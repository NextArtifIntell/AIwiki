  abstract     = {In automotive and industrial domains, the “health monitoring” or “condition monitoring” of electronic devices is gradually playing a key role in manufacturing processes and innovation roadmaps. The concept of health monitoring is often related to the so-called “residual lifetime” of the monitored system. In this work, the authors have designed a deep learning system for the health monitoring of power devices in Silicon Carbide (SiC) technology used in the Traction Inverter Systems of the latest generation electric cars. A Temporal Fusion Transformer embedding such layers of Temporal Convolutional Network with a Multi-Head Attention block for the robust lifetime assessment of SiC power devices, is proposed. Specifically, the designed system predicts such future samples of the ON-state voltage between drain and source of the low-side part of the SiC power module &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$Vds_{LS}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , in half-bridge configuration. Extensive literature confirmed that the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$Vds_{LS}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; signal can be efficiently used as a robust predictive device-degradation marker. Through the learning of the temporal feature relationships at different scales and the intelligent selection of relevant input features, the proposed solution will discard unnecessary input dynamics building a multi-step predictive model of the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$Vds_{LS}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; signal, significantly more performing than the existing state-of-the-art architectures. The proposed deep pipeline has been tested on several ACEPACK DRIVE SiC power modules delivered by STMicroelectronics, with an average error of about 0.2%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed system.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are utilized to improve the performance of wireless communication networks (WCNs). In 5G/6G WCNs, where massive muti-input multi-output (mMIMO) base stations (BSs) are operated for beamforming to address fast fading, shadowing, and blockage issues of millimeter waves (mmWave) and quasi-optic signals, the application of UAVs as active mMIMO transceivers is questionable. This is due to the prohibitive complexity of the required overhead baseband processor. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a complementary technology to mMIMO BSs to address the energy inefficiency and complexity of 5G/6G WCNs. Equipping UAVs with RISs, comprising passive elements, allows UAVs to remain promising gadgets for improving coverage and blockage issues in 5G/6G by reflecting in the sky and providing aerial line-of-sight (ALoS) service. Particularly, RIS-equipped UAVs (RISeUAVs) can be beneficial for ALoS vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication of autonomous intelligent vehicles. However, channel estimation is prohibitive in a highly dynamic environment. In this light, accurate localization makes it feasible to use geometry information for phase shift and passive beam-steering. Also, accurate localization is required for crash avoidance and safe navigation in dense urban canyons. We propose the simultaneous localization and phase shift (SLAPS) method as a mmWave-localization technique for RISeUAVs. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract     = {One of the most challenging problems in human-machine co-work is the gap between human intention and the machine&#39;s understanding and execution. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been showing superior abilities in solving such issue. In this article, we design a universal framework that embeds LLMs as a vehicle “Co-Pilot” of driving, which can accomplish specific driving tasks with human intention satisfied based on the information provided. Meanwhile, a utilization workflow is defined to handle the interaction between humans and vehicles, and memory mechanism is introduced to organize the information involved in the tasks. Expert Oriented Black-Box tuning is proposed to improve the performance of the Co-Pilot without finetuning or training the LLMs. In the experiment, the Co-Pilot is applied to two different tasks, i.e., path tracking control and trajectory planning. The Co-Pilot adjusts vehicle operating conditions by selecting a proper controller or planning a certain trajectory to fit human intentions. Simulation tests are conducted to evaluate the performance and generality of the proposed module. The results show that the Co-Pilot can accomplish most of the tasks based on only natural language processing, although it is not flawless. Finally, a discussion about human-machine hybrid intelligence and further applications of LLMs in autonomous driving is made. We believe that such a framework has promising potential in further applications in the field of automous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Safety is the primary concern in the motion planning and decision-making of the virtual driver that provides prescriptions to the real human driver and even performs self-driving in the absence of human take-over. For such an issue, traditional reinforcement learning methods, limited by their learning mechanisms, suffer from a slow convergence of model training as well as a less consideration for early warning of possible accidents. To address the above deficiency, this paper proposes a new method based on counterfactual evolutionary reasoning that can be used to build the virtual driver. The method treats safe driving as a sequential decision-making problem with sparse rewards, and employs counterfactual evolutionary reasoning to guide the searching direction as well as to accelerate the model training. An intervention mechanism from outlier distributions is further introduced to enhance the model&#39;s ability of exploration. Experiments in the virtual test environment indicate that the proposed method, compared with other typical reinforcement learning techniques, both achieves a higher safe arrival rate and a faster convergence speed.},

This research proposes an optimal control based CLC controller. It bears the following features: i) with the faster completion of a CLC maneuver by making space and changing lane at the same time; ii) with less speed oscillation perturbations on traffic. To make space and change lane at the same time, a formulation method in the relative spatial domain is proposed. In this method, the conventional longitudinal and lateral coupled nonlinear avoidance constraints are linearized into a relative longitudinal distance fixed lateral-only avoidance constraint. Evaluations indicate that the proposed method enhances the completion efficiency of CLC by 15.67%, reduce traffic emission by 0.24%, reduce fuel consumption by 0.36%, and improve traffic stability by 47.9%.},

However, it still faces significant challenges, including concerns over data breaches and privacy, inefficiencies and limited fault tolerance in centralized management, and the challenge of ensuring data accuracy. This letter marks the inaugural report from a series of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) Trustworthy IoV Workshops, which aim to address these issues. In these workshops, we explore the concept of a decentralized IoV (DeIoV), underpinned by decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs), to facilitate trustworthy interactions between vehicles and other entities. The proposed DeIoV is structured in two layers: the local DAO layer and the global DAO layer. This dual-layer architecture distinguishes between real-time and non-real-time decision-making tasks, aiding in their efficient completion. To ensure data security, integrity, and accuracy, we employ blockchain technology and smart contracts, which allow for mutual verification among adjacent members and utilize encryption algorithms. A reputation value-based voting mechanism for decision-making is also introduced, which helps prevent the monopolization of power through token-based systems, a common issue in traditional DAOs. Ultimately, we believe that DeIoV has the potential to create a trustworthy IoV ecosystem, contributing significantly to safe, secure, and collaborative autonomous driving.},

To address these challenges, we propose a TVG-ReID network, using a Transformer network to enhance features extracted from a CNN backbone network. A vehicle knowledge graph transfer method(Vehicle-Graph) is proposed, which treats each vehicle as a node in a graph, where simple information is transmitted through edges to constrain the distance of the nodes in a metric learning manner.

  abstract     = {Self evolution refers to the ability of a system to evolve autonomously towards a better performance, which is a potential trend for autonomous driving systems based on self-learning approaches. However, current algorithms for autonomous driving still lack of self-evolving mechanisms and the capability of maintaining continuously performance-enhancing. Some recent studies turn to the data closed-loop (DCL) architecture to realize self evolution. Therefore, this study analyzes some relevant technologies and then proposes a novel design mechanism to guarantee the self-evolving performance for autonomous driving systems. Although existing data closed-loop platforms are not yet mature enough to fully achieve this purpose, it has the potential to incorporate cutting-edge technologies that will enhance their functionality. Moreover, we give some suggestions for its future directions for self-evolving autonomous driving, including some more cutting-edge technologies that can be incorporated into the DCL architecture.},

  abstract     = {The handling of emergencies like severe wind and foreign matter collision in high-speed railways is a typical human-in-the-loop complex task. Conventional approaches find it challenging to satisfy the real-time, efficiency, and safety standards for reorganizing train schedules during such critical situations. This paper introduces a parallel railway traffic management (RTM) system to address the rescheduling of high-speed trains during such emergencies. The design and implementation of the parallel system are detailed using the ACP (Artificial systems, Computational experiments, and Parallel execution) methodology. An agent-based modeling approach is employed to construct the artificial RTM system. The computational experiments are designed and executed to forecast the system&#39;s status and assess the rescheduling strategies and algorithms utilizing computer-based simulation technology within the artificial RTM system. Through enabling real-time interaction and closed-loop feedback between the physical RTM system and the actual RTM system, the rescheduling strategies can be continuously assessed and iteratively optimized in real-time. Finally, a case study is conducted in two typical scenarios, involving temporary speed limit and complete blockage, to evaluate the performance of the proposed method through computational experiments. Timetable rescheduling during emergencies is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with various constraints. The hybrid strategy, First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) strategy, and First-Scheduled-First-Served (FSFS) strategy are applied to address the train rescheduling problem. The results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses traditional approaches in managing train rescheduling during disruptions. It enhances the efficiency of emergency response and furnishes decision support for dispatchers.},

Secondly, a longitudinal game strategy for HVs is established with consideration of the driver&#39;s longitudinal handling characteristics and personalized aggressiveness, with which the driving behaviors of HVs can be accurately predicted. Thirdly, the longitudinal game strategies for AVs at different positions are designed, with consideration of the safety constraints of AVs and surrounding vehicles, as well as the objectives of comfort and traffic efficiency. Then, the interactive games of ego AV, HVs, and other AVs in different types of mixed-driving environments are solved based on the Stackelberg game and partial cooperative game methods. Finally, the optimal lane-changing (LC) gaps and longitudinal speed trajectories of AVs are obtained.

The nonlinear vehicle steering tracking system is described by a T-S fuzzy model with a polytope modeling method. A switching event-triggered communication mechanism is presented, where two triggering conditions are activated based on state convergence and divergence, respectively. Inspired by fully actuated system approach, an asynchronous fuzzy controller with open-loop system dynamics is constructed in consideration of the event-triggered mechanism and bounded communication delays. The closed-loop system is modeled by a parameterized nonlinear system with input delay under switching event-triggered inequalities. A nonlinear design result of the fuzzy controller is derived by a switching discontinuous Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, which removes the assumption in existing results that the bounds of asynchronous constraint on membership functions are available. Through comprehensive comparative analysis, it is numerically shown that the proposed result can achieve less conservatism, better control effect, and larger average release intervals.},

  abstract     = {Bird&#39;s-eye-view (BEV) perception has gained popularity since it provides a 3D world representation with scale consistency. Although existing camera-based solutions achieve excellent performance, the BEV positions related to features are still less accurate. In this article, a BEV semantic segmentation framework with two-stream compact depth transformation and feature rectification is proposed. To balance the conflict that the feature maps ensemble tends to use two temporal frames with long interval, while shorter temporal frames are more beneficial to depth prediction, a two-stream compact depth transformation is designed. Between original temporal frames, we introduce an intermediate frame to decouple the joint depth estimation of original frames. The local representations of the intermediate frame are respectively matched with each original temporal frame to achieve stereo depth predictions, where compact cost volumes are built to significantly reduce memory usage with high discriminability in depth-dimension. Further, virtual camera intrinsic parameters are derived to realize adaption of compact cost volume to various 2D data augmentation and improve generalization. On this basis, BEV feature maps are obtained via feature transformation. With the influence of depth distribution errors to BEV feature map, a feature rectified segmentation network is proposed to dynamically adjust the position offsets of input features via deformable convolution and semantic information-guided feature learning. As a result, a dense and accurate BEV semantic map is obtained. In addition, a self-supervised depth estimation teacher is adopted to provide extra supervision for depth prediction of our segmentation framework. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on public datasets.},

While RIS technology holds significant potential for improving connectivity in IoV and vehicle settings, its fixed configuration falls short in meeting the dynamic demands in IoV. To address the diverse requirements of IoV services, including stringent safety norms, societal acceptance, and cost efficiency, this article proposes a parallel surfaces system to facilitate service-oriented V2X communications for autonomous vehicles. By harnessing artificial models of the physical RIS-assisted IoV system, conducting extensive computational experiments, and parallel execution, the proposed system enables real-time monitoring, predictive analysis, and optimization. Parallel intelligence empowers efficient and adaptable channel estimation, configuration, and energy management, thereby establishing a more intelligent and secure RIS-assisted IoV infrastructure.

For the predefined-time second-order practical consensus, the global information of the system is not required to calculate the estimate of the convergence time, including the initial states and communication topology. In addition, the singular problem and the communication loop problem are also avoided. Moreover, an event-based control strategy is developed to obtain the predefined-time second-order practical consensus, which can effectively reduce the operating frequency and wear of actuator under the predefined-time convergence. Furthermore, the control input and the measurement error are designed by utilizing the hyperbolic tangent function, then the non-differential problem and Zeno behavior can be excluded.

  abstract     = {Birds-Eye-View (BEV) perception can naturally represent natural scenes, which is conducive to multimodal data processing and fusion. BEV data contain rich semantics and integrate the information of driving scenes, which play an important role in researches related to autonomous driving. However, BEV constructed by single vehicle perception encounter certain issues, such as low accuracy and insufficient range, and thus cannot be well applied to scenario understanding and driving situation prediction. To address the challenges, this article proposes a novel data-driven approach based on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. The roadside unit or cloud center collects local BEV data from all connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) within the control area, then fuses and predicts the future global BEV occupancy grid map. It provides powerful support for driving safety warning, cooperative driving planning, cooperative traffic control and other applications. More precisely, we develop an attention-based cooperative BEV fusion and prediction model called BEV-V2X. We also compare the performance of BEV-V2X with that of single vehicle prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves higher accuracy. Even in cases where not all vehicles are CAVs, the model can still comprehensively estimate and predict global spatiotemporal changes. We also discuss the impact of the CAV rate, single vehicle perception ability, and grid size on the fusion and prediction results.},

In particular, CAVs provide new opportunities for cyberattackers, posing a significant threat to future road and vehicle data security. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity environment of CAVs. First, we propose a systematic classification of six security threats from cybersecurity principles: false data, information theft, privilege escalation, block communication, and time delay. We review the cybersecurity environment of CAVs from a lifecycle perspective, covering aspects from development to accident, and present the existing cybersecurity countermeasures. These involve security standards designation, verification and validation of vehicle networks, resilient strategies for self-defined driving, and attack detection and digital forensics. Finally, based on our systematic review, we propose a conceptual vehicle security operations center (VSOC) framework that provides valuable inspiration and references for future research and industrial applications for CAVs cybersecurity.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of intelligent vehicles brings unique opportunities for the service industry. This study introduces the concept of autonomous services, a new service paradigm, and autonomous services systems, in which intelligent vehicles are vital enabling technology. Specifically, autonomous services aim to minimize unnecessary human participation and effort in the service process by leveraging intelligence for service delivery, rather than relying on simple stimulus-response or rule-based program behavior. This letter reports on the first Decentralized and Hybrid Workshop (DHW) on autonomous services, aiming to reduce the cost of human labor and improve the quality and efficiency of service while tackling the challenges posed by a shrinking workforce. The introduction of intelligent vehicles enhances the capability of the service systems, while also significantly increasing complexity. To address the challenges associated with complexity, the Systems Engineering (SE) approach is indispensable. The Requirements-Functional-Logical-Physical (RFLP) framework can implement Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and help researchers and managers to understand the autonomous services system more comprehensively, so as to better operate and manage it. We substitute “Implementation” for “Physical” in this research to define and elaborate on the autonomous services system. Finally, we outline the potential research opportunities within the autonomous services system.},

To reduce data fluctuation and tackle channel uncertainty, the Lyapunov optimization theory is integrated into the long-term dynamic resource allocation framework, which addresses multiple performance indicators including queue backlog, communication delay, and user utility. In particular, the hierarchical competitive relationship between vehicle users and roadside users is captured, and the Stackelberg game structure is adopted to maximize the utilities of all users. Furthermore, the lower-game subproblem is transformed by the Lyapunov optimization method and is solved by the Lagrangian function method. As the best response function, the lower-game solution is used to formulate the upper-game strategy. Since the existing of game equilibrium (GE) solution, a Stackelberg game-enabled robust resource allocation algorithm can be proposed. Finally, various numerical simulations are performed to show that the proposed algorithm has better robustness and higher throughout than the benchmarks.},

As of today, only a handful of studies has experimentally analyzed the awareness messages generated by cars, and no existing work has concentrated on VRU awareness messages. The intent of this work is to fill the gap of missing experimental activities by analyzing the results of an extensive measurement campaign, aimed at investigating the awareness messages generated by cars and VRUs in a real-world context. Field tests have been performed employing an LTE-V2X prototype with connected VRUs in the urban scenario, while cars have been considered in urban, suburban, and highway environments. In all cases, the paper details the conditions that trigger the generation of awareness messages, presents the Probability Mass Function (PMF) of the time interval between consecutive messages, and relates it to the triggering conditions. As the findings indicate that many awareness messages from VRUs were generated under non-relevant circumstances, the paper also proposes an adjustment to the standard and evaluates its effectiveness in the field, showing a notable improvement with respect to the original setting. Finally, this study evaluates the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) experienced by vehicle-to-vehicle communications in the above scenarios and, for the first time, determines the PDR attained by bicycle-to-vehicle communications in the urban setting.},

  abstract     = {Driver errors, such as distraction, perceptual blindness, and incorrect control manipulation, can either cause road accidents or reduce driving performance in daily driving tasks. Several works in literature have illustrated perceptual blindness and distraction are associated with insufficient attention to those activities vital for safe driving. Also, inappropriate driving-related eye movements may subsequently result in manipulation errors, such as inappropriate control of the throttle or steering wheel. Although many studies have examined drivers&#39; visual performance, there have been few attempts to compare left-hand traffic (LHT) and right-hand traffic (RHT) conditions. Even driving in the same driving scene, different eye movement patterns may also be induced due to drivers&#39; left gaze bias. Motivated by this human factor, this research investigates potential human errors in driving from the perspective of eye movements (i.e., saccades and fixations) and corresponding control manipulations. Firstly, a driving simulator is used to investigate the discrepancy of eye movements in identical driving scenes between LHT and RHT. Secondly, visual regions and feature sensitivities are spatially correlated by comparing the gaze distribution from the central to peripheral visual fields for both LHT and RHT. Besides, considering the violation of traffic rules are likely the cause of potentially fatal driving eye movement and control mistakes, a recommendation strategy is proposed to alleviate visual errors by utilizing a neural network inspired by the driver gaze map. The experiments in both LHT and RHT driving tasks demonstrate improvements in the alleviation of human errors by importing the proposed eye movement recommendation strategy.},

  abstract     = {Loop Closure Detection is of great significance in the field of intelligent driving systems, as it reduces the cumulative error of the estimated position of the system and assists in generating a consistent global map. Existing methods differ in frame representation methods and the corresponding frame-matching strategy. Traditionally, local feature points and descriptors are studied extensively while recently global descriptors and semantic information extracted from deep learning methods are considered superior in terms of promoting a high-level understanding of the surrounding environments of robots. However, one of the most challenging problems of using semantic information for loop detection is how to deal with inconsistent visual contents from different viewpoints in the same place. In this article, a semantic loop closure detection method using panoramas is proposed to address this issue. We design a pipeline for efficiently extracting and matching semantic information between frames to identify loops. Most importantly we propose a novel polar coordinate-based panorama representation to address the inconsistent visual appearance problem caused by viewpoint differences. Experiment results show that our proposed method can significantly increase the accuracy of loop closure detection tasks in challenging scenarios where traditional methods may fail.},

  abstract     = {The dangers of adversarial attacks on Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) agents operating in public are increasing. Adopting AI-based techniques and, more specifically, Deep Learning (DL) approaches to control and guide these UAVs can be beneficial in terms of performance but can add concerns regarding the safety of those techniques and their vulnerability against adversarial attacks. Confusion in the agent&#39;s decision-making process caused by these attacks can seriously affect the safety of the UAV. This article proposes an innovative approach based on the explainability of DL methods to build an efficient detector that will protect these DL schemes and the UAVs adopting them from attacks. The agent adopts a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) scheme for guidance and planning. The agent is trained with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) DRL scheme that utilises Artificial Potential Field (APF) to improve training times and obstacle avoidance performance. A simulated environment for UAV explainable DRL-based planning and guidance, including obstacles and adversarial attacks, is built. The adversarial attacks are generated by the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) algorithm and reduced obstacle course completion rates from 97% to 35%. Two adversarial attack detectors are proposed to counter this reduction. The first one is a Convolutional Neural Network Adversarial Detector (CNN-AD), which achieves accuracy in the detection of 80%. The second detector utilises a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. It reaches an accuracy of 91% with faster computing times compared to the CNN-AD, allowing for real-time adversarial detection.},

The validation of LKAS&#39;s safety and performance requires extensive testing using diverse and representative test scenarios. However, identifying the most critical test scenarios from a large data is a significant challenge. Inspired by Scenarios Engineering, the present study introduces a novel approach that includes being the first to combine analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and hierarchical clustering (HC) to identify critical test scenarios for the comprehensive evaluation of LKAS. The proposed approach first utilizes the AHP to rank the key factors that contribute to the failure of the LKAS. Then, by taking the key factors as clustering parameters, the HC method is employed to cluster LKAS failure scenarios with similar characteristics. The experimental results suggest that our method is capable of effectively clustering 200 LKAS failure scenarios into 9 categories of critical, reasonable, and reliable LKAS test scenarios. Furthermore, these 9 categories of critical test scenarios can provide guidance for the development and testing of autonomous driving and serve as a foundation for establishing a testing and evaluation system for LKAS in China and around the world.},

  abstract     = {In the context of shared connected autonomous vehicles (SCAVs), the relocation of idle vehicles is a crucial issue for the operation of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) services. Unlike traditional human-chauffeured taxis, AMoD operations are fully controllable by central systems and not affected by unpredictable human driver behavior. To address the spatial-temporal imbalance between supply and demand and optimize the level of service while minimizing agency costs, we propose a real-time AMoD relocation model. However, vehicle-specific control every second for large fleet sizes may cause computational burdens for the control center. To overcome this, we present a bi-level framework that decomposes the original system-level problem into an inter-zonal relocation problem for the entire service area and an intra-zonal relocation problem for each zone. This reduces the decision space to periodic inter- and intra-zonal relocation of idle vehicles. Using real-world taxi operation data from Daejeon City, Korea, we demonstrate the proposed method via agent-based simulations, assuming that SCAVs replace existing taxis. The results show that the method can significantly reduce the total generalized cost for both users and the agency. Through a sensitivity analysis, we investigate how the performance varies depending on the zone size, inter- and intra-zonal relocation interval, and demand uncertainty and discuss the observed tradeoff. The intended contribution is twofold: first, we propose a novel computationally feasible method that can efficiently operate AMoD systems in real time; second, we provide a closed-form analytical formulation that can help decision-makers explicitly understand the relationship between the cost components and the decision factors.},

The key to reliable environmental perception is large amounts of data that are hard to collect. Several simulators provide realistic, raw sensor data based on physical sensor models. However, besides their high price, they also require very high computation capacity. Furthermore, most sensor suppliers provide high-level data, such as object detections, that is complicated to reproduce from simulated raw sensor data. This paper proposes a method that directly simulates the detections or object tracks provided by smart sensors. The model involves several uncertainties of the sensors, such as missed-, false detections, and measurement noise. In contrast to the conventional sensor models, this method tackles with state-dependent clutter model and considers the field of view in the detections model. The parameters of the proposed model are identified for an automotive smart radar and camera based on pre-evaluated real-world measurements. The resulting model provides synthetic object-level data with higher fidelity than the conventional probabilistic models, differing less than 2% from the precision and recall metrics of the actual sensors.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles has garnered significant attention in structured environments, but corresponding methodologies for unstructured environments remains relatively underexplored. The unloading area, an integral component of open-pit mines, exemplifies a quintessential unstructured environment. Implementing cooperative planning for autonomous mining trucks (AMTs) within these unloading areas is crucial as the optimization of processes in these areas substantially enhances the overarching safety, productivity, and cost-effectiveness of mining operations. Hence, enhancing the operational efficiency of AMTs in the unloading area can considerably elevate productivity levels of open-pit mines. This article focuses on the real-time cooperative trajectory planning problem for AMTs in such areas, which is challenging due to i) small and irregular space ii) complex operations iii) need for path stability and speed flexibility. We propose a decoupled multi-vehicle trajectory planning (MVTP) method that decomposes trajectory planning into path planning and speed planning. Specifically, we present driving behavior enhanced path planning and sequential real-time cooperative speed planning methods. Our method is compared with several state-of-the-art MVTP methods and proves to be both secure and efficient.},

  abstract     = {Localization is critical for automated vehicles as it provides essential position, velocity, and heading angle information to perform object tracking, trajectory prediction, motion planning, and control. However, model/environmental uncertainties (including road friction) and noises in sensor measurements have a significant effect on the accuracy of the localization and vehicle state estimation, specially for perceptually degraded conditions. In this article, an integrated localization method based on the fusion of an inertial dead reckoning model and 3D LiDAR-based map matching is proposed and experimentally verified in an urban environment with varying environmental conditions. Leveraging a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), inertial navigation system (INS), and 3D LiDAR point clouds, a novel light point cloud map generation method, which only keeps the necessary point clouds (i.e., buildings and roads regardless of vegetation varying with seasonal change), is proposed. Subsequently, based on the onboard sensors and the pre-built light point cloud map, a dead reckoning model is derived and integrated with the normal distribution transformation (NDT) based map matching algorithm by an error-state-constrained Kalman filter to limit the localization error. On top of the Kalman filter, the stability analysis of the estimator is presented. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is validated in real road experiments under various environmental conditions. Thorough experiments in winter and summer and associated results confirm the advantages of integrating the proposed light point cloud map generation with the dead reckoning model in terms of accuracy and reduced computational complexity.},

Furthermore, there is often a dynamic gap between evaluating and validating methods on fixed datasets and real driving scenarios. This letter forms part of a series of reports emanating from the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles&#39;s Decentralized and Hybrid Workshops (DHW) dedicated to the field of Scenarios Engineering. Our research proposes a scenario engineering-based calibration and validation framework for trajectory prediction of autonomous vehicles to more effectively validate the performance of the method in challenging scenarios. First, Scenarios Engineering (SE) uses OpenSCENARIO and real dataset to generate high-definition maps for challenging driving scenarios. Then, the vectorization approach is employed to extract contextual details from the scene and agent trajectory information from the HD map, and the graph neural network is used to model the high-order interaction to realize the interactive trajectory prediction. Compared with the traditional method, the trajectory prediction can be calibrated through SE so that the prediction process can use more traffic information and attribute characteristics, and improve the evaluation index of prediction. The DHW discusses a practical case to verify the potential of the trajectory prediction framework based on scenarios generation in improving the authenticity and accuracy of trajectory prediction.},

This paper presents a novel integrated robust preview control (PC) algorithm to further improve the ride comfort by effectively handling actuator delay. An augmented ASS model is first established to consider actuator delay. Then, to obtain the time-domain feedforward disturbance, updating the local spatial road dataset from sensing systems by low-pass filtering and introducing speed for conversion. A predictive control framework that utilizes preview road disturbances is developed to achieve better ride comfort. And assuming parameterized disturbances, it is transformed into a consistent quadratic programming (QP) problem for real-time application in ASS. Furthermore, an innovative design of combined observer provides accurate and robust observations under multiple uncertainties, with which the algorithm can effectively compensate for actuator delay under different road conditions. Finally, the bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability of the algorithm is well demonstrated. Simulation and bench test results indicate that the proposed algorithm can not only significantly improve road holding and ride comfort, but also realize a robust observation of the augmented ASS state. In addition, the solving time of the bench test satisfies the real-time requirements of the algorithm.},

However, with the development of high-speed railways (HSRs), the construction of new lines and the upgrading of existing equipment have become increasingly prevalent, posing significant challenges to the safety and reliability of the CTC system. To address these challenges, this article proposes a scenario-driven parallel testing method for the CTC system. We use divisible and combinable scenarios to describe the functionality and processes of testing. Building upon the scenario representation, a virtual-real interactive testing method is adopted, where virtual testing is employed to generate a large number of scenarios simultaneously, thereby accelerating the testing process of the CTC system while ensuring comprehensive testing coverage. Field testing is carried out to validate the reliability of the CTC system in real operational environments, particularly in critical scenarios. The CTC parallel testing system has been deployed in multiple railway bureaus in China, and the deployment results demonstrate that parallel testing can improve testing efficiency, alleviate tester workload, augment the proficiency of on-site construction, and boost the stability and reliability of CTC systems.},

  abstract     = {Collision risk assessment aims to provide a subjective cognitive comprehension of the risk level in driving scenarios, which is critical for the safety of autonomous driving systems. Pedestrian crossing scenarios contain intricate human-vehicle interactions. Hence, it is important to capture the rich relations between traffic entities and to assess the collision risk promptly to ensure safety. Existing studies focus on modeling the spatial relationships between the ego-vehicle and other vehicles in typical traffic scenarios, while ignoring the complex interactions between pedestrians and the ego-vehicle in critical driving scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that involves constructing traffic scene graphs with enhanced vehicle-pedestrian interactions, along with introducing an innovative deep model built upon Transformer and GCN for pedestrian collision risk assessment. Specifically, to facilitate spatio-temporal modeling of traffic scene graph sequence, we propose a novel unified framework that integrates Multi-Relation Graph Convolution Network (MR-GCN) and Temporal Transformer Encoder. In addition, two variants of traffic scene graph datasets termed as Interaction-Enhanced Scene Graph (IESG) and None-Interaction-Enhanced Scene Graph (Non-IESG) are created for the purpose of assessing pedestrian collision risk, utilizing the CAP-DATA and JAAD respectively. Experiments are conducted on our newly created traffic scene graph datasets of pedestrian crossing scenes. The results on the IESG dataset show that our model outperforms the baseline model with higher accuracy (94% vs. 84%), higher AUC (98% vs. 89%), and higher F1-score (93% vs. 84%).

Extreme cold or hot environments can further impact the EV&#39;s range as a significant amount of energy is needed for cabin and battery temperature regulation while the battery&#39;s power and energy capacity are also impeded. To overcome this issue, we present an optimal control strategy based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for integrated thermal management (ITM) of the battery and cabin of EVs, where the proposed NMPC simultaneously optimizes the EV range and cabin comfort in real time. Firstly, the components of the designed ITM system are introduced and control-oriented modeling is done. Secondly, to demonstrate and validate the benefits of the proposed ITM, an optimal control problem is defined and dynamic programming (DP) is employed to find the global optimal solution. Thirdly, for practical implementation, NMPC-based control strategy is developed, where the cost function design and weights calibration are done in comparison with DP global optimal solution. Weight-tuning results show that our NMPC-based approach can achieve close driving range maximization as compared to the DP benchmark while ensuring cabin comfort. The developed NMPC-based ITM strategy is further illustrated by comparing its performance to two additional benchmark strategies, i.e., rule-based control and cabin heating only. Finally, our simulation results also identify several important factors that impact the benefits of the proposed NMPC-based ITM, which are used to summarize the operating conditions under which the proposed ITM is critically needed.},

This article proposes a Transformer-based unified framework, VistaGPT, to address these challenges. VistaGPT, composed of Modular Federations of Vehicular Transformers (M-FoV) and Automated Composing of Autonomous Driving Systems (AutoAuto), aims to overcome the information barriers due to system-level and module-level heterogeneity. M-FoV collects and organizes Transformer-based models in a modular fashion to facilitate system integration by providing diversity and versatility. AutoAuto utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automatically compose end-to-end autonomous driving systems with a “Dividing and Recombining” strategy. Besides, we deploy Scenario Engineering systems to evaluate the composed systems and provide systematic feedback for the optimization of AutoAuto, and Federated intelligence to contribute to diverse training samples and applications. With its capacity, scalability, and diversity, VistaGPT provides a new paradigm of LLM-aided system development for transport automation, which promotes virtual-real interactive parallel driving and advances progress toward “6S” objectives.},

In contrast to existing works, our approach efficiently and exhaustively verifies all driving corridors of an automated vehicle, leveraging mature model checking techniques.

  abstract     = {Path planning is an essential function in an intelligent vehicle, especially when driving in scenarios cluttered by large-scale static obstacles. Traditional path planners often struggle to find a balance among speed, accuracy, and optimality in their solutions. In this article, we introduce an Adaptive Pure Pursuit (APP) planner, which is designed to be fast and near-optimal for autonomous driving in cluttered environments. The APP planner generates feasible paths through a simulated closed-loop tracking control process of a virtual vehicle. If a derived path encounters obstacles, an adaptive refinement step is taken to locally reduce these collisions. Unlike search-based planners that suffer from the “curse of dimensionality” and optimization-based methods that often run slowly, the APP planner operates extremely fast. The high speed stems from the fact that both the virtual controller simulation and the refinement step involve computations with zero degrees of freedom. The proposed APP planner outperforms the prevalent optimization-based and search-based path planners, as shown by comparative simulations.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of autonomous driving technology, intelligent vehicles represented by autonomous taxis have begun to participate in the transportation system. Improving the sustainability of intelligent vehicles can increase the useful life of vehicles and reduce the overall increase of vehicles in society. This reduction reduces emissions and energy consumption, thereby increasing environmental sustainability. However, most of the current intelligent vehicles are modified from existing vehicles. The initial design of these vehicle does not consider the requirements for autonomous driving, which can easily lead to a mismatch between the control algorithm and the mechanical structure. Moreover, current intelligent vehicles mainly focus on the development of autonomous driving algorithms and ignore sustainable design, which will lead to increased energy consumption and reduced lifespan. This letter proposes a multi-dimensional circular design (MDCD) framework to improve the sustainability of intelligent vehicles from sustainable lifecycle management perspective. The MDCD framework consists of six parts, which are intelligent design, sensing, control, supervision, diagnosis and recycle.

The stabilizability of a string of connected vehicles including multiple autonomous vehicles (AVs) and heterogeneous human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is studied by a model reduction technique and the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) test. For this problem setup, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem is formulated and a solution based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) techniques is proposed without a priori knowledge on model parameters. To start the learning process, an initial stabilizing control law is obtained using the small-gain theorem for the ring road case.

Hence, adaptive path-tracking control with a passivity-based observer is designed by the port-Hamiltonian model for autonomous vehicles in this article. Firstly, a passivity-based observer of lateral velocity is established by designing a gain matrix to assign the interconnection and damping parts, which makes an observation error system transform into a desired port-Hamiltonian system and renders the observer passive. At the same time, it&#39;s convergence and stability analysis is given. Then, a port-Hamiltonian model with perturbations and actuator saturations is constructed to describe lateral vehicle dynamics in terms of tracking errors for path-tracking, and an L2-gain disturbance attenuation strategy is developed to overcome the adverse influence caused of external disturbances. Furthermore, the robust stability of the controller is proved in the presence of observation errors and external disturbances. Finally, simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

However, existing security and privacy preservation solutions for MEC applications in VANETs face several challenges, such as the risk of privacy exposure of vehicle authentication, increased overhead due to cryptographic algorithms, as well as resource occupation and malicious attacks on edge servers. In this paper, we propose an aggregated security solution for the confidential, efficient, and trustworthy sharing of data while safeguarding the privacy of vehicle identities. Firstly, we present a broadcast proxy re-encryption scheme based on cubic spline interpolation that ensures the security of the VANET system and the identity privacy of large-scale vehicles. The re-encryption system is designed to prioritize the reduction of re-encryption computation time rather than focusing on the sizes of re-encryption keys and ciphertexts. We further model the aggregation overhead in terms of communication and computation. Additionally, we propose an efficient protocol based on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus to facilitate decentralized trust management for edge proxy servers. Our security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme satisfies the security and confidentiality requirements for data sharing in VANETs. Finally, we provide extensive simulations that reveal the performance and effectiveness of our solution.},

Although the core functionality of stock ACC systems, including their proprietary control logic and parameters, is not publicly available, this work considers a car-following scenario with a human-driven vehicle (leader) and an ACC engaged ego vehicle (follower) that employs a constant time-headway policy (CTHP). The objective of the DUKF is to determine the CTHP parameters of the ACC by using real-time observations of space-gap and relative velocity from the vehicle&#39;s onboard sensors. Real-time parameter identification of stock ACC systems is essential for assessing their string stability, large-scale deployment on motorways, and impact on traffic flow and throughput.

Despite its effectiveness in overcoming various challenges, cooperative perception&#39;s performance can still be affected by the aforementioned issues when Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) operate at the edges of their sensing range. Our proposed approach called HYDRO-3D aims to improve object detection performance by explicitly incorporating historical object tracking information. Specifically, HYDRO-3D combines object detection features from a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm (V2X-ViT) with historical information from the object tracking algorithm to infer objects. Afterward, a novel spatial-temporal 3D neural network performing global and local manipulations of object-tracking historical data is applied to generate the feature map to enhance object detection. The proposed HYDRO-3D method is comprehensively evaluated on the state-of-the-art V2XSet. The qualitative and quantitative experiment results demonstrate that the HYDRO-3D can effectively utilize the object tracking information and achieve robust object detection performance. It outperforms the SOTA V2X-ViT by 3.7% in AP@0.7 of object detection for CAVs and can also be generalized to single-vehicle object detection with 4.5% improvement in AP@0.7.},

It employs a continuous, differentiable rotation representation that simplifies the overall architecture compared to existing methods. Our method is validated on DD-Pose , a challenging real-world in-vehicle driver observation dataset that offers a broad spectrum of poses and occlusion states from naturalistic driving scenarios.

  abstract     = {LiDAR is an indispensable sensor for autonomous driving that can provide precise 3D information about the environment. Among various types of LiDARs, mechanical LiDARs are the most commonly used on vehicles that uniformly perceive the scene utilizing rotating motors. However, accurate perception of foreground objects is considered as the most important task in automotive LiDARs, therefore the current operating mode of mechanical LiDARs wastes a significant amount of sensing resources on the useless background. Besides, the development of LiDAR hardware and software systems is currently split into two independent segments, lacking real-time interaction between physical entities and digital models in cyberspace. To address these issues, we propose software-defined active LiDARs for autonomous driving based on parallel intelligence. Active LiDARs redefine LiDAR&#39;s hardware operation through software systems to achieve adaptive sensing resource allocation, constituting a closed loop between physical space and cyberspace. During the working process, it calculates scenario heatmaps with the constructed high-definition maps (HD maps) in cyberspace at first. Then it takes prescriptive control of physical LiDARs based on heatmaps to improve sensing resource utilization. We build two adaptive LiDAR models in CARLA and construct a hardware prototype in the parallel sensing platform, DAWN. Active Point Cloud (APC), a new dataset collected in CARLA, is proposed and a 3D object detection task is selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of active LiDARs. Our experimental results show that active LiDARs can both improve raw data quality and model performance compared with mechanical LiDARs, especially for the perception of distant objects.},

In this article, we present a Reconfigurable Holographic Surface (RHS)-aided SLAM system, incorporating federated learning. The hardware cost of autonomous driving systems can be significantly reduced by replacing the expensive phased array antennas, traditionally used in mmWave radars, with the low-cost RHS metasurface antenna. Furthermore, multiple vehicles can collaborate through the federated learning framework, obtaining additional sensed data to enhance SLAM performance. However, the distinctive radiation structure of the RHS and the information exchange within the federated learning framework introduce complexities to the overall SLAM system design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-vehicle SLAM protocol that regulates RHS-based radar sensing and data processing across multiple vehicles. Additionally, we design algorithms for RHS radiation optimization and federated learning-based localization and mapping. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach when compared to existing phased array-based and non-cooperative schemes.},

Existing autonomous races face challenges, including compromised fairness and low participant enthusiasm. These issues limit spectator engagement, thereby reducing the races’ educational value. To prevent similar flaws in organizing TAO, our focus lies in setting governance rules from an organizer&#39;s perspective. In these DHWs, we analyzed the rules of existing autonomous races and suggested rule-making guidelines for TAO. To improve fairness, we recommend a balanced scoring system with rigorous monitoring of participating teams’ performances. To discourage consistent victories by a single team, we suggest that leading teams share their source codes, thereby setting the championship-level performance as the baseline in the next season and accelerating the evolution of all participating teams’ abilities. For enhancing suspense and spectator interest, an on-site adaptive rewarding scheme should be deployed to create thrilling turnarounds. Our strategies aim to maintain fairness, increase spectator interest, inspire competitiveness, and ultimately contribute to the advancement of IV4E in organizing TAO.},

We focus on the lane change prediction of vehicles on a highway. In order to understand wrong decisions, which may lead to accidents, we want to interpret the reasons for a ML algorithm&#39;s decision making. To this end, we use motif discovery—a data mining method—to obtain sub-sequences representing typical driving behavior. With the help of these meaningful sub-sequences (motifs), we can study typical driving maneuvers on a highway. On top of this, we propose to replace non-interpretable ML algorithms with an interpretable alternative: a Mixture of Experts (MoE) classifier. We present an MoE classifier consisting of different &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -Nearest Neighbors ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -NN) classifiers trained only on motifs, which represent a few samples from the dataset.

This feedback leads to an enhanced grid representation by the inclusion of two new steps that allow semantic classification of the occupied space and the improvement of the dynamic estimation. To this end, objects extracted from the grid are analyzed with respect to potential object classes and displacement. Class likelihoods are filtered over time at cell-level using particles and a naive Bayesian classifier. The displacement information is computed taking into account semantic information and comparing objects in consecutive frames. Then, it is used to obtain velocity measurements that are used to enhance grid&#39;s dynamic estimation.

  abstract     = {The development of intelligent driving and X-by-wire chassis technology increases the computational complexity and the number of CAN bus-mounted nodes of steering-by-wire vehicles, which leads to non-negligible large random time delay (TD) of the SbW system&#39;s control input. TD has a great impact on SbW system&#39;s tracking error, which will inevitably deteriorate the safety and yaw stability of vehicles and even cause sideslip accidents. In order to ensure the safety of SbW vehicles, a layered time-delay robust control strategy (LTDRCS) consisting an upper and a lower controller is proposed. Specifically, a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) TD H∞ controller (H ∞ C) is designed as the lower controller to reduce tracking error, and the system&#39;s stability and convergence are synchronously guaranteed by an L-K function and an H∞ norm constraint. As for the upper controller, a novel terminal sliding mode controller (NTSMC) is established to control the yaw rate index and sideslip angle index. In order to restrain the serious influence of the SbW system&#39;s inevitable, unknown, and bounded tracking error caused by TD on vehicle yaw stability and ensure the rapid convergence of the system, a novel integral term is introduced. Simulation and experiments show that the proposed strategy efficiently improves the tracking accuracy of the SbW system and the vehicle yaw stability under random TD condition, which benefits from the synergy of the upper and lower layers.},

  abstract     = {Aviation emergency rescue has become one of the most effective means for natural disaster relief due to its flexible and timely characteristics. A reasonable emergency dispatch plan can guarantee the effective implementation of all the rescue measures. Most of previous studies in this area focused on the scheduling and routing but ignored the impact of the specific rescue process, for example the fuel consumption of various helicopters. In this paper, a multi-helicopter-multi-trip Aviation Rescue Routing Problem (ARRP) is analysed which covers the whole rescue process. In addition, a time-domain procedural simulation model is built which can consider different helicopters, refueling or not, various resource locations, multiple disaster sites and other operation factors. Based on that, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) hybridized Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm (GA-LNS) is proposed for optimization. In ARRP, single search algorithm may lead to the local optimum due to complexity. In contrast, the distance greedy strategy and the load ratio strategy are combined in GA-LNS which can fix the local optimum problem. More specifically, based on the helicopter-tagged-task-sequenced chromosome, the single-point crossover operator is used in GA and then, the worst removal strategy and the first/last insertion strategy are adopted in LNS. Finally, the numerical experiments are exercised to verify the effectiveness of the proposed GA-LNS algorithm which is compared with three traditional basic heuristic algorithms and a stateof-the-art memetic algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Automated vehicles require an efficient fail-safe system for unexpected failures in normal operation. Although existing methods aiming at L4 driving automation leverage conservative motion planning to independently guide fail-safe behaviors when a normal planning function fails, they usually ignore human intervention demands. In fact, manual takeover is still a reliable choice of fail-safe maneuver today. Moreover, human drivers tend to handle critical situations, rather than trust the automated system with the vehicle control. Here, we propose a fail-safe architecture for vehicle behavior and motion planning module incorporating shared control in response to the driver intervention. The proposed method not only estimates driver intention to cooperate with the driver on maneuver selection, but also distributes the driving authority in accordance with the types of achievable minimal risk condition. By using the receding horizon planner with composition planning horizons, the driver is able to obtain an appropriate takeover condition on the basis of safety guarantee. Test in the library of critical scenarios shows that the proposed method is effective in terms of safety and assistance to the driver.},

  abstract     = {Reliable detection and tracking of surrounding objects are indispensable for comprehensive motion prediction and planning of autonomous vehicles. Due to the limitations of individual sensors, the fusion of multiple sensor modalities is required to improve the overall detection capabilities. Additionally, robust motion tracking is essential for reducing the effect of sensor noise and improving state estimation accuracy. The reliability of the autonomous vehicle software becomes even more relevant in complex, adversarial high-speed scenarios at the vehicle handling limits in autonomous racing. In this paper, we present a modular multi-modal sensor fusion and tracking method for high-speed applications. The method is based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and is capable of fusing heterogeneous detection inputs to track surrounding objects consistently. A novel delay compensation approach enables to reduce the influence of the perception software latency and to output an updated object list. It is the first fusion and tracking method validated in high-speed real-world scenarios at the Indy Autonomous Challenge 2021 and the Autonomous Challenge at CES (AC@CES) 2022, proving its robustness and computational efficiency on embedded systems. It does not require any labeled data and achieves position tracking residuals below 0.1 m.},

Reliable TRPAC estimation can not only benefit the vehicle active safety system, but also serve the intelligent transportation system to improve the safety of traffic participants. Considering the problems of low estimation accuracy and poor real-time performance caused by low-quality sensor information in existing TRPAC estimation methods, a TRPAC fusion estimation framework based on the assessment of multisource information quality is proposed in this article. Based on the observability theory of nonlinear systems, a quantitative indicator of dynamic information quality denoted as the excitation level is established. The region of effective excitation is defined as the criterion for starting and stopping the proposed dynamics-based fusion estimator for the longitudinal-lateral coupling condition. Considering occupant comfort and vehicle stability, an active enhancement method based on hierarchical model predictive control is designed to actively improve the excitation level. Based on the receding horizon optimization theory, a dynamics-image-based fusion estimator is proposed to make full use of visual and dynamic information. An adaptive fusion estimation strategy is then proposed to apply the proper estimation working mode according to the multisource information quality. The results of the simulation and vehicle test show that the proposed framework can still perform competitively when the quality of multisource information is poor and achieve reliable TRPAC estimation.},

  abstract     = {Facing the requirements of intelligent vehicles for massive data processing, vehicular edge computing (VEC) utilizes computing resources deployed on the roadside infrastructure to provide proximity computing services for vehicles and forms a novel computing paradigm. Thus, vehicles can reduce the burden of local computing and improve computing efficiency by offloading tasks to roadside computing servers or neighboring resource-idle vehicles for execution via cooperative computation offloading (CO). However, dynamic communication channel states and data handover among multiple VEC servers caused by vehicle mobility pose challenges for CO decision-making and data security. This article applies blockchain to the cooperative CO of VEC and thus proposes a cooperative CO and secure handover framework with a consensus mechanism to guarantee the efficiency of cooperative CO and secure handover. In this framework, models for vehicle mobility and cooperative CO handover are constructed, and a consensus mechanism is proposed. This mechanism ensures the synchronization and immutability of offloaded data in the CO handover. A cooperative CO decision optimization is also formulated considering secure handover with blockchain technology to optimize the latency of vehicular computing tasks. To solve this complex problem, this optimization is transformed into a Markov decision process and a cooperative CO decision algorithm with multiagent deep reinforcement learning is designed, thus achieving the optimal solution. Extensive simulations verified the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Firstly, the driving intention is introduced to describe the driver&#39;s involvement level through using Gauss-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine method. And the index of driving ability is proposed to evaluate driver skills based on path-tracking errors. Then, a novel human-machine authority allocation strategy is designed by combining the two driving behavior characteristics and used to construct the driver-vehicle interaction system. Subsequently, a T-S fuzzy robust state-feedback shared control system is developed considering time-varying driver behaviors and vehicle states. Finally, the proposed shared steering system is validated by the driver-in-the-loop test bench. The results show that the proposed control method can reduce human-machine conflicts and has obvious superiority in improving performance of driving comfort, path tracking, and vehicle stability for the co-driving vehicles.},

Herein, we propose a multiple model–based adaptive estimator (MMAE) that infers the lane-change intention of the surrounding vehicles and then predicts their trajectories. Specifically, first, a path is generated in the form of a cubic spline curve using the Frenet coordinate system, which is robust to changes in road curvatures. Linearized recursive least-squares estimation (LRLSE) method is used to adaptively predict a future trajectory based on the past trajectory of the target vehicle. Preview time is defined as a time-varying parameter that determines the final point of the path, and LRLSE updates it in real time. The MMAE applies LRLSEs to multiple paths and obtains the mode probability for each path, then the lane-change intention is inferred using the mode probability and preview time. The predicted future trajectory is the cubic spline curve determined based on the preview time. Further, we verify the performance of our approach using highD, a naturalistic dataset of vehicle trajectories, and compare it with those of existing methods. The proposed method does not require a large amount of data for training and has a low computational burden and high real-time performance.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle trajectory prediction plays a vital role in intelligent driving modules and helps intelligent vehicles travel safely and efficiently in complex traffic environments. Several learning-based prediction methods have been developed that accurately identify vehicle behaviour patterns in actual driving data. However, these methods rely on manually curated structured data and are difficult to deploy in intelligent vehicles. In addition, modular information channels that perform vehicle detection, tracking, and prediction tasks encounter error propagation issues and insufficient computing resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a new multitask parallel joint framework in which vehicle detection, state assessment, tracking, and trajectory prediction are performed simultaneously according to raw LIDAR data. Specifically, a multiscale bird&#39;s eye view (BEV) backbone feature extraction model is proposed and combined with the designed vehicle state identification branch to distinguish dynamic and static vehicles, which is used as a strong prior for trajectory prediction. In addition, a spatiotemporal pyramid model with convolutions and a backbone residual network is used to generate high definition (HD) maps with strong constraints and guidance capabilities, thereby improving the trajectory prediction accuracy. The experimental results on the real-world dataset nuScenes show that the proposed multitask joint framework outperforms state-of-the-art vehicle detection and prediction schemes, including ES3D and PnPNet.},

Specifically, 3D object detection is a vital functional module as it can simultaneously predict surrounding objects&#39; categories, locations, and sizes. Generally, autonomous vehicles are equipped with multiple sensors, including cameras and LiDARs. The fact that single-modal methods suffer from unsatisfactory detection performance motivates utilizing multiple modalities as inputs to compensate for single sensor faults. Although many multi-modal fusion detection algorithms exist, there is still a lack of comprehensive and in-depth analysis of these methods to clarify how to fuse multi-modal data effectively. Therefore, this paper surveys recent advancements in fusion detection methods. First, we present the broad background of multi-modal 3D object detection and identify the characteristics of widely used datasets along with their evaluation metrics. Second, instead of the traditional classification method of early, middle, and late fusion, we categorize and analyze all fusion methods from three aspects: feature representation, alignment, and fusion, which reveals how these fusion methods are implemented in an essential way. Third, we provide an in-depth comparison of their pros and cons and compare their performance in mainstream datasets. Finally, we further summarize current challenges and research trends for realizing the full potential of multi-modal 3D object detection.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a novel GPS-free collaborative elliptical circumnavigation control for multiple non-holonomic vehicles, where two realistic issues—achieving a higher efficiency observation and saving the energy expenditures during cooperation are involved. By defining a novel coordinated error relative to neighboring arc length, under the premise of accessible global position, a cooperative elliptical enclosing control strategy is derived for multiple vehicles connected by a digraph to enable formation behaviors with a uniform forward speed. To surmount the reliance on global position data in hostile surroundings where GPS is being attacked or disrupted, by resorting to a distance-based relative position observer, a new GPS-free cooperative elliptical circling controller is formulated to force all vehicles to collaboratively evolve along the prescribed ellipse. The special innovation includes two aspects, one is that by specifying the adjacent arc length instead of separation angles appearing in existing vehicle coordination, energy consumption can be reduced by approximately 7.6% during cooperative periodic enclosing process, another is that the dependency on global position can be removed by resorting to a relative position estimator utilizing distance-only data. It is inferred from Lyapunov stability that all signals are demonstrated to be convergent. Eventually, both simulation and experimental results substantiate the utility of suggested avenue.},

Moreover, to gain deeper insights, the asymptotic expressions of outage probability along with the diversity order are obtained.

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the problem of autonomous valet parking trajectory planning in complex environments. The task normally can be well described by an optimal control problem (OCP) for the rapid, accurate, and optimal trajectory generation. Appropriate initial guesses obtained by sampling or searching-based methods are important for the numerical optimization procedure. Still, in highly complex environments with narrow passages, it may incur high computational costs or fail to find the proper initial guess. To address this challenge, an enhanced hybrid A* (EHA) algorithm is proposed to address the issue. The EHA includes four steps. The first step is to quickly obtain the global coarse trajectory using a traditional A* search. The second step is constructing a series of driving corridors along the rough trajectory, then evaluating and extracting nodes from each wide or narrow passage based on the length of the box&#39;s side. The third step is to extract each passage&#39;s boundary points. The final step is connecting boundary points by hybrid A* and generating a feasible initial guess for OCP. To reduce safety risks, vehicles in particular areas (Fig. 1(b)) should travel as slowly as possible. The global and local speed restrictions are distinct, and local restrictions are only activated when the vehicle enters a particular area. This “if-else” structure makes the optimization problem difficult. A novel approximation formulation for these local state constraints is introduced to overcome this issue. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method for trajectory planning is effective and robust.},

  abstract     = {Assisted and automated driving functions in vehicles exploit sensor data to build situational awareness, however, the data amount required by these functions might exceed the bandwidth of current wired vehicle communication networks. Consequently, sensor data reduction, and automotive camera video compression need investigation. However, conventional video compression schemes, such as H.264 and H.265, have been mainly optimised for human vision. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware (SA) video compression (SAC) framework that compresses separately and simultaneously region-of-interest and region-out-of-interest of automotive camera video frames, before transmitting them to processing unit(s), where the data are used for perception tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, etc. Using our newly proposed technique, the region-of-interest (ROI), encapsulating most of the road stakeholders, retains higher quality using lower compression ratio. The experimental results show that under the same overall compression ratio, our proposed SAC scheme maintains a similar or better image quality, measured accordingly to traditional metrics and to our newly proposed semantic-aware metrics. The newly proposed metrics, namely SA-PSNR, SA-SSIM, and iIoU, give more emphasis to ROI quality, which has an immediate impact on the planning and decisions of assisted and automated driving functions. Using our SA-X264 compression, SA-PSNR and SA-SSIM have an increase of 2.864 and 0.008 respectively compared to traditional H.264, with higher ROI quality and the same compression ratio. Finally, a segmentation-based perception algorithm has been used to compare reconstructed frames, demonstrating a 2.7% mIOU improvement, when using the proposed SAC method versus traditional compression techniques.},

Next, to identify and handle various cyber attacks, a novel secure data transmission mechanism, featuring a secure transmitter and a secure receiver, is developed for each ASV. Then, a secure CPF control scheme, consisting of a networked cooperative kinematic control law and a networked kinetic control law, is presented. Furthermore, the observer error dynamics and networked CPF error dynamics are derived to account for the simultaneous network-induced delays, packet dropouts, physical attacks, and cyber attacks. The proposed control scheme is capable to preserve satisfactory secure tracking performance of the resulting CPF control system under a desired reference path even in the presence of external environmental disturbances, delays, packet dropouts, and malicious attacks.

It is notable for formation to achieve collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance, so the prescribed performance methodology is introduced to solve the constrained range problem of distance and angle. Meanwhile, in order to compensate the effect from the infinite number of uncertain actuator failures, the robots can maintain interacting with their leader at the moment of actuator faults, and also uninterruptedly track the time-varying referenced trajectory from the leader, a novel decentralized adaptive fault tolerant control (AFTC) strategy is further proposed for time-varying formation and guarantees all signals are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, the effectiveness of AFTC strategy is illustrated perfectly for nonholonomic multirobot systems.},

However, the covariances of all constraints are set to constant matrices or by manual setting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to approximate covariances of constraints in pose graph optimization to better represent the true uncertainty of the underlying visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) that fuses inertial measurements and visual observations. Specifically, for sequential constraints, we propose to utilize nonlinear factor recovery to optimally extract covariance matrices from the accumulated visual-inertial odometry (VIO). For loop-closing constraints, we propose a dynamic scale estimation method to approximate the scales of the information matrices. To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on public and self-collected datasets in various environments. Results show that our proposed method achieves higher accuracy compared with naively-formulated pose graph optimization adopted by several state-of-the-art visual-inertial navigation systems.},

Meanwhile, Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication significantly facilitates the development of connected vehicles. However, the coupled effects of the longitudinal vehicle&#39;s mobility, platoon control and V2I communication may result in a low reliable communication network between the platoon vehicle and the roadside unit, there is a tradeoff between the platoon control and communication reliability. In this article, we investigate a bi-objective joint optimization problem where the first objective is to maximize the success probability of data transmission (communication reliability) and the second objective function is to minimize the traffic oscillation flow. The vehicle&#39;s mobility state of the platoon vehicle affects the channel capacity and transmission performance. In this context, we deeply explore the relationship between control signals and resource scheduling and theoretically deduce a closed-form expression of the optimal communication reliability objective. Through this closed expression, we transform the bi-objective model into a single objective MPC model by using &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\epsilon$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -constraint method.

However, existing AI techniques, such as deep learning and ensemble learning, have been criticized for their black-box nature. Explainable AI is an effective methodology to understand the black box and build public trust in AVs. In this article, a maximum entropy-based Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) is proposed for explaining lane change (LC) decision. Specifically, we first build an LC decision model with high accuracy using eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Then, to explain the model, a modified SHAP method is proposed by introducing a maximum entropy base value. The core of this method is to determine the base value of the LC decision model using the maximum entropy principle, which provides an explanation more consistent with the human intuition. This is because it brings two properties: 1) maximum entropy has a clear physical meaning that quantifies a decision from chaos to certainty, and 2) the sum of the explanations is always isotropic and positive. Furthermore, we develop exhaustive statistical analysis and visualization to present intuitive explanations of the LC decision model. Based on the explanation results, we attribute the causes of predictions with wrong results to model defects or sample sparsity, which provides guidance to users for model optimization.},

Moreover, the optimized velocity profile and the corresponding performance improving rate are analyzed in different control weights, driving styles, and prediction horizons. Notably, a novel predictive eco-driving strategy with long-term connected information is proposed to realize much lower idling time, combining predictive cruise control (car-following scenario) and long-term eco-driving without preceding cars. The traffic signal is transferred into the constraints in the online control through a detailed case judgment.

  abstract     = {Impacts of vehicle automation and connectivity have been studied widely from the perspectives of fuel economy, ecology, and safety. Synthesis of various segments of this literature through review papers has also been presented. However, a systematic review is needed for the growing body of recent literature examining how energy consumption of automated vehicles is influenced by the advancements in powertrain operation and planning/control of driving patterns in different traffic conditions. To address this need, we have first developed an AI-based methodology to effectively find the most relevant papers from a very high volume of related literature. The methodology, comprising natural language processing and machine learning models with humans in the loop, has two phases: search query refinement and relevancy determination. The former ensures that almost all the potentially relevant papers are identified. The latter seeks to automatically eliminate (most) irrelevant papers. Application of our method reduced several thousands of papers from an initial step to 430 potentially relevant papers. Manual review of these papers further characterized many as irrelevant resulting in the final pool of 172 papers. We organized these papers based on various means of influencing power consumption, which are powertrain control, platooning, car-following, intersection management, speed planning, traffic control, lane changing, and on-ramp merging. Synthesis of the papers reveals that the existing studies vary greatly in their design, implementation, and comparison baselines, and thus offer widely differing predictions. Hence, more application specific and comprehensive studies are required to appropriately benchmark energy consumption impact of vehicle automation.},

  abstract     = {Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely researched for automotive control. However, the real-world application of MPC for autonomous vehicles (AV) is still limited due to the high computational requirement of solving the real-time optimization problem. To address this issue, this letter presents an event-triggered MPC framework and illustrates its application in AV path tracking control using the CARLA simulation environment. Unlike traditional time-triggered MPC, event-triggered MPC solves the optimization problem only when an event is triggered. Otherwise, the previously optimized control sequence is used to determine control action. Therefore, when following the same path, event-triggered MPC solves fewer optimization problems than time-triggered MPC, thereby reducing the computation requirements. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, both time-triggered MPC and event-triggered MPC are simulated and compared using CARLA. Results validate that the proposed event-triggered MPC method reduces significant computation with acceptable performance degradation.},

This problem requires an open-world learning approach but most of the machine learning methods used for traffic scenario categorisation work under the closed-world assumption. A closed-world model will classify all the inputs to one of the classes from the training data. An open-world learning method can identify, collect and cluster unknown traffic scenarios and incrementally add new scenario categories to the already existing ones. In this work, a hierarchical architecture for open-world learning method is proposed. The open-world architecture consists of the following components: an open-set recognition model, storage buffer, outlier detection, class-conditioned generative replay model, and clustering method. The components in the architecture contain novel machine learning approaches to address the challenging open-world learning tasks, e.g., Extreme Value Theory (EVT) for open-set recognition, Random Forest Activation Patterns (RFAPs) for clustering, class-conditioned generative models for replay, and self-supervised pre-training for feature generation. The proposed architecture is tested using real-world and simulation-based datasets. The results show the performance advantages of the proposed method. Also, extensive analysis of each component of the hierarchical open-world architecture underlines their importance in the overall architecture.},

  abstract     = {Point clouds have been a popular representation to describe 3D environments for autonomous driving applications. Despite accurate depth information, sparsity of points results in difficulties in extracting sufficient features from vulnerable objects of small sizes. One solution is leveraging self-attention networks to build long-range connections between similar objects. Another method is using generative models to estimate the complete shape of objects. Both approaches introduce large memory consumption and extra complexity to the models while the geometric characteristics of objects are overlooked. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes Point Augmentation (PA)-RCNN, focusing on small object detection by generating efficient complementary features without trainable parameters. Specifically, 3D points are sampled with the guidance of object proposals and encoded through the 3D grid-based feature aggregation to produce localised 3D voxel properties. Such voxel attributes are fed to the pooling module with the aid of fictional points, which are transformed from sampled points considering geometric symmetry. Experimental results on Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI dataset show a superior advantage in the detection of distant and small objects in comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods.},

As such, this work proposes a novel framework where, accounting for CAVs&#39; location uncertainty, an intersection manager (IM) controls CAVs approaching a road crossing so as to maximize the number of admitted vehicles, while ensuring a guaranteed (tunable) level of safety. To fully exploit the communication links among the IM and the CAVs, several features are included in the proposed framework: (i) periodic re-optimizations of the CAVs&#39; applied controls; (ii) periodic re-ordering of the intersection crossing sequence; and (iii) event-based control and ordering optimizations to achieve the best possible trade-off between complexity and performance. The proposed framework is able to improve both the number of admitted CAVs to the intersection and the CAVs&#39; average speeds as compared to relevant state-of-the-art solutions. Importantly, when event-triggering is applied, most of the benefits introduced by periodic optimizations are retained, while at the same time the number of re-optimizations required are reduced by 47.6% (34.18%) during average (heavy) traffic conditions.},

Moreover, most current algorithms don&#39;t consider collision mitigation in an emergency. This functionality is essential since the problem may have no feasible solution. We propose a safe controller using model predictive control and artificial potential function to address these problems. A new artificial potential function inspired by line charge is proposed as the cost function for our model predictive controller. The vehicle dynamics and actuator limitations are set as constraints. The new artificial potential function considers the shape of all objects. In particular, the artificial potential function we proposed has the flexibility to fit the shape of the road structures, such as the intersection. We could also realize collision mitigation for a specific part of the vehicle by increasing the charge quantity at the corresponding place. We have tested our methods in 192 cases from 8 different scenarios in simulation with two different models. The simulation results show that the success rate of the proposed safe controller is 20 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; higher than using HJ-reachability with system decomposition by using a unicycle model.

  abstract     = {The promise of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with the mobile edge computing (MEC), named MEC-aided-UAV extends the MEC application to offer new flexible, low-latency computing services and considerable utilities for pervasive sensing of the world. In MEC, the UAV with limited on-board energy and computation resources needs to offload its tasks to resource-rich ground base stations (GBSs) servers. Because of the broadcast nature of line-of-sight (LoS) channels, one of the key challenges in task offloading is to guarantee that confidential data is offloaded safely to the GBSs without being intercepted by eavesdroppers (Eves). In this MEC-aided-UAV system, the GBSs help the UAV compute the offloaded tasks and transmit the artificial noise (AN) to suppress the vicious Eves. We make the first attempt to study the maximum-minimum average secrecy capacity problem, including joint optimization of the trajectory and transmit power of the UAV, the transmit power of AN, the local computation ratio, and the selection of GBSs with consideration of the practical constraints of completion delay of the tasks, maximum velocity, and the power consumption. The optimization issue is confirmed as a mixed-integer non-convex problem. Thereafter, a low-complexity iterative algorithm with the block coordinate descent method and successive convex approximation technique is put forward to get its suboptimal solution. In addition, the convergent solution can be achieved by solving the subproblems in turn. Evaluation results validate that the proposed secure offloading scheme significantly effectiveness the baselines by 17.4%-71.2% on the maximum-minimum average secrecy capacity.},

  abstract     = {Many map matching-based localization algorithms estimate the autonomous car&#39;s pose using a registration between lanes measured by a camera and the High-Definition (HD) map. However, the registration methods based on numerical optimization, such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), can cause underdetermined problems due to no unique solution when matching under-constrained lane shapes such as straight lines and circular arcs. This paper proposes a robust localization algorithm with centimeter-level accuracy by applying different matching techniques depending on the road shape. We proposed a road shape classification-based map matching algorithm to overcome the under-constrained problems, which have no unique solution due to insufficient constraints. The proposed algorithm classifies lane segments into line, arc, and clothoid curves considering their curvature characteristics. After that, we find correction information through a map matching and covariance estimation method using lane pairs with the same type of their shape. For the under-constrained shapes, the geometry-based map-matching algorithm and covariance estimation method are applied to avoid underdetermined results. Finally, the measurement calculated from the correction information and predicted pose of the ego-vehicle is exploited for the measurement update of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The proposed method was quantitatively evaluated in the simulation environment, which contains various road shapes, and qualitatively validated for experimental data from an autonomous driving platform. The proposed algorithm shows more robust matching capability, efficient computation time, and higher accuracy than the localization system based on ICP-based lane matching.},

The salient features of this paper are: (1) Inherent constraints of visual homing are analyzed in detail to reveal the limitations of existing ALV-based methods. (2) Instead of removing mismatched landmarks or artificially assigning fixed weights to landmarks, a novel solution is proposed by adaptively evaluating a reasonable weight for each landmark to account for contribution to the output. (3) Computation time of the proposed method is particularly concerned to enable the vehicle to perform real-time homing tasks in actual scenarios. (4) Simulations and experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method under both static and dynamic conditions. Our method focuses on improving a vehicle&#39;s homing ability in terms of landmark matching, landmark distribution and homing direction. Comparative studies with other ALV-based methods demonstrate that our method generalizes well to various complex and challenging indoor scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Modern war relies heavily on various combat units, such as command and control units, surveillance units, and reconnaissance units. These units are usually combined organically as a combat SoS (System of Systems) to conduct given missions. To ensure that the combat SoS executes correctly, the communication systems (e.g., communication vehicles, communication UAVs) must be planned carefully to connect all constituent systems or units. However, the c ommunication a rchitecture d esign problem for combat SoS (SoS-CAD) is very challenging as the combat SoS usually resides in a dynamic and confrontational environment. In this paper, we formally formulate the SoS-CAD problem with integer programming and prove its NP-hardness. The SoS-CAD problem has high requirements for the solving speed as well as the solution quality, but traditional meta-heuristic algorithms cannot satisfy them. Thus, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method called CADer to solve it. Specifically, we introduce the attention mechanism and dynamic embedding mechanism into CADer with considering the characteristics of the SoS-CAD problem itself. The massive experiment results show that CADer performs well in the generalization ability and can achieve the best tradeoff between the solving speed and the solution quality against the meta-heuristic algorithm.},

A highly reliable levitation controller must be designed with the inherent antilock capability to prevent such fatal deadlock. In this work, an adaptive fixed-time levitation control scheme is established by directly introducing antilock limits of EMLS into an output-constrained controller, by which not only the desired levitation distance is achieved with a fixed-time convergence rate, but also the EMLS never exceeds the predefined levitation boundaries. Therefore, the antilock levitation operation is naturally ensured. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

Compared to previous visual-LiDAR fusion frameworks, our proposed framework leverages more constraints among LiDAR features and visual features and integrates that in a tightly coupled approach. Specifically, the framework starts with a preprocess module which contains LiDAR feature extraction, visual feature extraction and tracking, and visual feature depth recover. Then a frame-to-frame odometry module is established by fusing visual feature tracking and LiDAR feature match between frames, aiming to provide a coarse pose estimation for next module. Finally, to refine the pose and build a multi-modal map, we introduce a multi-modal mapping module that tightly couple multi-modal feature constraints by matching or registering multi-modal features to multi-modal map. In addition, the proposed fusion framework also functions well in sensor-degraded environment (texture-less or structure-less), which increases its robustness. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed fusion framework are demonstrated and evaluated on the public KITTI odometry benchmark, and results show that our proposed fusion framework achieves comparable performance compared with the state-of-the-art visual-LiDAR odometry frameworks.},

Passenger classification based on volunteer heterogeneity is introduced for label reconstruction. Secondly, this paper innovatively develops a comfort degree quantification model based on the combination of AM-Bi-LSTM and semi-supervised learning. The semi-supervised learning strategy is developed to generate pseudo-labels and reduce dataset noise caused by individual variances of volunteers.

The outputs of onboard real-time comfort quantification system are consistent with the driving intensity of automated vehicle. The results illustrate that the proposed model can accurately identify different comfort degrees of lane change scenarios, which can enhance the evaluation capacity of automated vehicle and optimize the decision-making and path planning modules of automated driving framework with more personalized driving styles.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicle technologies have evolved quickly over the last few years, with safety being one of the key requirements for their full deployment. However, ensuring their safety while navigating through highly interactive and complex scenarios remains a critical challenge. To tackle this problem, intention estimation and motion prediction are fundamental. In this work, a method to infer the intentions, based on a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), and predict the motion, using Markov Chains, of the nearby vehicles at unsignalized intersections is proposed. This approach considers all possible corridors of the surrounding traffic participants and takes into account their interactions to infer the probabilities of stopping or crossing the intersection, as well as the probability of being in each of the possible navigable corridors. To achieve this, the DBN is used to model the relationships between the observed states and the unobserved intentions of the nearby agents. The Markov Chain model, obtained from a kinematic model, is used to predict the future motions of the vehicles, taking into account their current state, their inferred intentions, and the uncertainty associated with the prediction. The resulting multi-modal motion predictions are sent to the ego vehicle to navigate through the scene. The proposed method is evaluated in 6 real situations extracted from publicly available datasets and is compared with a model-based and a learn-based baseline models. The results showed that the proposed method outperformed both baselines in terms of accuracy considering the metrics ADE and FDE.},

However, the scarcity of risky driving events distributed in real-world driving often makes sampling inefficient. In this paper, we propose a unified and hierarchical testing framework for efficient and unbiased safety tests of ADS. We first extract the risk subspace from the Naturalistic Driving Data (NDD) with defined safety measures. Subsequently, we use the Gaussian Copula method to accurately model the subspace joint probability density function (PDF). We further formulate a Kriging model-based optimization problem for finding the appropriate Importance Sampling (IS) parameters, where the Kriging model is trained iteratively within limited computational resources. Eventually, the risky concrete scenarios library is generated using the obtained Importance Sampling parameters. With the simulation results skewered back to the original risk subspace, the ADS probability of failure (e.g., crash rate) can thus be accurately and unbiasedly estimated. Experiment results show that using 0.94% computational resources, the Kriging surrogate model captures 96.04% of ADS crashes with at least 90.25% precision. On crash rate estimation, our proposed method achieves a consistent result with that of Monte Carlo simulation, provided that the relative error does not exceed 10% while improving the testing efficiency by up to 6,539 times.},

In addition, the proposed model predictive controller (MPC) actively utilizes the road friction limit constraint for each tire force to ensure vehicle stability. Through this, the proposed controller generates optimal braking and steering inputs for situations such as high-speed turns in which braking must be involved. Due to the proposed linearized model, the controller achieves a significant improvement in computational efficiency and good control performance similar to that of the nonlinear MPC.

Although prototypes of automated vehicles (AVs) are developed, remaining safety issues and functional insufficiencies hinder their market introduction. To obtain reasonably foreseeable scenarios and study human driving policies, many naturalistic driving datasets are proposed. However, no open-source dataset filled with congestion scenarios is publicly available. The paper presents the Aerial Dataset for China&#39;s Congested Highways &amp; Expressways (AD4CHE). It contains 5.12 hours of aerial survey data from four different cities in China, with a total driving distance of 6540.7 km. Moreover, overlap and non-overlap cut-in scenarios are distinguished to better describe driver behavior in congestion scenarios. Both types of cut-in scenarios are extracted and parameterized. The Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) is utilized to generate parameter distributions for the scenario-based testing method. Furthermore, the driving behavior in overlap cut-in scenarios is intensively analyzed. The results reveal that the drivers have an evasive maneuver during overlap cut-in of challenging vehicles, and the preferred following distance varies with the relative longitudinal velocity. Both scenario parameterization and driving behavior analysis can contribute to developing and verifying Traffic Jam Pilot (TJP) systems deployed in Chinese traffic situations.},

RCTAC has several advantages over existing adaptive dynamic programming algorithms for CT systems. It does not require the “admissibility” of the initialized policy or the input-affine nature of controlled systems for convergence. Instead, given any initial policy, RCTAC can converge to an admissible, and subsequently nearly optimal policy for a general nonlinear system with a saturated controller. RCTAC consists of two phases: a warm-up phase and a generalized policy iteration phase. The warm-up phase minimizes the square of the Hamiltonian to achieve admissibility, while the generalized policy iteration phase relaxes the update termination conditions for faster convergence. The convergence and optimality of the algorithm are proven through Lyapunov analysis, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations and real-world path-tracking tasks.},

  abstract     = {The fuel economy of plug-in hybrid electric bus (PHEB) is highly dependent on its energy management strategy (EMS). In practice, the fuzzy control (FC) is widely used in EMS due to its real-time performance and robustness. However, the FC with fixed parameters is difficult to obtain the optimal fuel economy under changing traffic conditions. Regarding this, the control parameters of FC need to be optimized, but this scheme needs to overcome the subsequent calculation burden and time consumption. Therefore, the design of a real-time EMS with parameter optimization is a challenging problem. Inspired by this issue, a cyber-physical optimization-based fuzzy EMS is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a cyber-physical system framework is formulated for PHEB to eliminate the conflict between parameter optimization and real-time operation of EMS. Secondly, considering the uncertainty of the vehicle environment, an IT2 FC with optimization parameters is designed for real-time torque allocation. Thirdly, an iterative modified particle swarm optimization (IMPSO) algorithm is proposed to optimize parameters to accurately and quickly converge to the optimal solution. Additionally, the optimization problem with multi-objective that takes battery life into account is introduced. Finally, simulation and hardware in loop test are used to discuss the performance of the proposed EMS. The results reveal that the IMPSO algorithm can improve the optimization effect. Compared to conventional rule-based and fuzzy-based strategies, the proposed EMS can reduce fuel consumption at least 10% and 4.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, it shows the proposed EMS could reduce the battery capacity loss by 6.42%∼9.72% with a slight increase in fuel consumption.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, great efforts have been devoted to deep imitation learning for autonomous driving control, where raw sensory inputs are directly mapped to control actions. However, navigating through densely populated intersections remains a challenging task due to uncertainty caused by uncertain traffic participants. We focus on autonomous navigation at crowded intersections that require interaction with pedestrians. A multi-task conditional imitation learning framework is proposed to adapt both lateral and longitudinal control tasks for safe and efficient interaction. A new benchmark called IntersectNav is developed and human demonstrations are provided. Empirical results show that the proposed method can achieve a success rate gain of up to 30% compared to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {A core issue of safe human-machine cooperative driving lies in dynamic assessment of the rapidly evolving driving risks. Given that, this paper proposes a shared controller for safe and human-friendly cooperative driving based on predictive risk assessment enabled by Digital Twin technologies. In the digital world, we create a fine-grained digital replica of the driving scene comprising historical motions of vehicles, as well as roadway geometries and topologies. On the basis of that, spatial-temporal interactive features are obtained with a deep learning-based model and subsequently decoded to predict future trajectories of each target vehicle in the neighborhood of the ego-vehicle. In the physical world, the predicted trajectories of neighboring vehicles are integrated into the risk distribution to construct predictive risk fields. A novel shared controller in the framework of multi-objective MPC is designed to minimize the driving risk while matching driver&#39;s commands, so that safe cooperative driving is achieved in a smooth and minimal-intervention manner. The results of driver-in-the-loop simulation experiments demonstrate the enabling role of the Digital Twin in improving the assessment of risk in highly dynamic scenes through taking the motion trends of dynamic agents into account. The results also show the superiority of the Digital Twin-based shared controller in terms of implementing cooperation in time while honoring the driver&#39;s commands whenever possible.},

Next, existing VC control techniques are surveyed and classified into five groups: consensus-based control, model prediction control, sliding mode control, machine learning-based control, and constraints-following control. Their advantages and disadvantages for VC applications are also discussed in detail. Furthermore, several future directions for achieving better controller development and better controller implementation are envisioned, respectively. The purposes of this survey are to help researchers to achieve a comprehensive understanding regarding VC control, to spark more research into VC, and to further speed-up the realization of this emerging technology in railway and other relevant fields such as road vehicles.},

We consider a multi-objective, multiple-vehicle routing problem in which teams of manned ground vehicles (MGVs) and AMRs are deployed respectively in a leader-follower framework to execute missions with differing requirements for MGVs and AMRs while considering human-robot interactions (HRI). HRI studies highlight the costs of managing a team of follower AMRs by a leader MGV. This paper aims to compute feasible visit sequences, replenishments, team compositions and number of MGV-AMR teams deployed such that the requirements for MGVs and AMRs for the missions are met and the routing, replenishment, HRI and team deployment costs are at minimum. The problem is first modeled as a a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that can be solved to optimality by off-the-shelf commercial solvers for small-sized instances. For larger instances, a variable neighborhood search algorithm is offered to compute near optimal solutions and address the challenges that arise when solving the combinatorial multi-objective routing optimization problem. Finally, computational experiments that corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are presented.},

While still focused on extreme speed, autonomous racing differs from conventional automobile racing in its development philosophy, as human drivers are no longer involved. The absence of human drivers should be regarded as a new chance to increase competitiveness and entertainment value. This letter discusses opportunities to promote education-oriented autonomous racing. Recall that the flagship car race is Formula 1, where “formula” denotes technical restrictions that should be satisfied strictly. We name the new race series Autonomous 1 or A1, leveraging the power of autonomous intelligence in education. The achievements made in Formula 1 and typical autonomous races are reviewed, followed by discussions about A1’s future perspectives. Specifically, A1 needs to maintain race consistency, update rules, and provide personalized commentary to support all-age education.},

This letter reports our first DHW (decentralized and hybrid workshop) on Scenarios Engineering (SE), that aims to calibrate and validate AV modules through advanced scenarios. Specifically, the DHW discusses combining SE with existing simulation software and real-road testing strategies, enabling developers to maximize the advantages of each approach while ensuring the safety and efficacy in the development of autonomous vehicles. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of enhancing realism of simulation scenarios in the aspects of both content and appearance.

In reality, especially when long-term autonomy is the objective, this is not valid. This paper studies a scenario where uniquely identifiable landmarks can attend multiple discrete positions, not known a priori . Based on a feature based multi-hypothesis map representation, a multi-hypothesis SLAM algorithm is developed inspired by target tracking theory. The creation of such a map is merged into the SLAM framework allowing any available SLAM method to solve the underlying mapping and localization problem for each hypothesis. A recursively updated hypothesis score allows for hypothesis rejection and prevents exponential growth in the number of hypotheses. The developed method is evaluated in an underground mine application, where physical barriers can be moved in between multiple distinct positions. Simulations are conducted in this environment showing the benefits of the multi-hypothesis approach compared to executing a standard SLAM algorithm. Practical considerations as well as suitable approximations are elaborated upon and experiments on real data further validates the simulated results and show that the multi-hypothesis approach has similar performance in reality as in simulation.},

An incorrect prediction of an upcoming situation means that erroneous information may be supplied to the decision-making process, leading to hazardous outcomes. It is therefore of great importance to estimate the driving areas that are reachable by other interacting road users, without introducing misleading information. This paper presents a means of handling the integrity of prediction information, given the imperfection of object prediction, via a Lane Grid Map, that is to say a spatial representation of the situation at a tactical level, based on the topological layer of a high-definition map. We demonstrate experimentally, using real data, how the spatial sampling step of the grid representation can be used to manage the integrity of prediction information. Moreover, addressing interactions during the prediction makes it possible to handle some particular situations safely. We show how some interactions can be utilized via the concept of neutralization. To quantify the integrity of the prediction, we propose the use of two metrics, namely False Negative Rate and Neutralized Time Interval. Experiments were carried out with three vehicles to evaluate the integrity of the prediction using these metrics.},

This leads to the multiple implementations of the similar functionalities within different domains of the vehicle, and the redundancy of hardware resources. Having separate domains communicating with each other would certainly lower the cost of the vehicle hardware and facilitate software development. Nevertheless, establishing inter-domain connectivity is not a trivial solution, and requires determining the suitable communication protocol, as well as the consideration of the use-case variety, specialized domain knowledge of automotive developers, platforms and software standards heterogeneity, safety and security issues, etc. This article presents a verified automated solution for data exchange between Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) domains over SOME/IP. The backbone of the generated solution uses the most common interface definition languages for specific domains - ARXML, FIDL and AIDL, and enables the translation between those languages, as well as the generation of the required cross-domain services and clients, while supporting various architectural aspects and different software platforms.},

While supervised approaches can effectively identify aspects related to driving anomalies, it is unfeasible to tabulate and address all potential driving anomalies. Instead, it is appealing to design unsupervised approaches that can automatically identify unexpected driving scenarios. This study formulates the detection of driving anomalies as a binary-discrimination task between expected and unexpected driving behaviors. We propose an unsupervised contrastive method using conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) implemented with the attention model and the triplet loss function. A feature of our framework is its scalability, where it is easy to add new modalities. We consider five different modalities: the vehicle’s CAN-Bus signals, driver’s physiological signals, distance to nearby pedestrians, distance to nearby vehicles and distance to nearby bicycles. Our approach trains a conditional GAN to extract latent features from each of the five modalities. An attention model combines the latent representations from the modalities. The entire framework is trained with the triplet loss function to generate effective representations to discriminate normal and abnormal driving segments. We conduct experimental evaluations on the driving anomaly dataset (DAD), achieving improved performance over alternative approaches.},

  abstract     = {As automated driving technology advances, drivers are gradually taking the role of passengers. During this transition of the driver’s role, learning methods to adapt the planned path to individual drivers have been proposed to improve the comfort and trust provided by automated driving systems (ADSs). However, existing methods apply offline learning from data of manual driving conducted at least once in a specific situation, even if they can accept the request to learn while driving (on-demand learning). Although several online learning methods are available, their learning results have not been applied in real time for vehicle maneuvering. Focusing on obstacle avoidance, we propose on-demand online learning of preferred paths for individual drivers and investigate whether the proposed method improves the comfort and trust provided by the ADS after learning. Unlike the existing methods, the proposed ADS can smoothly and arbitrarily transition between automated and manual driving, thereby learning preferred maneuvers whose results can be applied in real-time to obstacle avoidance. Accordingly, the proposed ADS includes mutual transfer of steering authority between the ADS and driver and curve modification resembling proportional–derivative control according to the error between the ADS planned path and actual vehicle trajectory. Experimental results from driving simulations and questionnaire survey responses show that the proposed ADS method improves the comfort and trust of drivers. In addition, the proposed ADS method learns the paths preferred by individual drivers during avoidance maneuvers to some extent and gradually adjusts the path according to the driver’s preference through repeated learning. The proposed method may contribute to the convenience of ADSs and their fast adaptation to various traffic situations. Furthermore, the proposed method can serve as basis for online learning and its real-time application to other ADS operations.},

  abstract     = {In automated driving, a strong relation between the sensing modules and the planning module exists, since the former provide uncertain information to the latter. To ensure good data processing over the whole sense-plan-act chain, the quality of the planner’s input needs to be analyzed: How much uncertainty can the planning module handle while still providing reliable decisions, and are the sensing modules capable of ensuring this quality for the information they provide? We present a method that identifies uncertainty bounds for every input such that with a given probability changes in the input, e.g., due to measurement errors, do not lead to unacceptably large deviations in the planning result. For this, we define a stochastic optimization program, which characterizes non-influential input parameters with a stochastic constraint, and give a discrete approximation to the problem. To solve it, we extend a multilevel coordinate search algorithm by a sensitivity analysis. Finally, we determine accuracy requirements for a longitudinal-lateral driver model in a roundabout scenario. We see that the proposed method is capable of determining situation- and planner-dependent bounds. With this, we are able to detect weaknesses of the planning algorithm offline as well as to examine if a more conservative driving maneuver is required due to a lack of information.},

A two-step iterative strategy relying on both a discrete and a continuous space representation, using Dynamic Programming and reference tracking via Model Predictive Control, is formulated. It allows the creation and arbitrary reshaping of vehicle formations in a unified context, providing an applicability in a wide range of practical situations. Only position measurements and basic communication capabilities for global coordination are required for the automated vehicles. Scalability and flexibility are achieved by the underlying decoupled structure of the algorithm, while an asynchronous functioning is enforced due to trigger signals that are exchanged between the vehicles and the coordinator. Different scenarios are simulated and discussed to evidence the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

In this paper, we propose an Intelligent Congestion Avoidance Mechanism (ICAM) to prevent congestion in Heterogeneous Vehicular Network (HetVNET) that adapts the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) transmission power using a Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) to predict data congestion. We compare the performance of the proposed GRNN congestion prediction model to other well-known models such as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) for regression, Decision Tree Regression (DTR), and Multi-layer Perceptron for Regression (MLPR). Numerical results show that the proposed GRNN congestion prediction model outperforms those other models in terms of accuracy, reliability and stability. Furthermore, simulation results show a substantial network performance improvement compared to other congestion control methods in terms of packet delivery ratio, average delay, and packet loss ratio.},

With the motivation that automatic driving is more difficult to be realized under more complicated scenarios, an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) based evolution test is proposed to accelerate the test process for the performance limit evaluation of automatic driving systems. IGA conducts the crossover operation at all positions and the mutation operation for several times to make the high quality chromosome exist in the candidate offspring easily. Then the normal offspring is selected statistically based on the index of scenario complexity, which is designed to measure the difficulty of automatic driving indirectly by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The benefits of the modified cross/mutation operators on the improvement of the scenario complexity are analyzed theoretically. The effectiveness of IGA based evolution test is validated by application to the evaluation of the collision avoidance performance of an automatic parallel parking system. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional genetic algorithm, the average scenario complexity of the offspring is increased by 16.59%, the convergence speed is about twice as fast and IGA can find the collision condition successfully.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous and connected vehicles mainly rely on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) for positioning and navigation, which is a key component for path planning and guidance. It is therefore crucial to ensure the reliability and robustness of the GNSS signals. Jamming has recently become one of the major concerns for GNSS receivers, especially with the widespread of in-car jammers that broadcast jamming signals. Therefore, future vehicle manufacturers must deploy advanced anti-jamming techniques that have to be extensively tested before being deployed in future self-driving vehicles. This motivates us to develop a robust anti-jamming technique based on wavelet packet transform to efficiently suppress jamming signals and enhance the performance of the acquisition, tracking, and navigation stages within a software-defined receiver. The developed technique is computationally efficient, thus, more suitable for real-time processing. Several experiments for different driving scenarios are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for mitigating various types of jamming signals. Experiments are conducted on global positioning system (GPS) L1 C/A signals obtained from Spirent system for a fully controlled environment. Moreover, a unique experimental setup was developed to assess the performance of the proposed technique in the presence of a jamming signal from a real jammer.},

In this work, we propose a novel shared lane-keeping controller-based on quasi-continuous high-order sliding mode control dealing with the above challenges. The parameters of the controller are characterized by an upper bound estimate of the lateral wind’s force and the road curvature which acts as disturbances. Using the sharing parameter dependent on the monitored driver attribute, the authority is smoothly transitioned between various modes while accounting for driver behaviors. Experimental results on the SHERPA vehicle simulator shows the real-time implementation feasibility.

In this paper, a novel twin delayed deep deterministic police gradient (TD3) algorithm based EMS integrating co-recognition for driving style and traffic condition is proposed, aiming to improve the generalization ability of EMS in various application scenarios with superior energy saving performance and higher self-learning efficiency. In particular, the TD3 based energy management architecture combining delayed policy update and smooth regularization technologies is studied to achieve simultaneous improvement for PHEV energy efficiency and strategy convergence speed. Furthermore, the traffic conditions are recognized by fuzzy C-means method, while the local minimum problem is effectively avoided by incorporating simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA). Sequentially, the driving styles are decoupled from recognized traffic condition, which are further recognized as three typical styles. The comparison results of the proposed strategy with several representative deep reinforcement learning based EMSs indicate that the TD3 based EMS outperforms DDQN and DDPG based EMSs in terms of convergence speed and energy saving performance. With considering the recognized traffic condition and driving style, the energy efficiency of TD3 based EMS is further improved with an ideal robustness to various driving cycles.},

Their failure can mainly be accounted for the extreme sparseness of radar point cloud for objects, low angular resolution, and the issue of ghost targets. In this work, we propose a novel network that employs the complex range-Doppler matrix as input to achieve radar-tailored panoptic segmentation (i.e., free-space segmentation and object detection ). Our network surpasses previous works in free-space segmentation and object detection tasks, and the improvement in the former task is especially notable. During training, the segmented camera image with radar customized adaption is utilized as the ground truth.

Meanwhile, based on the analysis of relay UAVs requirements during the spatial distribution of tasks, a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) is constructed to solve the approximate number of relay nodes and access locations. Then aiming for the minimum number of relay UAVs, a continuous time-sharing relay UAVs reward model is constructed, and the consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA) is adopted to obtain the maximum rewards, including the number of relay nodes, mission sequences and route planning.

  abstract     = {LiDAR object detection algorithms based on neural networks for autonomous driving require large amounts of data for training, validation, and testing. As real-world data collection and labeling are time-consuming and expensive, simulation-based synthetic data generation is a viable alternative. However, using simulated data for the training of neural networks leads to a domain shift of training and testing data due to differences in scenes, scenarios, and distributions. In this work, we quantify the sim-to-real domain shift by means of LiDAR object detectors trained with a new scenario-identical real-world and simulated dataset. In addition, we answer the questions of how well the simulated data resembles the real-world data and how well object detectors trained on simulated data perform on real-world data. Further, we analyze point clouds at the target-level by comparing real-world and simulated point clouds within the 3D bounding boxes of the targets. Our experiments show that a significant sim-to-real domain shift exists even for our scenario-identical datasets. This domain shift amounts to an average precision reduction of around &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$14 \,\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; for object detectors trained with simulated data. Additional experiments reveal that this domain shift can be lowered by introducing a simple noise model in simulation.

  abstract     = {Common cameras cannot capture high quality image in the night or extreme weather conditions that without enough light, while thermal infrared(TIR) cameras are not limited in this situation. Hence, TIR imaging technique is widely used in military, surveillance, nighttime traffic and other scenarios. However, TIR images are monochromatic, and the majority of details of such images are lost, which are difficult for human or computer system to analyze. Translating TIR images into visible images is beneficial to subsequent observation or further processing. Though there are some advances to realize the transformation from TIR images to color visible images, edge distortion and semantic confusion remain to be solved. Therefore, we propose a Mixed-Skipping UNet(MS-UNet) based image colorization model joint Generative Adversarial Network, which is denoted by MUGAN. Firstly, the dense skip connections of UNet++ and full-scale skip connections of UNet 3+ are combined to form the MS-UNet, which is regarded as the generator. In addition, we design a feature extraction module in MS-UNet to effectively capture the multi-scale features in source image. Then, a novel attention mechanism module is designed for decoding stage which can help decoder of MS-UNet to focus on the important information. Moreover, we explore the effect of different loss functions in TIR image colorization task, and the loss function with excellent performance is selected to further optimize the training process of the model. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of our method in the task of TIR image colorization.},

  abstract     = {Great efforts have been devoted to the intelligent control of autonomous systems. Yet, most of existing methods fail to effectively handle the uncertainty of their environment and models. Uncertain locations of dynamic obstacles pose a major challenge for their optimal control and safety, while their linearization or simplified system models reduce their actual performance. To address them, this paper presents a new model predictive control framework with finite samples and a Gaussian model, resulting in a chance-constrained program. Its nominal model is combined with a Gaussian process. Its residual model uncertainty is learned. The resulting method addresses an efficiently solvable approximate formulation of a stochastic optimal control problem by using approximations for efficient computation. There is no perfect distribution knowledge of a dynamic obstacle&#39;s location uncertainty. Only finite samples from sensors or past data are available for moment estimation. We use the uncertainty propagation of a system&#39;s state and obstacles’ locations to derive a general collision avoidance condition under tight concentration bounds on the error of the estimated moments. Thus, this condition is suitable for different obstacles, e.g., bounding box and ellipsoid obstacles. We provide proved guarantees on the satisfaction of the chance-constraints corresponding to the nominal yet unknown moments. Simulation examples of a vehicle&#39;s control are used to show that the proposed method can well realize autonomous control and obstacle avoidance of a vehicle, when it operates in an uncertain environment with moving obstacles. It outperforms the existing moment methods in both performance and computational time.},

This study provides a real-time switching topology technique for improving the platoon&#39;s performance under poor communication. First, a discrete sliding mode controller with a double power reaching law is designed for a nonlinear heterogeneous vehicle dynamic model with packet loss. Then, Lyapunov analysis is applied to ensure the platoon&#39;s stability and string stability. Finally, a two-step switching topology framework is introduced. The first step is to search for Pareto optimal topology offline with predicted imperfect communication scenarios. Then, the platoon&#39;s overall performance is optimised using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. In the second step, the optimal topology is selected and switched in real-time to reduce the control cost. The proposed method maximises the advantages of information flow topology. It deals with poor communication, improves the platoon&#39;s performance, and ensures stability. Numerical simulations were conducted to validate the proposed approach. Compared to a standard robust sliding mode controller, the suggested technique enhances platoon tracking ability by 97.73 percent, fuel efficiency by 9.96 percent, and driving comfort by 20.18 percent, respectively.},

The challenge, from a system perspective, is to accurately detect those cases. Recently, machine learning-based prediction models that are able to estimate the prediction uncertainty in real-time have successfully been introduced for this purpose. However, very little effort has been made on using the prediction uncertainty in the decision-making logic to improve the system&#39;s robustness, especially in cases where the input data is affected by noise or anomalies that are not presented in the training data. In this work, four threat-detection methods using uncertainty estimates are proposed and evaluated using a real-world data set. The methods use different strategies for leveraging uncertainty information, where the goal is to ensure that the intervention decision is based on trustworthy predictions. The threat-detection methods&#39; performances are evaluated, using five different learning-based prediction models, in the context of a lane-keeping assistance application.},

For the first time, we formulate a resilient JLATT framework to synthesize the hybrid problems of distributed cooperative localization and flock tracking in the presence of BAs. More specifically, we propose a covariance weighted mean-subsequence-filter (CW-MSF) algorithm to guarantee that the MVS achieves flock tracking w.r.t a target even in the presence of a certain fraction of Byzantine vehicles. Note that this resilient JLATT scheme does not require global information and thus it is fully distributed.

The mixture-of-experts approach is first utilized to learn from human-driving trajectory data to construct a multimodal motion planner, which uses a Transformer to model the interactions between vehicles by explicitly considering their driving styles to facilitate the integrated network to achieve scene-consistent multimodal trajectory prediction and candidate trajectory generation. Second, based on the generated trajectories for the SDV and the predicted trajectories for the other HDVs, each candidate planning trajectory is evaluated via a safety-balanced value function. After that, the trajectory with the highest value is selected for implementation. Such a method plans a safe and efficient driving trajectory in complex and uncertain scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the designed method as well as the robustness and reasonableness of the SDVs&#39; maneuver decisions at an intersection considering the behavioral dynamics of HDVs.},

  abstract     = {3D point-cloud upsampling, a crucial perceptual module to help us understand the complex scene and object, aims to generate a high-resolution point cloud given a sparse point set. While considerable attention has been paid to single object point-cloud upsampling, literature on upsampling complex scenes has emerged slowly. Remarkably, few related works target LiDAR-based point clouds, which inherently have a density imbalance problem over distance. This paper proposed LiUpNet, a LiDAR-based point cloud upsampling network. Given a sparse and imbalanced point cloud of a natural and complex scene, LiUpNet extracts robust regional features and generates a uniformly distributed dense point cloud that preserves the fine-grained structural architecture. Specifically, in LiUpNet, an attentive and transformer-based feature extractor is applied to learn the detailed regional representation to model the underlying complex local structure. Also, a novel density-invariant feature consistency loss is introduced to improve the robustness of the learned features against the sparsity changes. Finally, given the regional representations, we append a manifold-based upsampler to super-resolve the regional point clouds up to different scales according to the sparsity and implicitly regresses non-linear 3D scene surfaces. A more uniformly distributed and denser scene point cloud is then achieved with the scheme of dynamic regional upsampling rates. The experimental results on single-object and scene point-cloud upsampling show that LiUpNet outperforms related works qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, we demonstrate that the enhanced scene point clouds can efficiently improve the performance of downstream tasks such as point-cloud-based 3D object detection and depth completion.},

To evaluate CACC, simulation plays a key role. However, conventional simulation platforms focus more on highway scenes but less on urban scenes. Hence, this paper proposes a CACC simulation platform for urban scenes. The platform bears the following features: i) able to plug in production Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) control systems; ii) able to capture the interaction between Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) and CAVs; iii) able to evaluate CACC with regard to various traffic control; iv) capable of quantifying CACC safety in urban scenes; v) capable of assessing the impact of CACC on mobility in urban scenes. The platform is validated by comparing against actual field tests and previously published theoretical studies. Its credibility is confirmed in terms of free flow CACC, interrupted CACC flow and free flow Partially Connected and Automated Traffic (PCAT). Through the proposed platform, evaluations on CACC safety and mobility are conducted. The results reveal that current CACC technology requires significant enhancement, since CACC technology may interrupt the traffic in urban areas due to platoon splitting, interaction with lane-changing vehicles, etc. Rushing the deployment of current CACC technology in urban areas is probably not a good idea.},

  abstract     = {The traffic environment and driving behaviors are of great complexity and uncertainty in our physical world. Therefore, training in the digital world with low cost and diverse complexities become popular for autonomous driving in recent years. However, the current training methods tend to be limited to static data sets and deterministic models that do not sufficiently take into account the uncertainty and diversity prevalent in real traffic scenarios. These approaches also limit more possibilities for the comprehensive development and optimization of vision systems. In this paper, we develop a parallel training method based on artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) for the intelligent optimization and learning of the aforementioned agents in uncertain driving spaces. Parallel training creates a virtual driving space following the instruction of the ACP approach and conducts large-scale rehearsal experiments for possible scenarios. By enhancing the diversity of virtual scenarios, intelligent vehicles are trained to respond and adapt to the diverse uncertainties in the physical real-world driving space. Specifically, parallel training first proposes a standard operating procedure for intelligent driving systems, namely the projection-emergence-convergence-operation (PECO) loop. Digital quadruplets for parallel training, i.e., physical, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive coaches, are also proposed. With the guidance of parallel training, virtual and real-world driving spaces are set up in parallel and interact frequently. They are closely linked and unified in opposition to each other, ultimately building a parallel driving system that fulfills safety, security, sustainability, sensitivity, service, and smartness (6S).},

First, in the realization of the dynamic control policy, we integrate the current state and the previous action to construct the augmented state as well as the augmented Markov decision process. Meanwhile, it is shown theoretically that the goal of the developed dynamic control policy is to learn the variation rate of the action. The augmented state contains information of the current state and the previous action, which enables the developed ETDQN to directly design the immediate reward considering communication loss. Then, based on dueling double deep Q-network (dueling DDQN), we establish the augmented action-value, value, and advantage functions to directly learn the optimal event-triggered decision-making policy of autonomous driving without an explicit triggering condition. It is worth noticing that the developed ETDQN applies to various deep Q-networks (DQNs).

  abstract     = {Computation offloading is considered as a promising method to improve computation performance of Intelligent Vehicles (IVs), where IVs can offload resource-hungry applications to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers. However, due to the dynamic environment of Intelligent Transportation Systems, it&#39;s challenging to develop an effective offloading scheme that ensures stable operation of the system. Furthermore, IVs only offload tasks to MEC servers or parked vehicles, how to take full advantage of resources in a random traffic flow is a main challenge. In this paper, we propose a vehicular-cloud-assisted MEC network in urban cities to fully explore the idle resources and ensure the stability of task queue. Specifically, we develop a novel virtual platform based on deep neural network that predicts vehicles trajectory and creates vehicular cloud to integrate computation resources. We then design a vehicular-cloud-assisted offloading scheme that aims to maximize task throughput in continuous time slots subject to multi-constraint. To address the coupling among multiple variables and different time slots, we put forward a lightweight framework to apply the Lyapunov optimization in combination with deep reinforcement learning. In particular, we apply Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty approach to decompose the initial problem into per-slot subproblems and control the long-term task queue stability. To further reduce the computation complexity, we decouple the subproblem into three processes, and the deep Q-network is put forward to solve it. Extensive simulations demonstrate that under different task arrivals, our proposed scheme can achieve the task queue stability within 10 time slots with a low transmission power.},

  abstract     = {Real-time digital twin technology can enhance traffic safety of intelligent vehicular system and provide scientific strategies for intelligent traffic management. At the same time, real-time digital twin depends on strong computation from vehicle side to cloud side. Aiming at the problem of delay caused by the dual dependency of timing and data between computation tasks, and the problem of unbalanced load of mobile edge computing servers, a parallel intelligence-driven resource scheduling scheme for computation tasks with dual dependencies of timing and data in the intelligent vehicular systems (IVS) is proposed. First, the delay and energy consumption models of each computing platform are formulated by considering the dual dependence of sub-tasks. Then, based on the bidding idea of the auction algorithm, the allocation model of computing resources and communication resources is defined, and the load balance model of the mobile edge computing (MEC) server cluster is formulated according to the load status of each MEC server. Secondly, joint optimization problem for offloading, resource allocation, and load balance is formulated. Finally, an adaptive particle swarm with genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the total cost of the system while satisfying the maximum tolerable delay, and effectively improve the load balance of the edge server cluster.},

  abstract     = {High-performance path tracking is a key technology for autonomous vehicles. Feedforward-feedback control architectures are suitable for accurate path tracking with adequate margins of stability. For system modelling in the feedforward component, the learning-based method has been proven to be a promising approach owing to its model-free framework. However, the offline-learned data model trained with collection data is confined by its feature space, resulting in insufficient generalization. As a solution, in this study, we introduce an online learning network – the recurrent high-order neural network (RHONN) – to characterize vehicle behaviors. The RHONN is used to feature vehicle behaviors in a timely manner with a high fidelity and flexible form. The equilibrium at the preview point on the desired path is found based on the online-identified RHONN model, and its induced steering angle is taken as the feedforward command. For the feedback steering controller, the preview point position-based control law incorporating the steady vehicle sideslip angle is adopted to enhance the stability performance. Finally, in the CarSim/Simulink environment, the performance of the designed RHONN-informed feedforward and feedback controller is validated in two typical scenarios – double-lane change and single-turn. The validation results reveal that the proposed approach offers better tracking accuracy in linear and nonlinear regions than other techniques. More notably, the average execution time (3.55 ms) is less than the sampling frequency of the controller (50 ms), which further confirms the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {A major role of automated vehicles is that vehicles serve as mobile sensors for event detection and data collection, which support tactical automation in autonomous driving and post-analysis for traffic safety. However, most data collected during regular operations of vehicles are not of interest, while it costs a large amount of computation, communication, and storage resources on the cloud servers. Vehicular edge computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to balance these high costs in traditional cloud computing. But edge computers often have limited resources to support the high efficiency and intelligence of advanced vehicular functions. Motivated by the existing challenges and new concepts, this paper proposes and tests a lightweight edge intelligence framework for vehicle event detection and logging that runs in an event-based and real-time manner. Specifically, this paper takes vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-pedestrian near-crashes as the events of interest. The lightweight algorithm design of modeling the bounding boxes in object detection/tracking enables real-time edge intelligence onboard a vehicle; The event-based data logging mechanism eliminates redundant data onboard and integrates multi-source information for individual near-crash events. Comprehensive open-road tests on four transit vehicles have been conducted.},

Combining Mixed Reality with Digital Twin, mixedDT integrates the virtual and physical spaces into a mixed one, where physical entities coexist and interact with virtual entities via their digital counterparts. Under the framework of mixedDT, MCCT contains three major experimental platforms in the physical, virtual and mixed spaces respectively, and provides a unified access for various human-machine interfaces and external devices such as driving simulators. A cloud unit, where the mixed experimental platform is deployed, is responsible for fusing multi-platform information and assigning control instructions, contributing to synchronous operation and real-time cross-platform interaction. Particularly, MCCT allows for multi-vehicle coordination composed of different multi-source vehicles (e.g., physical vehicles, virtual vehicles and human-driven vehicles). Validations on vehicle platooning demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of MCCT.},

Specifically, we train the Encoder to study the basic driving logic of the control sequences collected during free-drive tests by human drivers, forming a low-dimension latent feature space. Then, we sample from specified regions in the latent feature space and use the Decoder to generate new control sequences. Finally, we use the sequences as the control input of the 27-DoF high-precision vehicle dynamic simulation platform and analyze the variations of simulated vehicle dynamics. We conduct different experiments and validate the method from different aspects.

  abstract     = {Advances in Single-vehicle intelligence of automated driving has encountered great challenges because of limited capabilities in perception and interaction with complex traffic environments. Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) has been considered a pivotal solution to next-generation automated driving and smart transportation. Though CDA has attracted much attention from both academia and industry, exploration of its potential is still in its infancy. In industry, companies tend to build their in-house data collection pipeline and research tools to tailor their needs and protect intellectual properties. Reinventing the wheels, however, wastes resources and limits the generalizability of the developed approaches since no standardized benchmarks exist. On the other hand, in academia, due to the absence of real-world traffic data and computation resources, researchers often investigate CDA topics in simplified and mostly simulated environments, restricting the possibility of scaling the research outputs to real-world scenarios. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish an open-source ecosystem (OSE) to address the demands of different communities for CDA research, particularly in the early exploratory research stages, and provide the bridge to ensure an integrated development and testing pipeline that diverse communities can share. In this paper, we introduce the OpenCDA research ecosystem, a unified OSE integrated with a model zoo, a suite of driving simulators at various resolutions, large-scale real-world and simulated datasets, complete development toolkits for benchmark training/testing, and a scenario database/generator. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of OpenCDA OSE through example use cases, including cooperative 3D LiDAR detection, cooperative merge, cooperative camera-based map prediction, and adversarial scenario generation.},

The heterogeneous car-following (CF) behavior of HDVs can degrade the control performance of CAVs and introduce inefficiencies in CAV operations. To address these challenges, it is necessary to comprehend HDV CF behavior in mixed-flow traffic. This driving simulator-based study investigates HDV CF behavior in mixed-flow traffic under three different CAV control settings (string-stable, string-unstable, and HDV-like). The effects of traffic congestion level and demographic characteristics on CF behavior are also considered. Statistical analysis and CF model calibration, based on trajectory data collected from 72 participants in driving simulator experiments, are performed to examine the impacts of these factors on string stability, traffic efficiency, and safety. Then, online parameter estimation is conducted to illustrate the time-varying desired time headway, and sensitivity to spacing and speed variations (i.e., CF behavior evolution). Additionally, analysis of post-experiment interview results and eye-tracking data show that the string-stable CAV control setting is preferred by most HDV drivers, but can trigger driver distraction. The results also provide insights for CF behavior prediction and the optimal mixed platoon formation to enhance CAV benefits for traffic flow.},

One promising technique is Cooperative Perception, which leverages Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to share deep learning-based features among vehicles. However, most cooperative perception algorithms assume ideal communication and do not consider the impact of Lossy Communication (LC), which is very common in the real world, on feature sharing. In this paper, we explore the effects of LC on Cooperative Perception and propose a novel approach to mitigate these effects. Our approach includes an LC-aware Repair Network (LCRN) and a V2V Attention Module (V2VAM) with intra-vehicle attention and uncertainty-aware inter-vehicle attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the public OPV2V dataset (a digital-twin simulated dataset) using point cloud-based 3D object detection. Our results show that our approach improves detection performance under lossy V2V communication. Specifically, our proposed method achieves a significant improvement in Average Precision compared to the state-of-the-art cooperative perception algorithms, which proves the capability of our approach to effectively mitigate the negative impact of LC and enhance the interaction between the ego vehicle and other vehicles.},

  abstract     = {The driving conditions of urban consecutive signalized intersections are one of the main research scenarios for vehicle speed trajectory optimization, and typical for bus driving, where frequent acceleration and deceleration before and after the intersection can intensify the energy consumption of the bus. Prior research has predictive cruise controlled under Intelligent Transportation System, which is not feasible to directly communicate with controllers’ units of Intelligent Connected Vehicles. Besides, the effect of queue dissipation is a topic that has received less attention in recent related work. Therefore, this paper proposes a vehicle-cloud hierarchical architecture based on Cloud Control System at first, under which a predictive cruise control for urban buses is deployed. Given the impact of intersection queue length and dissipation time on vehicle driving, a queue dissipation time estimation model based on shockwave theory is proposed to predict changes in intersection traffic state. The queue dissipation time equivalent to the extension of the red-light window is reflected in the constraints of the Receding Distance Horizon Dynamic Programming (RDHDP) algorithm for solving the optimal control problem. Eventually, comparison simulations, a segment of realistic trip between adjacent stops, are presented. The results show that the proposed method saves 44.94%–56.74% of energy consumption and at least 26.8s of waiting time compared to human drivers, and 22.72%–41.27% of energy consumption compared to vehicle with the Intelligent Vehicle Infrastructure Cooperative Systems.},

We also compare Q-learning with NMPC and PID assistance and show that NMPC has 114% higher mean reward.

Past movements are represented by 3D poses reflecting the posture and movements of individual body parts. The surrounding environment is modeled in the form of semantic maps showing, e.g., the course of streets, sidewalks, and the occurrence of obstacles. Forecasts are generated in grids discretizing the space and in the form of arbitrary discrete probability distributions. The distributions are evaluated for their reliability, sharpness, and positional accuracy. We compare our method with two approaches providing forecasts in the form of continuous probability distributions, and we discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages. We thereby investigate the impact of poses and semantic maps. Using a technique we refer to as spatial label smoothing, our approach is able to achieve reliable forecasts. Overall, the 3D poses have a positive impact on the forecasts. The semantic maps facilitate the adaptation of the probability distributions to the individual situation and prevent forecasts of trajectories leading through obstacles. Our method is evaluated on a dataset recorded in inner-city traffic using a research vehicle. The dataset has been made publicly available.},

However, the evaluation of such models is commonly oversimplistic, ignoring the asymmetric importance of prediction errors and the heterogeneity of the datasets used for testing. We examine the potential of recasting interactions between vehicles as gap acceptance scenarios and evaluating models in this structured environment. To that end, we develop a framework aiming to facilitate the evaluation of any model, by any metric, and in any scenario. We then apply this framework to state-of-the-art prediction models, which all show themselves to be unreliable in the most safety-critical situations.},

  abstract     = {Connected and autonomous vehicles are expected to revolutionize transportation systems in the near future. Nevertheless, full autonomy still requires further development that will only be achieved through a high level of cooperation and coordination among vehicles. For the safe execution of several autonomous functions, vehicles will need to frequently communicate their current location to the Road Side Units (RSUs). However, due to information aging, it is expected that the delays from the time a message is generated until the location of the vehicle is updated will induce a tracking error. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the frequency of location updates and tracking error. Further, in order to reduce the queue-induced delays present in the system, the number of messages can be reduced by employing an event-triggered communication scheme. In this work, a family of optimization problems is proposed, utilizing the event-triggered algorithm, in order to determine the optimal triggering threshold. Both single and multiple RSU cases are considered in several simulation scenarios, demonstrating that the proposed optimization framework derives the optimal tracking accuracy. In the case of multiple RSUs, results are further optimized by assigning roads (and in turn vehicles) to RSUs if coverage areas of multiple RSUs overlap.},

Specifically, the HDDC includes the path tracking layer, vehicle motion control layer, and actuator regulating layer. The first layer is designed to achieve accurate path tracking and generate the desired states, and it is algorithmically adaptable and confirmed by MPC and LQR. The second layer is proposed to integrate drifting and typical cornering control by the dynamic drifting inverse model. The third layer can achieve the steering system and wheel speed control to satisfy corresponding commands. Ultimately, the real-time performance of the controller is verified by the ECU hardware-in-the-loop platform. The results with MPC-HDDC and LQR-HDDC show that the HDDC can achieve integrated control of drifting and typical cornering maneuvers and possess high tracking accuracy.},

Then, a cooperative voltage tracking control strategy for EV energy storage units is developed to realize the accurate voltage tracking control, and a second-order sliding mode differentiator is designed to estimate the derivative of the virtual control law. Besides, the unknown part of the model is approximated by the fuzzy logic system, and the neighborhood synchronization error is upper-bounded by the prescribed performance control. The integrated cooperative control strategy designed is completely distributed. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed integrated cooperative control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Motion planning algorithms for urban automated driving must handle uncertainty due to unknown intention and future motion of Dynamic Obstacles (DOs). Considering a single future trajectory for each DO is not adequate, especially in urban frameworks where traffic participants exhibit very different behaviors. However, including multiple candidate trajectories representing different behaviors results in an excess of conservatism. We present a novel combination of the Interactive Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm and Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) that allows non-conservative safe motion planning in presence of DOs with unknown intention. We introduce a framework based on LQR and IMM to predict multiple candidate future trajectories, each interpreted as a high-level intention that the DO is pursuing, and dynamically estimate their probabilities. Then, the future trajectory of the automated vehicle is iteratively planned in an SMPC fashion, in which collision avoidance constraints are generated for multiple future trajectories of each DO, with a focus on the most likely. Our method improves safe motion planning fully exploiting the benefits of multi-modal predictions of the DOs, avoiding excessive conservatism. Advantages of the proposed method are discussed through simulations in the CARLA environment.},

However, there are still many challenges to be solved, and handling crowded roundabouts is one of them. This kind of scenario requires both safe and efficient maneuvers from the autonomous driving systems in order to maintain a proper traffic flow. This work presents a strategy to generate different speed profiles for a set of path candidates in order to obtain a merging maneuver according to current traffic scene. The proposed mechanism relies on the use of fictitious accelerations generated by leader and lag vehicles, incorporating by design comfort and safety bounds. The autonomous driving system proposed in this work was tested on realistic driving scenarios collected from public datasets and its performance was compared to human drivers on the same scenarios. The results showed in a variety of situations that the automated vehicle was capable of merging into roundabouts with tight merging gaps while maintaining both comfort and safety constraints.},

  abstract     = {Most of the current self-driving cars are equipped with a variety of sensors (such as lidar, camera), and it has become a trend to integrate multi-sensor information to achieve 3D multi-object tracking (MOT). In addition, unlike the perfect experimental conditions on public datasets, cars on real roads may experience a 3D sensor failure due to weather, mutual interference, etc. In this paper, we propose a dual-tracker-based 3D MOT system, which fuses 2D and 3D information to track objects and can still ensure good tracking accuracy when the 3D sensor fails in a single frame or multiple consecutive frames. Among them, two internal trackers complete the data association of 3D and 2D information, respectively. However, the outputs of the two internal trackers may conflict. First, we calculate the degree of association of potential matched pairs from the features extracted by each sensor, and then normalize it into the mass function of D-S evidence theory. Finally, we combine the evidence to obtain the final matched pairs of detection instances and track estimates. We do extensive experiments on the KITTI MOT dataset and simulate sensor failure scenarios by ignoring the output of the 3D detector. Using the latest evaluation measure for comparison, the results show that our method outperforms other advanced open-source 3D MOTs in a variety of scenarios.},

The obtained trajectory homotopy guarantees obstacle avoidance and motion stability at the same time. To handle the non-cooperative and dynamic obstacle avoidance, a trajectory elliptical homotopy decomposition (TEHD) algorithm is proposed with an FTSA constraint.

State-dependent constraints on control inputs are considered to ensure that the vehicle moves within the road boundaries and to prevent collisions. An objective function, comprising various weighted sub-objectives, is designed, whose minimization leads to vehicle advancement at the desired speed, when possible, while avoiding obstacles. A nonlinear optimal control problem (OCP) is formulated for the minimization of the objective function subject to constraints for each vehicle. A computationally efficient Feasible Direction Algorithm (FDA) is called, on event-triggered basis, to compute in real-time the numerical solution for finite time-horizons within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The approach is applied to each vehicle on the road, while running simulations on a lane-free ring-road, for a wide range of vehicle densities and different types of vehicles. From the simulations, which create myriads of driving episodes for each involved vehicle, it is observed that the proposed approach is highly efficient in delivering safe, comfortable and efficient vehicle trajectories, as well as high traffic flow outcomes. The approach is under investigation for further use in various lane-free road infrastructures for CAV traffic.},

However, the new generations of wireless communication networks (WCNs), such as quasi-optic millimeter-wave (mmWave) (5G) and visible light optic (6G) WCNs, are exposed to blockage/scattering problems in highly dense (urban) areas. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-equipped (unmanned aerial vehicle) UAV (RISeUAV) to secure an uninterrupted line-of-sight (LoS) communication link for an intelligent vehicle. The vehicle can be a smart ambulance and needs a stable high-speed link for autonomous navigation, also for continuous monitoring/diagnosing of the health condition of a patient. A two-stage method is proposed to address the NP-hardness and nonconvexity of planning an optimal trajectory for autonomous navigation of the RISeUAV limited to UAV motion and LoS constraints. In the first stage, the optimal tube path is determined by considering the energy consumption, LoS link, and UAV speed/acceleration constraints. In the second stage, an accurate RISeUAV trajectory is obtained through the secured tube path by considering the communication performance, passive beamforming, and nonholonomic constraint of the RISeUAV. Dynamic programming and successive convex approximation methods are used in the first and second stages, respectively. Simulation results show the accuracy/effectiveness of the method.},

Deep-networks-based visual systems achieve state-of-the-art performance, but they are usually cumbersome and computationally infeasible for embedded devices (e.g., dash cams). Knowledge distillation is an effective way to derive more efficient models. However, most existing works target classification tasks and treat all instances equally. In this paper, we first present our Adaptive Instance Distillation (AID) method for self-driving visual detection. It can selectively impart the teacher&#39;s knowledge to the student by re-weighing each instance and each scale for distillation based on the teacher&#39;s loss. In addition, to enable the student to effectively digest knowledge from multiple sources, we also propose a Multi-Teacher Adaptive Instance Distillation (M-AID) method. Our M-AID helps the student to learn the best knowledge from each teacher w.r.t. certain instances and scales. Unlike previous KD methods, our M-AID adjusts the distillation weights in an instance, scale, and teacher adaptive manner. Experiments on the KITTI, COCO-Traffic, and SODA10 M datasets show that our methods improve the performance of a wide variety of state-of-the-art KD methods on different detectors in self-driving scenarios. Compared to the baseline, our AID leads to an average of 2.28% and 2.98% mAP increases for single-stage and two-stage detectors, respectively. By strategically integrating knowledge from multiple teachers, our M-AID method achieves an average of 2.92% mAP improvement.},

Firstly, a new type of robust control barrier function (CBF) condition for collision-avoidance is derived for the uncertain AVs by incorporating the estimation of the system uncertainty with Gaussian process (GP) regression. Then, a robust CBF-based RL control structure is proposed, where the nominal control input is composed of the RL policy and a model-based reference control policy. The actual control input obtained from the quadratic programming problem can satisfy the constraints of collision-avoidance, input saturation and velocity boundedness simultaneously with a relatively high probability. Finally, within this control structure, a Dyna-style safe model-based RL algorithm is proposed, where the safe exploration is achieved through executing the robust CBF-based actions and the sample efficiency is improved by leveraging the GP models. The superior learning performance of the proposed RL control structure is demonstrated through simulation experiments.},

To enhance the autonomy of UUV collision avoidance and improve its adaptability to unstable forward-looking sonar observation and uncertain environments, we propose a novel Transformer-based Dual-Channel Self-attention (TDCS) architecture for UUV collision avoidance. TDCS is a network architecture composed of two encoders and a decoder, which integrates dynamic/static obstacle recognition, obstacle motion prediction, collision risk assessment, and collision avoidance decision. The two encoders extract the observation features of different sensors in parallel, and this dual-channel structure avoids the mutual interference of input information. Moreover, the two encoders are beneficial for adaptive learning to focus on sensor information with varying forms of representation. The fusion layer integrates the bimodal features extracted from different sensors by the dual-channel encoder. Finally, the fusion features and historical decisions are recombined through the decoder to form a new decision.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss the resilient formation tracking control problem of multiple unmanned vehicles (MUV). A dynamic leader-follower distributed control structure is utilized to optimize the performance of the formation tracking. For the follower of the MUV, the leader is a cooperative unmanned vehicle, and the target of formation tracking is a non-cooperative unmanned vehicle with a nonlinear trajectory. Therefore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) observer is designed to estimate the state of the target. Then the leader of the MUV is adjusted dynamically according to the state of the target. In order to describe the interactions between the follower and dynamic leader, a Stackelberg game model is constructed to handle the hierarchical decision problems. At the lower layer, each follower responds by observing the leader&#39;s strategy, and the potential game is used to prove a Nash equilibrium among all followers. At the upper layer, the dynamic leader makes decisions depending on the response of all followers to reaching the Stackelberg equilibrium. Moreover, the Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium of the designed game theoretical model is proven. A novel reinforcement learning-based algorithm is designed to achieve the Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium of the game. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by a variety of formation tracking simulation experiments.},

  abstract     = {Crack detection mostly benefits from the rapid development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, the improvement of crack detection performance comes from the deeper and wider network structure, which requires heavier computation and storage overhead. This prevents crack detection methods from being deployed on practical platforms, especially mobile devices. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Split Exchange Convolution (SEConv) modules, which splits the feature maps into high resolution and low resolution parts and then filters out the redundant information of each part. SEConv exchanges the feature information between the two modules to make the feature efficient reuse. Besides, we design a Multi-Scale Feature Exchange (MSFE) module to promote the cross stage features fusion. Benefiting from the SEConv and the MSFE modules, we build an extremely lightweight crack detection model with only 1.3 M parameters and 8 G FLOPs while achieving comparable performance. Extensive experimental results on the crack detection benchmark show that our method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in the evaluation metrics of F1-score and MIoU .},

Specially, in some circumstances like autonomous driving in surface mine, there is a fact that the particularity of scene brings tremendous challenges for object detection with a series of problems caused by the multi-scale and camouflaged objects. In this paper, a multi-scale feature fusion and attention based multi-branches framework was proposed to improve the performance of object detection for above problems called MSFANet.

The policy provides agile and dynamically adjusted gap-traversing actions for the quadrotor in real-time by directly mapping the observed states of the quadrotor and gaps to motor thrusts. In contrast to existing optimization-based methods, our RL-based policy couples trajectory planning and control modules, which are strictly independent and computationally complex in previous works. Moreover, a safety-aware exploration is presented to reduce the collision risk and improve the safety of the policy, which also facilitates the transfer of the policy to real-world environments. Specifically, we formulate a safety reward on the state spaces of both position and orientation to inspire the quadrotor to traverse through the narrow gap at an appropriate attitude closer to the center of the gap. With the learned gap-traversing policy, we implement extensive simulations and real-world experiments to evaluate its performance and compare it with the related approaches. Our implementation includes several gap-traversing tasks with random positions and orientations, even if never trained specially before. All the performances indicate that our RL-based gap-traversing policy is transferable and more efficient in terms of real-time dynamic response, agility, time-consuming, and generalization.},

  abstract     = {Effective and friendly human-machine cooperative driving is considered as a feasible solution to filling the gap between assisted driving and highly automated driving. This paper proposes an indirect shared control strategy, in both longitudinal and lateral directions, for safe cooperative driving on curvy roads, which often pose hazards in real-world driving. At the tactical decision level of the proposed strategy, driving authorities are dynamically allocated between human and machine based on the risk assessed with a data-driven gaussian processes regression (GPR) model, which is trained to generate dynamic safety envelopes of longitudinal and lateral control commands, namely vehicle speed and front wheel steering angle, from observed road conditions and vehicle states. At the maneuver execution level, a multi-objective hierarchical MPC controller is built to combine human-machine control commands smoothly for collision-free driving while simultaneously maintaining vehicle stability and mitigating human-machine conflicts. Both matching the driver&#39;s commands and tracking the reference trajectories are formulated into objectives of the optimization-based controller. The weight factor of each objective is adjusted according to the authorities allocated at the decision level. The results of experiments conducted on a 3 degree of freedom motion-base driving simulator show that the proposed strategy accomplishes effective and friendly cooperative driving on curvy roads. It&#39;s also verified that the proposed strategy is adaptable to unseen scenarios, mainly owing to the superiority of the GPR-based risk assessment model, driven by class-balanced training data, in modeling the nonlinearity and uncertainty of driving risks.},

Specifically, the multi-frame monocular depth estimation achieves promising results in virtue of temporal information. However, existing multi-frame solutions ignore the different impacts of pixels of input frame on depth estimation and the geometric information is still insufficiently explored. In this paper, a self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework with geometric prior and pixel-level sensitivity is proposed. Geometric constraint is involved through a geometric pose estimator with prior depth predictor and optical flow predictor. Further, an alternative learning strategy is designed to improve the learning of prior depth predictor by decoupling it with the ego-motion from the geometric pose estimator. On this basis, prior feature consistency regularization is introduced into the depth encoder. By taking the dense prior cost volume based on optical flow map and ego-motion as the supervising signal for feature consistency learning, the cost volume is obtained with more reasonable feature matching. To deal with the pixel-level difference of sensitivity in input frame, a sensitivity-adaptive depth decoder is built by flexibly adding a shorter path from cost volume to the final depth prediction. In this way, the back propagation of gradient to cost volume is adaptively adjusted, and an accurate depth map is decoded. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on public datasets.},

The excessively complex anomaly detection approaches cannot accommodate the constraints on the inference time of intelligent vehicles. Inspired by the fact that humans have a natural instinct to be curious about unknown objects in a new environment, we propose a novel curiosity-driven attention mechanism (CuDAM) for anomaly road obstacles segmentation. CuDAM adopts the attention map as a new uncertainty judging criterion and utilizes it to improve the efficiency of the model. Specifically, CuDAM is composed of three parts: 1) an attention module for generating an attention map; 2) a reward mechanism for encouraging the network to focus its attention on uncertain regions; 3) an attention loss function for widening the distance between the attention values of deterministic and uncertain pixels. Different from previous approaches, CuDAM can improve both anomaly detection and semantic segmentation performance without complex operations and training, which makes it widely applicable to existing semantic segmentation models. The result of qualitative and quantitative experiments shows that such a straightforward approach achieves consistent significant improvements in anomaly detection performances with the various uncertainty estimation methods, demonstrating the broad applicability of CuDAM.},

In this paper, a coupling multi-objective iterative distributed model predictive control (CMOI-DMPC) approach is proposed to address the above difficulties. The proposed CMOI-DMPC approach consists of two steps. The first step is to build a linearized cross-coupled instantaneous centers of rotation (ICR) kinematics model of the UTV to address the strongly nonlinear constraints. The second step is to design a multi-objective iterative optimization DMPC strategy to solve the problems of time-consuming computation and low tracking accuracy. Moreover, the sufficient condition on ensuring closed-loop stability is demonstrated by Lyapunov theorem. The proposed CMOI-DMPC approach is also applied to solve an optimal FTTC problem of UTVs in near-natural simulation environment and real vehicle environment, which validates the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed CMOI-DMPC approach.},

There exists a conflict between the overall objective of the swarm and own parameterized individual tasks of each ISV, resulting in a noncooperative game. A distributed cooperative maneuvering control method is proposed for multiple ISVs. Specifically, at first, action estimators are designed for each ISV based on the information of neighboring ISVs to estimate the actions of other ISVs. Then, an accelerated learning-based neural predictor is designed, where an echo state network is introduced as the identifier of uncertain nonlinearities, and adaptation laws are developed based on a high-order tuner to accelerate the convergence rate. Finally, controllers and update laws of individual variables are designed for multiple ISVs based on a distributed Nash equilibrium seeking approach, where the time derivative of the kinematic control law is obtained based on a nonlinear command filter. The control architecture is modular, leading to a decoupling of an action estimator module, a neural predictor module, and a controller module. Using the cascade system theory, the input-to-state stability of the resulting closed-loop system is guaranteed based on the input-to-state stability of three subsystems.

  abstract     = {With the development of intelligent vehicle technology, pedestrian trajectory prediction techniques play a key role in collision avoidance systems. Activity regions are commonly adopted to cover the uncertainty of predicted trajectories. However, setting a rational region size for each pedestrian is a challenging issue. Excessive region size may lead to over-reactions of vehicles and limit the degree of freedom of the path planning while insufficient region size may fail to cover the uncertainty. This work proposes a novel dynamic activity region (DAR) prediction algorithm and a relevant collision risk evaluation method. In the prediction module, the proposed method predicts a rational activity region for each pedestrian based on the historical trajectory in contrast to the conventional methods which adopt preset static activity regions (SAR) for all pedestrians. The comparative study shows that the proposed method reduces the sizes of pedestrian activity regions by 10.5% on average with similar precision. In the cases where the trajectory is highly nonlinear, the region size reduction can reach 12.1%. In the collision risk evaluation module, the risk statuses of pedestrians are classified based on the relationship between their DARs and the future trajectory of the vehicle. This method can produce a more detailed classification. The effectiveness and improvement of the proposed method are validated by experiments and simulations.},

  abstract     = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) play a vital role in transforming human mobility, tackling road congestion and road safety. However, CAVs rely heavily on the security, accuracy, and stability of sensor readings and network data. Abnormal sensor readings caused by malicious cyberattacks or faulty car sensors can have devastating consequences, possibly even lead to a fatal crash. In order to avoid the CAVs data anomalies caused by network attacks or data failures, we propose a Wavelet Kernel Network with Omni-Scale Convolutional (WKN-OC) for anomaly detection in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which can select the optimal scale adaptively and processes high-frequency signals better. The proposed method pays more attention to the high-frequency components of input data, and fully extracts valuable features through the feature extraction framework, so that the model has strong anomaly detection performance. We verify the reliability of the WKN-OC method on the Safe Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) data set. It is shown that the proposed WKN-OC model has good detection performance for various anomaly data, especially in the mixed anomaly experiment. We have achieved 96.78% average accuracy in mixed anomaly experiments and 96.13% accuracy in multi anomaly experiments. The results show that the model has strong generalization performance for the anomaly detection problem faced by the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) and can identify the unknown anomalies in reality well.},

A more critical issue is the use of limited observable neighboring vehicles to achieve reliable trajectory prediction. Motivated by it, this paper studies the trajectory prediction for cut-in maneuvers from ego-vehicle&#39;s-view. An interaction-aware model is developed for long-term prediction based on the attention mechanism, where both the encoder and the social interactor are implemented through multi-head attentions and feed forward layers. First, an attention-based trajectory encoder module with temporal embedding is presented to extract hidden features from historical observations. Then another attention-based module is constructed to characterize social interactions between the target vehicle and its neighbors. In the interactor, a novel social mask layer is designed to improve prediction performance in different scenarios, especially for discretionary cut-in maneuvers. Experimental comparison with the state-of-the-art models on public dataset demonstrates the excellent performance of our proposed model on cut-in trajectory prediction. In addition, ablation studies are conducted to highlight the strengths of the main modules in our model.},

Second, based on the desired heading angle design, dynamic surface control is introduced, which reduces the computational complexity, and the desired speed can be obtained. A compensation filter is used to compensate for the loss caused by the input saturation of the control signal. Third, novel velocity compensation laws are designed to compensate the sway velocity, which can overcome the challenge of underactuation. Moreover, the parameter uncertainty issue, which widely exists in most engineering systems, can also be handled by the novel velocity compensation laws.

  abstract     = {In the open scene of auto-docking for wireless charging, vehicle needs to approach the station with the capability of real-time path planning to achieve the time efficiency, and to stop with a certain posture to guarantee high charging efficiency. The prominent challenge arises from the coupled problem of dynamic obstacle avoidance and precise targeting posture control. To simultaneously address these two issues, this paper takes into considerations of vehicle jerk and targeting posture constrains, and proposes a generic real-time planning and tracking control method for the wireless charged nonholonomic autonomous vehicle. First, a kinematic and dynamic model for nonholonomic differential-drive vehicle is built as the foundation of the planning and tracking control. Then, a real-time layered planner consisting of a path planning and a trajectory planning stage is designed to generate reference trajectory, which encompasses jerk constraints and vehicle dynamics to ensure the global time and energy efficiency in an intermittent acceleration and deceleration scenario. Finally, a fast nonlinear model predictive control (FNMPC) algorithm is established to realize high precision trajectory tracking during the dynamic obstacle avoidance. Numerical experimentation shows that the proposed method achieves a straightforward, less than 3 cm docking error posture under a given autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) configuration, and outperforms general-purpose simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) planning and control algorithms for dynamic obstacle avoidance. The results show that the proposed method is feasible for the general efficiency-aware applications of vehicle auto docking in the wireless charging station.},

This paper systematically investigates VTPs (pedestrians, cyclists, and electric cyclists) trajectory prediction based on a fresh data-driven stacking model. Firstly, a micro-dynamic Modified Social Force Model (MSFM) is proposed, pedestrian-cyclist-electric cyclist-dynamic vehicle interactions, the effect of zebra crossing and pedestrian heterogeneity (age and gender) are taken into account. Then an Attention-Long Short Term Memory Network (AN-LSTM) is developed, AN is used to achieve the influence weights of pedestrian heterogeneity and road users. Finally, a fresh stacking model by combining the MSFM and AN-LSTM is proposed for VTPs trajectory prediction. The stacking model is evaluated with the current state-of-the-art models. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves an increased accuracy of more than 12%. Moreover, a real-time online integrated vision system which combines target detection, multi-target tracking, pedestrian heterogeneity recognition and distance measurement is developed. The proposed model is tested with the integrated vision system, and high accuracy and good real-time performance (0.030 seconds) are achieved, which can give us great confidence to use the proposed model in the autonomous vehicles for improving VTPs safety and transportation efficiency.},

The existing safety evaluation methods merely focus on the possibility of collision, which is deficient to evaluate the hazard level due to the symmetry for both the interactive vehicles. Thus, the vehicle aggressiveness model is proposed in this paper based on the asymmetric interactions between different types of vehicles from the perspective of the social cognitions in the human driving. Firstly, a new conceptual framework of the vehicle aggressiveness is constructed, and the factors are analyzed. Secondly, the general mathematic formulation of the aggressiveness is deduced elaborately based on the analogy with the mechanical wave. Thirdly, the simplified formulation is derived by introducing resonant assumption, and an illustration of aggressiveness distribution is presented and discussed. The mathematical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed model could explicitly describe the asymmetric characteristics as regards the vehicle mass, motion states and position. Finally, the potential applications in safety assessment, decision-making and motion planning of the social cognitive autonomous driving are discussed. The aggressiveness model provides a new perspective in asymmetric driving safety evaluation and heterogeneous driving behavior model under complex and mixed traffic environments.},

With this in mind, a planning-integrated active safety control system is developed for post-impact vehicles to avoid subsequent accidents. The vehicle dynamics model is established considering the roll degree of freedom. The constraint equivalent methods based on the octagon and rhombus envelopes are proposed to linearize the road adhesion constraint and the obstacle avoidance constraint, respectively. A planning-integrated model predictive controller (MPC) is developed for post-impact vehicles to achieve the coordination of stability recovery and the avoidance of secondary collision with surrounding vehicles. In the meantime, an obstacle avoidance decision strategy based on the safe braking distance is designed to cope with different traffic scenes. Furthermore, a control allocator based on particle swarm optimization is developed to achieve the high-efficiency allocation of the resultant control output of MPC under post-impact extreme conditions.

  abstract     = {Due to the rising cost of human resources in road maintenance and the pursuit of efficiency, autonomous road inspection vehicles are developed for intelligent detection of road disease to prevent severe traffic disasters in the early stages. Nevertheless, as a prevalent road disease, road cracks are diverse and susceptible to shadows, weather changes, and noise in data acquisition. Moreover, they usually appear with thin shapes that are hard to detect correctly by existing methods. To handle this problem, more details of the road cracks need to be better analyzed. In this article, we propose a refined road crack detection method named locally enhanced cross-shaped windows transformer (LECSFormer), which adopts a delicate design of the encoder-decoder structure. The encoder employs window-based transformer blocks to model long-range dependencies. Each transformer block ensembles the locally enhanced module to enrich the local contextual information, and token shuffle operation is applied to build cross-windows connections. The decoder uses dense connections to fuse multi-scale information, and the feature fusion module fuses hierarchical features and reweights them by the channel attention mechanism. The proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with ODS of 0.963, 0.917, 0.952, and 0.953 on four challenging datasets, CrackTree260, CrackLS315, Stone331, and CRKWH100.

It includes the integrated driving behavior modeling to ensure basic safety and the characteristic learning to further imitate human driver&#39;s style. Firstly, an integrated behavior model is built according to driver&#39;s operation logics, including lane advantage assessment, target lane selection and acceleration determination. The lane advantage is assessed by five lane features, like safety, efficiency, cooperativity, etc. Then, parameters of the built model are learned from human&#39;s demonstrations. For the lane selection parameter, a novel lane feature extraction method is presented and the maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is adopted to solve. For the acceleration parameter, since it&#39;s hard to extract human&#39;s acceleration features accurately, the particle filtering is used to estimate. Finally, the IMLC algorithm is validated in highD dataset compared to existing algorithms. The results show that the RMSE of position and velocity in 9s are within 4.2 m and 0.9 m/s, which has great advantage. Moreover, we test the human-like performance in driver simulator. The safety and efficiency in this process are fairly approximate.},

We first implement a motion planner using a neural network as an approximation of traditional planners. The inputs to the baseline planner include the current states of the ego and its surrounding agents and a shared map. The planner produces a five-second trajectory for the ego vehicle considering the current situation. Subsequently, we generalize the baseline to consider the historical states of the ego and its surrounding agents. Using the generalized planner, we investigate the impacts of the history horizon on planning performance. We next investigate how the future motions of the surrounding agents of the ego affect the planner and observe improvement in planning. This demonstrates that knowledge of the future trajectories of other agents is useful for planning. However, we do not have access to ground-truth future motions for inference. Finally, we investigate how the future can be approximated through prediction and how the prediction quality affects planning performance.},

In the present paper, a predictive thermal management strategy for the powertrain cooling system is developed. The aims are to minimize the energy consumption of the cooling system, to increase the efficiency of the electric motors and to operate them in a temperature area of safety and durability. The thermal management strategy is realized by a real-time capable nonlinear model predictive controller, incorporating a dynamical model for the powertrain of the battery electric vehicle under consideration. The usage of this model-based approach ensures a fast adaption of the control strategy to different vehicle architectures. Since predictions of the disturbances acting on the system are uncertain in general, the control strategy is extended by a stochastic model predictive control approach to handle uncertainties in the disturbance prediction. The effectiveness of the resulting strategies is demonstrated using an accurate simulation model. Special attention is given to the possible energy savings, the robustness with respect to uncertainties, as well as the computational effort of the algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In automated vehicles, driversare only required to input high-level control commands as opposed to lower-level commands in manually driven vehicles. The conventional driver-vehicle interfaces (DVIs) such as steering wheel and pedals that function in operational level, thus, may not be utilized in higher levels of automation. A DVI that allows the driver to input tactical-level control commands, i.e., lane change and turning, by easily understanding a situation, would be potentially required for automated vehicles. We thus propose tactical-level-interaction (TLI) for lateral and longitudinal controlling of highly automated vehicles. In this study, we developed a touchscreen-based DVI prototype that allows the driver to use simple touch gestures to input tactical control commands. The screen displays an augmented map including the ego vehicle rendered from the top view. The driver can instantly input a set of lateral commands by location-based TLI, e.g., lane changing, by designating a desired location on the map, e.g., lane, by double-tapping and swiping. Situational awareness is enhanced, for e.g., when approaching an intersection, by using visual and auditory prompts. We performed experiments using a simulator to evaluate TLI compared with the operational- (OLI, level 0) and strategical-level interaction (SLI, level 4). The results show that TLI offers both the flexibility of OLI as well as the comfort of SLI, and drivers prefer to use all three interaction methods depending on the driving environment.},

However, to date, the greater part of the existing environmental perception studies are under ordinary conditions, and the method to deal with the adverse weather conditions was ignored. Hence, this paper proposes an all-in-one gated adversarial network (AIO-GAN) to improve the performance of vision-based environment perception algorithms under adverse weather conditions, including in rain, haze, lack of light, etc. Three key technical contributions are made. At first, the deep learning based gated transformer module was proposed to classify the input mixed images to different collections by passing them through different branches. Second, the multi-branch based variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network was proposed to solve the ill-pose problem of the solution. Third, high-level weight sharing encoders was given out to guarantee the stability and the high quality of the training process. In this way, the unified clean-style images can be achieved, even if the mixed multi-modal images are transferred from the source domain of complex weather scenes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved better performance than state-of-the-arts and improved the accuracy of target detection.},

TBAS incorporates a combined trailer-tow-vehicle kinematic model, which requires an estimate of the hitch-angle. The proposed radar-based TAD model processes reflections acquired from the mmWave radars situated at the rear side of the vehicle to detect the trailer and track its orientation to the tow-vehicle. This technique is based on the tracking of individual points in the merged radars point-cloud. Each tracked point is considered as a hitch-angle estimator. Using the current and past position information of a point, the model estimates the current hitch-angle. To offer an accurate and reliable estimation for the hitch-angle, the model fuses the estimated hitch-angle by all estimators and the yaw rate of the vehicle. The model employs a Kalman filter to track each radar point, which is robust to the noisy radar measurements. In the presence of strong and persistent reflections from the trailer, the model can track the trailer successfully and return the hitch-angle with a reliability measure equal to 90%. For a less common flat trailer with inconsistent radar reflective points, the measured reliability drops to 72%. The model is implemented in real-time with an expected processing time of 4 ms per epoch.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the real time LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM) problem in unstructured environments. We propose E-LOAM (LOAM with Expanded Local Structural Information), a paradigm which expands the pre-extracted geometric information with local point cloud information around the geometric feature points. State-of-the-art approaches usually extract pointed geometric features as the only correspondence primitives for point cloud scan-to-scan and scan-to-map registration. We argue that, in unstructured environments, sometimes, the extracted geometric features are too sparse for adequate point cloud registration. Therefore, E-LOAM expands the ‘pointed’ geometric correspondence primitives with the point clouds around them, i.e., the local point clouds in the voxel around the feature point. The local point clouds, approximated by a multivariate normal distribution, offer additional local structural information, on top of the pointed geometric information. Additionally, to enrich the sparse geometric features, we make use of the intensity information of point clouds, and extract the places with high intensity variations as additional feature points. Experimental results with the KITTI dataset show the efficacy of E-LOAM, when compared with state of the arts. We further implement E-LOAM on a real robot platform, and evaluate E-LOAM with in-field tests.},

A novel reference speed generation function is proposed to automatically adjust the position of the ego vehicle before the initiation of any lateral maneuvers. After a proper gap is selected, the lateral maneuver initiation function with an add-on threshold function is introduced to ensure the safety of the maneuver and to enable the ego vehicle to automatically start or stop the lateral maneuver.

With reliance on model information, safety conditions can be expressed as Control Barrier Functions (CBF’s) and performance objectives can be expressed as Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF’s) for real-time optimization-based controllers. In this work, we use an amalgamation of model-free RL and model-based controllers to establish safety and stability. We first design CLF, CBF Quadratic Programs (QP’s) for different driving manoeuvres on nominal vehicle dynamics. Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are trained to learn policies for the actual vehicle with enhanced dynamics. In order to incorporate safety and stability while retaining optimal behaviour we selectively guide the RL agents using CLF, CBF QP’s. This results in both safe and stable (S 2 RL) policies. We empirically validate the proposed methodology on different driving manoeuvres.},

  abstract     = {Distributed-observer-based distributed control law for interconnected systems has become the research focus in recent years, owing to its broad prospects. This paper extends the objectives of this study from linear systems to a class of affine nonlinear systems. Before this, distributed observer for nonlinear systems with controlled inputs has not been studied, as well as the distributed-observer-based distributed control law. To fill this gap, we overcome the difficulty of proving the joint observability of distributed observer for nonlinear systems by an original analysis method based on maximum invariant distribution. Furthermore, to deal with the dissatisfaction of the separation principle, a high-gain parameter is introduced in the distributed observer. In addition, the influence of model mismatch on the distributed observer and distributed controller is also investigated and analyzed in detail. By analyzing the complex coupling relationship between observer dynamics, control input, high-gain parameter, and model mismatch, we successfully prove the asymptotic omniscience of distributed observer and the stability of closed-loop systems. The results show that both the error dynamics of the distributed observer and the system states of the closed-loop system formed by the observer-based distributed control law can converge to an arbitrarily small invariant set around the origin. In addition to the original work in distributed-observer-based distributed control law, this paper also has innovation in the design of distributed observer. Firstly, the proposed design method is also applicable to the distributed observer of autonomous systems. Compared to existing results on autonomous systems, our method admits weaker assumptions. Specifically, one could find an approximate system to meet the assumptions required by designing distributed observer when the underlying system fails to meet the requirements. At last, the interconnected cruise control of intelligent vehicles is employed to be verified the developed results.},

  abstract     = {Several datasets exist which contain annotated information of individuals’ trajectories. Such datasets are vital for many real-world applications, including trajectory prediction and autonomous navigation. One prominent dataset currently in use is the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) (Robicquet et al. , 2016). Despite its prominence, discussion surrounding the characteristics of this dataset is insufficient. We demonstrate how this insufficiency reduces the information available to users and can impact performance. Our contributions include the outlining of key characteristics in the SDD, employment of an information-theoretic measure and custom metric to clearly visualize those characteristics, the implementation of the PECNet (Mangalam et al. , 2020) and Y-Net (Mangalam et al. , 2021) trajectory prediction models to demonstrate the outlined characteristics’ impact on predictive performance, and lastly we provide a comparison between the SDD and Intersection Drone (inD) Dataset. Our analysis of the SDD’s key characteristics is important because without adequate information about available datasets a user’s ability to select the most suitable dataset for their methods, to reproduce one another’s results, and to interpret their own results are hindered. The observations we make through this analysis provide a readily accessible and interpretable source of information for those planning to use the SDD. Our intention is to increase the performance and reproducibility of methods applied to this dataset going forward, while also clearly detailing less obvious features of the dataset for new users.},

  abstract     = {Drifting - operating a vehicle at a high sideslip angle - offers intriguing possibilities for controlling autonomous vehicles in critical situations. While drifting is a very dynamic process, occurring in a region of the state space with saturated tires and unstable equilibria, autonomous vehicles have been successfully controlled in this region. Previous control approaches to path tracking while drifting have relied on nonlinear vehicle models. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that linearized models capture the necessary dynamics for control in a large region surrounding a drift equilibrium. Using this linearized model, we develop a controller based on a linear quadratic regulator. This controller uses steering, throttle, and brakes to track both a desired path and a desired speed profile, making the system fully actuated. We demonstrate the fidelity of this linearized model and the utility of this controller by implementing this controller on MARTY, an electric DMC DeLorean, and accurately tracking equilibrium and quasi-equilibrium paths with centimeter-level accuracy that exceeds prior work.},

  abstract     = {As more Highly Automated Driving (HAD) functions are implemented using Machine Learning (ML)-based methods, the challenge of validating them is undeniable. In a prior work, we proposed a validation method which analyzes the feature embeddings of Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers. Using this method, if different DNNs with similar classification performance are given, an engineer can inspect the feature embeddings and choose the DNN showing the most meaningful embeddings. This is a form of validation of the chosen architecture. In our prior work, the feature embeddings were passively observed with the goal of choosing the architecture with the most meaningful embeddings. In this work, we modify the DNN loss function in order to encourage more meaningful feature embeddings, aiming to actively strengthen the validation of a given DNN architecture. To this end, we make use of k-means friendly spaces, introduced in the context of autoencoders. We argue that these lead to desirable feature embeddings for validation. Furthermore, we introduce two classification rejection rules, which can be used to reject certain classifications. This increases the overall performance of the ML-based method. Ultimately, these rejection rules positively benefit from the k-means friendly space. We use a lane change prediction task as a safety-critical HAD function use-case throughout the paper. We show that the proposed methods can be used on a wide range of ML-based algorithms.},

By scaling the speed of the test vehicle through a combination of VR visuals, vehicle dynamics emulation, and steering wheel force feedback, we can safely and immersively run experiments up to highway speeds within a limited driving space. In double lane change and highway weaving experiments, our high speed emulation method tracks yaw motion within human perception limits and provides sensory feedback comparable to the same maneuvers driven manually.},

A panoramic cost map (PCM)-based gaze control method (PGC) is proposed for the active VSLAM. Different from traditional method, a panoramic camera is added beside the positioning camera to aid the gaze control of the positioning camera. The panoramic camera is used to perceive the environment and evaluate the potential performance of each available orientation of the positioning camera. The evaluation of all the available orientations will make up a panoramic cost map. The cost map is then used to help the gaze control method to select an optimal target gaze for the positioning camera. In the calculation of the panoramic cost map, the effective factors of the VSLAM, such as feature points and moving objects, are taken into consideration. In the gaze control method, we also take into consideration of errors of the system, the time delay of the proposed method, and the velocity of the AGV. The test results in different scenes with different VSLAM algorithms show that the proposed method can improve the positioning accuracy of all the tested VSLAM algorithms compared to fixed camera gaze.},

The impact of various system and channel parameters such as number of reflecting elements, amplitude of reflection coefficients, number of interferers, Doppler frequencies of desired and interfering vehicles, and different channel fading environments has been shown on the LCR and AOD performances. Moreover, we derive an expression for asymptotic LCR under high transmit power conditions. It has been shown that the asymptotic LCR is independent of the threshold and transmit power. In addition, we consider a stop and wait automatic repeat request (SW-ARQ) protocol for reliable data packet transmission and derive the expressions for packet error rate (PER) and throughput by utilizing the finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) model. The optimal packet length is also determined which maximizes the throughput under SW-ARQ protocol. The impact of various system parameters is also shown on the PER and throughput performances.},

The PPC technique is divided into three parts; first, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) based path-planner is designed to periodically generate an updated feasible trajectory for reaching the goal pose, under the constraint of avoiding collisions with dynamic and static objects which are present in the context. In particular, a proximal averaged Newton-type method for optimal control (PANOC) is used to implement NMPC. Second, the velocity commands are produced via evolutionary programming (EP) based on kinematic control (KC). Third, a dynamic control process with an extended state observer (ESO) is introduced to estimate disturbances whose magnitudes are unknown but bounded. Finally, to verify the performance of the proposed scheme, simulations are performed for the platform operating in the presence of static obstacles (SO) and moving obstacles (MO), whose trajectories may be nonlinear and difficult to be accurately predicted. Additionally, we have investigated and confirmed that the proposed PPC is able to operate in real time under limited CPU processing resources.},

Firstly, the multi-modal probability distribution of driving intention is fused to establish a driving risk field. Moreover, combined with the longitudinal safety distance model and lateral driving direction, the concept of dynamic collision area is proposed in the driving risk field. Then, MDI-POMDP is formulated to analyze the influence of the uncertainty on planning, which is caused by the multi-modal driving intention of surrounding vehicles. In the following, with the help of the previous state, a time-dependent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm recurrent deterministic policy gradient (RDPG) is designed to enhance the current observation, to solve the optimal driving policy under partial observation and generate the optimal trajectory. Furthermore, the simulation results show that the performance of our proposed motion planning algorithm is outstanding, compared with the states-of-the-art methods.

In order to minimize the HD map updating latency, this paper jointly considers the generation and transmission processes of HD map. The generation process of HD map relies heavily on the data captured by different types of sensors, which is modeled by the federated analytics process. Also, in order to quantify the diversity of utilized sensors, the concept of love of variety is introduced in this paper. Then, considering HD map is composed of dynamic and static layers that have different latency requirements during the transmission process, this paper proposes a method to allocate edge server capacity to each HD map layer such that the overall information staleness can be minimized. Firstly, the deterministic edge capacity case is discussed and the solution is derived by obtaining the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Then, considering the practice that an edge server provides services to multiple attached devices simultaneously, contentions among these devices make available capacity for the autonomous vehicle variational. Therefore, an uncertain edge capacity case is discussed as well, where the uncertainty is described by Wasserstein metrics and the problem is reformulated into distributional robust chance constrained optimization problem. And for the low latency purpose, we utilize an inner approximation to reduce the complexity of the original problem and find a suboptimal solution. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods that achieves the lowest latency for HD map updating.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in learning for control allow to synthesize vehicle controllers from learned system dynamics and maintain robust stability guarantees. However, no approach is well-suited for training robustly-stabilizing linear time-invariant (LTI) controllers using arbitrary learned models of the dynamics. This article introduces a method to do so. It uses a robust control framework to derive robust stability criteria. It also uses simulated policy rollouts to obtain gradients on the controller parameters, which serve to improve the closed-loop performance. By formulating the stability criteria as penalties with computable gradients, they can be used to guide the controller parameters toward robust stability during gradient descent. The approach is flexible as it does not restrict the type of learned model for the simulated rollouts. The robust control framework ensures that the controller is already robustly stabilizing when first implemented on the actual system and no data is yet collected. It also ensures that the system stays stable in the event of a shift in dynamics, given the system behavior remains within assumed uncertainty bounds. We demonstrate the approach by synthesizing a controller for simulated autonomous lane-change maneuvers. This work thus presents a flexible approach to learning robustly stabilizing LTI controllers that takes advantage of modern machine learning techniques.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the model-free cluster formation problem of the networked marine surface vehicles facing the cases of external disturbances and bounded inputs constraint. To handle such a complex problem, a predefined-time estimator-based hierarchical control algorithm is designed in a bounded way and without prior model information, which then decomposes the aforementioned problem into two subcontrol problems, namely, the distributed predefined-time estimation problem and the local tracking problem. Specifically, a novel distributed predefined-time estimator algorithm is designed such that the states of the virtual leaders can be estimated by their corresponding follower vehicles within a predefined time. Further, these obtained estimators are employed to construct the local bounded model-free tracking controller to finally address the considered problem. The sufficient conditions for solving these two subcontrol problems by using the designed algorithm are derived based on systematic and thorough Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, digital simulation experiment on the networked Cyber-Ships II are carried out to verify the main results.},

  abstract     = {Verifying the safety of autonomous vehicles is one of the major challenges towards their deployment on public roads due to the vast number of possible situations that can occur in traffic. Scenario-based testing has been proposed to reduce the number of required tests using catalogs of abstractly defined scenarios. However, when specifying test scenarios abstractly, there is still an infinite number of possible concrete scenarios that can be derived from a specification. Available computational resources can thus be easily exceeded when using inefficient strategies for deriving concrete scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel method that synthesizes concrete scenarios complying with abstract scenario specifications. We compute the set of compliant trajectories for surrounding traffic participants and only sample trajectories within those sets. Our synthesis integrates a falsification algorithm that searches for specified failures of the vehicle under test. Compared to existing work, we can efficiently find scenario concretizations, especially for complex maneuver specifications. By directly considering failure specifications during the scenario synthesis, we avoid executing irrelevant simulations that cannot possibly result in failures. Our approach is demonstrated in several scenarios using Monte Carlo tree search as a search algorithm.},

While, until now, most of the existing 3D object detection methods are based on the ordinary driving scenes provided by the mainstream dataset. The researches on actual complex scenes (adverse illumination, inclement weather, distant or small objects, etc.) have been ignored and there is still no comprehensive review of the recent progress in this field. Thence, this paper aims to gain a deep insight on the performance and challenges of 3D object detection methods under complex scenes for AD. Firstly, we discuss the complex driving environments in actual and the perception limitations of mainstream sensors (LIDAR and camera). Then we analyze the performance and challenges of single-modality 3D object detection methods. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy and robustness of 3D object detection methods in some complex AD scenes, the fusion of L-C (LIDAR-camera) is recommended and systematically analyzed. Finally, some suitable datasets and potential directions are comparatively summarized to support the relative research in complex driving scenes. We hope that this review could facilitate people&#39;s research and look forward to more progress in this timely and crucial problem field.},

In this work, we focus on Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) in the case of such challenging vehicle maneuvers as cut-in and cut-out, and leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and vehicle connectivity to develop a data-driven cooperative ACC application. Our DRL framework accounts for all the relevant factors, namely, passengers&#39; safety and comfort as well as efficient road capacity usage, and it properly weights them through a two-layer learning approach. We evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed scheme against existing alternatives through the CoMoVe framework, which realistically represents vehicle dynamics, communication and traffic. The results, obtained in different real-world scenarios, show that our solution provides excellent vehicle stability, passengers&#39; comfort, and traffic efficiency, and highlight the crucial role that vehicle connectivity can play in ACC. Notably, our DRL scheme improves the road usage efficiency by being inside the desired range of headway in cut-out and cut-in scenarios for 69% and 78% (resp.) of the time, whereas alternatives respect the desired range only for 15% and 45% (resp.) of the time. We also validate the proposed solution through a hardware-in-the-loop implementation , and demonstrate that it achieves similar performance to that obtained through the CoMoVe framework.},

Most algorithms divide these tasks into sequential procedures where pedestrians are detected from shape-based features in video frames, and their behaviors are analyzed with frame tracking. Different from those, this work introduces a deep learning-based pedestrian detection method that only uses motion cues. The pedestrian motion, which is much different from that of static background and dynamic vehicles, is investigated in the spatial-temporal domain. The pedestrian leg movement forms a chain-type trace in the motion profile images even if the ego-vehicle moves. Instead of modeling walking actions based on kinematics, the chain structure is directly learned from a large pedestrian dataset in driving videos. This method works for the more challenging scenes observed on moving vehicles than those scenes from static cameras. The aim is to detect not only pedestrians promptly but also predict their walking direction in the driving space. Since a video is reduced to temporal images, real-time performance is achieved with a high mean average precision and a low false-positive rate on a publicly available dataset.},

It is important to simultaneously consider all these elements in an integrated framework when predicting the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles. This paper presents a unified graphical representation method for dynamic traffic scenarios based on integrating not only the constraints from vehicles but also the collision risk implied behind road structures and traffic rules. Different from previous studies which ignores road structures and traffic rules or separately represent them in a qualitative way, this method can make better use of the influences of these environment elements in a quantitative way to improve trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles in highway scenarios. Specifically, this method first assesses the permissibility and passability of different types of roads and vehicles, and then defines their collision risk level based on traffic rules like speed limit or priority signs. Secondly, the bird-view scenarios are rasterized and rendered as color-scaled feature maps based on this risk level. Finally, multiple feature maps with various spatial and temporal perspective field are sequentially fed to a convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) network to predict trajectories for surrounding vehicles. We implement the model on NGSIM dataset and achieve satisfying prediction accuracy, for example, the error over 5s time prediction horizon can be reduced to less than 2.78 m in longitudinal and 0.26 m in lateral direction.},

Two different classes of cooperation, enabled by vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, are considered: status-sharing and intent-sharing. Status sharing allows vehicles to exchange their instantaneous states with each other (e.g., current velocity and position), whereas intent sharing also enables information exchange regarding the future motion of vehicles (e.g., velocity and acceleration bounds). We consider two types of time delays, one in vehicle dynamics and the other in V2X communication. Using reachability theory, our conflict analysis framework interprets the information encoded in the wireless messages pertaining to the two different cooperation classes by means of conflict charts. These charts allow for efficient and reliable on-board decision making and control design for a connected automated ego vehicle which interacts with multiple connected remote vehicles when carrying out different maneuvers. We quantify the effects of time delays in a mixed-autonomy traffic environment and unveil the benefits of intent information. Utilizing real highway data, we use numerical simulations to validate the extended conflict management framework.},

Typically, the solutions based on scan-to-map matching mainly optimize current pose. To further reduce the accumulated error of pose estimation, the fixed-lag smoothing that optimizes fixed-size poses simultaneously by matching corresponding point features of multiple frames becomes necessary. The integration of fixed-lag smoothing with LO still needs further exploration. In this paper, a general fixed-lag smoothing module is proposed, which can be appended to existing LO framework to improve the consistency of trajectory. Also, a fast scan-to-map matching module based on sparse features is developed to guarantee the real-time performance. Besides, the feature-centric feature management strategy is adopted in both scan-to-map matching and fixed-lag smoothing modules, which makes the proposed LO efficient. On this basis, a hierarchical estimation-based LiDAR odometry is presented, where low-level scan-to-map matching estimates pose of each frame by aligning associated features in the frame and corresponding surrounding map with high efficiency, and high-level fixed-lag smoothing further optimizes keyframe poses in a sliding window by matching associated features among multiple frames with high accuracy. As a result, a fast and accurate pose estimation is achieved, which is verified by experiments on the KITTI dataset, Newer College dataset, and an actual outdoor scenario.},

In this paper, Hy-Seg is proposed, which is a hybrid method and achieves accurate and fast ground segmentation. First, to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, the 3D point cloud generated by LIDAR is represented by a polar grid map. Then, candidate ground points in each grid are generated by a gradient-based method, reducing most of the false-positive results. Polynomial fitting based on random sample consensus is used to model the ground of each segment correctly. Finally, the original 3D point cloud is segmented using the fitted model. Experiments on SemanticKITTI show that the proposed method can not only achieve an accurate segmentation result but also run at a frequency of 53 Hz, which meets the requirements of intelligent vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles integrate complex software stacks for realizing the necessary iterative perception, planning, and action operations. One of the foundational layers of such stacks is the perception one which is comprised of localization, detection, and recognition algorithms for understanding the location and the driving environment around the vehicle. More precisely, localization aims to identify the location of the vehicle on a global coordinate system and is considered one of the most critical parts in the stack since its accuracy and robustness affects the subsequent algorithms of the perception layer and also the following planning and action layers. Due to the rapid and significant interest in self-driving cars, several localization techniques have been proposed with different directions and approaches. Algorithms using prior maps are currently considered the most accurate ones and found almost in all current self-driving car prototypes. Thus, in this paper, we categorize, discuss and analyze the state-of-the-art map-based localization techniques in an attempt to examine their potentials and limitations. We first present techniques and approaches that aim to match prior maps with on-board observations from different sensor modalities.

  abstract     = {Automated driving desires better performance on tasks like motion planning and interacting with pedestrians in mixed-traffic environments. Deep learning algorithms can achieve high performance in these tasks with remarkable visual scene understanding and generalization abilities. However, when common scene-parsing methods are used to train end-to-end models, limitations of explainability in such algorithms inhibit their implementations in fully automated driving. The main challenges include algorithm performance deficiencies and inconsistencies, insufficient AI transparency, degraded user trust, and undermining human-AI interactions. This research aids the decision-making performance and transparency of automated driving systems by providing multi-modal explanations, especially when interacting with pedestrians. The proposed algorithm combines global visual features and interrelation features by parsing scene images as self-constructed graphs and using an attention-based module to capture the interrelationship among the ego-vehicle and other traffic-related objects. The output modules make decisions while simultaneously generating semantic text explanations. The results show that the fusion of the features from global frames and interrelational graphs improves decision-making and explanation predictions compared to two state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms. The interrelation module also enhances algorithm transparency by disclosing the visual attention used for decision-making. The importance of interrelation features on the two prediction tasks is further revealed along with the underlying mechanism of multitask learning on the datasets with hierarchical labels. The proposed model improves driving decision-making during pedestrian interactions with intelligible reasoning cues for building an appropriate mental model of automated driving performance for human users.},

  abstract     = {Highway surface segmentation consists of extracting road surface at pixel-level from the surveillance camera view. Since the intelligent traffic event detection task does not require the detection of off-road scene, the segmentation of highway surface is of great demand. However, it is challenging to accurately extract road surface in real time scenarios. To cope with the above issues, Bi-Unet, a dual stream lightweight network is proposed. Firstly, the dual stream structure enhances segmentation performance on the narrow remote end of the highway and preserves the detailed border information. Then, to perform real-time segmentation, a novel lightweight module (LSM) is introduced to lighten the model and provide higher segmentation accuracy. Moreover, to ensure road segmentation for complex scenes, a Road Attention Network (RAN) module is proposed. Lastly, due to the lack of a suitable benchmark dataset serve for the highway segmentation problem, a new large and high-quality segmentation dataset named Highway-Surface-Free (HSF) is proposed in this paper, which is collected from the perspective of highway surveillance cameras under all-day and all-weather conditions. Compared with the state of arts, the extensive experimental results verify that our proposed Bi-Unet achieves the best overall performance on our proposed HSF dataset.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging paradigm for urban sensing, vehicular crowd sensing (VCS) has received increasing attention in recent years. Unlike traditional sensing paradigms, VCS leverages ubiquitous connected vehicles (CVs) and diverse onboard sensors to efficiently collect city-scale data. Despite the considerable benefits of CVs, the fast-changing traffic environment and attendant human and social factors bring significant complexity to the VCS system and make it a typical cyber-physical-social system (CPSS), followed by the challenge of robust and efficient modeling of VCS systems. To cope with the complexity of social dimensions and optimize the decision-making process in the physical VCS, this article introduces the artificial societies, computational experiments, and the parallel execution (ACP) approach to the VCS system and develops a novel framework called parallel VCS (P-VCS). Three key components empower P-VCS to balance the physical environment, cyber networks, and human and social factors, namely, an artificial system that is used to parametrically describe the physical VCS, two types of computational experiments that simulate the decision process and evaluate different strategies, and the parallel execution mechanism that is used to characterize the system operation. To demonstrate the feasibility of the framework, we take participant selection under traffic events as an application example. Experimental results illustrate that the P-VCS-based parallel learning strategy maintains competitive performance in all cases.},

This paper focuses on utilizing millimeter-wave (MMW) radar and camera sensor fusion for 3D object detection. A novel method that realizes the feature-level fusion under the bird&#39;s-eye view (BEV) for a better feature representation is proposed. Firstly, radar points are augmented with temporal accumulation and sent to a spatial-temporal encoder for radar feature extraction. Meanwhile, multi-scale image 2D features which adapt to various spatial scales are obtained by image backbone and neck model. Then, image features are transformed to BEV with the designed view transformer. In addition, this work fuses the multi-modal features with a two-stage fusion model called point-fusion and ROI-fusion, respectively. Finally, a detection head regresses objects category and 3D locations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method realizes the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under the most crucial detection metrics–mean average precision (mAP) and nuScenes detection score (NDS) on the challenging nuScenes dataset.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory planning for a heavy-duty mining truck near the loading/dumping sites of an open-pit mine is difficult. As opposed to trajectory planning for a small-sized passenger car in a parking lot, trajectory planning for a heavy-duty mining truck involves complex factors in vehicle kinematics and environment. These factors make the concerned trajectory planning scheme a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) incorporated with conditional constraints (denoted as C-MINLP). MINLP solvers can neither deal with conditional constraints nor find global optima in real time. Instead of solving the C-MINLP directly, we build a from-coarse-to-fine framework so that the coupled difficulties (the mixed integral variables, conditional constraints, and the demand for global optimality) are divided and conquered. At the coarse search stage, a global-optimality-enhanced hybrid A * search algorithm is proposed to find a near-optimal coarse trajectory with the mixed integral variables, conditional kinematic constraints, and global optimality considered. The coarse trajectory is further polished at the refinement stage, wherein the nominal C-MINLP is simplified as a small-scale NLP. The solution to the NLP is an optimized trajectory, which does not violate the complex constraints in the nominal C-MINLP. This indicates that conversion from the C-MINLP to an NLP is efficient with the help of a high-quality coarse trajectory.},

In case of the collision and loss of effective communication, the distance constraints for each vehicle are guaranteed by a barrier function-based control strategy. In contrast to the existing results regarding the command filter techniques, the proposed distance keeping controller can constrain the distance tracking error directly and the error generated by the command filter is coped with by adaptive fuzzy control technique. Moreover, to offset the impacts of the unknown system dynamics and the external disturbances, an unknown input reconstruction method with asymptotic convergence is developed by utilizing the interval observer technique. Finally, two relative threshold triggering mechanisms are utilized in the proposed fixed-time multi-lane fusion controller design so as to reduce the communication burden. The corresponding simulation results also verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {In traditional practices of transportation system&#39;s constructions, traffic-related information is collected based on dedicated sensor networks, which are not only coverage-limited but also cost-consuming. With the enrichment of the concepts concerning “social sensors” and “social transportation”, Sparse Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) is proposed to collect data from only a few subareas by recruiting participants with portable devices and to infer the data in unsensed subareas with acceptable errors. However, in real-world sensing campaigns, the Sparse MCS systems often fail to collect data from any subareas of interest since the assumption about sufficient participants is not always realistic. To be specific, the recruitment of participants is often limited by interest deficiency, privacy awareness, and distribution biases. To handle this problem, we introduce the dedicated sensing vehicles (DSVs) into traditional Sparse MCS to improve subarea coverage and inference performance. To achieve effective collaboration among DSVs and mobile users, we first design a crowd-aided vehicular hybrid sensing framework, which defines the order of task assignment for different participants as well as the budget allocation. In terms of DSVs route planning, we propose a three-step strategy, including optimal route searching, fused route selection, and final route determination. Moreover, mobile users are selected based on a novel selection strategy. Experimental findings on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness (with less inference error) of the hybrid sensing framework, in comparison with the user-only/DSV-only framework and five baselines. Results reveal important implications of applying the hybrid sensing paradigm in intelligent transportation systems to enhance data collection},

In this paper, we first investigate the distribution of objects around the heading of vehicles and observe that several objects are severely biased. On the basis of this observation, we use the bird&#39;s eye view (BEV) representation to project the 3D point clouds into a 2D image and divide the BEV projection into eight areas. For each area, we apply input-dependent convolution kernels to extract the local feature. These local features are concatenated to the panoptic backbone for panoptic segmentation. We validate our method on the validation and test sets of the SemanticKITTI dataset.

We verify the proposed method with other methods on three public parking space detection datasets (CNREXT, PKLot and ACPDS).

To reduce extra time spent with charging on everyday trips, we introduce a new charging infrastructure siting and sizing approach. We analyze daily schedules of drivers to find suitable locations for slow and fast charging stations. In simulation, we test how many charge points to assign to each charging station. Vehicles can be charged with either en-route or destination charging using a realistic model for charging and energy consumption for five electric vehicle models of different car segments. To reduce waiting times at charging stations, we use a centralized charging station database (CSDB), that coordinates charging between vehicles. We found that a combination of a few centralized fast charging stations and many distributed slow charging stations is the best option to improve the average extra time spent with charging for all vehicle types. We also found that by using the CSDB to coordinate charging between vehicles, we were able to significantly reduce the necessary number of charge points to achieve an acceptable average extra time.

  abstract     = {The choice of the reference point in automated vehicles impacts the vehicle’s driving behavior. However, this influence is often not considered for planning and control tasks. To find out where the reference point should be located best, we first consider its position to be ideal if the needed lane width on the left and right side of the planned path is equal when cornering with constant curvature. For constantly curved paths we derive the ideal reference point depending on the curvature, using the kinematics of a slip angle free bicycle model. For non-stationary cornering, we analyze different maneuvers and finally, we select the reference point on the front axle. Utilizing this knowledge, the extent of a forward moving vehicle can be reduced to a point model, which does not require the orientation of the vehicle. This enables a simple and still promising approach for collision checking, where the vehicle’s needed space is approximated by only one circle around the reference point. Finally, we analyze the influence of the reference point on a lateral feed-forward controller. Thus, we confirm the previously chosen reference point on the front axle for the equally distributed needed lane width and therefore recommend its use.},

This paper proposes a hierarchical velocity control system considering different drive preferences for connected and automated vehicles to improve overall efficiency under the vehicle-to-X (V2X) environment. Two major contributions are (i) control-oriented formulation of task planning in multiple road segments, which is amiable to numerical computation and can consider different drive preferences; and (ii) solving the nonlinear velocity trajectory optimization to realize real-time control in the lower level. Simulation results indicate that energy-saving and computational efficiency are improved using the proposed control system.

  abstract     = {Disengagement cases during naturalistic driving are rare or even one-shot, but valuable for autonomous driving. The autonomous vehicles are necessary to continually learn from these disengagement cases, to improve the policy for better performance when next time meeting these cases. Manually adjusting the policy or adding the rules to fix these disengagement cases may cause engineering burden and may contradict other driving functions. To this end, this work proposes a continually learning agent which can automatically get improved once encountering a disengagement case. The main idea is to establish a disengagement-imagination environment, and then train the policy using imagination data for performance improvement, named disengagement-case imagination augmented continual learning (DICL). In the imagination environment, the surrounding objects are designed to first follow the recorded trajectory, and then switch to the interactive models for the policy training. The switch point is carefully designed to make the imagination contain the disengagement reasons but avoid overfitting the collected driving case. This method is evaluated by the real autonomous driving disengagement data, collected from an open-road-testing autonomous vehicle. The results show that the DICL agent can automatically learn to handle the emerging disengagement case and similar cases. This work provides a possible way to make the AV agents automatically get improvement during road testing.},

To achieve accurately trajectory tracking in longitudinal and lateral motions simultaneously, a flatness disturbance-observer-based control scheme is developed to address the kinematic coupling issue of the vehicle, which can avoid extra modeling errors introduced by linearization. The main idea is that, derived from a suitable selection of flat outputs, the complex kinodynamic vehicle model is transformed into three fully-actuated subsystems with same structure, which will provide convenience for controller design. Then, in order to compensate the lumped disturbances caused by modeling and transformation, a disturbance-observer-based control strategy is designed via backstepping. Trajectory tracking control is accomplished through longitudinal, lateral and yaw motions simultaneously. The stability of the closed-loop dynamics is guaranteed in the framework of Lyapunov and input-to-state stability theories. Finally, the CarSim simulation tests demonstrate that the proposed integrated control method can successfully promote the trajectory tracking performance in different manoeuvres.},

The risk of cyber attacks and other criminal incidents along with recent road accidents caused by autonomous vehicles calls for more research on automotive digital forensics. Failures in automated driving functions can be caused by hardware and software failures and cyber security issues. Thus, it is imperative to be able to determine and investigate the cause of these failures, something which requires trustable data. However, automotive digital forensics is a relatively new field for the automotive where most existing self-monitoring and diagnostic systems in vehicles only monitor safety-related events. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first systematic literature review on the current research within this field. We identify and assess over 300 papers published between 2006–2021 and further map the relevant papers to different categories based on identified focus areas to give a comprehensive overview of the forensics field and the related research activities. Moreover, we identify forensically relevant data from the literature, link the data to categories, and further map them to required security properties and potential stakeholders. Our categorization makes it easy for practitioners and researchers to quickly find relevant work within a particular sub-field of digital forensics. We believe our contributions can guide digital forensic investigations in automotive and similar areas, such as cyber-physical systems and smart cities, facilitate further research, and serve as a guideline for engineers implementing forensics mechanisms.},

To tackle the problem of decision-making in the presence of pedestrians, the authors introduce a framework based on Social Value Orientation and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that is capable of generating decision-making policies with different driving styles. The policy is trained using state-of-the-art DRL algorithms in a simulated environment. A novel computationally-efficient pedestrian model that is suitable for DRL training is also introduced. We perform experiments to validate our framework and we conduct a comparative analysis of the policies obtained with two different model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. Simulations results show how the developed model exhibits natural driving behaviours, such as short-stopping, to facilitate the pedestrian&#39;s crossing.},

Hence, monitoring of drowsiness is critical to reduce this burden on society. This paper surveys the broad range of solutions proposed to address the challenges of driver drowsiness, and identifies the key steps required for successful implementation. Although some commercial products already exist, with vehicle-based methods most commonly implemented by automotive manufacturers, these systems may not have the level of accuracy required to properly predict and monitor drowsiness. State-of-the-art models use physiological, behavioural and vehicle-based methods to detect drowsiness, with hybrid methods emerging as a superior approach. Current setbacks to implementing these methods include late detection, intrusiveness and subject diversity. In particular, physiological monitoring methods such as Electroencephalography (EEG) are intrusive to drivers; while behavioural monitoring is least robust, affected by external factors such as lighting, as well as being subject to privacy concerns. Drowsiness detection models are often developed and validated based on subjective measures, with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale being the most popular. Subjective and incoherent labelling of drowsiness, lack of on-road data and inconsistent protocols for data collection are among other challenges to be addressed to progress drowsiness detection for reliable on-road use.},

Distributed agents, which compute cooperative decision-making, increase computational performance. In cooperative decision-making, agents locally plan for a subset of all agents. Due to only local system knowledge of the agents, these local plans are inconsistent with the local plans of other agents. This inconsistency leads to the infeasibility of plans. This article introduces an algorithm for synchronizing local plans for cooperative distributed decision-making. The algorithm enables parallel decision-making and achieves feasible decisions. The algorithm consists of two iterative steps: local planning and global synchronization. In the local planning step, the agents parallelly compute local decisions, referred to as plans. Subsequently, consistency of the local plans across agents is achieved using global synchronization. The globally synchronized plans act as reference decisions for the local planning step in the next iteration. In each iteration, the local planning guarantees locally feasible plans, while the synchronization guarantees globally consistent plans in that iteration. The parallel algorithm converges to globally feasible decisions if the coupling topology is feasible. We introduce requirements for the coupling topology to achieve convergence to globally feasible decisions and present the algorithm using a model predictive control example. Our evaluations with car-like robots show that globally feasible decisions are achieved.},

  abstract     = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can plan and actuate control that explicitly considers performance, system safety, and actuation constraints in a manner more efficient than their human-driven counterparts. In particular, eco-driving is enabled through connected exchange of information from signalized corridors that share their upcoming signal phase and timing (SPaT). This is accomplished in the proposed control approach, which follows first principles to plan a free-flow acceleration-optimal trajectory through green traffic light intervals by Pontryagin&#39;s Minimum Principle in a feedback manner. Urban conditions are then imposed from exogeneous traffic comprised of a mixture of human-driven vehicles (HVs) - as well as other CAVs. As such, safe disturbance compensation is achieved by implementing a model predictive controller (MPC) to anticipate and avoid collisions by issuing braking commands as necessary. The control strategy is experimentally vetted through vehicle-in-the-loop (VIL) of a prototype CAV that is embedded into a virtual traffic corridor realized through microsimulation. Up to 36% fuel savings are measured with the proposed control approach over a human-modelled driver, and it was found connectivity in the automation approach improved fuel economy by up to 26% over automation without. Additionally, the passive energy benefits realizable for human drivers when driving behind downstream CAVs are measured, showing up to 22% fuel savings in a HV when driving behind a small penetration of connectivity-enabled automated vehicles.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an adaptive lane change trajectory planning scheme to road friction and vehicle speed for autonomous driving, while considering both the maneuver safety and the comfort of occupants. In regard to achieve smooth trajectory, a 7th-order polynomial function is constructed to ensure continuity of the planned trajectory up to the derivative of the curvature (jerk). Unlike traditional planning methods that only consider very limited maneuvering conditions, the proposed scheme adapts to a wide range of road friction and vehicle speed, while ensuring enhanced occupants’ ride comfort and acceptance. The proposed trajectory planning scheme creatively integrates all the dynamic constraints which are defined by road friction, safety, comfort and human-like driving style. It is shown that the proposed lane change planning algorithm reduces to the identification of exclusively the lane change duration given a constant forward speed. Illustrative simulation examples in MATLAB/Simulink have been conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme. The acceptable traceability of the planned lane change trajectories is further demonstrated through path tracking analysis of a full-vehicle model in CarSim. Finally, experimental tests have been conducted based on Quanser’s latest self-driving car (QCar) to verify the practical effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a distributed fault-tolerant control strategy is proposed for cooperative operation of high-speed trains (HSTs) subject to unmodeled dynamics, time-varying external disturbances, input saturation and actuator partial failures. The cooperative control of HSTs is first transformed to the consensus problem of a multi-agent system. Then, the distributed control laws that are equipped with a command filter and an adaptive neural network are developed to achieve the consensus task among the HSTs with predefined displacement and speed profiles. Further, an auxiliary dynamical system is introduced to compensate for the influence of input saturation. Moreover, an adaptive failure compensation strategy is designed to deal with the unknown and time-varying actuator faults. The convergence of the proposed controller is analyzed rigorously by applying the Lyapunov theorem, and the effectiveness is demonstrated by numerical simulations.},

In view of the interaction between surrounding vehicles and target vehicle and its own trajectory, we propose a new graph network model to predict future vehicle trajectory. First, the correlation network of vehicles at each time is constructed based on the complex network method. In order to make up for the lack of real spatial relevance caused by the fixed graph, we propose an adaptive parameter matrix to coordinate and optimize the global spatio-temporal graph. Second, the global spatio-temporal features of vehicle historical trajectory data are extracted by stacked graph convolution module. Finally, the obtained graph features are coded based on seq2seq network, and the trajectory prediction of road vehicles at different times in the future is realized. Our model has been trained and verified on the published NGSIM US-101 and I-80 data sets. Compared with other advanced schemes, our model has more accurate results in the future time of 5 seconds. In predicting the future group trajectory of vehicles on the road, the accuracy of long-term prediction is 16.6% higher than that of the most advanced scheme.},

  abstract     = {Using highly maneuverable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to collect data is a fast and efficient method that is widely studied. In most studies, they assume that the UAVs can obtain the location of the Cluster Head (CH) before take-off, allocate CHs, and optimize the trajectory in advance. However, in many real scenarios, many sensing devices are deployed in areas with no basic communication infrastructure or cannot communicate with the Internet due to emergencies such as disasters. In this kind of sensing network, the surviving devices often change, and the CHs cannot be known and allocated in advance, thus bringing new challenges to the efficient data collection of the networks by using UAVs. In this paper, a UAV path planning scheme for IoT networks based on reinforcement learning is proposed. It plans hover points for UAV by learning the historical location of CHs and maximizes the probability of meeting CHs and plans the shortest UAV path to visit all hover points by using the simulated annealing method. In addition, an algorithm to search for the location of CHs is proposed which is named Cluster-head Searching Algorithm with Autonomous Exploration Pattern (CHSA-AEP). By using CHSA-AEP, our scheme enables the UAV to respond to the position change of the CHs. Finally, we compare our scheme with other algorithms (area coverage algorithms and random algorithm). It is found that our proposed scheme is superior to other methods in energy efficiency and time utilization ratio.},

  abstract     = {Eco-driving has been widely investigated over the last decade, but most studies focused on an individual vehicle or a vehicle platoon consisting of pure connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Recently, mixed vehicle platoons consisting of both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) have attracted much interest, considering the fact that HDVs will mix with CAVs in the traffic system for a long period. This paper proposes an eco-driving strategy for mixed platoons, composing of both offline planning and online tracking. In offline planning, an energy-efficient speed reference and a gearshift reference are determined by using the characteristics of each vehicle and future traffic information through dynamic programming. Offline planning optimised the vehicle speed and gearshift to allow the vehicle powertrain working at a high efficiency region. In online tracking, two different types of model predictive controls (MPCs) are proposed to control the CAVs in real-time. The MPCs are designed to achieve precise speed reference tracking performance and guarantee platoon string stability, respectively. Meanwhile, HDVs within the mixed platoon can be located anywhere in the platoon except working as the first vehicle to improve flexibility. Therefore, the proposed eco-driving strategy is applicable to mixed platoons with more general structures in ordering. The key contribution of this study is that the proposed eco-driving strategy can optimise the total fuel consumption for general mixed platoons. Simulation results show that the proposed eco-driving strategy improves the fuel economy of a mixed platoon by up to 6.39% compared to the benchmark conventional-adaptive cruise control strategies.},

  abstract     = {Multi-object tracking (MOT) is among crucial applications in modern advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) systems. The global nearest neighbor (GNN) filter, as the earliest random vector-based Bayesian tracking framework, has been adopted in most of state-of-the-arts trackers in the automotive industry. The development of random finite set (RFS) theory facilitates a mathematically rigorous treatment of the MOT problem, and different variants of RFS-based Bayesian filters have then been proposed. However, their effectiveness in the real ADAS and AD application is still an open problem. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the latest RFS-based Bayesian tracking framework could be superior to typical random vector-based Bayesian tracking framework via a systematic comparative study of both traditional random vector-based Bayesian filters with rule-based heuristic track maintenance and RFS-based Bayesian filters on the nuScenes validation dataset. An RFS-based tracker, namely Poisson multi-Bernoulli filter using the global nearest neighbor (GNN-PMB), is proposed to LiDAR-based MOT tasks. This GNN-PMB tracker is simple to use, and it achieves competitive results on the nuScenes dataset. Specifically, the proposed GNN-PMB tracker outperforms most state-of-the-art LiDAR-only trackers and LiDAR and camera fusion-based trackers, ranking the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$3^{rd}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; among all LiDAR-only trackers on nuScenes 3D tracking challenge leader board ( https://bit.ly/3bQJ2CP ) at the time of submission.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving related researches require the analysis and usage of massive amounts of driving scenario data. Compared to raw data collected by sensors, scenario data provide a preliminary abstraction of driving tasks and processes, explicitly integrate information about the road environment and the dynamic and static attributes of traffic participants, making it easier to conduct task understanding and decision making. However, many existing driving scenario datasets have the following two problems. First, it is not clear which data fields need to be recorded for driving scenarios. The data storage formats and organization standards are inconsistent. Second, the datasets cannot establish driving scenario indexing effectively. Existing datasets are sparsely annotated and difficult to index, which is detrimental to data sampling and extraction for machine learning process, thus hindering efficient fusion and reuse. In this paper, we propose MetaScenario, a framework for driving scenario data. We describe driving scenarios and design the centralized and unified data framework for the storage, processing, and indexing of scenario data based on relational database. The concept of atom scenario is proposed and characterized using semantic graphs. We also annotate and classify behaviors and interactions of traffic participants in atom scenarios by extracting the spatiotemporal evolution of semantic information. The annotation facilitates the indexing and extraction of data. The scenario datasets are further evaluated via the data distribution and annotation statistics. MetaScenario can provide researchers with convenient tools for scenario data extraction and important analytical references.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) has the potential to significantly improve traffic throughput by reducing inter-vehicle following gap. However, communication and actuation delays in CACC systems are detrimental to string stability. A much larger time gap than the lump sum of the two delays is often required for CACC to guarantee string stability, which compromises their benefits on traffic throughput. It remains as a challenge to design string-stable CACC controllers that operate at small time gaps under delays. In this paper, we design a memory-anticipation CACC to explicitly handle communication and actuation delays to fulfill string stability specifications. The proposed controller employs a novel memory-anticipation spacing policy to address communication and actuation delays and is applicable to heterogeneous platoons. Unlike existing CACC controllers, our proposal utilizes past information of the preceding vehicle (i.e. the memory) instead of its current state/control information, which makes the controller robust to communication delay. Furthermore, a Smith predictor (i.e. the anticipation) is designed to compensate for the actuation delay. Both individual vehicle stability and string stability can be guaranteed with the minimum time gap as small as the summation of communication delay and actuation delay. Controller analysis and simulation verify the enhancement of the stability performance with respect to existing studies.},

  abstract     = {Consensus formation tracking of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to nonlinear and uncertain dynamics is a challenging problem in robotics. To tackle this challenge, a distributed bioinspired sliding mode controller is proposed in this paper. First, the conventional sliding mode controller (SMC) is presented, and the consensus problem is addressed on the basis of graph theory. Next, to tackle the high frequency chattering issue in SMC scheme and meanwhile improve the robustness to the noises, a bioinspired approach is introduced, in which a neural dynamic model is employed to replace the nonlinear sign or saturation function in the synthesis of conventional sliding mode controllers. Furthermore, the input-to-state stability of the resulting closed-loop system is proved in the presence of bounded lumped disturbance by the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed formation control protocol.},

Complex terrain constraints of urban environment increase mission planning difficulties, and bring a strong input-output coupling between subproblems of mission planning, which affect the computing performance and effectiveness of the UAV swarm. In this paper, an evolutionary utility prediction matrix (EUPM) method is presented to solve the input-output-coupled mission planning problem for a UAV swarm executing heterogeneous tasks in an urban scenario with complex constraints. A structured framework of urban missions is established with a distributed mission planning architecture. The input-output coupling relationships between the subproblems of mission planning are analyzed in terms of typical urban mission patterns. Modules for the mission planning subproblems are designed with improved input-output coupling relationships. Simulations and hardware-in-loop experiments demonstrate that the EUPM method achieves accurate prediction of the utility and high effective mission planning solutions than the traditional methods.},

Vehicle and driving data are often used to mine information about people’s lifestyles and preferences. Without advanced data encryption and strict authorization measures, personal privacy and security are at great risk. To solve the problem that the relatively low security of vehicles connected to the Internet may threaten the privacy of users, a blockchain-based sensitive data privacy-protection scheme for vehicles connected to the Internet is proposed. First, association rules are used to mine Big Data in the Internet of Vehicles. Then, a data security aggregation protocol is established. Finally, an end-to-end encryption mechanism is created. The privacy protection of Big Data in the Internet of Vehicles is achieved through static and dynamic strategies. The experimental results show that the scheme can improve the hiding rate of sensitive data, the key generation time and encryption time are shorter than those of typical technologies, and the encryption ability is better. Therefore, in protecting the privacy of Big Data in the Internet of Vehicles, the blockchain proposed in this paper has better privacy protection and encryption abilities and is applicable to the protection of sensitive data in the Internet of Vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is an effective method for motion planning of automated vehicles, but the high computational load of numerical optimization limits its practical application. This paper designs an NMPC based motion planner and presents two techniques, named adaptive Lagrange discretization and hybrid obstacle avoidance constraints, to accelerate the numerical optimization by reducing the optimization variables and simplifying the non-convex constraints. Given the high nonlinearity of vehicle dynamics, the Lagrange interpolation is adopted to convert the state equation of vehicle dynamics and the objective function to ensure a preset accuracy but with less discretization points. An adaptive strategy is then designed to adjust the order of Lagrange polynomials based on the distribution of discretization error. Moreover, a hybrid strategy is presented to construct the constraints for obstacle avoidance by combing the elliptic and linear time-varying methods together. It can ensure driving safety and also make a good balance between computing load and accuracy. The performance of these techniques on accelerating the NMPC based motion planner is validated and analyzed by comparative numerical simulations and experimental tests under various scenarios. Compared with traditional methods, the results show that these techniques improve accuracy and efficiency by 74% and 60%, respectively.},

Behavioral cloning, which allows automatic trajectory learning and improvement, has been effectively used in driving trajectory planning. However, existing behavioral cloning methods always rely on large scales of time-consuming, laborious, and reliable labels. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new off-policy imitation learning method for autonomous driving using task knowledge distillation. This novel method clones human driving behavior and effectively transfers the driving strategies to domain shift scenarios. The experiment results indicate that our method can lead to satisfactory route-following performance in realistic urban driving scenes and can transfer the driving strategies to new unknown scenes under various illumination and weather scenarios for autonomous driving.},

In the last year, we organized 1 distributed/decentralized and hybrid symposia (DHS), 2 DHWs, and 7 seminars. The following is a brief review of the findings from our DHS, DHWs, and Seminars, in particularly about a novel emission regulatory framework for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and smart cities (SCs) in ERS. Vehicle emissions are one of the main anthropogenic contributors to global warming and atmospheric pollution. However, effective regulation of transportation emissions is still challenging, even in intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. To realize accurate estimations and credible predictions, a parallel framework is proposed in this letter, consisting of a parallel transportation level and a parallel vehicle level. Through low-cost computational experiments and parallel executions, both accurate estimation and emission-aware optimal planning can be achieved. Unlike previous emission models, modern aftertreatment systems (ATS) are considered as a core module in this novel modular integration model (MIM).

Conventional development approaches such as testing and simulation are limited by non-exhaustive analysis, and can thus not guarantee safety in all possible scenarios. Formal methods can provide mathematical proofs that could be used to produce rigorous evidence to support the safety argument. This paper investigates the use of differential dynamic logic and the deductive verification tool KeYmaera X in the development of an AD feature. Specifically, this paper demonstrates how formal models and safety proofs of different design variants of a Decision &amp; Control module can be used in the safety argument of an in-lane AD feature. In doing so, the assumptions and invariant conditions necessary to guarantee safety are identified, and the paper shows how such an analysis helps during the development process in requirement refinement and formulation of the operational design domain. Furthermore, it is shown how the performance of the different models is formally analyzed exhaustively, in all their allowed behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has emerged as a novel generalized multiple access technology which can control the interference in multi-user communication systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has also been proven to improve the spectral efficiency in the next-generation (beyond 5 G (B5G) and 6 G) wireless communication networks. Thus, in this paper, we explore the RSMA scheme for RIS-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based multi-user vehicular communication network in the presence of co-channel interference. The communication between the UAV and the desired vehicle takes place through an RIS along with the direct link and is interfered by multiple interfering vehicles operating in the same spectrum. After deriving the approximate cumulative distribution function (CDF) of common and private stream signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) at the desired vehicle in the interference limited scenario, we obtain an expression for the average outage probability (AOP) over the complete flying duration of the UAV. Furthermore, the optimum RSMA power allocation coefficients in each time slot of UAV flight duration are obtained by minimizing the Sum-AOP over all the desired vehicles. The performance of the proposed RSMA based RIS-aided vehicular communication network is compared with (a) RSMA based network without RIS and (b) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based RIS-aided counterpart. The numerical results reveal the superiority of RSMA over NOMA and the significance of deploying RIS in considered vehicular communication network. The analytical results are corroborated with Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract     = {Automated driving systems need to perform according to what human drivers expect in every situation. A different behavior can be wrongly interpreted by other human drivers and cause traffic problems, disturbances to other road participants, or in the worst case, an accident. In this paper, we propose a behavior cloning concept for learning high-level decisions from recorded trajectories of real traffic. We summarized and gave a clear definition of the main features that affect how humans make driving decisions. Some other approaches rely on complex neural networks where their decisions are impossible to understand. Due to the importance of the decision making module, we produce safe human-like behavior which is transparent to humans and easy to track. Furthermore, the learned policy is not overfitting to the limited training data and generalizes well to multi-lane scenarios with arbitrary speed limits and traffic density, which is strengthened by the successful application of merging policy on exiting. Simulation evaluations show that our learned policy is able to handle the intention uncertainty of surrounding agents, and provide human-like decisions in the sense of well-balanced behavior between efficiency, comfort, perceived safety, and politeness.},

  abstract     = {Learning-based stereomatching methods have produced remarkable results in recent years. However, typical supervised learning-based methods always suffer from the non-negligible problem of costly and time-consuming depth annotations. To mitigate this issue, in this work, a multi-stage unsupervised stereo matching method based on the cascaded Siamese network is proposed. To obtain a better performance on depth annotations, the improvements of this work are as follows. Firstly, sparse costs are constructed to predict the coarse disparity, and an adaptive sampling strategy is developed to dynamically adjust the sampling interval and effectively narrow the disparity search range. The proposed cost sparse and sampling strategy can certainly guarantee the accuracy of disparity estimation under the limited memory requirements. Then, geometric constraints with left and right semantic features are integrated into the loss function to learn the inherent matching correspondences. Next, information entropy of the probability volume is used to measure the quality of estimated disparity and designed as weighted guidance for the photometric loss. Finally, a pixel-wise disparity refinement module is designed to achieve high-resolution disparity estimation at the final stage. Experimental results on the datasets, including SceneFlow and KITTI, show the effectiveness and practicability of our method with limited memory consumption and running time.},

To this end, this paper proposes a shared control approach to assist drivers in path-tracking and collision avoidance. A high-fidelity CarSim vehicle model embedded driver simulator is built to collect the driver data, based on which the normalized steering angle input and the time to collision are defined to quantify the driving performance. Then, these performance indices are employed to develop the fuzzy controller and determine the control authority for the steering assistance system (SAS). A multi-constraints model predictive control is designed to follow the desired path, and simultaneously ensure the vehicle stability. Different from the traditional constraints handling method, the state constraint is transformed into the input constraint considering the nonlinearity. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with two less experienced drivers. The test results show that the path-tracking performance and vehicle stability can be guaranteed with less control effort.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in lane detection based on deep neural networks have enhanced the detection performance of intelligent vehicles under different traffic scenes. However, it’s still difficult for existing lane detection algorithms to robustly extract lane instances and adapt to varying lane numbers simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on anchor-free methods and propose an adaptive multi-lane detection approach based on instance segmentation for intelligent vehicles. By combining instance segmentation with lane center estimation, the proposed approach achieves robust and efficient performance. Besides, cosine-metric is incorporated into the objective functions that enables the proposed method to extract more discriminative features for foreground extraction. Different from the proposed approach, most existing algorithms treat the lane instance detection task as a multi-class object detection problem which require to predefine different lane categories and fix the lane number in advance, while the lane category predefinition degrades the robustness of the algorithms. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better overall performance compared with the state-of-the-art anchor-free lane detection methods. It is also illustrated that the proposed approach can be easily extended to other instance segmentation tasks, e.g. vehicle segmentation.},

The aim of this study is to verify the stability, robustness, and high accuracy of the proposed method, and propose appropriate intervals for magnetic markers. This localization method accurately calculates the sideslip angle because a noisy acceleration sensor is not required except for the identification process. The estimated positions and orientation are filtered through an extended Kalman filter as the vehicle passes the magnetic markers. The robust stability of the proposed method is verified using the small-gain theorem, which shows that the intervals for magnetic markers should be less than 38.6 m for a city bus. Experimental results using a city bus and GMPS show that there is a possibility that the intervals of magnetic markers are extended to 30 m at small curvature, and 10 m at large curvature from the current 2 m intervals. These results indicate that the maximum intervals to avoid lane deviation of vehicles depend on the reference path curvature.},

  abstract     = {Approaches to keeping a dynamical system within state constraints typically rely on a model-based safety condition to limit the control signals. In the face of significant modeling uncertainty, the system can suffer from important performance penalties due to the safety condition becoming overly conservative. Machine learning can be employed to reduce the uncertainty around the system dynamics, and allow for higher performance. In this article, we propose the safe uncertainty-learning principle, and argue that the learning must be properly structured to preserve safety guarantees. For instance, robust safety conditions are necessary, and they must be initialized with conservative uncertainty bounds prior to learning. Also, the uncertainty bounds should only be tightened if the collected data sufficiently captures the future system behavior. To support the principle, two example problems are solved with control barrier functions: a lane-change controller for an autonomous vehicle, and an adaptive cruise controller. This work offers a way to evaluate whether machine learning preserves safety guarantees during the control of uncertain dynamical systems. It also highlights challenging aspects of learning for control.},

However, promising planning concepts from research are usually not included within a reasonable time, possibly due to resource restrictions or technical limitations. Without evaluating these novel algorithms in reality, the benefits and shortcomings of proposed approaches cannot be thoroughly assessed.

It discusses the necessary modifications of Apollo for deployment on a different vehicle and presents three real-world driving experiments on a public road alongside a detailed experience report.

This paper proposes a method of single-pedestrian tracking using thermal infrared cameras to meet the needs of DAS operating in nighttime and low-visibility conditions. The proposed algorithm uses the background-aware correlation filter (BACF) as the basic tracking framework. In order to address the problem that directly introducing the convolutional features leads to tracking performance degradation in the BACF framework, this paper proposes a fusion scheme to integrate handcrafted and convolutional features to make full use of the advantages of both the features. The proposed scheme combines response maps from convolutional and handcrafted features through fusion coefficients to improve the performance of the trackers based on the single features. In order to calculate fusion coefficients, a novel approach of searching the main peak and interference peaks of a response map is proposed by using local binary pattern values of the response map to locate all local maximum points. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing 9 competing tracking algorithms and can be used in vehicle platforms as a module of DAS to improve the safe level of driving in nighttime.},

Although Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are widely used in many applications, their performance is often disturbed, particularly in urban areas. Therefore, many studies consider multi-sensor integration and cooperative positioning (CP) approaches to provide additional degrees of freedom to address the shortcomings of GNSS. However, few studies adopted real-world datasets and internode ranging outliers within CP is left untouched, leading to unexpected challenges in practical applications. To address this, we propose a Robust Cooperative Positioning (RCP) scheme that augments the GPS with the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) system. A field experiment is conducted to generate a real-world dataset to evaluate the RCP scheme. Moreover, the analysis of the collected dataset enables us to optimise a simple but effective Robust Kalman Filter (RKF) to mitigate the influence of outlier measurements and improve the robustness of the proposed solution. Finally, a simulated dataset is derived from the real-world data to comprehensively study the performance of the proposed RCP method in urban canyon scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed solution can crucially improve positioning performance when the number of visible GPS satellite is limited and is robust against various adverse effects in such environments.},

The convex framework exploits these properties to evaluate depth jumps in the disparity space image and perform geometrical analysis of potential occlusion regions. The corresponding convex formulations are based on linear matrix inequalities to detect sudden disparity, angle profile, and intensity variations for potential negative obstacles and to estimate the internal depth of the detected obstacles.

The emission of greenhouse gases has resulted in a continuous increase in the temperature of the atmosphere leading to Global warming. CO2 continues to be the leading contributor to the greenhouse effect, with transport being a major CO2 emission source. The majority of transport emissions are from road transport i.e. vehicular emissions. To control vehicular emission, first, an efficient emission monitoring system is required. Direct sensor installation in individual vehicles is neither cost-effective nor the data is easy to collect. In this paper, a scalable vehicle CO2 emission prediction model is proposed which uses vehicle On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) port data. The proposed system uses real-time in-vehicle sensor data to estimate CO2 emission of the vehicle using a Recurrent neural network (RNN) based Long short-term memory(LSTM) model. OBD-II dongles can be used to easily transmit the vehicle’s sensor data to the cloud, where the LSTM model uses this data to estimate the real-time CO2 emission of the vehicle. The proposed model provides a scalable and efficient system to monitor emissions at a vehicular level and, has been evaluated using public OBD-II dataset.

  abstract     = {The tradeoff between speed and accuracy is important in semantic segmentation problems, especially for resource-constrained platforms, such as intelligent vehicles. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a well-deployed real-time semantic segmentation architecture named MLFNet. Specifically, we first build a lightweight backbone (SEFE) with a larger receptive field and multi-scale contextual representation performance to encode the pixel-level features. For better preserving target boundaries and contours, a spatial compensation branch (SPFE) is designed to gradually reduce the dimension of feature maps and refine the low-level specifics. In the decoding phase, we introduce a well-designed multi-branch fusion extractor (MBFD) for integrating the spatial details into high-level layers. Finally, the outputs from the semantic and spatial branches are fused to predict the final segmentation results. Extensive offline and online experiments have shown that our model has a superior speed and accuracy trade-off. On the Cityscapes test dataset, our model (MLFNet-Res18) achieves 71.0% mIoU with 95.1 FPS for 512 × 1024 inputs, and 72.1% mIoU with 72.2 FPS while inferring on MLFNet-Res34 model. Meanwhile, MLFNet-Res18 can reach 24.5 FPS when deployed to NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and 64.0 FPS with an experimental vehicle.},

This paper proposes a distributed coordinated brake control (DCBC) algorithm for longitudinal collision avoidance of multiple CAVs. Firstly, the studied scenario is defined, within which the communication topology and vehicle dynamics are modeled for a vehicle string and the control objective is designed to minimize the total relative kinetic energy. Next, the control problem is formulated into a centralized model predictive control problem, which is then transformed into a quadratic programming (QP) problem. By separating the QP problem into several sub-problems assigned to each CAV, distributed optimization is introduced to solve the QP problem in a distributed manner. Elaborate numerical simulation comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed DCBC algorithm.},

  abstract     = {A framework that could achieve submeter-level-accurate horizontal navigation with carrier phase differential measurements from cellular signals is developed. This framework, termed CD-cellular, is composed of a base and a rover in a cellular environment, both making carrier phase measurements to the same cellular base transceiver stations (BTSs). The base shares its carrier phase measurements with the mobile rover, which in turn employs an extended Kalman filter to obtain a coarse estimate of its states, followed by a batch weighted nonlinear least squares (B-WNLS) estimator to solve for the integer ambiguities, and finally a point-solution WNLS to estimate its own states. The framework is designed to guarantee that after some time, the rover&#39;s position error remains below a pre-defined threshold with a desired probability. This is achieved by leveraging models of the BTS positions from stochastic geometry. Experimental results on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an open semi-urban environment with multipath-free, line-of-sight (LOS) conditions are presented, showing that the developed framework achieves a 70.48 cm position root mean-squared error (RMSE) over a trajectory of 2.24 km, measured with respect to the UAV&#39;s navigation solution from its onboard GPS-inertial navigation system (INS).},

Hence, the aforementioned rail systems are “automated” but not “autonomous,” and the architecture utilization and train tracking interval are limited. With the development of advanced sensors and control algorithms, the train intends to be equipped with a decision-making capability. In order to further improve train movement coordination and efficiency, an Autonomous Train Control System (ATCS) is proposed. This paper provides three main contributions: Firstly, the system structure is described, and the information following in ATCS is discussed with general operation scenarios. Secondly, data isolation is broken under ATCS, and data prediction and edge-based information fusion are applied to process the real dynamic data and estimate the train&#39;s speed and position. Thirdly, with the assistant of data fusion, model predictive and data-based control methodologies are discussed.},

However, their formulated trajectory planning optimization problems in unstructured environments are highly non-convex and nonlinear, requiring a proper initial guess to help with convergence. Given the low efficiency of common sampling-and-search-based initialization strategies due to the dimensionality brought by complex vehicle dynamics and the maneuverable space narrowed by cluttered obstacles, the sequential optimization of a series of softened intermediate problems is emerging as a new initialization strategy. Unlike sequential optimization-based strategies, which optimize all decision variables (w.r.t. the positions, velocities, vehicle orientations, steering angles, and so on of all waypoints) for initialization, the proposed strategy only optimizes critical variables, whose values should help satisfy the inequalities strictly with a small equation violation. Thus, the original scheme for initialization is decoupled into two sub-tasks with down-sized variables. One reduces the nonlinear equation violation, and the other ensures strict inequality satisfaction. Experimental results show that the proposed initialization strategy can facilitate the solution of an optimization-based trajectory planner, thereby making the trajectory planner outperform the state-of-the-art competitors in this community.},

  abstract     = {Due to the difference of data modalities, it’s a very challenging task to find the feature correspondences between 2D and 3D data in LiDAR-Camera calibration. In existing works, the establishment of the cross-model correspondence is always simplified by specifically designing artificial targets or restricting the region of searching correspondences with the help of initial extrinsic parameters. To achieve automatic LiDAR-Camera calibration without prior knowledge, we propose a novel self-adaptive LiDAR-Camera calibration approach named ATOP which realizes a cascaded procedure of ATtention-to-OPtimization. In the attention stage, an attention-based object-level matching network called Cross-Modal Matching Network (CMON) is designed for finding the overlapped FOV(Field of View) between camera and LiDAR, and producing 2D-3D object-level correspondences. In the optimization stage, two cascaded PSO-based (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithms, namely Point -PSO and Pose -PSO, are designed to estimate the LiDAR-Camera extrinsic parameters. Different from previous works, the proposed calibration method does not require any artificial targets or initial pose guesses, therefore it can be applied to achieve online self-adaptive LiDAR-Camera calibration. Besides, this is the first work, to our best knowledge, to achieve object-level matching between uncalibrated camera and LiDAR data. Experimental results on both the collected datasets and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we construct a two-stage end-to-end autonomous driving model for complex urban scenarios, named HIIL (Hierarchical Interpretable Imitation Learning), which integrates interpretable BEV mask and steering angle to solve the problems shown above. In Stage One, we propose a pretrained Bird&#39;s Eye View (BEV) model which leverages a BEV mask to present an interpretation of the surrounding environment. In Stage Two, we construct an Interpretable Imitation Learning (IIL) model that fuses BEV latent feature from Stage One with an additional steering angle from Pure-Pursuit (PP) algorithm. In the HIIL model, visual information is converted to semantic images by the semantic segmentation network, and the semantic images are encoded to extract the BEV latent feature, which are decoded to predict BEV masks and fed to the IIL as perception data. In this way, the BEV latent feature bridges the BEV and IIL models. Visual information can be supplemented by the calculated steering angle for PP algorithm, speed vector, and location information, thus it could have better performance in complex and terrible scenarios. Our HIIL model meets an urgent requirement for interpretability and robustness of autonomous driving. We validate the proposed model in the CARLA simulator with extensive experiments which show remarkable interpretability, generalization, and robustness capability in unknown scenarios for navigation tasks.},

After formulating the general nonconvex trajectory optimization problem, we form a convex approximation using sequential convex programming (SCP). The state of the art convexifies track constraints using sequential linearization (SL), which is a method of relaxing the constraints. Solutions to the relaxed optimization problem are not guaranteed to be feasible in the nonconvex optimization problem. We propose sequential convex restriction (SCR) as a method to convexify track constraints. SCR guarantees that resulting solutions are feasible in the nonconvex optimization problem. We show recursive feasibility of solutions to the restricted optimization problem. The MPC is evaluated on a scaled version of the Hockenheimring racing track in simulation. The results show that MPC using SCR yields faster lap times than MPC using SL, while still being real-time capable.},

  abstract     = {In the growth of intelligent surveillance and computer vision, pedestrian intrusion detection (PID) has been widely applied in security, automatic driving and many other fields. Vision-based PID aims at detecting whether pedestrians invade an area-of-interest (AoI). For dynamic PID task, we need to identify the invading individuals from a large amount of pedestrian objects in a varying AoI scene, which is very challenging. We take the first attempt to solve this issue and propose a network named PIDNet to address it. In the PIDNet, we design an efficient dual-branch network, which combines region segmentation and pedestrian object detection. The final intrusion judgement is made by analyzing the position relation between a segmented AoI and a detected pedestrian. With the lightweight network design, PIDNet can detect pedestrian objects and segment AoI simultaneously, and make intrusion judgment efficiently. In order to achieve better intrusion detection performance, we further propose a netowrk with a cross-association strategy (cross-PIDNet) to improve the feature extraction capability of dual-branch network. In this strategy, we build the connection between detection branch and segmentation branch, avoiding the redundancy of non-critical intrusion features and enhancing the expression of critical intrusion features. Meanwhile, we design a multi-scale intrusion judgment module, which makes the judgment of intrusion state more robust. Since neither public datasets nor a benchmark is available in this direction, we set up a benchmark dataset and corresponding evaluation metrics.

  abstract     = {This paper presents an improved machine learning approach for the accurate and robust state of charge (SOC) in electric vehicle (EV) batteries using differential search optimized random forest regression (RFR) algorithm. The precise SOC estimation confirms the safety and reliability of EV. Nevertheless, SOC is influenced by numerous factors which cannot be measured directly. RFR is suitable for real-time SOC estimation due to its robustness to noise, overfitting issues and capacity to work with huge datasets. However, proper selection of RFR architecture and hyper-parameters combination remains a key issue to be explored. Hence, a differential search algorithm (DSA) is employed to search for the optimal values of trees and leaves in the RFR algorithm. DSA optimized RFR eliminates the utilization of the filter in data pre-processing steps and does not require a detailed understanding and knowledge about battery chemistry, rather only needs sensors to monitor battery voltage and current. The developed approach is validated at room temperature using two types of lithium-ion batteries under a pulse discharge test. In addition, the proposed model is verified under varying temperature settings under EV drive cycles. The experimental results demonstrate that the DSA optimized RFR algorithm achieves RMSE of 0.382% in the HPPC test using LiNMC battery. Besides, the proposed method obtains satisfactory outcomes in EV drive cycles, estimating MAE of 0.193% and 0.346% in DST and FUDS cycles, respectively, at 25°C.},

In this paper, we design longitudinal vehicle controllers and study the dynamics of a system of homogeneous vehicles on a single-lane ring road in order to understand the interplay of limited space, speed, and safety. Each vehicle in the system either operates in the cruise control mode or follows a vehicle ahead by keeping a safe time headway. We show that if the number of vehicles is less than a certain critical threshold, vehicles can occupy the limited space in many different configurations, i.e., different platoons of different sizes, and they converge to a uniform maximum speed while attenuating errors in the relative spacing upstream a platoon. If the number of vehicles exceeds the threshold, vehicles converge to a unique symmetric configuration and the equilibrium speed decreases as the number of vehicles increases. Next, we consider vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and show that it increases the critical number of vehicles that can travel with the maximum speed. Finally, we consider vehicle coordination and show that the proposed controllers can force vehicles to converge to a desired configuration specified by the coordinator while maintaining safety and comfort. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed controllers via simulation.},

  abstract     = {The performance of smart vehicle (SV) applications like autonomous driving and in-vehicle augmented reality based traffic information system depends on the Field of View (FoV) and the timely processing of the SVs sensor data. Vehicular networking (VN) technology can enhance the performance of these applications by enabling a SV to access the sensing and processing capabilities of other neighbouring SVs. The processing and storage capacity of a SV is limited compared to cloud servers and the communication link between two SVs is unreliable due to their mobility and the nature of wireless channels. Hence, developing efficient processing and sensing schemes for SVs and VNs can help in optimizing the performance of SV applications. In this paper, we propose Contextual Bandits (CB), Markov decision process (MDP) and deep Q-network (DQN) based sensing and processing schemes for VNs. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes outperform the baseline schemes in a variety of scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving demands robust and precise vehicle localization in complex environments with limited on-board computational resources. Incorporating reliable semantic information with localization algorithms can increase accuracy remarkably, however, the process of extracting semantic information from LiDAR point clouds and matching it to semantic maps is computationally intensive. Moreover, pure semantic localization cannot achieve the robustness requirements for safe self-driving as the necessary quantity of semantic landmarks cannot be guaranteed under extreme conditions. In this paper, we present a lightweight semantic-aided localization method that improves upon traditional techniques in two ways. First, we propose a highly efficient pipeline to extract three semantic classes from a LiDAR scan. Second, instead of semantic 3D point cloud registration, map matching is performed through 2D key point matching. We then integrate these two functions into a dynamic semantic aided localization framework. Our on-road experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves both the high accuracy of semantic localization and the robustness of non-semantic localization. With our algorithm consuming under 10% of CPU resources, we observe reduced positioning error, especially peak error, when comparing to non-semantic counterparts.},

We first review the major traditional machine learning and deep learning methods that have been used in the literature to detect and recognize these objects. We provide a vision-based framework that detects and recognizes traffic objects inside and outside the attentional visual area of drivers. This approach uses the driver 3D absolute coordinates of the gaze point obtained by the combined, cross-calibrated use of a front-view stereo imaging system and a non-contact 3D gaze tracker. A combination of multi-scale HOG-SVM and Faster R-CNN-based models are utilized in the detection stage. The recognition stage is performed with a ResNet-101 network to verify sets of generated hypotheses. We applied our approach on real data collected during drives in an urban environment with the RoadLAB instrumented vehicle. Our framework achieved 91% of correct object detections and provided promising results in the object recognition stage.},

  abstract     = {Accurate knowledge about the motion state of preceding vehicles (PVs) contributes to the optimization of planning and decision making of autonomous vehicles, which in turn further enhances road safety. Existing studies generally rely on information from special sensors mounted on the ego vehicle to estimate PVs state. With the evolution of information technology, the use of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to estimate the PVs state has attracted more and more attention. However, the problem of how to reduce the communication rate while ensuring the estimation accuracy of PVs state with the limited communication bandwidth has not been addressed yet. In addition, traditional studies on lateral state estimation of PVs assume that the longitudinal velocity of the PV is known or design an additional estimator to predict the longitudinal velocity. This results in the dynamical coupling characteristics of the vehicle not being fully considered. To address these problems, an event-triggered estimation framework by fusing an event-triggered mechanism with an embedded cubature Kalman filter based on a coupled vehicle model is proposed for PVs state estimation. Simulation and real vehicle test results demonstrate that the proposed prediction approach can strike an effective balance between the communication rate and the estimation performance. The estimation accuracy of the proposed method is still superior to that of the cubature Kalman filter, even if the communication rate drops to 37.55%.},

Firstly, we propose a data-driven method to model mixed vehicle platoons based on Koopman operator theory. This method gives a way to represent the mixed vehicle platoon by a linear model in a high-dimensional space, the approximation of which is obtained by a neural network framework. Secondly, we employ model predictive control (MPC) to address the platoon control problem of mixed vehicle platoons, where both centralized MPC and distributed MPC algorithms are designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the data-driven modeling method and the centralized/distributed MPC algorithms is verified by numerical simulations. It is revealed that the proposed data-driven DMPC algorithm exhibits comparable control performance with less computation cost compared with the centralized MPC algorithm, and it shows faster convergence speed than the nonlinear model based DMPC algorithm.},

The model is used to drive the ego vehicle safely by following a sequence of routes defined by the global planner. The perception part of the model is used to encode high-dimensional observation data provided by an RGBD camera while performing semantic segmentation, semantic depth cloud (SDC) mapping, and traffic light state and stop sign prediction. Then, the control part decodes the encoded features along with additional information provided by GPS and speedometer to predict waypoints that come with a latent feature space. Furthermore, two agents are employed to process these outputs and make a control policy that determines the level of steering, throttle, and brake as the final action. The model is evaluated on CARLA simulator with various scenarios made of normal-adversarial situations and different weathers to mimic real-world conditions. In addition, we do a comparative study with some recent models to justify the performance in multiple aspects of driving. Moreover, we also conduct an ablation study on SDC mapping and multi-agent to understand their roles and behavior. As a result, our model achieves the highest driving score even with fewer parameters and computation load.

The target position information can be sensed by a fraction of follower USVs only. A fixed-time resilient cooperative edge-triggered estimation and control architecture is presented for achieving cooperative target tracking under DoS attacks. Specifically, a distributed edge-triggered fixed-time extended state observer (ESO) is designed to recover the position and velocity of the target with a prescribed time regardless of the unreliable communication network subject to DoS attacks. Moreover, the communication burden of the network is reduced by the proposed edge-triggered mechanism. In the control law design, a fixed-time ESO is designed for estimating the model uncertainties and external disturbances in an earth-fixed reference frame. Then, a fixed-time target tracking control law is proposed for each follower USV based on the fixed-time ESO. It is proven that the error signals in the closed-loop control system of USVs are convergent to the origin in a fixed time. An example is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed fixed-time resilient cooperative edge-triggered estimation and control architecture for USVs.},

Despite the advances in sensor technologies, we do not have the accuracy needed to guarantee safety under all driving conditions. In fact, for certain road geometries such as going around sharp curves, forward-looking beams and vision cannot see what is around the curve no matter how accurate they are. To ensure safety and driving comfort, the following challenges need to be addressed under all road geometry characteristics and traffic conditions: Effective detection of in-path objects, collision avoidance with objects not visible with exteroceptive sensors, adopting a cautious approach in high noise environment and avoiding high longitudinal and lateral accelerations for driving comfort. This paper presents a methodology and control design that meets these challenges. It incorporates geo-referenced maps to identify road geometries and detect in-path objects. It analyses the impact of noise on sensor data and uses a probabilistic approach to determine the desired velocity. It then proposes a vehicle following controller that achieves robust vehicle following and cruising under all road geometries and in particular sharp curves. In the case of sharp curves, where a possible obstacle is not visible by the on-board sensors, slowing down to a certain speed preemptively to have time to stop is part of the proposed methodology. Simulations show that proposed system fulfills all safety and comfort constraints.},

Since the research object of this paper is Chinese semantics, the characteristics of the Chinese language are considered to make a better performance. Specifically, since the shortcomings of insufficient information representation and single perspectives in the expression of word vector, this paper combines Chinese word vector with Chinese character vector to obtain the information of the text data from different levels. Then, the obtained information is input into the bidirectional long short-term memory neural network-attention mechanism model (BiLSTM-Attention), which makes the overall and local features of the text can be simultaneously extracted. Finally, the experiments illustrate the model BiLSTM-Attention proposed in this paper can effectively and accurately extract the relationship between events, which provides an effective reference for emergency decision-making.},

For this reason, this article focuses on the assessment of automated driving styles with different lane change frequencies and the potential influence of non-driving related tasks. A driving study ( N = 60) was conducted on a German highway under real-world conditions using a vehicle with a prototype automation system. The evaluation of automated driving styles and driving experience of participants was based on well-being, driving comfort, trust in automation, and acceptance of the automation system. The study did not reveal any statistically significant interactions between three non-driving related tasks and two automated driving styles with a low and a high lane change frequency. However, the driving style with a low lane change frequency resulted in significantly more discomfort than the driving style with a high lane change frequency. Furthermore, the authors confirmed the assumption that intentions of an automated drive and external circumstances, such as time pressure or specific driving scenarios, affect the preferred lane change frequency.},

  abstract     = {Within the field of automated driving, a clear trend in environment perception tends towards more sensors, higher redundancy, and overall increase in computational power. This is mainly driven by the paradigm to perceive the entire environment as best as possible at all times. However, due to the ongoing rise in functional complexity, compromises have to be considered to ensure real-time capabilities of the perception system. In this work, we introduce a concept for situation-aware environment perception to control the resource allocation towards processing relevant areas within the data as well as towards employing only a subset of functional modules for environment perception, if sufficient for the current driving task. Specifically, we propose to evaluate the context of an automated vehicle to derive a multi-layer attention map (MLAM) that defines relevant areas. Using this MLAM, the optimum of active functional modules is dynamically configured and intra-module processing of only relevant data is enforced. We outline the feasibility of application of our concept using real-world data in a straight-forward implementation for our system at hand.

  abstract     = {Advanced automation and information systems are shaping the future of transportation by enabling advanced approaches, such as ecodriving control strategies, which improve safety and energy efficiency of personal transport. This paper contributes to the field of ecodriving control by developing a novel approach capable to deal with curvy roads, combining road grade and curvature look ahead to keep the driving comfortable, while also considering pollutant emissions. The formulation and solution of emission aware ecodriving as an optimal control problem is presented and, more specifically, a novel switching Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is proposed. Its feasibility and potential are shown by means of simulation case studies based on real world test cases, a validated vehicle model, and measured road topology. Hence, it is shown that emission aware ecodriving is a viable option and that developers of future ecodriving systems should expand their focus from solely energy efficiency towards additional targets.},

However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, all of the existing works address only constant or time-varying constraint functions. In this work, we study path-dependent constraint requirements, which explicitly depend on the path parameter, instead of depending on the time variable directly. This approach is more practical in reality, where the constraint requirements are often shaped by the environment boundaries. From the system users’ perspectives, it is also much easier to define constraint functions based on the path parameter. A modified version of the universal barrier function is used in the analysis of path-dependent constraint requirements. We show that under the proposed novel control scheme, the vehicle’s line-of-sight distance and angle error terms can converge into small sets near the equilibrium with a fixed-time convergence rate, while the path-dependent constraint requirements are satisfied at all time. A simulation and an experiment study further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.},

This article proposes an integrative framework to analyze pedestrian behavior in shared spaces with AVs. Following the “perception-cognition-action” cycle, the proposed framework breaks down pedestrian behavior into 3 parts: 1. Sensation and Perception; 2. Emotion and Cognition; 3. Action and Communication. The framework is used to review and synthesize current knowledge on pedestrian behavior in urban shared spaces. Studies involving pedestrians in shared environments with AVs are limited. Since an AV can be seen as a hybrid of a conventional car and a mobile robot, this review includes studies on pedestrian behavior with conventional cars and with mobile robots as well as with AVs. Examining pedestrian behavior in these three situations of interaction allows us to make assumptions about how humans will behave in sharing their urban spaces with AVs. The reviewed interactions reveal that pedestrians have diverse and imperfect behaviors. AVs must consider this variety of behaviors and follow socially compliant rules in order to be understood and accepted by pedestrians. Perspectives for AVs in shared spaces and research directions are also identified.},

This challenge can be mitigated with effective operator intent recognition, which can configure automated systems in context-specific situations where the driver intends to perform a steering maneuver. In this article, an ensemble learning-based driver intent recognition strategy has been developed. A nonlinear model predictive control algorithm has been designed and implemented to generate haptic feedback for lateral vehicle guidance, assisting the drivers in accomplishing their intended action. To validate the framework, operator-in-the-loop testing with 30 human subjects was conducted on a steer-by-wire platform with a virtual reality driving environment. The roadway scenarios included lane change, obstacle avoidance, intersection turns, and highway exit. The automated system with learning-based driver intent recognition was compared to both the automated system with a finite state machine-based driver intent estimator and the automated system without any driver intent prediction for all driving events. Test results demonstrate that semi-autonomous vehicle performance can be enhanced by up to 74.1% with a learning-based intent predictor. Further, the learning-based model has a 30.9% higher driver intent recognition accuracy than the finite state machine-based method. The holistic framework that integrates human intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and vehicle control can help solve the driver-system conflict problem leading to safer operation.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a less-disturbed ecological driving strategy for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The proposed strategy integrates the offline planning and the online tracking. In offline planning, an energy efficient reference speed is created based on traffic information (such as the average traffic speed) and characteristics of the vehicle (such as the engine efficiency map) via dynamic programming. The consideration of average traffic speed in speed planning avoids selfish optimisations. In online tracking, model predictive control is employed to update the vehicle speed in real-time to track the reference speed. A key challenge in applying ecological driving strategies in real driving is that the vehicle has to consider other traffic participants when tracking the reference speed. Therefore, this paper combines both longitudinal control and lateral control to achieve better speed tracking by overtaking the preceding vehicle when necessary. The proposed less-disturbed ecological driving strategy has been evaluated in simulations in both single road segment scenario and real traffic environment. Comparisons of the proposed method with benchmark strategies and human drivers are made. The results demonstrate that the proposed less-disturbed ecological driving strategy is more effective in energy saving. Compared to human drivers, the less-disturbed eco-driving strategy improves the fuel efficiency of CAVs by 4.53%.},

  abstract     = {As a non-invasive method, vision-based driver monitoring aims to identify risky maneuvers for intelligent vehicles and it has gained an increasing interest over recent years. However, most existing methods tend to design models for specific tasks, such as head pose or gaze estimation, which results in redundant models hampering real time applications. Besides, most driver facial monitoring methods ignore the correlation of different tasks. In this work, we propose a unified framework based on cascade learning for simultaneous facial landmark detection and head pose estimation, as well as simultaneous eye center detection and gaze estimation. In particular, built upon the key idea that facial landmark locations and 3D face model parameters are implicitly correlated, we introduce a cascade regression framework to achieve these two tasks simultaneously. After coarsely extracting the driver’s eye region from the detected facial landmarks, we perform cascade regression for simultaneous eye center detection and gaze estimation. Leveraging the power of cascade learning allows our method to alternatively optimize facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, eye center localization, and gaze prediction. The comparison experiments conducted on benchmark datasets of 300-W, GI4E, BU, MPIIGaze, and driving dataset of SHRP2 demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance with robust effectiveness on the real driver monitoring applications.},

  abstract     = {The Motion Cueing Algorithm (MCA) is the main unit of motion simulators responsible for transforming the vehicle motions to generate driving motion sensation for the simulator users within the motion simulator&#39;s physical workspace through washout filters. In this study, we design and provide a new framework by developing a set of novel washout filters using optimized fuzzy control systems to solve the drawbacks associated with the existing optimal MCAs of the motion simulators. These drawbacks include constant washout filter parameters, inefficient simulator movement in the workspace, lack of considering the simulator&#39;s physical constraints and driver sensation-related factors, and sub-optimal settings which causes false motion cues and subsequently simulator sickness. As a pioneering framework, the fuzzy logic controllers generate restitution signals for the optimal washout filters based on the motion sensation error between the real vehicle and simulator divers as well as the platform&#39;s position in the workspace aiming to correct the filtered signals, reduce error, generate realistic motions, and increase motion fidelity online. The GA is applied to optimize the fuzzy logic membership functions and control rules. The optimization procedure takes into account a number of important factors that are normally ignored in the current MCAs including the sensed motion error between the drivers of simulator and real car; the platform physical constraints; the motion threshold limiter effects; and signal shape following. The new adaptive MCA is designed, implemented and tested using the MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the developed MCA in maximizing motion fidelity and the reference sensation shape following, and enhancing the workspace usage of the simulator.},

The traditional model-based controllers usually degrade significantly in this case. With the development of artificial intelligence, learning-based control methods are emerging as promising alternatives. These methods require a tremendous amount of training data to achieve acceptable performances. However, the data collection process is costly or inefficient. To solve this problem, we propose a parallel learning-based steering control method. Specifically, we first build a neural network (NN) based trajectory generative model (GeneratingNN) based on limited steering-trajectory raw data. The GeneratingNN can efficiently generate sufficient steering-trajectory data by enumerating the allowable steering actions sequences. Then, based on the raw data and generated data, we train another NN (RecallingNN) to learn the inverse mapping relationship between steering actions and trajectories. Hence, the RecallingNN can efficiently recall appropriate steering actions once given the previewed trajectory points. In addition, to further enhance the control accuracy and robustness, we use a simple feedback controller to handle the unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance. Testing results validate that the proposed method can achieve better tracking accuracy, stability and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicle racing has emerged as vibrant, innovative technology development, demonstration platform in recent years. Universities, companies demonstrate their achievements on various vehicles - from 1:10th to full-scale prototypes. One of those platforms is the Dallara AV-21, and the spec-vehicle for the Indy Autonomous Challenge. This paper outlines the robust model predictive control (MPC) concept used within the software stack of the TUM Autonomous Motorsport team. It is based on a simplified friction-limited point mass model and a set of low-level feedback controllers. The remaining model uncertainties are managed via introducing a constraint-tightening approach based on a Tube-MPC approach. In contrast to classical tracking controllers, the optimization problem is formulated to freely optimize the trajectory while staying within certain maximum deviations of the reference. This approach allows to rely on a coarse output of the trajectory planning approach while maintaining smoothness requirements in steering, throttle, and brake actuation. The paper highlights the advantages of the proposed robust reoptimization concept compared to pure tracking formulations. It showcases the performance compared to a classical LQR controller and an MPC, which utilizes a vehicle model with a more sophisticated tire model.

However, since charging behaviors of EVs show large uncertainties, the forecasting of EVCS charging power is non-trivial. This paper tackles this issue by proposing a reinforcement learning assisted deep learning framework for the probabilistic EVCS charging power forecasting to capture its uncertainties. Since the EVCS charging power data are not standard time-series data like electricity load, they are first converted to the time-series format. On this basis, one of the most popular deep learning models, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is used and trained to obtain the point forecast of EVCS charging power. To further capture the forecast uncertainty, a Markov decision process (MDP) is employed to model the change of LSTM cell states, which is solved by our proposed adaptive exploration proximal policy optimization (AePPO) algorithm based on reinforcement learning. Finally, experiments are carried out on the real EVCSs charging data from Caltech, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, USA, respectively. The results and comparative analysis verify the effectiveness and outperformance of our proposed framework.},

This paper proposes an approach to search for the Pareto optimal information flow topology off-line for the control of connected vehicles’ platoon using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. Based on the obtained Pareto optimal information flow topology, the platoon&#39;s overall performance in terms of three main performance indices: tracking index, acceleration standard deviation, and fuel consumption, are all improved. Numerical simulations are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the simulation, the impact of different information flow topologies on the performance of the connected autonomous vehicles platoon is firstly investigated. The results show that more communication links can lead to better tracking ability. The smoothness of the velocity profile is consistent with fuel economy, while velocity profile&#39;s smoothness, fuel economy and communication efficiency are in contrary to the tracking index. Then, five cases are discussed using the Pareto optimal information flow topology.

  abstract     = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to revolutionize road transportation in terms of safety and efficiency, offering important societal, economic, and environmental benefits. In this work, we harness CAV capabilities, such as seamless connectivity and fine-grained control to safely and efficiently coordinate a set of CAVs crossing an unsignalized intersection. Coordinated control is achieved by generating an acceleration profile for each CAV to simultaneously optimize fuel consumption and travel time. As the resulting problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, we design a novel centralized solution approach. First, we construct a relaxed reformulation of the problem by ignoring certain safety constraints to eliminate interdependence between the trajectories of CAVs traveling in the same lane. Because the relaxed problem is still non-convex, we develop a custom convex-concave procedure that yields the travel time of each CAV to traverse the intersection without lateral collisions. Finally, the derived travel times are utilized to construct collision-free trajectories for all CAVs using convex optimization. Elaborating on principles from the centralized approach, we also introduce a decentralized scheme that solves the problem on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis. Extensive simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed solution approaches in terms of solution quality and execution speed. Simulation results also highlight the importance of optimizing the trade-off between travel time and fuel consumption as small sacrifices in travel time lead to substantial fuel savings. Finally, simulation results indicate that the simultaneous coordination of a set of CAVs yields significant performance benefits compared to decentralized control.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop a mechanical system inspired microscopic traffic model to characterize the longitudinal interaction among a chain of vehicles. In particular, we propose a mass-spring-damper-clutch based car-following (CF) model that can naturally capture the car-following behavior of a rational driver. Specifically, the spring and damper can well characterize the driver’s tendency to maintain the same speed as the vehicle ahead while keeping a (speed-dependent) desired spacing. It is also capable of characterizing the impact of the following vehicle on the preceding vehicle, which is generally neglected in existing models. A new string stability criterion is defined for the considered multi-vehicle dynamics, and stability analysis is performed on the system parameters and time delays. An efficient online parameter identification algorithm, sequential recursive least squares with inverse QR decomposition (SRLS-IQR), is developed to estimate the driving-related model parameters. These real-time estimated parameters can be employed in advanced longitudinal control systems to enable accurate prediction of vehicle trajectories for improved safety and fuel efficiency. The proposed model and the parameter identification algorithm are validated on NGSIM, a naturalistic driving dataset, as well as our own connected vehicle driving data. Promising performance is demonstrated.},

In platooning, vehicles follow one another according to an agreed-upon control law that determines vehicle separation. We show that a vehicle within a platoon and under the control of a malicious actor could cause collisions or decrease the efficiency of surrounding vehicles. This paper focuses on detecting, identifying, and mitigating so-called destabilizing attacks that could cause vehicle collisions. Our approach is decentralized and requires only local sensor information for each vehicle to identify the vehicle responsible for the attack and then deploy an appropriate mitigating controller that prevents collisions. We use a Deep Learning approach (Convolutional Neural Network) with various data preprocessing techniques to detect and identify the malicious vehicle. Results indicate that even with decent noise levels in range and relative speed data, we achieve accuracy up to 96.3%. Also, once the adversarial vehicle is localized, we derive conditions for controller gains using the Routh Hurwitz criterion to mitigate the attack and ensure the stability of the platoon. Realistic simulator CARLA and MATLAB simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.},

Car-following models are widely developed to characterize the human-drivers’ car-following manoeuvre actions and adopted in traffic simulation and automated vehicle control system development. Car-following models need to be able to represent the drivers’ behaviour while following preceding vehicles. On the other hand, car-following controllers are an important component of intelligent vehicle systems, both for autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles. However, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) as well as Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) do not include human behaviour, which makes their car-following behaviour not human-like or natural for the on-board driver or passenger. To address this problem, in this study, the human-like Wiedemann car-following model is calibrated and verified with our driving simulator data. A human-like car-following nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) controller is developed based on the calibrated car-following model. Three different scenarios are tested to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller, with which the autonomous vehicle is able to have human-like and smooth trajectories at different phases and within different transition zones.},

  abstract     = {High-precision localization is an important task for intelligent vehicles. Previous studies have used the raw point cloud for mapping and localization. The problems with this method are the large storage requirement of the map for localization in large-scale areas, and the many meaningless points that do not contribute to localization, and may even degenerate localization results, and result in drift and failure in the map matching process. This paper presents a robust localization method for intelligent vehicles based on the proposed compressed road scene map to solve these problems. This work consists of three parts: mapping, map matching, and sensor fusion. For mapping, the point cloud is first converted to 3D occupancy grids, and the grids are projected on a plane perpendicular to the ground and parallel to the longitudinal direction. This will produce a 2D grid map, which we name a compressed road scene map because it can reflect the depth of the road scene. For map matching, a Monte Carlo framework is used to sample several hypothetical real-time compressed road scenes, and the normalized information distance is used to measure the similarity between the hypothetical real-time compressed road scenes and the compressed road scene map. For sensor fusion, vehicle motion data provided by the IMU and wheel encoders are fused with the map matching result. The experimental results show that the storage of the compressed road scene map decreases substantially compared with the raw point cloud. The robustness and precision of the proposed localization method is also demonstrated via real-vehicle experiments in large-scale areas.},

A majority of approaches used in providing safety guarantees for AV motion control originate from formal methods, especially reachability analysis (RA), which relies on mathematical models for the dynamic evolution of the system to provide guarantees. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have been no review papers dedicated to describing and interpreting state-of-the-art of formal methods in the context of AVs. In this work, we provide both an overview of the safety verification, validation, and certification process, as well as a review of formal safety techniques that are best suited to AV applications. We also propose a unified scenario coverage framework that can provide either a formal or sample-based estimate of safety verification for full AVs. Finally, challenges and future opportunities beyond the scope of current published research for assured AV safety are presented.},

This work presents a novel approach to address the aforementioned shortcomings by identifying collision-free driving corridors that represent spatio-temporal constraints for motion planning using set-based reachability analysis. We derive a suitable formulation of collision avoidance constraints from driving corridors that can be integrated into arbitrary nonlinear programs as well as (successive) convexification procedures. When combining our approach with existing motion planning methods based on continuous optimization, trajectories can be planned in arbitrary traffic situations in a computationally efficient way.

  abstract     = {Reinforcementlearning holds the promise of allowing autonomous vehicles to learn complex decision making behaviors through interacting with other traffic participants. However, many real-world driving tasks involve unpredictable perception errors or measurement noises which may mislead an autonomous vehicle into making unsafe decisions, even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these risks, to ensure safety under perception uncertainty, autonomous vehicles are required to be able to cope with the worst case observation perturbations. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel observation adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust lane change decision making of autonomous vehicles. A constrained observation-robust Markov decision process is presented to model lane change decision making behaviors of autonomous vehicles under policy constraints and observation uncertainties. Meanwhile, a black-box attack technique based on Bayesian optimization is implemented to approximate the optimal adversarial observation perturbations efficiently. Furthermore, a constrained observation-robust actor-critic algorithm is advanced to optimize autonomous driving lane change policies while keeping the variations of the policies attacked by the optimal adversarial observation perturbations within bounds. Finally, the robust lane change decision making approach is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows based on different densities. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only enhance the performance of an autonomous vehicle but also improve the robustness of lane change policies against adversarial observation perturbations.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain has been forming the central piece of various types of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) network for trusted data exchange. Recently, permissioned blockchains garner particular attention thanks to their improved scalability and diverse needs from different organizations. One representative example of permissioned blockchain is Hyperledger Fabric (“Fabric”). Due to its unique execute-order procedure, there is a critical need for a client to select an optimal number of peers. The interesting problem that this paper targets to address is the tradeoff in the number of peers: a too large number will degrade scalability while a too small number will make the network vulnerable to faulty nodes. This optimization issue gets especially challenging in V2X networks due to mobility of nodes: a transaction must be executed, and the associated block must be committed before the vehicle leaves a network. To this end, this paper proposes a mechanism for selecting an optimal set of peers based on reinforcement learning (RL) to keep a Fabric-empowered V2X network impervious to dynamicity due to mobility. We model the RL as a contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. The results demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed scheme.},

When vehicle platoons encounter vehicle to vehicle wireless communication failures, the preceding vehicle’s acceleration is unavailable, which degrades the performance of the system. However, the existing achievements can not be directly used to address the aforementioned three issues. To this end, a generalized extended state observer-based control (GESOBC) law is contrived. First, the parameter uncertainties and the external disturbances are together regarded as a lumped disturbance. Then, a generalized extended state observer is designed to estimate the lumped disturbance and the preceding vehicle’s acceleration, separately. Based on the estimation, a composite controller consisting of a state feedback control part and an estimation-based feedforward control part is developed. Furthermore, it is proved that the proposed GESOBC method can guarantee the exponentially bounded stability of the individual vehicle and the input to state string stability of the whole vehicle platoon. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.},

This is mainly ascribed to the generation of a collision-free trajectory cluster based on the speed and the path re-planning. The upper-layer controller is to generate a reference quintic polynomial trajectory based on the Sequential Quadratic Programming by assuming mild speed and acceleration variations of the surrounding vehicles. The waypoints and time stamps can be obtained via the reference trajectory. When the assumption is invalid under complex driving conditions, the middle-layer controller would generate a Quadratic Programming-based trajectory cluster to assign different time stamps to each waypoint through time-based sampling methods. The lower-layer controller would be triggered to create a new feasible trajectory based on the path sampling if the collision avoidance requirements are not satisfied. The host vehicle will return to its original lane if no feasible time window is available to perform a lane change maneuver under the vehicle kinematics and lane change time/displacement constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified under various scenarios through comprehensive simulations.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving technologies have received notable attention in the past decades. In autonomous driving systems, identifying a precise dynamical model for motion control is nontrivial due to the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty in vehicle dynamics. Recent efforts have resorted to machine learning techniques for building vehicle dynamical models, but the generalization ability and interpretability of existing methods still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a pure data-driven vehicle modeling approach based on deep neural networks with an interpretable Koopman operator. The main advantage of using the Koopman operator is to represent the nonlinear dynamics in a linear lifted feature space. In the proposed approach, a deep learning-based extended dynamic mode decomposition algorithm is presented to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator. A multi-step prediction loss function is used in the training process, enabling a long-term prediction capability. Furthermore, a data-driven model predictive controller with the learned Koopman model is designed for velocity profile tracking control of autonomous vehicles. Simulation results in a high-fidelity CarSim environment show that our approach outperforms previously developed traditional and advanced modeling methods. Velocity profile tracking tests of the autonomous vehicle are also performed in the CarSim environment. The results show that our approach has better tracking accuracy and higher computational efficiency than the model predictive control algorithms using a nonlinear model and a linear time-varying model.},

However, most existing studies focus on ideal traffic environments and ignore potential vehicle failures in traffic systems, which pose significant threats to traffic safety. Therefore, the fault-tolerant capacity of the existing cooperative driving strategies is questionable. To fill this research gap, this paper proposes a fault-tolerant cooperative driving strategy for signal-free intersections by modeling potential vehicle failure types, aiming to keep a good balance between traffic safety and efficiency. Notably, a rule-based fault-tolerant model is constructed to mitigate the threat of potential vehicle failures to traffic safety and efficiency, and to effectively recover the cooperative driving system after vehicle failures occur. Theoretical analysis and simulation results jointly demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed model in achieving fault tolerance and improving traffic efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles are becoming more popular all over the world. With increasing battery capacities and a growing fast-charging infrastructure, they are becoming suitable for long-distance travel. However, queues at charging stations could lead to long waiting times, making efficient route planning even more important. In general, optimal multi-objective route planning is extremely computationally expensive. We propose an adaptive charging and routing strategy, which considers driving, waiting, and charging time. For this, we developed a multi-criterion shortest-path search algorithm using contraction hierarchies. To further reduce the computational effort, we precompute shortest-path trees between the known locations of the charging stations. We propose a central charging station database (CSDB) that helps estimating waiting times at charging stations ahead of time. This enables our adaptive charging and routing strategy to reduce these waiting times. In an extensive set of simulation experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of our concept, which reduces average waiting times at charging stations by up to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$97 \,\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .

  abstract     = {Automotive radar provides reliable environmental perception in all-weather conditions with affordable cost, but it hardly supplies semantic and geometry information due to the sparsity of radar detection points. With the development of automotive radar technologies in recent years, instance segmentation becomes possible by using automotive radar. Its data contain contexts such as radar cross section and micro-Doppler effects, and sometimes can provide detection when the field of view is obscured. The outcome from instance segmentation could be potentially used as the input of trackers for tracking targets. The existing methods often utilize a clustering-based classification framework, which fits the need of real-time processing but has limited performance due to minimum information provided by sparse radar detection points. In this paper, we propose an efficient method based on clustering of estimated semantic information to achieve instance segmentation for the sparse radar detection points. In addition, we show that the performance of the proposed approach can be further enhanced by incorporating the visual multi-layer perceptron. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experimental results on the popular RadarScenes dataset, achieving 89.53% mean coverage and 86.97% mean average precision with the IoU threshold of 0.5, which is superior to other approaches in the literature. More significantly, the consumed memory is around 1MB, and the inference time is less than 40 ms, indicating that our proposed algorithm is storage and time efficient. These two criteria ensure the practicality of the proposed method in real-world systems.},

Trajectory prediction is one core function of an autonomous vehicle. This study proposes an Attention-based Interaction-aware Trajectory Prediction (AI-TP) for traffic agents around the autonomous vehicle. With an encoder-decoder architecture, the AI-TP model uses Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to describe the interactions of traffic agents and Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) to carry out predictions. Based on the attention mechanism, the AI-TP model constructs graphs from various traffic scenes to predict trajectories of different types of traffic agents. Traffic data from both the high-way (i.e., NGSIM) and urban road areas (i.e., ApolloScape and Argoverse) are used to evaluate the performance of the AI-TP model. Numerical results demonstrate that the AI-TP model requires less inference time and achieves better prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the AI-TP model improves the performance with much less inference time on the NGSIM dataset, which shows the promise of predicting trajectories under various scenarios.

Estimating the driver’s visual attention can help a vehicle understand the awareness state of the driver, providing important contextual information. While estimating the exact gaze direction is difficult in the car environment, a coarse estimation of the visual attention can be obtained by tracking the head pose. Since the relation between head pose and gaze direction is not one-to-one, this paper proposes a formulation based on probabilistic models to create salient regions describing the driver’s visual attention. The area of the estimated region is small when the model has high confidence, which is directly learned from the data. We use Gaussian process regression (GPR) to implement the framework, comparing the performance with different regression formulations such as linear regression and neural network based methods. We evaluate these frameworks by studying the tradeoff between spatial resolution and accuracy of the probability map using naturalistic recordings collected with the UTDrive platform. We observe that the GPR method produces the best result creating accurate estimations with localized salient regions. For example, the 95% confidence region is defined by an area covering 3.77% region of a sphere surrounding the driver.},

  abstract     = {Understanding urban scenes is a fundamental ability requirement for assisted driving and autonomous vehicles. Most of the available urban scene understanding methods use red-green-blue (RGB) images; however, their segmentation performances are prone to degradation under adverse lighting conditions. Recently, many effective artificial neural networks have been presented for urban scene understanding and have shown that incorporating RGB and thermal (RGB-T) images can improve segmentation accuracy even under unsatisfactory lighting conditions. However, the potential of multimodal feature fusion has not been fully exploited because operations such as simply concatenating the RGB and thermal features or averaging their maps have been adopted. To improve the fusion of multimodal features and the segmentation accuracy, we propose a multitask-aware network (MTANet) with hierarchical multimodal fusion (multiscale fusion strategy) for RGB-T urban scene understanding. We developed a hierarchical multimodal fusion module to enhance feature fusion and built a high-level semantic module to extract semantic information for merging with coarse features at various abstraction levels. Using the multilevel fusion module, we exploited low-, mid-, and high-level fusion to improve segmentation accuracy. The multitask module uses boundary, binary, and semantic supervision to optimize the MTANet parameters. Extensive experiments were performed on two benchmark RGB-T datasets to verify the improved performance of the proposed MTANet compared with state-of-the-art methods. 1},

To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a contrastive learning approach with the aim of building a model that can quantify driver anomalies with a continuous variable. In addition, a novel clustering supervised contrastive loss is proposed to optimize the distribution of the extracted representation vectors to improve the model performance. Compared with the typical contrastive loss, the proposed loss can better cluster normal representations while separating abnormal ones. The abnormality of driver activity can be quantified by calculating the distance to a set of representations of normal activities rather than being produced as the direct output of the model. The experiment results with datasets under different modes demonstrate that the proposed approach is more accurate and robust than existing ones in terms of recognition and quantification of unknown abnormal activities.},

Largely this uncertainty is caused by other traffic participants, e.g., surrounding vehicles. Future motion of surrounding vehicles is often difficult to predict. Whereas robust control approaches achieve safe, yet conservative motion planning for automated vehicles, Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) provides efficient planning in the presence of uncertainty. Probabilistic constraints are applied to ensure that the maximal risk remains below a predefined level. However, safety cannot be ensured as probabilistic constraints may be violated, which is not acceptable for automated vehicles. Here, we propose an efficient trajectory planning framework with safety guarantees for automated vehicles. SMPC is applied to obtain efficient vehicle trajectories for a finite horizon. Based on the first optimized SMPC input, a guaranteed safe backup trajectory is planned using reachable sets. This backup is used to overwrite the SMPC input if necessary for safety. Recursive feasibility of the safe SMPC algorithm is proved. Highway simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method regarding performance and safety.},
