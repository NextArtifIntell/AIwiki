  abstract     = {Self-organisation in robot swarms can produce collective behaviours, particularly through spatial self-organisation. For example, it can be used to ensure that the robots in a swarm move collectively. However, from a designer’s point of view, understanding precisely what happens in a swarm that allows these behaviours to emerge at the macroscopic level remains a difficult task. The same behaviour can come from multiple different controllers (ie the control algorithm of a robot) and a single controller can give rise to multiple different behaviours, sometimes caused by slight changes in self-organisation. To grasp the causes of these differences, it is necessary to investigate the relationships between the many methods of self-organisation that exist and the various behaviours that can be obtained. The work presented here addresses self-organisation in robot swarms by focusing on the main behaviours that lead to spatial self-organisation of the robots. First, we propose a unified definition of the different behaviours and present an original classification system highlighting ten self-organisation methods that each allow one or more behaviours to be performed. An analysis, based on this classification system, links the identified mechanisms with behaviours that could be considered as obtainable or not. Finally, we discuss some perspectives on this work, notably from the point of view of an operator or designer.},

Three examples of agency at different scales—human, bacterial, and thermodynamic—are presented, which reveal insights into the nature of agency itself, while also illustrating the range of phenomena that theoretical accounts need to address. Three approaches to agency are then explored, an enactive approach and two ecological accounts, Reed’s “effort after meaning and value” and ecological values-realizing theory. These approaches are compared from the perspective of ecological values-realizing theory, noting differences and similarities between them. The article is intended to be exploratory, so that the contributions of each of the three accounts can be appreciated, while posing sharp questions and challenges from an ecological values-realizing perspective. Claims considered include: Agency is characteristic of the ecosystem in its entirety, not only in its organismic components. A defining aspect of agency is the possibility of acting in ways that increase freedom and other values. Values function as ecosystem defining constraints. Agency requires hope and responsibility, going beyond goal-achievement toward increasing the integrity of the ecosystem. Agency is marked by interdependence and self-criticism more than autonomy. Living systems create and increase instability.},

  abstract     = {Immersive learning environments in education provide a set of rich and diverse learning affordances (possibilities). Cognition in such environments can be considered as embodied, enacted, embedded, and extended (the 4Es of cognition). During such cognitive happenings, we assume and live as valid everything we experience. Yet in this enactive structural coupling between individuals and their experiential world, another phenomenon occurs. We become a behaviorally inseparable entity with the virtual/immersive world. We become entangled with that virtual/immersive world. Here we propose that, within the framework of the 4Es of cognition, a recognizable lived experience phenomena occurs when learners engage with virtual or immersive learning environments. That is, cognition becomes entangled in immersive environments with alternative realities. Coming from the Santiago school of cognition, and building from ideas from immersive learning, 4E cognition, and quantum entanglement inspired in quantum cognition, we attempt to describe the process of entangled cognition happening in immersive learning environments. We recognize at least two levels of entanglement from the same recursive phenomenology: one we call a local entanglement, related to perception and sense-making; and a second we call a global entanglement, connected to the process and phenomena of human consciousness and meaning-making, accessible when conceived as a whole. We see the benefits for such a theoretical framework to ultimately guide, justify, and encourage the emergence of an epistemology shift in educational technology towards design principles that account for entangled cognition in immersive learning (and beyond), and the associated possibilities offered by new immersive technologies in education.},

In the present article, we introduce our perspective on the concept of the holobiont mind , a biogenic conception of cognition compatible with the 4E approach and the holobiont theory. We furthermore expand on the idea of the mind as the emerging product of multi-genomic morphology of a composite animal-agent, in ever-changing interaction with its ecological niche. We thus briefly review recent evidence on the brain–gut–microbiome axis and the Microbiome of the Built Environment in order to provide a bridge between the Holobiont Mind and the 4E approach to Cognition , two complementary lines of evidence that have not been linked before, opening novel venues for research with direct impact on health and disease.},

This universal suffering experience called Dukkha refers to the failure to find a Self in reflection or the frustrated desire or craving to have or to be something. For Buddhism, not only the desired object is illusory, but so is the desiring self. Further, Varela et al. (1993) integrate these ideas into the development of cognitive sciences and the understanding of human experience from an embodied and selfless mind perspective. The present article attempts to apply the Buddhist notion of suffering or Dukkha along with Varela, Thompson, and Rosch’s contributions to the understanding of the embodied sense of Self that characterizes symptoms of Depression. The expression of the self-grasping suffering experiences and the tension between reflection and experience for depressive patients will be discussed from an enacted and embodied perspective.

This has given rise to a number of issues that reveal inconsistencies in the understanding and treatment of some crucial aspects of first-person research. In this article, we will outline a research direction aiming at contributing to the establishment of a framework for the study of experience that addresses these inconsistencies. Specifically, we will identify some challenges facing the study of experience—in particular those linked to the understanding of memory, expression and description, and intersubjectivity in exploring experience—and propose to reframe them under the epistemological framework of the enactive approach. Moreover, we will explore the prospect of gaining insight into theoretical and methodological strategies for dealing with these issues by extending our vision beyond the field of cognitive science to its neighboring fields, focusing in particular on the field of somatic practices.},

This paper addresses this limitation by presenting the Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach based on the Embodied, Embedded, Extended, and Enactive perspective, which complements traditional laboratory work while also facilitating ecologically valid applications. First, we briefly review Mobile Brain/Body Imaging technologies used to obtain functional and structural images of the Brain/Body System during natural cognition. Specifically: mobile cognitive electrophysiology, mobile functional neurovascular dynamics, and mobile behavioral measurements. Second, we review the development of Mobile Brain/Body Imaging/4E in Chile. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities. We conclude that although this new epistemic/methodological approach is promising, there is a need for greater portability, robust equipment, and data-analysis tools that can integrate signals from the brain/body-in-the-world system. Future experimental designs need to re-consider their underlying logic and increase their ecological validity by-perhaps-modifying the physical spaces in which experiments are conducted.},

The study of consciousness and subjective experience has been central to philosophy for centuries. However, despite its relevance for understanding cognition and behaviour, the empirical study of consciousness is relatively new, embroiled by the seemingly opposing subjective and objective sources of data. Francisco Varela (1946–2001) pioneered the empirical study of consciousness by developing novel, naturalised and rich approaches in a non-reductive and comprehensive manner. In this article, we review the main conceptual distinctions and philosophical challenges of consciousness research and highlight the main contributions of Varela and his associates: the development of neurophenomenology as a methodological framework that builds a bridge between subjective and objective sources of data and the discovery of gamma-band phase synchronisation as a neural marker of perceptual awareness. Finally, we describe the work of Varela on time consciousness, his philosophical approach and the implementation of his neurophenomenological framework for its study by integrating subjective reports with neural measures.},

  abstract     = {4E cognition (embodied, embedded, extended, and enactive) is a growing, open and pluralistic research tradition that offers new philosophical and scientific avenues to study the mind. Both its origins and current expansive movement are theoretically and geographically diverse. Chile, the mother country of the influential biologists Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana, represents one of its roots, but also, as the variety of contributions in this special issue shows it, one of its fields of new blossoms. In this editorial introduction, regarding the roots, we focus on the enactive approach developed by Francisco Varela and its relationship with Maturana’s autopoietic theory. We discuss the way in which the particular theoretical and historical horizons of these two research programs conditioned, to a large extent, their philosophical stances regarding cognition. Regarding the new blossoms, we introduce the seven articles composing the present special issue and briefly comment on their contributions in terms of methodology, practical applications, theoretical extensions, and conceptual reflection.},

  abstract     = {In Michael Tomasello’s new book, The Evolution of Agency: Behavioral Organization from Lizards to Humans , it posits a close relationship between agency and the evolution of animal and human behavior. Tomasello adopts an integrated perspective, tracing ancient animals to early humans within the constraints of social norms. This book details a fascinating journey through the evolution of agency, therein presenting an innovatively comprehensive framework for analyzing processes of decision-making and behavioral control. Given the current interest in establishing connections among evolving individual agency, we think this book is a timely contribution, particularly for multidisciplinary researchers looking into the domain.},

Sport situations provide appropriate conditions for exploring the interplay between humans and material equipment when users are engaged in a quest for performance. In the present opinion, we discuss the notions of transparency of sports equipment used by athletes, showing that the association between appropriation and transparency is not straightforward. Furthermore, we highlight distinctions between types of sports equipment based on the latter’s behavior in relation to the athlete’s activity. This leads us to suggest three directions of research that should develop a better understanding of the interplay between humans and sports equipment in particular, and more generally the interplay between humans engaged in a quest for performance and their material artefacts.},

Empirical data was used to quantify changes in stroke patients’ movements in a daily life task (drinking water) after participating in a combined rehabilitation program (virtual reality plus conventional therapy). Results of the simulation study reflected the reliability of the Running Procrustes Method to quantify the dissimilarity between trajectories continuously over time. For the empirical data, this method identified critical parts of the drinking water task, providing information that might suggest beneficial effects of the combined program in stroke patients’ daily life tasks.},

  abstract     = {A central question in the evolution of human language is how it emerged. Based on recent research across disciplines, we identified three processes proposed as potential driving factors behind the evolution of ‘modern’ language phenotype: i) a reduction in reactive aggression entailing a boost in prosociality and cooperation, ii) a change in early brain growth trajectory that impacted structures like the cerebellum and striatum, and thus likely impacted the (procedural) memory circuits these regions support, and iii) a demographic expansion of H. sapiens during the Middle Pleistocene. While extensively researched on their own, the interaction between these three processes has yet to be investigated systematically. We develop an abstract agent-based model to interrogate the relationship between these three factors and how they influence transmission of information within a population, which we take to be the essence of language. The model abstracts linguistic capacity to an ‘array of skills’ and investigates under what conditions the number of skills increases. The results demonstrate that there is an optimal degree of cooperation and memory capacity at which the amount of transmitted information is the highest. Our model also shows that separate linguistic communities arise under circumstances where individuals have high levels of memory capacity and there is at least a certain degree of non-cooperation. In contrast, we find no significant direct effects for population size in the process of linguistic community formation. Taken together, these results highlight the explanatory benefits of combining insights from cognitive science, archaeology, and computational modelling.},

Our contribution shows the foundations for a new area of research that we title swarm analytics , whose primary concern is with the design and organisation of collections of swarm markers to understand, detect, recognise, track and learn a particular insight about a swarm system.

How can cognitive science research extend beyond the bounds of its own field to change academia and society? These are precisely the kinds of questions the 2022 Workshop on “Challenges in 4E Cognition and the Opportunities They Present” sought to address. The workshop gathered an interdisciplinary cohort of researchers from philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence to discuss the future of 4E (embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended) cognition research in and outside of Japan. The aim was to identify the most prominent fields in which 4E research is taking place, such as 4E in relation to artificial life, human–computer interfaces, and phenomenology. We strived to articulate the most important open questions in these fields, and understand how adopting a 4E perspective may yield unique ways of answering them, as well as novel avenues of long-term interdisciplinary collaboration. We then discussed how the 4E framework may embed itself as a point of connection between the social and biological sciences, and bridge the gap between academia, medicine, and policymaking, to inform how humans conduct research, think about ourselves, and live life. In this report, we summarize the topics of discussion, the insights garnered, and the practical methods used to ignite discussions and collaborations amongst the researchers in attendance, as a model for future workshops with similar aims.},

We examine the modulation of reading relationship-action sentences in the execution of concurrent motor actions. We manipulated the delay between the sentence display and the visual prompt for motor response: 300 ms and 800 ms. If approach-avoidance verbs recruit motor representations, sentence reading will modulate the execution of the motor action. We found that sentence interfered with motor action at 300 ms delay while facilitated it at 800 ms delay in congruent conditions: approach-forward and avoidance-backward. This result supports that sentence understanding and motor action execution share motor processes. Implications are discussed for embodiment of social cognition in the ambit of relationship actions and their interwoven with language to facilitate social navigation.},

  abstract     = {The tricky question in the plant cognition debate is what theory of cognition should be used to fix the reference of cognitive concepts without skewing the debate too much one way or the other. After all, plants are rather different to animals in many respects: they are not motile, do not possess central nervous systems or even neurons, do not exhibit an invariant morphology, interact with the world in a distributed multi-centred manner, and behave through changes in their physiology. Nonetheless, there is a significant strand in the debate that asserts that plants are indeed cognitive. But what theory of cognition makes sense of this claim without baking in prior zoological assumptions? The aim of this paper is to try out a theory of minimal cognition that makes the claim of plant cognition plausible. It is primarily inspired by the distributed cognition literature and the sensorimotor coordination theory of cognition proposed by van Duijn et al. (2006) . We take a cognitive system to be a coordinated set of semi-autonomous processes running over the organism and items in its environment. Coordination is characterised in terms of two functional conditions that ensure that the system generates goal-directed action in the world. The system is stigmergic in the sense that the material results of its actions in the environment are a crucial part of the processes that coordinate further actions. The account possesses a degree of scale invariance and helps unify cognitive explanation across microorganisms, plants and animals.},

We developed (1) a new geomagnetic sensory augmentation device, the NaviEar, and (2) a battery of tests for automaticity in the use of the device. The NaviEar translates head direction toward north into continuous sound according to a “wind coding” principle. To facilitate automatization of use, its design is informed by considerations of the embodiment of spatial orientation and multi-sensory integration, and it uses a sensory coding scheme derived from means for auditory perception of wind direction that is common in sailing because it is easy to understand and use. The test battery assesses different effects of automaticity (interference, rigidity of responses, and dynamic integration) assuming that automaticity is a necessary criterion to show the emergence of perceptual feel, that is, an augmented experience with perceptual phenomenal quality. We measured performance in simple training tasks, administered the tests for automaticity, and assessed subjective reports through a questionnaire. Results suggest that the NaviEar is easy and comfortable to use and has a potential for applications in real-world situations. Despite high usability, however, a 5-day training with the NaviEar did not reach levels of automaticity that are indicative of perceptual feel. We propose that the test battery for automaticity may be used as a benchmark test for iterative research on perceptual experiences in sensory augmentation and sensory substitution.},

Moreover, benefits from the CRP are often compared among decision-makers, which raises fairness issues. Given these, this paper comprehensively considers these two factors in linguistic GDM modeling. Aiming at the problem of multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) under distributed linguistic assessment (DLA) information, a two-stage group consensus model that considers psychological behaviors with fairness concern is proposed. Subsequently, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model are illustrated by a case of selecting emergency material warehouses related to urban flood disasters. The main innovations and contributions of this paper are as follows. (a) The psychology of individual fairness concern is integrated into the MAGDM process with DLA information. (b) The DLA-based two-stage group consensus model, including the first-stage consensus model with maximum fairness satisfaction degree and the second-stage consensus model with minimum cost, is developed. Compared with the existing consensus models for distributed linguistic MAGDM, the proposed consensus model can not only improve the consensus level on the opinions with minimum cost but also promote the fairness satisfaction degree of decision-makers.},

However, both constructing and evaluating such models remain an open challenge. The most common approaches to evaluating models is to assess their accuracy with respect to observable values. However, the prevailing reliance on estimator accuracy as a proxy for the usefulness of the knowledge has the potential to lead us astray. We demonstrate the conflict between accuracy and usefulness through a series of illustrative examples including both a thought experiment and an empirical example in Minecraft, using the General Value Function framework (GVF). Having identified challenges in assessing an agent’s knowledge, we propose an alternate evaluation approach that arises naturally in the online continual learning setting: we recommend evaluation by examining internal learning processes, specifically the relevance of a GVF’s features to the prediction task at hand. This paper contributes a first look into evaluation of predictions through their use, an integral component of predictive knowledge which is as of yet unexplored.},

The result is an extraordinarily rich set of reflections that critically engage in debate and lay the groundwork for future discussions and empirical research. In this reply, the authors try to highlight the originality of the course-of-experience framework, which is not yet widely known but has the potential to offer a breakthrough in the present-day international ecological-enactive mainstream and an alternative to (Husserlian) phenomenologically inspired enactivist approaches. They also try to set things right concerning the critical dimensions of cognitive ecology, such as the role of material and ‘others’ that they didn’t mention in their original article (in view of the objectives pursued).},

  abstract     = {The target article promotes an enactive approach to human behaviour, highlighting the phenomenology of agent-environment coupling, and is rooted in the course of experience from pre-reflective self-consciousness. In our comment we debate the idea that experience does equate with subjectivity. Such an equation reflects an organismic asymmetry locating behavioural organisation in the subjective mind, interacting with the objective world. In contrast, an ecological realist perspective considers that human behaviour and experience should be captured at the ecological level of analysis, requiring investigation of eco-physical variables. To achieve this aim, researchers need to avoid organismic asymmetries, and instead study performance variables that underpin the symmetry of the agent-environment system. We also debate the place of language and the fact that verbalisation does not equate with subjective experience. According to James Gibson, language focuses on ‘knowledge about the environment’ and not ‘knowledge of the environment’ needed by any autonomous, self-regulating organism, making their way in the world. Last, the target paper promotes the course of in-formation to complement the course of experience, without fully explaining how to deal with potential incongruence and divergence between findings emerging from verbalisation and behavioural aspects of realizing a given activity (the difference between ‘what we say, what we do’). We conclude by considering how our ecological perspective could offer pathways for the presented enactive approach to go beyond the course of in-formation.},

This commentary focuses on two issues. First, experiencing, as event, needs to be analyzed by means of categories that retain the its evental qualities. This cannot be done by attempting to breathe life into people and things through enaction . Second, human life and any of its parts, as irreducibly transactional phenomena, are essentially and originarily social.},

By relying on the enactive paradigm, the Course-of-Experience Framework focuses on singular experiences but does not take individuals as its starting point. Thus, from-within gains a very particular meaning that will be explored here through the concept of event, in Deleuzian terms, the event is neither subjective nor objective in the usual meaning of these words, even though it is a singularity, capable of producing both individual and collective effects. This concept prevents considering subjective experience as a property of individuals. The concept of event is valuable to elucidate the notion of “common experiential ground.”},

  abstract     = {The Course-of-Experience Framework (CEF) represents a promising path forward for embodied and enactive approaches to cognitive science. It aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of representation-hungry activities by grounding cognition in practice. Practice is not merely something that we do as a means to an end, but is constitutive of cognition. Puzzlingly, however, the CEF begins to develop a distributed approach to cognition by viewing individuals through their cultural-cognitive ecology or milieu, before shifting focus to an internalist interpretation of enactive agency. CEF states that the agent enacts their world and discovers themselves through practice, but provides no clear account of organism-environment mutuality. This is problematic because CEF’s notion of practice depends on organism-environment mutuality in its first core assumption. The tendency to downplay the importance of the environment is likely due to a holdover of early enactivist ideas that have sparked tensions between ecological psychology and enactivism in the past. We attempt to re-align the CEF with the enactive project, which we think is gradually shifting away from individualistic concepts like autopoiesis and sense-making toward social and ecological concepts like participatory sense-making and affordances.},

Psychology can benefit by the development of both theories of principle (formal accounts of the structure of phenomena) and constructive theories (formal accounts of the mechanics of phenomena). The course-of-experience method can provide a useful step toward the development of both. Resonances with other work grounded in naturalistic observation identify potential questions that remain as to how the course-of-experience method can address questions about the relationship between individual and collective aspects of experience, but the technique represents a significant boon to the future development of valid cognitive science.},

In this commentary, we discuss the authors&#39; commitment to the enactive notion of sense-making as the activity of an autonomous system that brings forth a meaningful world to maintain its self-constituted identity. From Material Engagement Theory, we hold that defending such a notion leads to unnecessary ontological asymmetries that obscure the fundamental role of materiality for cognition. On the one hand, we argue that the relationship of close intertwinement and co-constitution that unites organism and environment makes it untenable to characterise cognition as being driven by individuals. In our view, cognition arises from the dynamic encounter between brains, bodies and culture. On the other hand, we suggest that organism and environment should not be seen as separate ontological categories that come to interact with each other but as two terms of a transactional process of continuous becoming. Consistently, we propose to consider meaning as emerging from the in-between space that material engagement creates rather than from the activity of an organism.},

Practice is considered to be a relevant unit of analysis for studying cognition-in-the-world and is defined as enacted, lived, situated, embodied, and enculturated. Practice is not viewed as a “context for” but as “constitutive” of the cognitive process itself. This article describes (a) the epistemological foundation and general assumptions of the course-of-experience framework, (b) the associated way of looking at pre-reflective self-consciousness and its relation to practice, (c) the analytical hypothesis derived from Peirce’s semeiotic, and (d) some methodological considerations related to data collection, data processing, and analysis.

Specifically, this includes the problems of self-maintenance and adaptation, and how such activities are to be monitored and corrected in case of their (anticipated) deviation from viable norms. In this paper, it is shown how the functional systems theory of P. K. Anokhin formulated key notions of adaptive control, self-monitoring, and self-detectable (“system-detectable”) error that directly anticipate current debates on neural information and representation, and allow to reframe these debates in new empirical and theoretical perspectives. In addition to showing this on the basis of early (less known and untranslated) works, we analyze how functional systems pose new questions for current research. Specifically, recent discoveries in integrative and cellular neuroscience regarding the biophysical limits of signal summation in neural cells directly confirm Anokhin’s analysis of the integrative activities of the neuron. These findings may have wide implications, and call for new and biologically more specific models of the integrative and semiotic closure of nervous activity, in line with the systemic closure of the organismic functions in which they participate.},

Since such behaviour typically is considered to be ‘representation hungry’, it is often assumed to require the possession of complex cognitive machinery capable of manipulating symbolic representations of the world. However, a series of simulation studies have shown that it can be achieved by very simple embodied artificial agents controlled by evolved recurrent artificial neural networks that are challenging to interpret in symbol-processing terms. In this paper, we extend this paradigm to explore scenarios in which a pair of agents, each of which is privy to a different piece of private information, must jointly solve a task that requires both pieces of information to be communicated, compared and acted upon, i.e., each agent must simultaneously play the role of both signaller and receiver during an unstructured referential communication interaction that is bidirectional . We demonstrate evolved agents that are able to solve this task, and analyse the extent to which their situated, embedded and embodied communicative behaviour can be considered to be a step towards understanding the minimal cognitive basis for human language.},

In this paper, I develop an alternative to both views, which focuses not on the processes in the animal’s head, but on the sociomaterial processes that animals are in and that organize their ongoing activities. Instead of an individual trying to predict the behaviour of another individual based on inferential abilities, the animal is responsive to affordances and how they are nested within the sociomaterial processes that make up the environment. I argue that this depiction of animal social cognition is preferable, because it is allows us to understand the social abilities of nonhuman animals free from our current understanding of human social cognition.},

  abstract     = {The notion of self-organisation plays a major role in enactive cognitive science. In this paper, I review several formal models of self-organisation that various approaches in modern cognitive science rely upon. I then focus on Rosen’s account of self-organisation as closure to efficient cause and his argument that models of systems closed to efficient cause – ( M , R ) systems – are uncomputable. Despite being sometimes relied on by enactivists this argument is problematic it rests on assumptions unacceptable for enactivists: that living systems can be modelled as time-invariant and material-independent. I then argue that there exists a simple and philosophically appealing reparametrisation of ( M , R )–systems that accounts for the temporal dimensions of life but renders Rosen’s argument invalid.},

  abstract     = {Agent-based models, with a history reaching back to the 1940s, have been cited as a useful technique for planning economic development and simulating the effect of economic crashes. These models offer an insightful alternative to the traditional techniques of mathematical modelling. Understanding how different designs of agent-based models change simulation outcomes will be useful for modellers of economic and other simulation scenarios. The work presented here examines how a computer simulation of an agent-based model responds to disruptive events, in the context of an economic model. Agents within the model interact by producing, selling and buying goods. A series of experiments compare system stability in two scenarios: one where a top-down rule is applied to the pricing of goods and another where decision-making is at the individual agent level, a bottom-up approach. These two approaches are termed system-adaptive and self-adaptive. Results draw the conclusion that a self-adaptive function can provide greater stability, but this depends on whether the measured variable is a primary or secondary variable to the adaptive function. Considerations are presented for future work which could consider the impact adaptive functions have on secondary variable measurements.},

  abstract     = {We present three new diagnostic prediction problems inspired by classical-conditioning experiments to facilitate research in online prediction learning. Experiments in classical conditioning show that animals such as rabbits, pigeons, and dogs can make long temporal associations that enable multi-step prediction. To replicate this remarkable ability, an agent must construct an internal state representation that summarizes its interaction history. Recurrent neural networks can automatically construct state and learn temporal associations. However, the current training methods are prohibitively expensive for online prediction —continual learning on every time step—which is the focus of this paper. Our proposed problems test the learning capabilities that animals readily exhibit and highlight the limitations of the current recurrent learning methods. While the proposed problems are nontrivial, they are still amenable to extensive testing and analysis in the small-compute regime, thereby enabling researchers to study issues in isolation, ultimately accelerating progress towards scalable online representation learning methods.},
