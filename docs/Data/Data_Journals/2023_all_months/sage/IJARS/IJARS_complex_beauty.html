  abstract     = {Manipulability quantification and evaluation of robot manipulators plays an important role in robotic mechanism design, motion planning, and control. In this article, a general methodology of using manipulability polytopes to characterize the manipulator’s capability to generate velocities, forces, and accelerations at the end-effector is proposed. This methodology can be used to determine the kinematic, mechanical, and dynamic manipulability of both redundant and nonredundant serial manipulators, where influences of gravity, joint velocities and accelerations, and end-effector payload on the dynamic manipulability are incorporated into the derivation of the manipulability polytopes. Since the manipulability polytope is the feasible region defined by all the joint constraints, the proposed method is suitable for solving the problems including both symmetric and asymmetric joint constraints. Furthermore, a systematic architecture and detailed procedures for performance computation with respect to different types of manipulability of serial robot manipulators are presented. Two typical application examples, respectively, for two and three degree-of-freedom planar manipulators are given to illustrate the correctness and capability of the proposed methodology.},

Finally, picking experiments in a lab will be also conducted in view of diverse indexes, such as the successful grabbing action, flipping–cutting action, flipping–breaking action, average fruit picking time, success rate, and damage rate. It is drawn from experimental results that the success rate of grabbing is 100%, and a success rate for picking is over 80%. An average picking time is about 9.6s, and very few fruits are damaged. Therefore, such a scheme is feasible, further presenting a good reference for designing the entire robot in a field of picking diverse spherical fruits.},

  abstract     = {The manipulate load system of a helicopter driving simulator is a complex mechatronic system. To simulate the load system of the joystick more effectively, this study provides a new manipulate mechanism with automatic position reset function that integrates a spring system within the joystick. The load simulation of this manipulate mechanism can be achieved by designing the nonlinear coefficient of the spring in a reasonable manner, thereby eliminating the need for complex control of motor simulation and system time delay. This greatly simplifies the complexity of the system and effectively meets the requirements of real-time and accuracy. Initially, the new manipulate mechanism is described in detail through kinematic analysis. Then, dynamic simulation is conducted in ADAMS software to simulate the motion of the operation mechanism. Considering the active–passive relationships between the manipulate mechanism and the driving simulator, a mapping is established to achieve synchronized motion. The synchronized motion is subsequently evaluated and verified in MATLAB/Simulink. The results reveal that this new manipulate mechanism has high reliability and can effectively achieve synchronized motion with the driving simulator. The new manipulate mechanism will be useful in advancing research into the design of manipulate mechanism processes.},

In this article, a target recognition method combining underwater generative adversarial network and improved YOLOv4 is proposed, which is named M-YOLOv4. Firstly, the images collected by the underwater inspection robot are enhanced using the underwater generative adversarial network algorithm to obtain the training datasets. Secondly, the YOLOv4 target detection algorithm combines the feature extraction network of MoblieNetv3 for lightweight processing, which reduces the network model size, and reduces the number of algorithm calculations and parameters. Then, change the size of the spatial pyramid pooling module pooling kernel, which can enlarge receptive field and integrate characteristics of different receptive fields. Finally, the processed datasets are transferred to the improved M-YOLOv4 algorithm for training, and the trained model is transplanted to the Jetson Nano hardware device for real-time detection. The results of experiments show that the mean average precision value of the improved M-YOLOv4 recognition is 90.77%, which is 2.02% higher than that of the unimproved one. The frame per second value of the lightweight YOLOv4 algorithm with MobileNetv3 is 27, an increase of 12 compared with YOLOv4. The improved M-YOLOv4 algorithm can perform accurate detection of marine multi-targets on embedded devices.},

  abstract     = {Safety plays a key role when implementing collaborative robots (cobots) in human-shared workspace scenarios. Nevertheless, the significance and understanding of safety-related aspects may significantly vary with different stakeholders’ perspectives. In particular, there is often a misconception that cobots are inherently safe with the result of significantly underestimating the need of adopting adequate safety measures and features for the deployment of collaborative robots in industrial and non-industrial frames. Accordingly, this article develops an in-depth analysis of the stakeholders and their stakes in human–robot collaboration in the manufacturing industry with particular attention to the safety aspects. The proposed approach consists of a field study, with an online questionnaire and structured interviews, directed at the main stakeholders. The field study results are presented and compared with insights from two recent explorative studies. Finally, careful analysis and discussion is provided. This research focuses on three topics: (i) the specific phases in the collaborative robot application cycle, (ii) the stakeholders that are involved in each phase, and (iii) the stakes that affect the stakeholders in general, and specifically the role of safety within these stakes. The findings show that awareness of safety issues is still jeopardized between stakeholders. In addition, key stakeholders still significantly underestimate safety-related issues when implementing cobots in new production lines. This implies the need for objective assessment tools that can systematically address and assess all safety-related aspects. This study provides industry practitioners with a broader view of how different stakeholders regard safety-related aspects in the cobot life cycle. This will enable more informed decision-making when implementing cobot solutions and potentially avoid unconsidered safety risks later on. This article also adds to the scant research on the role of each stakeholder in human–robot collaboration.},

This study proposes a closed-chain singularity processing method for dual-arm collaboration, adopting the Jacobian pseudoinverse method based on damped least squares to obtain an approximate solution. During the solution process, the adaptive damping factor is improved by cubic polynomials, and the optimal damping factor is determined by quadratic sequence programming. Furthermore, this study analyzes the kinematic constraints of the closed-chain system and constructs a closed-chain Jacobian to judge whether the system is in a singular region.

Furthermore, various tools used during the operation were designed and constructed using a 3D printer.

To solve the problem that the controller’s performance highly relies on the accuracy of robotic model, a model-free control idea is introduced where an ultra-local model is established and the estimation of time delay is used to approximate the unknown part of the ultra-local model. Considering the transient performance is a significant element that effects the using security and system stability, the technique of prescribed performance control is introduced to limit the state errors in a prescribed region.

To this end, the present study undertook a structured systematic literature review to assess the relevant research on the concepts, dimensions, user response (including cognitional and behavioral), and recovery strategies related to service robot failure. Prior studies have largely followed interpersonal service interaction concepts and have identified several major consequences of service robot failure, including emotional and cognitive responses, negative attitudes, attributions of failure, and related behavioral and action-based responses. Notably, recovery strategies for robot service failure can be categorized into two main types: robot-initiated strategy and human intervention strategy. Further research on robot service failure is recommended in five key areas, including exploring the uniqueness of robot service failure, psychologically investigating user responses to robot failure, identifying novel remedy strategies for robot service failures, evolving the concepts of robot service failure and its remedies, and employing mixed-method and complementary research approaches.},

  abstract     = {Lower-limb exoskeletons have attracted considerable interest because they can provide impaired individuals with the ability to walk upright. Trajectory generation of walking gait is a crucial issue for lower-limb exoskeletons that has not yet been satisfactorily solved. The purpose of this article is to study a stable gait generation method considering the subjective walking intention. Inspired by the motion synergy between crutches and lower limbs, a stable gait generation method for flat-ground walking was proposed for a lower-limb exoskeleton. The motion synergy in the sagittal plane between the crutch-pitch-angle and step length was validated using theoretical and experimental methods. The synergistic relationship between the maximum crutch-pitch-angle and step-length coefficient was established and optimized. Based on the synergistic relationship, the gait trajectory of the exoskeleton with variable step length can be instinctively generated with a crutch swing. The gait stability of the human-exoskeleton system was modeled and analyzed. Consecutive walking experiments were conducted on flat ground in which a compact lower-limb exoskeleton and pair of instrumented crutches were employed. The results demonstrate that gait based on the synergistic relationship is effective and stable, thereby verifying the feasibility of this human-in-the-loop gait generation method.},

  abstract     = {Visual–tactile fusion information plays a crucial role in robotic object classification. The fusion module in existing visual–tactile fusion models directly splices visual and tactile features at the feature layer; however, for different objects, the contributions of visual features and tactile features to classification are different. Moreover, direct concatenation may ignore features that are more beneficial for classification and will also increase computational costs and reduce model classification efficiency. To utilize object feature information more effectively and further improve the efficiency and accuracy of robotic object classification, we propose a visual–tactile fusion object classification method based on adaptive feature weighting in this article. First, a lightweight feature extraction module is used to extract the visual and tactile features of each object. Then, the two feature vectors are input into an adaptive weighted fusion module. Finally, the fused feature vector is input into the fully connected layer for classification, yielding the categories and physical attributes of the objects. In this article, extensive experiments are performed with the Penn Haptic Adjective Corpus 2 public dataset and the newly developed Visual-Haptic Adjective Corpus 52 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that for the public dataset Penn Haptic Adjective Corpus 2, our method achieves a value of 0.9750 in terms of the area under the curve. Compared with the highest area under the curve obtained by the existing state-of-the-art methods, our method improves by 1.92%. Moreover, compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best results in training time and inference time; while for the novel Visual-Haptic Adjective Corpus 52 dataset, our method achieves values of 0.9827 and 0.9850 in terms of the area under the curve and accuracy metrics, respectively. Furthermore, the inference time reaches 1.559 s/sheet, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The existing deceleration systems in industrial robots often employ rotate vector (RV) or harmonic reducers to augment torque and decrease speed, yet achieving the motor’s peak power proves challenging. Given the extremely high space-size demands for reduction systems in robotic applications, an innovative compact continuously variable transmission is suggested, leveraging the transmission characteristics of spatial gear trains and metallic V-belts. The proposed system utilizes the input of an eccentric shaft to drive the planetary pulley’s rotation around the sun pulley. The pinhole, in cooperation with the eccentric shaft of the planetary pulley, achieves coaxial output of the transmission power. The article primarily explores the transmission and speed change mechanisms, then dissects the relationships between the transmission ratio and the effective radius of the pulley, the axial adjustment distance, and the factors influencing the pulley’s wrapping angle. Further, we use the Lagrange equation to derive the input equation, establishing the correlation between the planetary pulley’s rotation angle and system inertia, angular acceleration, angular velocity, and effective working radius over time. Finally, we simulate the continuously variable transmission’s motion to examine speed changes in forward, reverse, and neutral states. A continuously variable transmission prototype and a testing platform are also constructed to assess performance parameters, specifically input and output torque, and rotational speed.},

We aimed at evaluating its usability and accessibility in a preclinical setting. This was a preclinical feasibility study. Two groups of surgeons, one with three experienced robotic surgeons (group 1) and one with three robotic-surgery naive participants (group 2), performed the following tasks using the hinotori™ system in a simulated preclinical setting: console setup, docking, instrument exchange, undocking, and suturing. Each participant repeated each task three times. The time required for performing each repetition and the count of failed repetitions were the primary outcomes of the study. The subjectively perceived workload in performing the tasks, as measured by the NASA-TLX score, was the secondary outcome. The improvement of participants within the three repetitions as well as a comparison between the performances of group 1 and 2 were evaluated. The time required to perform each task decreased with repetitions for both groups, so did the subjective workload score. The time measures required to perform the tasks and the mental effort scores were comparable between the two groups for the console setup, docking, instrument exchange, and undocking tasks. The NASA-TLX score was also comparable between the two groups for the console setup and the emergency undocking tasks and decreased significantly within all tasks after the third repetition. The incidence of failed repetitions was higher in group 2 for the suturing task, however the difference was not statistically significant. The results confirmed the usability of the hinotori™ system in a preclinical setting for both highly trained surgeons and nonexperienced operators and its accessibility for both long-time users of other systems and first-time users.},

This study demonstrates a landmark-based visual localization framework for unmanned aerial vehicles flying at low altitudes. YOLOv5 and DeepSORT are used for multi-object detection and tracking, respectively. The unmanned aerial vehicle localization is achieved according to the geometric similarity between the geotagged transmission towers and the annotated images captured by a monocular camera. The validation is accomplished both in the Rflysim-based simulation and the quadrotor-based real flight. The localization precision is about 10 m, and the location update frequency reaches 5 Hz with a commercially available entry-level edge artificial intelligence platform. The proposed visual localization strategy needs no satellite image as a reference map, which saves a significant amount of the GPU memory and makes possible the end-to-end implementation on small unmanned aerial vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Exploring people’s attitudes toward the appearance design of social robots in a low-cost and efficient way, and enhancing the experience of human–robot interaction have always been topics of concern for robot developers and interaction designers. This study aimed to explore the influence of the baby schema effect on users’ perceptions of cuteness and trustworthiness pertinent to social robot faces through two experiments. Experiment 1 used 100 uniformly processed pictures of robot faces in the real world to help explore the linear relationship among the degree of baby face, cuteness, and trustworthiness, and received a total of 98 valid questionnaires via the Internet. Experiment 2 was a 5 × 3 within-subjects factorial design. The research variables were robot type (i.e. MAKI, RoboThespian, Flobi, Pepper, and iCat) and baby schema (low schema, uncontrolled, and high schema); their impact on users’ perceptions of cuteness and trustworthiness was investigated. A total of 175 valid questionnaires were collected via the Internet. The generated results are as follows: (1) The degree of baby face and perceived emotion of social robot faces had a positive impact on trustworthiness for most real-world robots. (2) This study obtained the correlation formula of baby face, cuteness, and trustworthiness from a quantitative point of view, thus providing a reference for research on the related credibility of communication robots. (3) In general, baby schema effect also existed in the cuteness evaluation of most real-world robots. Faces with high schema were considered cuter and more trustworthy than uncontrolled or low schema faces. (4) Robot type and baby schema had a significant interaction with cuteness and trustworthiness. (5) However, for certain types of robots, baby schema effect may also have a counter-effect, that is, an overly high baby schema may reduce users’ perceptions of the cuteness and trustworthiness of social robots.},

However, because of the odometer drift that occurs in actual environments, the performance of the paths planned by these algorithms is significantly worse in actual environments than in simulated environments. To address this issue, this article proposes a new Bug algorithm. The proposed algorithm contains a potential field function that is based on the relative velocity, which enables the potential field method to be extended to dynamic scenarios. Using the cumulative changes in the internal and external angles and the reset point of the robot during the wall-following process, the condition for state switching has been redesigned. This improvement not only solves the problem of position estimation deviation caused by odometer noise but also enhances the decision-making ability of the robot. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is simpler and more efficient than existing wall-following algorithms and can realise path planning in an unknown dynamic environment. The experimental results for the Kobuki robot further validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {One of the most significant disadvantages of electric multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles is their short flight time compared to fuel-powered unmanned aerial vehicles. This is mainly due to the low energy density of electric batteries. Fuel has much more energy density when compared to batteries. Electric-powered motors in multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles cannot be replaced with fuel-based engines because the stability and control of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles rely on the high response rates of electric motors. One of the possible solutions to overcome this problem of short endurance times is by using hybrid thrusting systems that combine the advantages of both fuel and electrical propulsion systems, where high maneuverability and long endurance flight time could be achieved. In this work, hybrid thrusting and power systems for multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles are studied. Targeted hybrid thrusting systems consist of combustion engines, electric motors, and their power sources. Then a hybrid thrusting system-based quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle model is developed. The article presents the altitude and attitude control systems of the developed hybrid thrusting system-based unmanned aerial vehicle. The presented hybrid quadcopter model comprises four electric motors and one fuel engine. The fuel engine used in this work is a 4.07 cc internal combustion engine targeting 2–3 kg unmanned aerial vehicles with up to 5 kg maximum takeoff weight. The developed hybrid quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle achieved a 139% improvement in flight time when compared with traditional electric-based quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles. The article also reports on other flight time-related issues such as the optimal fuel mass to battery size ratio to maximize the endurance time of the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles.},

  abstract     = {A type of manipulator configuration with four-fingers is put forward, for grasping fragile hollow workpieces, with adjustable finger length and finger pad shape. Within a certain range, the manipulator can be used to grasp the internal cross section of fragile objects with different size of circular and oval shape. The design idea and structure of the manipulator are introduced, while the join positions between the finger pad and the finger body, as determined by uniform interpolation or Chebyshev interpolation, are comparatively analyzed and researched regarding forming force contact with workpiece. During the process of grasping, the internal forces and deformations between finger pad and workpiece are analyzed, based on a constructed finite element analysis model. The calculation example shows that, under the same grasping parameters, the maximum impact force on the workpiece is reduced by 63%, when the curvature adjustment points for the finger pad are distributed according to the Chebyshev interpolation, compared to their equal spacing distribution. Research has provided a theoretical basis for the design optimization of the finger pad structure and the connection point positions. For using manipulator to grasp objects with different size of circular and oval shape, the working space of the proposed manipulator is studied. The experiments show that, the manipulator structure, as presented in this article, can meet the requirements of relevant tasks.},

To date, two techniques have proved applicable: geolocation using GPS and 3D mapping. In the latter case, the creation of the 3D map is an essential step in preparing the software. This manuscript presents a novel method for creating a high-definition 3D map using a Velodyne sensor. The primary objective is to achieve deeper understanding of the map creation algorithm and to lay the groundwork for future autonomous vehicle architecture. In this manuscript, two high-definition mapping algorithms are applied: the graph simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm and the normal distributions transform algorithm. The results of both displayed different strengths and weaknesses upon creating a high-definition 3D map, which may help other researchers to select the best algorithm in future.},

However, visual simultaneous localization and mapping systems based on RGB image are generally not robust in complex situations such as low-textures or large illumination variations. In order to solve this problem, more environmental information is added by introducing depth information, and a feature extraction and matching algorithm combining depth information is proposed. In this article, firstly, the intrinsic mechanism that depth image is used to extract and match feature points is discussed. Then depth information and appearance information are comprehensively considered to extract and describe feature points. Finally, the matching problem of feature points is transformed into a regression and classification problem, with which a matching model is presented in a data-driven way. Experimental results show that our algorithm has better distribution uniformity and matching accuracy and can effectively improve the trajectory accuracy and drift degree of the simultaneous localization and mapping system.},

At present, the integrated navigation with global navigation satellite system and strapdown inertial navigation system is the most mature and effective navigation technology for unmanned ground vehicle. However, this technique depends on the signal accuracy of global navigation satellite system. When the receiver cannot capture four or more satellite signals for a long time or the satellite completely invalid, it cannot provide accurate navigation and positioning information for the unmanned ground vehicle. Therefore, this article combine the observation information of strapdown inertial navigation system, global navigation satellite system, and laser Doppler velocimeter to propose a high-precision seamless navigation technique of unmanned ground vehicle based on state transformation extended Kalman filter. Under different land vehicle driving environments and global navigation satellite system signal quality conditions, the seamless navigation technique is evaluated through global navigation satellite system interruption simulation and land vehicle experiments. The experimental results show that the strapdown inertial navigation system/global navigation satellite system/laser Doppler velocimeter tightly coupled integration seamless navigation has good environmental adaptability and reliability and can maintain high navigation accuracy under high frequency global navigation satellite system–signal blockage conditions in urban areas.},

In order to improve the thermal error prediction accuracy of long-span truss robot, a thermal error prediction method based on multiple linear regression and long short-term memory network is proposed based on mechanism and data drive. Firstly, the multiple linear regression model is used to predict the thermal error, and the prediction error data processing. Secondly, the long short-term memory network is established. In order to improve the performance of the long short-term memory network more effectively, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the long short-term memory network. Finally, the improved particle swarm optimization–long short-term memory network is used to correct the prediction error of the multiple linear regression model. The experimental results show that the combined thermal error prediction model based on multiple linear regression and improved particle swarm optimization–long short-term memory algorithm has higher prediction accuracy than multiple linear regression model and long short-term memory network.

  abstract     = {Currently, research is being carried out on a new type of parallel robots, such as cable-driven parallel robot. The cable-driven parallel robot are parallel robots with flexible (cables), with a large workspace, with high speeds and accelerations of the end effector. In the cable-driven parallel robot, cables can only work in tension, and cable-driven parallel robot lose their performance when they are compressed. This feature severely limits the development and application of cable-driven parallel robots and requires further development of cable-driven parallel robot modeling on various software systems. Currently, Adams multibody dynamics software is widely used to create and test virtual prototypes of mechanical systems. But for cable-driven parallel robot modeling, the Adams program is quite complex and expensive to use. In this article, the simulation of the cable-driven parallel robot is carried out on the SimulationX software. Unlike other software packages, SimulationX is more accessible and cheaper and is well suited for cable-driven parallel robot simulation. Cable-driven parallel robot modeling on SimulationX allows you to identify the main design flaws even before its prototype is made. A model on the SimulationX software of a suspended cable-driven parallel robot with a point mass end effector, taking into account the elastic-dissipative properties of cables, was developed. The prototype of suspended cable-driven parallel robot with a point mass end effector was manufactured. Experimental researches of the prototype of the suspended cable-driven parallel robot with a point mass end effector confirmed the correctness of the application of the model on SimulationX for practical calculations.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose the visual application of a navigation framework for a wheeled robot to disinfect surfaces. Since dynamic environments are complicated, advanced sensors are integrated into the hardware platform to enhance the navigation task. The 2D lidar UTM-30LX from Hokuyo attached to the front of the robot can cover a wide scanning area. To provide better results in laser scan matching, an inertial measurement unit was integrated into the robot’s body. The output of this combination feeds into a global costmap for monitoring and navigation. Additionally, incremental encoders that obtain high-resolution position data are connected to the rear wheels. The role of the positioning sensor is to identify the existing location of the robot in a local costmap. To detect the appearance of a human, a Kinect digital camera is fixed to the top of the robot. All feedback signals are combined in the host computer to navigate the autonomous robot. For disinfection missions, the robot must carry several ultraviolet lamps to autonomously patrol in unknown environments. To visualize the robot’s effectiveness, our approach was validated using both a virtual simulation and an experimental test. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: (i) a structure for ultraviolet-based hardware was first established; (ii) the theoretical computations for the robot’s localization in the 3D workspace will play a fundamental role in further developments; and (iii) data fusion from advanced sensing devices was integrated to enable navigation in uncertain environments.},

These include the successful application of asynchronous advantage actor-critic, double deep Q-network and other algorithms in multi-agent environments, and the more representative multi-agent training method based on the classical centralized training distributed execution algorithm QMIX. However, in a large-scale multi-agent environment, training becomes a major challenge due to the exponential growth of the state-action space. In this article, we design a training scheme from small-scale multi-agent training to large-scale multi-agent training. We use the transfer learning method to enable the training of large-scale agents to use the knowledge accumulated by training small-scale agents. We achieve policy transfer between tasks with different numbers of agents by designing a new dynamic state representation network, which uses a self-attention mechanism to capture and represent the local observations of agents. The dynamic state representation network makes it possible to expand the policy model from a few agents (4 agents, 10 agents) task to large-scale agents (16 agents, 50 agents) task. Furthermore, we conducted experiments in the famous real-time strategy game Starcraft II and the multi-agent research platform MAgent. And also set unmanned aerial vehicles trajectory planning simulations. Experimental results show that our approach not only reduces the time consumption of a large number of agent training tasks but also improves the final training performance.},

The improvement of the proposed model on the prediction of feasible rolling gaits is quantitatively verified by experiments on a six-strut locomotive tensegrity.

First, two ultra-wide-band modules, the tag installed inside the mobile robot and the anchor installed inside charging station, are used to obtain the relative distance between the mobile robot and the charging station. Second, the global grid map is converted into a map with obstacle noise given the ranging accuracy of the ultra-wide-band modules with different obstacles. Third, while the robot is kidnapped, matching grids are screened based on the range information of ultra-wide-band modules and the obstacle noise of the grids. Finally, global localization algorithm is performed based on ultra-wide-band-based adaptive Monte Carlo localization to convert randomly generated particles from the whole map into randomly generated particles in the local map. Experimental results based on gazebo simulation and a real scenario showed that our global localization algorithm based on improved ultra-wide-band-based adaptive Monte Carlo localization not only significantly helped to improve the chances of the robot global pose recovery from lost or kidnapped state but also enabled the robot kidnap recovery with a smaller number of randomly generated particles, thus reducing the time to recover its accurate global localization.

  abstract     = {In the industrial and military sector, work activities are required transporting or supporting heavy loads manually, affecting this the human spinal column due to the weight of the loads or the repetition of this labor. In this regard, the use of force-enhancing exoskeletons is a potential solution to this issue. Therefore, this article summarizes the state of the art in relevant contributions to structural design, control systems, actuators, and performance metrics to evaluate the proper functioning of exoskeletons used for load support and transfer. This is essential to address current and new open problems in these applications, and this includes reducing the metabolic cost and enhancing the loading force in exoskeletons, in which challenges such as structural design and kinetic interactions between the human and the robot are presented. The systematic review of the strategies found in the literature helps addressing these challenges in an orderly way. The proposal of some alternative solutions could help to solving some of the challenges mentioned above, as well as further research to improve the design of these devices is necessary.},

  abstract     = {Fish is the master of fluid control, with high propulsive efficiency and great maneuverability. Carps are chosen for observations since they are the typical carangiform fish. We add some external stimuli on the fish and observe their responses. It is found that a fish attempts to escape backward or forward depending on the stimuli. The fish tries a greater number of its tail oscillations in a forward escape than in a backward escape. In the case of a forward escape, the retract stroke where the tail gets a concave shape (suitable for higher thrust generation) is faster than the forward stroke where the tail takes a convex shape (suitable for smaller drag), while vice versa in the case of a backward escape. Becoming concave or convex shapes of the tail and being faster or slower strokes all correspond to enhancing fluid momentum in the forward or backward directions where appropriate. The traveling wave of the body propagates backward and forward for the forward and backward escapes, respectively. The results provide a reference for bionic fish design and simulation.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale sheep farming has conventionally relied on barcodes and ear tags, devices that can be difficult to implement and maintain, for sheep identification and tracking. Biological data have also been used for tracking in recent years but have not been widely adopted due to the difficulty and high costs of data collection. To address these issues, a noncontact facial recognition technique is proposed in this study, in which training data were acquired in natural conditions using a series of video cameras, as Dupo sheep walked freely through a gate. A key frame extraction algorithm was then applied to automatically generate sheep face data sets representing various poses. An improved MobilenetV2 framework, termed Order-MobilenetV2 (O-MobilenetV2), was developed from an existing advanced convolutional neural network and used to improve the performance of feature extraction. In addition, O-MobilenetV2 includes a unique conv3x3 deep convolution module, which facilitated higher accuracy while reducing the number of required calculations by approximately two-thirds. A series of validation tests were performed in which the algorithm identified individual sheep using facial features, with the proposed model achieving the highest accuracy (95.88%) among comparable algorithms. In addition to high accuracy and low processing times, this approach does not require significant data pre-processing, which is common among other models and prohibitive for large sheep populations. This combination of simple operation, low equipment costs, and high robustness to variable sheep postures and environmental conditions makes our proposed technique a viable new strategy for sheep facial recognition and tracking.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic motion primitive has been the most prevalent model-based imitation learning method in the last few decades. Gaussian mixed regression dynamic motion primitive, which draws upon the strengths of both the motion model and the probability model to cope with multiple demonstrations, is a very practical and conspicuous branch in the dynamic motion primitive family. As Gaussian mixed regression dynamic motion primitive only learns from expert demonstrations and requires full environmental information, it is incapable of handling tasks with unmodeled obstacles. Aiming at this problem, we proposed the positive and negative demonstrations-based dynamic motion primitive, for which the introduction of negative demonstrations can bring additional flexibility. Positive and negative demonstrations-based dynamic motion primitive extends Gaussian mixed regression dynamic motion primitive in three aspects. The first aspect is a new maximum log-likelihood function that balances the probabilities on positive and negative demonstrations. The second one is the positive and negative demonstrations-based expectation–maximum, which involves iteratively calculating the lower bound of a new Q-function. And the last is the application framework of data set aggregation for positive and negative demonstrations-based dynamic motion primitive to handle unmodeled obstacles. Experiments on several typical robot manipulating tasks, which include letter writing, obstacle avoidance, and grasping in a grid box, are conducted to validate the performance of positive and negative demonstrations-based dynamic motion primitive.},

  abstract     = {Based on camera calibration in detection area, an improved method of time interpolation for vehicle speed identification is proposed. Firstly, calibration of camera parameters during photogrammetry is carried out through preset rectangular detection area. Secondly, the key frames are extracted from the video images and the target vehicle feature points and their image coordinates are identified by the image morphological processing. Then the actual coordinates of the characteristic points are determined through the coordinate conversion. Finally, the improved time interpolation method considering the acceleration between frames is used to identify the vehicle speed, so as to improve the accuracy of the vehicle speed measurement. The results proved that the vehicle speed calculated by improved time interpolation method is more reliable, and the error is reduced by 0.7%.},

  abstract     = {This study aimed to analyze the kinematic development of a rehabilitation cable robot for patients with cerebral palsy problems. For this purpose, the walking pattern of a healthy person was analyzed in the robot by extracting his kinematic model. Therefore, a seven-link model was considered, and changes in the mass center of the links and then movements during the gait cycle were obtained with the angles related to joint changes. Next, the person’s integration with the rehabilitation cable robot was investigated with the resolution of the direct kinematic problem. In addition, the change-related outputs of the cables were obtained by the person’s movement and the attached belt. The robot was further proposed because the specific change diagram of the cables facilitates understanding how much motor torque is needed to change the length of the cable. It is noteworthy that the static person balance is provided in the existing rehabilitation robots. However, in this structure, the balance is done by the six degrees of freedom robot so that the robot can return the person to the original path when he loses his balance. Cable systems for the lower limbs (thighs and shanks) are also simulated to rehabilitate the patient. The obtained results from the simulation and the obtained output from kinematic equations for lower limb movements were also compared, and the highest deference was 2.2, 1.8, 1.8, and 1.5% for shank-back, shank-front, thigh-back, and thigh-front of the leg in the corresponding points in the outputs of both software, respectively.},
