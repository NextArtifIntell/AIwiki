  abstract     = {For scientists conducting research, fractional integral differential equation analysis is crucial. Therefore, in this study, we investigate analysis utilizing a novel method called the fractional decomposition method, which is applicable to fractional nonlinear fractional Fredholm integro-differential equations. Then, we apply the approach to five test problems for a general fractional derivative β involving fractional Fredholm integro-differential equations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to ever do so because of the very complicated calculations involved when dealing with the general case β . For fractional Fredholm integral-differential equations, we provide both exact and approximate solutions. Throughout this work, the fractional Caputo derivative is discussed. This technique leads us to say that the method is precise, accurate, and efficient, according to the theoretical analysis.},

In other words, we want to find the biggest hole in the dataset that can contain the biggest possible rectangle. A new algorithm for dealing with this problem is, therefore, suggested. Existing algorithms are exact but cannot deal efficiently with problems in high dimensions and large instances. In fact, only computing maximum empty rectangles in a set of points in 2 d , 3 d has been well addressed. In high dimensions, the problem is shown to be NP-complete. Our suggested approach is evolutionary in nature and is an innovative implementation of the genetic algorithm. The approach solves a more general form of the stated problem in that it ignores the axis-parallel condition imposed on the hyper-rectangles to be found.

  abstract     = {Soil moisture content (SMC) is an important parameter that affects tea growth. Reasonable soil moisture content improves tea quality and ensures tea yield. Therefore, it is necessary to regularly monitor the soil water content. However, the traditional soil moisture content prediction algorithm has the problems of low accuracy and low efficiency. This paper constructs and evaluates the performance of a hybrid arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) and support vector machine (SVM) prediction model (AOA-SVM) for predicting SMC in tea plantations. Grey relation analysis (GRA) and Pearson correlation analysis are adopted to select features for soil moisture content prediction model, and then the correlation of SMC with soil temperature (ST), atmospheric temperature (AT), and soil electrical conductivity (SEC) was analyzed. The optimal penalty parameter ( c ) and the parameter of the kernel function ( g ) of SVM model are determined by AOA. The mean square error (MSE) and coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean error (ME) were calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. Meanwhile, the performance of AOA-SVM model is compared with SVM optimized by the sparrow search algorithm (SSA-SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The results showed that AOA-SVM, SSA-SVM and CNN are better, with the coefficient of determination above 93%, the coefficient of determination of SVM and ELM is 81.69% and 89.61%, respectively. The AOA-SVM model has the best R 2 of 95.03%. This indicates that the AOA-SVM model has significant performance with higher R 2 , smaller MSE than other models, which has potential implications in precision agriculture.},

  abstract     = {The differential equations of pharmacokinetic models, obtained from the formulation based on the Fick&#39;s perfusion principle and law of conservation of mass action, deals with absorption, distribution, and elimination of drugs by the body systems. In the formulation, the ordinary differential equations obtained may result into highly stiff systems whereby suitable implicit methods have to be employed to solve accurately drug concentration in the body systems, owing to the complex nature of the exact solutions, if they exist. Further, because of the large and increasing interest in the problems of drug kinetics, it is necessary to apply considerably accurate implicit numerical methods in evaluating and in applying them to specific cases. These solutions are to help determine the distribution of drug concentration in different compartments (parts) of the human body network systems as a fundamental step to help in understanding and improving treatments. This is necessary since drug concentration in each compartment is different from one another because of the differences in drug affinity to tissues. From the study, the solution curves obtained show that drug level in the gastrointestinal tract decreases with the passage of time, while drug concentration in the blood increases from zero and reaches its maximum level and then decreases steadily again. We further, compared the model curves with some experimental data plots published in scientific papers. The results obtained from the study can be used extensively for various drug diffusion problems arising in pharmaceutical studies. The presented results widen the applicability of the continuous block implicit hybrid one-step collocation methods to diffusion process which have good number of applications in the drug control, drug dosage and other related problems in pharmaceutical and biomedical industries.},

To explore the laws of data leakage and solve practical problems, the reasons for data leakage and the evolution of players’ strategy in the game are discussed. After sorting out the interest relationship of data leakage incidents, a three-party evolution model of invaders, operators, and regulators is established to analyze the evolution path from the perspective of a single party. The Lyapunov theory is used to analyze the stability of equilibrium points of the system and then verified by MATLAB simulation. The influence relationship of various parameters on the system is analyzed. Finally, the ideal state is defined and the system is attempted to be modified. The results demonstrate that under the current system, the evolution direction cannot be changed by the initial intention of players. The game result will eventually form a situation with a strong attack from invaders, advanced defense from operators, and extensive management from regulators. The attack level can be reduced by adjusting the controllable parameters, modifying the evolution path, and calculating the parameter range.},

Implemented as a toolbox in commercial solvers, it allows researchers and practitioners, currently conversant with linear instances, to easily manage large-scale convex instances as well. In this article, we compared the proposed algorithm with alternative approaches in the literature, covering both theory and large test cases. New test cases with non-separable convex costs and non-network flow side constraints are also presented and evaluated. The toolbox is available free for academic use upon request.},

  abstract     = {Power transformers are crucial components of power transmission and transformation networks. Their operational status has a direct impact on the reliability of power supply systems. As such, the security and stability of power systems depend heavily on the state of transformers within them. The oil temperature of a transformer is a critical indicator of its working condition. Accurately and rapidly predicting transformer oil temperature is therefore of significant practical importance for ensuring the safe and effective operation of power systems. To address this prediction problem, this article proposes a transformer oil temperature prediction method based on empirical mode decomposition-bidirectional long short-term memory (EMD-BiLSTM). The time series of oil temperature is first cleaned before being processed. Next, the EMD algorithm is used to decompose the time series into relatively stable components. The BiLSTM neural network is then utilized to predict the complex nonlinear long-term series. The proposed method is evaluated using the open data set Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT)-small. Experimental results show that the EMD-BiLSTM model outperforms traditional LSTM, BiLSTM, EMD-BP, and Wavelet Transform-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (WT-BiLSTM) methods, demonstrating that it is an effective and accurate prediction method for transformer oil temperature.},

A number of approaches to deal with this issue have been investigated. One of them is by switching between the solvers preemptively breakdown. However, the problem is not fully solved yet. Here, we propose switching models combined with particular Lanczos iterative methods. The first model is by using the last iterate as the switching point with an unlimited number of iterations, the second model is by using the iterate with the minimum residual norm as the initial point and the third model is by using the iterate with the minimum of minimum residual norms as the switching point. These three models lead algorithms of SLULast, SLUMinRes, and SLUMoM, respectively. The parallel version of the proposed algorithms is also provided to speed up their convergence. In this case, we constructed the parallel of SLUMoM and we call it pSLUMoM. The numerical results showed that our switching models performed better than the existing switching strategy in terms of robustness and efficiency. In fact, under a parallel framework, pSLUMoM showed a performance gain of up to 50% in our experiments.},

To overcome these problems, the best solution is to use feature selection. In this article, we propose a new filter method for feature selection, by combining the Relief filter algorithm and the multi-criteria decision-making method called TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), we modeled the feature selection task as a multi-criteria decision problem. Exploiting the Relief methodology, a decision matrix is computed and delivered to Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution in order to rank the features. The proposed method ends up giving a ranking to the features from the best to the mediocre. To evaluate the performances of the suggested approach, a simulation study including a set of experiments and case studies was conducted on three synthetic dataset scenarios. Finally, the obtained results approve the effectiveness of our proposed filter to detect the best informative features.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a hybrid susceptible–infected–removed model which takes into consideration the spatiotemporal dynamics of the individuals. The model is based on a system of discrete stochastic diffusion equations. To build these equations, the two-dimensional diffusion equations coming from a balanced method are coupled with the human displacement probability law pattern through a discretization made by the finite volume method for complex geometries. The validation of this model is applied to COVID-19 spread. Since it is actual and the statistics are available elsewhere. The case of a developed country is used for simulation under some assumptions. Firstly to fit the chosen displacement pattern, then the accuracy of the statistics provided helps to analyze the sensitivity of the parameters of the model. The results explain the influence of the population movement on the evolution of the spread.},

  abstract     = {The aim is to analyse that, during the current pandemic situation, the reduction in the number of cases of influenza suggests that the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) applied to contain the expansion of SARS-CoV-2 also affect the influenza expansion. We analyse the interaction of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 spread based on an extended SEIRD model for the Catalonia region in Spain. We show that the dynamic evolution of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza generates a small interference. This interference causes a small reduction in the number of cases of seasonal influenza, reducing its expansion over the population. Other elements like the face mask mandates, social distancing and hand cleaning boost the reduction in both expansions. Influenza expansion will present a small reduction in the number of cases due to the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 expansion but mainly because the NPIs applied to the population.},

Distinguishing from some existing modulus-based matrix splitting methods, we present a flexible modulus-based inexact fixed-point iteration method for the resulting system, in which the subproblem can be solved approximately by a linear system-solver. The global convergence of the proposed method is established by assuming that the system matrix is positive definite. Some numerical comparisons are reported to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method, especially for large-scale problems.},

Under the proposed scheme, the fractional-order transfer function of the linear time-invariant system is used to approximate the Gaussian-like wavelet functions. Firstly, we construct a causal, stable, and physically achievable fractional-order mathematical approximation model. Then, the fractional-order mathematical approximation model is transformed into an optimization problem, and a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm is exploited to find its global optimal solution. At the same time, constraint terms are introduced to ensure the desired stability. The simulation results show that the fractional-order analog wavelet filters have higher approximation accuracy than the traditional integer-order analog wavelet filters. Furthermore, fractional-order analog wavelet filters can provide more precise control of the stopband attenuation rate, which is a key issue for many engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Decision trees are frequently used to overcome classification problems in the fields of data mining and machine learning, owing to their many perks, including their clear and simple architecture, excellent quality, and resilience. Various decision tree algorithms are developed using a variety of attribute selection criteria, following the top-down partitioning strategy. However, their effectiveness is influenced by the choice of the splitting method. Therefore, in this work, six decision tree algorithms that are based on six different attribute evaluation metrics are gathered in order to compare their performances. The choice of the decision trees that will be compared is done based on four different categories of the splitting criteria that are criteria based on information theory, criteria based on distance, statistical-based criteria, and other splitting criteria. These approaches include iterative dichotomizer 3 (first category), C 4.5 (first category), classification and regression trees (second category), Pearson’s correlation coefficient based decision tree (third category), dispersion ratio (third category), and feature weight based decision tree algorithm (last category). On eleven data sets, the six procedures are assessed in terms of classification accuracy, tree depth, leaf nodes, and tree construction time. Furthermore, the Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests are used to examine the results that were obtained. The results of these two tests indicate that the iterative dichotomizer 3 and classification and regression trees decision tree methods perform better than the other decision tree methodologies.},

  abstract     = {The deep convolutional neural network performs well in current computer vision tasks. However, most of these models are trained on an aforehand complete dataset. New application scenario data sets should be added to the original training data set for model retraining when application scenarios change significantly. When the scenario changes only slightly, the transfer learning can be used for network training by a small data set of new scenarios to adapt it to the new scenario. In actual application, we hope that our model has bio-like intelligence and can adaptively learn new knowledge. This paper proposes a pretrained adaptive resonance network (PAN) based on the CNN and an intra-node back propagation ART network, which can adaptively learn new knowledge using prior information. The PAN network explores the difference between the new data and the stored information and learns this difference to realize the adaptive growth of the network. The model is testified on the MNIST and Omniglot data set, which show the effectiveness of PAN in adaptive incremental learning and its competitive classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {One common issue with datasets used for supervised classification tasks is data imbalance or the unequal distribution of classes within a dataset. The class imbalance may cause biased machine learning models to favor the dominant class, misclassifying the minority class. Specific techniques can be employed to deal with the issue of class imbalance, including resampling by oversampling or undersampling and ensemble approaches. Besides, generative adversarial networks, a deep learning technique for building generative models, offer an alternative machine learning technique that is particularly well suited to address the class imbalance problem. This work introduces a machine learning-based approach to deal with the class imbalance in a cancer intracellular signaling dataset produced by a verified and validated computer simulation. Specifically, we use synthetic data generation to increase and balance the dataset generated by the computational simulation. The used approach simulates the oversampling method by employing a generative adversarial network to produce new examples for the minority class. Subsequently, we applied supervised machine learning methods, such as the K-NN algorithm, to assess whether or not the classification accuracy improved relative to the unbalanced dataset. The results presented in this work have shown an accuracy increase in the classification of patterns belonging to the minority class, with an improvement of 24.5 % .},
