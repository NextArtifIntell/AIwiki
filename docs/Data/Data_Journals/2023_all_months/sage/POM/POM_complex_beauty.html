  abstract     = {We study mechanisms that encourage manufacturers of health products to build production and distribution capacity. This is important for low‐ and middle‐income country (LMIC) markets where ability to pay is lower and demand risks are greater. Development finance institutions and philanthropies are beginning to utilize new instruments to incentivize manufacturers to build production/distribution capacity for LMIC markets. The goal of this paper is to understand the effectiveness of such mechanisms in different settings. We examine four instruments: (1) subsidy proportional to unit sales (sales subsidy), (2) subsidy proportional to unit capacity (variable‐capacity subsidy), (3) subsidy proportional to total capacity investment (total‐capacity subsidy), and (4) a minimum volume guarantee. We analyze incentivized capacity as a function of the social‐investor budget for each instrument. We show how our framework can be used to identify a social investor&#39;s preferred instrument given relevant parameter estimates, and we provide insight into the type of settings where a particular instrument dominates. A sales subsidy dominates when ability to pay is very low; a total‐capacity subsidy dominates when ability to pay is low. Outside of these settings, instrument preference is nuanced, though a sales subsidy is dominated by at least one other instrument. When ability to pay is moderate, a variable‐capacity subsidy tends to be preferred under high variable‐capacity cost and high budget, a volume guarantee tends to be preferred under low variable‐capacity cost and high budget, and a total‐capacity subsidy tends to be preferred under low budget.},

  abstract     = {Researchers have increasingly turned to crowdfunding platforms to gain insights into entrepreneurial activity and dynamics. While previous studies have explored various factors influencing crowdfunding success, such as technology, communication, and marketing strategies, the role of visual elements that can be automatically extracted from images has received less attention. This is surprising, considering that crowdfunding platforms emphasize the importance of attention‐grabbing and high‐resolution images, and previous research has shown that image characteristics can significantly impact product evaluations. Indeed, a comprehensive review of empirical articles ( n = 202) utilized Kickstarter data, focusing on the incorporation of visual information in their analyses. Our findings reveal that only 29.70% controlled for the number of images, and less than 12% considered any image details. In this manuscript, we contribute to the existing literature by emphasizing the significance of visual characteristics as essential variables in empirical investigations of crowdfunding success. We review the literature on image processing and its relevance to the business domain, highlighting two types of visual variables: visual counts (number of pictures and number of videos) and image details. Building upon previous work that discussed the role of color, composition, and figure–ground relationships, we introduce visual scene elements that have not yet been explored in crowdfunding, including the number of faces, the number of concepts depicted, and the ease of identifying those concepts. To demonstrate the predictive value of visual counts and image details, we analyze Kickstarter data using flexible machine learning models (Lasso, Ridge, Bayesian additive regression trees, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting). Our results highlight that visual count features are two of the top three predictors of success and highlight the ease at which researchers can incorporate some information about visual information. Our results also show that simple image detail features such as color matter a lot, and our proposed measures of visual scene elements can also be useful. By supplementing our article with R and Python codes that help authors extract image details ( https://osf.io/ujnzp/ ), we hope to stimulate scholars in various disciplines to consider visual information data in their empirical research and enhance the impact of visual cues on crowdfunding success.},

  abstract     = {Companies have increasingly used supply chain financing instead of bank financing when engaging with financially constrained suppliers. We investigate the effectiveness of different financing mechanisms at supporting supply chain responsibility. We consider a decentralized supply chain where a buyer sources from a financially constrained supplier who borrows from either a bank or the buyer to finance his production. The buyer audits the supplier for responsibility compliance and will refuse to accept and pay for the order if the supplier fails the audit. We find that under conventional bank financing, the bank is concerned with the supplier&#39;s audit failure and will raise the interest rate. This not only hinders the supplier&#39;s compliance effort but also hurts the profitability of every stakeholder. In contrast, under buyer financing, the buyer may offer the supplier a low interest rate to motivate him to be more compliant when the supplier&#39;s collateral is of low value. However, if the supplier&#39;s collateral is of high value, the buyer may be tempted to set a high interest rate to exploit the supplier—leading to a reduction in supplier&#39;s compliance and supply chain profitability. Thus, we conclude that buyer (bank) financing is more preferable for encouraging responsibility when the supplier has low (high) collateral. Our findings suggest that buyer financing may not always be an effective approach for encouraging supply chain responsibility. As such, we propose an alternative mechanism under which the buyer offers a reward to the supplier if he passes the audit while the supplier continues to borrow from a bank. We prove that this combination of bank financing and buyer reward always improves the compliance level and in most cases increases the total supply chain profit. It is even more effective than buyer financing in encouraging responsibility especially when the supplier&#39;s collateral is of low value.},

  abstract     = {Disaster relief workers face unique factors in their operating environments that can inhibit internal integration. For example, disaster relief often involves exposure to traumatic events affecting relief workers’ commitment to cooperation and the organization. As such, disaster relief organizations dedicate substantial amounts of scarce resources to support workers exposed to trauma. Unfortunately, contradictory views exist in the literature on how trauma exposure affects commitment and integrative behaviors and how supervisor support influences these relationships. Based on the approach‐avoidance coping theory, we test whether trauma exposure has positive or negative effects. We test our hypotheses on data from 300 disaster relief workers collected using a 2 × 3 factorial scenario‐based experiment. We find that trauma exposure evokes avoidance coping behaviors, which decrease individuals’ cooperative disposition, and approach coping behaviors, which motivate organizational commitment. Next, we show that both forms of commitment have a nonlinear convex relationship with internal integration and mediate the relationship between trauma exposure and internal integration. Finally, we find that supervisor support amplifies these relationships. When exposed to trauma, supervisor approach and avoidance orientations provide higher internal integration levels than subjects exposed to no supervisor support. These findings extend the literature on disaster relief management, integration, and support, guiding decision‐making regarding support investments in disaster relief organizations.},

  abstract     = {The paper proposes an optimization model for the allocation of vaccines to a heterogeneous population composed of several subpopulations with different sizes and epidemiological disease transmission parameters. As the objective, an aggregated function combining a standard utilitarian efficiency criterion with a Gini index–related penalty term is considered. Contrary to previous work, we adopt an outcome equity view: The inequity measure is not based on vaccination fractions or other input factors, but on the fractions of individuals escaping infection, as predicted by an susceptible‐infectious‐removed (SIR) model. An adjusted pro rata (APR) policy of vaccine allocation minimizing inequity in this outcome view is introduced, and a numerical procedure for its determination is presented. The concepts are developed both for the case of segregated subpopulations and for that of interactions between the subpopulations. Interestingly, in a large number of instances, the optimal solution under the aggregated objective function turns out to be identical to APR. Whether APR is locally or even globally optimal in a concrete case depends on the relation of an inequity aversion parameter to certain threshold values. While the local optimality threshold can be determined by linear programming, the determination of the global optimality threshold, as the vaccine allocation problem itself, is a problem of nonconvex optimization. We suggest an exact optimization approach for smaller instances, and propose algorithms building on particle swarm optimization for threshold determination and allocation optimization at larger instances. Extensions to alternative outcome measures such as the number of fatalities are presented as well. In addition to the investigation of randomly generated instances, two test cases from the literature are revisited in the context of the present work. Moreover, a new case study based on data from the COVID‐19 outbreak in Austria in 2020 is introduced and analyzed.},

The COVID‐19 pandemic and its differential impact on different regions in the world offer an opportunity to explore these effects. We investigate the multiregional supply chain risk by focusing on credit risk measured by abnormal credit default swaps (CDS) spreads and US–China supply chain networks. Our evidence shows that local risks propagate through global supply chains to other regions. Using a matched sample, we find that abnormal CDS spreads for firms with Chinese supply chain partners increase by 12% to 13% relative to the average raw CDS spreads due to supply chain disruptions during the economic shutdown in China, and the abnormal CDS spreads decrease by 9% to 13% relative to the average raw CDS spreads when the supply chain activities resume in China. We also find that having a more global customer base can mitigate the effects of local household demand shocks. Lastly, we discover that firm size, supply chain network centrality, cash holdings, inventory, strong credit ratings, capital redeployability, and the number of segments increase resilience to global supply chain shocks, while financial leverage, operational leverage, and market competition weaken supply chain resilience.},

  abstract     = {Auto‐delivery is a subscription model widely employed in supply chains, whereby a supplier delivers products to a buyer (or multiple buyers) according to the buyer&#39;s choice of a constant shipping quantity to be delivered at prescheduled dates. The buyer enjoys a discount for the auto‐delivery orders and other benefits, including free subscription and cancellation. Because these benefits seem to all accrue to the buyer at the supplier&#39;s expense, the rationale for the supplier&#39;s decision to offer auto‐delivery and its impact on the profitability of both parties is an intriguing concern. We first develop a model that consists of a supplier and a single buyer, whereby the supplier offers a discount for the auto‐delivery orders and the buyer chooses the auto‐delivery quantity with the flexibility of cancelling the subscription. We derive the two parties&#39; operating characteristics of their inventory systems and examine their optimal decisions. Our analysis shows that buyers benefit from the auto‐delivery discount; the supplier benefits from the demand‐expansion effect and the inventory‐reduction effect, a potential discount on the cost of the auto‐delivery units; and the supply chain benefits from reducing the bullwhip effect. We also find that channel coordination requires the supplier to pass the inventory‐related savings to the buyer through the auto‐delivery discount, which depends on the ratio of the two parties&#39; holding cost rates. Moreover, we examine a model extension whereby the supplier announces a discount that is available for multiple buyers, we show that the supplier&#39;s optimal auto‐delivery discount under exponential demand can be determined based on the aggregate‐level demand information from all buyers. Finally, we discuss another model extension whereby the lead time of the supplier&#39;s recurring orders for auto‐delivery is longer than that of the regular orders and present a full analysis of the case when the lead time differential is one time period.},

  abstract     = {CVaR (Conditional value at risk) is a risk metric widely used in finance. However, dynamically optimizing CVaR is difficult, because it is not a standard Markov decision process (MDP) and the principle of dynamic programming fails. In this paper, we study the infinite‐horizon discrete‐time MDP with a long‐run CVaR criterion, from the view of sensitivity‐based optimization. By introducing a pseudo‐CVaR metric, we reformulate the problem as a bilevel MDP model and derive a CVaR difference formula that quantifies the difference of long‐run CVaR under any two policies. The optimality of deterministic policies is derived. We obtain a so‐called Bellman local optimality equation for CVaR, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for locally optimal policies and only necessary for globally optimal policies. A CVaR derivative formula is also derived for providing more sensitivity information. Then we develop a policy iteration type algorithm to efficiently optimize CVaR, which is shown to converge to a local optimum in mixed policy space. Furthermore, based on the sensitivity analysis of our bilevel MDP formulation and critical points, we develop a globally optimal algorithm. The piecewise linearity and segment convexity of the optimal pseudo‐CVaR function are also established. Our main results and algorithms are further extended to optimize the mean and CVaR simultaneously. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments relating to portfolio management to demonstrate the main results. Our work sheds light on dynamically optimizing CVaR from a sensitivity viewpoint.},

  abstract     = {Customers of many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in business‐to‐business markets today demand product servicizing in which instead of buying the product from the OEM they buy the use of a product during a lease. During the lease, (i) the customer uses the product and returns it to the OEM after the use reaches a specific level, (ii) the OEM remanufactures the product in a costly process and sends it back to the customer, and this usecycle is repeated multiple times. The lease terms typically involve a use‐based payment. While a greater product use by a customer brings a larger revenue to the OEM, it also increases the remanufacturing cost incurred by the OEM. We investigate this trade‐off using an analytical model for a contract that is used extensively in industry. For the case of homogeneous customers with a common use rate of the product, we optimize lease payment terms and identify market and product‐remanufacturing characteristics for which the OEM should servicize the product instead of selling it. We show that an OEM should not servicize a product when the customers&#39; use rate exceeds a threshold. This is because, beyond this threshold, the remanufacturing cost increases disproportionably, exceeding the higher usage‐based revenue. Subsequently, we consider a market with two segments with different use rates. We consider two servicizing modes: (i) servicize both market segments or (ii) selectively servicize only one segment and sell the product to the other segment, and the default mode of selling in both segments. We develop optimal lease payment terms for these use‐based servicizing modes, identify thresholds of product and market characteristics for the optimality of these modes. Finally, we extend the results to a market with more than two segments and compare the environmental impacts of the servicizing or sell decision. Numerical results informed by empirical data show that the OEM&#39;s loss of profit from choosing a suboptimal servicizing/sell decision can be significant.},

  abstract     = {Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have emerged as effective channels for advertising that enable consumer targeting based on demographics, interests, and user behavior. Social media marketers have utilized information spillover within these platforms to reach a larger customer base. This information spillover also exists across groups of users within the platform and enhances returns from social media advertising. Thus, this information spillover can be utilized to strategically sequence targeted advertising to amplify the returns from social media ads. In this paper, we present a theoretical model for information retention and show that the sequential advertising strategy is effective in targeting groups of users on a social media platform. In addition, we provide empirical evidence through two series of randomized field experiments. From experiments for a health services organization, we find that sequential advertising campaigns provide 23% more clicks when compared to campaigns that target groups simultaneously, which translates to a saving of 18.7% in the advertising budget to achieve similar results as simultaneous advertising. Additionally, we found that sequential advertising campaigns targeting a smaller group first followed by a larger group provide 10.7% additional clicks when compared to targeting a larger group first followed by a smaller group. These results were consistent for consumer packaged goods that were advertised on Facebook and Twitter. These results provide implications for social media advertising research and practice.},

  abstract     = {Much interest exists in physicians’ ability and willingness to adapt their practice styles, as research demonstrates that many physicians practice in ways that are not aligned with the best available scientific evidence. We exploit migration patterns of primary care physicians in Massachusetts over a span of 8 years by tracking physician migrations to practice sites comprised of new peers who shared actual physical working space. We examined whether a patient&#39;s likelihood of receiving an inappropriate referral for diagnostic imaging, specifically a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), was associated with a change in the work environment of the referring physician. Study results indicate that migrating physicians changed their practice style for imaging relatively soon after migration in conformance with the average practice style of their new peer group regardless of whether or not the practice style was aligned with evidence‐based standards for diagnostic imaging. To place our results in context, a 1 percentage point difference in average inappropriate MRI referral rates between a migrating physician&#39;s new and previous work environment was associated with approximately a 14% change in the probability that a patient received an inappropriate MRI referral. The effect diminished with greater variability in inappropriate MRI referral rates within the new peer group. The results show that physician practice style may deviate from evidence‐based standards and vary markedly among physicians within a work environment. At the same time, physician practice style is also malleable in either direction—more or less likely to deviate from evidence‐based standards in conformance with the average practice style of their new peer group. These results imply that healthcare managers can employ various institutional‐level interventions to influence physician behavior in the direction of evidence‐based practice by including strategies directed towards developing strong peer influence in physicians’ work environments.},

  abstract     = {We address a production/inventory problem for a single product and machine where demand is Poisson distributed, and the times for unit production and setup are constant. Demand not in stock is lost. We derive a solution for a produce‐up‐to policy that minimizes average cost per unit time, including costs of setup, inventory carrying, and lost sales. The machine is stopped periodically, possibly rendered idle, set up for a fixed period, and then restarted. The average cost function, which we derive explicitly, is quasi‐convex sparately in the produce‐up‐to level Q , the low‐level R that prompts a setup, and jointly in R equals Q . We start by finding the minimizing value of Q where R equals 0, and then extend the search over larger R values. The discrete search may end with R less than Q , or on the matrix diagonal where R equals Q , depending on the problem parameters. Idle time disappears in the cycle when R equals Q , and the two‐parameter system folds into one. This hybrid policy is novel in make‐to‐stock problems with a setup time. The number of arithmetic operations to calculate costs in the ( Q , R ) matrix depends on a vector search over Q . The computation of the algorithm is bounded by a quadratic function of the minimizing value of Q . The storage requirements and number of cells visited are proportional to it.},

  abstract     = {We study the robust production and maintenance control for a production system subject to degradation. A periodic maintenance scheme is considered, and the system production rate can be dynamically adjusted before maintenance, serving as a proactive way of degradation management. Optimal control of the degradation rate aims to strike a balance between the risk of failure and the production profit. We first consider the scenario in which the degradation rate increases linearly with the production rate. Different from the existing literature that posits a parametric stochastic degradation process, we suppose that the degradation increment during a period lies in an uncertainty set, and our objective is to minimize the maintenance cost in the worst case. The resulting model is a robust mixed‐integer linear program. We derive its robust counterpart and establish structural properties of the optimal production plan. These properties are then used for real‐time condition‐based control of the production rate through reoptimization. The model is further generalized to the nonlinear production–degradation relation. Based on a real production–degradation dataset from an extruder system, we conduct comprehensive numerical experiments to illustrate the application of the model. Numerical results show that our model significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of the mean and variance of cost rate when degradation model misspecification is presented.},

We develop a model where a company continuously assesses information that follows a doubly stochastic Poisson process with a mean‐reverting and stochastic intensity. Accordingly, the company faces a two‐dimensional optimal stopping problem in which the company continues to evaluate the product if and only if the product reputation and information intensity remain in a continuation set. We employ a probabilistic approach to prove that the continuation set takes the form of an open interval for any fixed information arrival intensity. Given the complicated nature of the optimal solutions, we develop an asymptotic expansive solution, and numerical studies show that our solution performs well. We also analyze a heuristic solution where the company substitutes the dynamic intensity with a constant intensity. Interestingly, we find that this heuristic company does not necessarily benefit from having a higher product reputation.},

  abstract     = {Companies across many industries seek to understand how customer ordering impacts supply chain distribution performance. In the US medical supplies industry, wholesalers are uniquely positioned to use information about downstream customers to study and potentially influence buyer policies and practices due to their industry scale and data visibility. In this study, wholesale medical supplies buyers are first examined based on their ordering practices over a 2‐year window using the theoretical lens of data clumpiness—patterns of data non‐conformity to equal spacing—to derive insights into how their ordering practices affect the distribution efficiency of the medical supplies wholesale distributor. The analysis also considers how different buyer and industry characteristics moderate these upstream ordering effects. The results reveal several significant findings for both theory and practice. First, buyers exhibiting less clumpiness in order sizing and greater clumpiness in order‐timing practices drive greater distribution efficiencies for the wholesale distributor. These effects are greater when buyers have more category experience and lower when ordering across multiple categories. Industry customers’ use of centralized purchasing also tends to lower wholesale distributor efficiency. Still, these negative effects can be mitigated when customer ordering practices favor replenishment based on customer needs and consistent order sizing. After discussing the implications of our analysis, we offer additional practical and theoretical extensions of our approach that can be applied to study other industry supply chains or that could affect related healthcare purchasing markets.},

  abstract     = {We study the effect of managerial time horizon on two key operations decisions: inventory levels and capacity investment. For identification, we exploit a quasi‐natural experiment provided by the staggered adoption of constituency statutes, which alleviate managerial short‐termism by providing legal protection to executives adopting a long‐term approach in their corporate decisions. Using a staggered difference‐in‐differences design, we find that, after the reforms, firms incorporated in constituency states (treated firms) increased inventory and capacity investment by 5.2% and 15.4%, respectively, relative to firms not incorporated in constituency states (control firms). We also find that these increases are gradual and persist over time, suggesting that they are structural in nature. We further show that the effect of constituency statutes on inventory levels and capacity investment are stronger for firms with ex ante higher level of managerial short‐termism, such as firms with low institutional ownership. Performance also increases relatively more for affected firms with higher ex ante managerial short‐termism. Our results pass a battery of robustness and validity tests. Interestingly, while constituency statutes are intended to protect executives from short‐term oriented shareholder sanctions, our findings suggest that these statutes ultimately benefited not only executives, but also potentially the long‐term interest of shareholders. Even in the absence of regulation, executives facing short‐term pressure could intensify communication efforts with shareholders on how specific operational decisions and investments would be beneficial to the company. Notably, executives could use various media channels to help shape retail investors’ attitude toward operational investments that may create future value.},

  abstract     = {Many on‐demand service platforms employ surge pricing policies, charging higher prices and raising provider compensation when customer demand exceeds provider supply. There is increasing evidence that service providers understand these pricing policies and strategically collude to induce artificial supply shortages by reducing the number of providers showing as available online. We study a stylized mathematical model of a setting in which an on‐demand service platform determines its pricing and provider compensation policies, anticipating their impact on customer demand and the participation of strategic providers, who might collectively decide to limit the number of providers showing online as available. We find that collusion can substantially harm the platform and customers, especially when the potential demand is large, and the supply of providers in nearby regions is limited. We explore two pricing policies that a platform could employ in the presence of (potential) provider collusion: a bonus pricing policy that offers additional provider payments on top of the regular compensation and the optimal pricing policy that maximizes the platform&#39;s expected profit while taking strategic provider behavior fully into consideration. Both policies feature a compensation structure that ensures that total provider earnings increase in the number of providers available, thereby encouraging all providers to offer their service. We show that both policies can effectively mitigate the impact of potential provider collusion, with the bonus pricing policy often performing near‐optimally. As it might be difficult for a platform to accurately estimate the propensity of providers to collude, we numerically evaluate how platform profits are affected if the pricing policy is designed based on possibly incorrect estimates of the providers&#39; propensity to collude. Our observations suggest that a platform should design its pricing policy under the assumption that all providers are strategic and consider collusion, as the losses associated with implementing such a policy in settings with minor risk of collusion are limited, while the potential losses from failing to consider rampant collusion can be significant.},

We focus on a multiclass, capacity‐constrained pricing problem in which each of the product classes has a price range. Specifically, we examine the effects of price range overlaps and introduce it as a revenue‐maximizing pricing strategy. Price cannibalization happens when sales in some product classes decrease due to the existence of overlaps between the price ranges. We employ a multimethod approach. First, we define a Markov decision problem to obtain the revenue‐maximizing strategy in a two‐class sales scenario. We show that price range overlaps are part of the optimal strategy. Second, we collect multichannel data from a European storage company to examine how price range overlaps impact a customer&#39;s purchase decisions. The results show that the existence of price range overlaps leads to cannibalization, but increases spending and improves conversion. Finally, we use simulations to compare several pricing strategies and demonstrate the long‐term effects of using price range overlaps in pricing algorithms in complex situations. Our findings suggest that using price range overlaps, though leads to cannibalization, actually helps companies avoid spoilage and early sellouts, leading to better capacity utilization and higher revenue.},

Our analysis shows that consumers’ inconvenience costs and the relative size or travel–distance heterogeneity of the two consumer segments play an important role in determining the firms’ equilibrium targeting and pricing decisions. We find that the taxi&#39;s inconvenience cost can have non‐monotonic effects on firms’ prices. An increase in the taxi&#39;s inconvenience cost can reduce both firms’ profits because it can induce both firms to lower their prices. In an extension, we show that distance‐based price discrimination (charging different unit prices based on the consumer&#39;s travel distance) can lead to win–win or lose–lose outcomes for both firms.

Motivated by this goal, we examine the impact of employing individuals with disabilities in apparel manufacturing cells on overall team productivity (PD). We formulate a series of deterministic and stochastic PD maximization assignment problems to study the impact of disability inclusion on a production line. We extend the baseline PD maximization formulation to study a multi‐objective problem that simultaneously maximizes PD, disability diversity (DD), and language diversity (LD). Each analysis is performed across two different garments drawn from a real‐world setting. The models are tested using archival time study data collected in partnership with an apparel manufacturing firm where more than 75% of the billed work hours are from individuals with significant disabilities. The following insights emerge from the analyses. First, the PD of teams that have individuals across multiple, different types of disabilities is higher than the PD of teams with employees who share a single, specific type of disability. Second, teams that employ both individuals with and without disabilities perform slightly better than teams that consist of only individuals with disabilities. In some instances, contrary to intuition, teams of only individuals with disabilities even have higher PD than teams of only individuals with no disabilities. Finally, our results from the multi‐objective problem that simultaneously maximizes PD, DD, and LD suggest that PD is not generally sensitive to increases in DD. However, PD is sensitive at extreme levels of DD and LD. Limitations and possible future extensions of the study are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Firms have been proactively holding data science competitions via online contest platforms to look for innovative solutions from the crowd. When firms are designing such competitions, a key question is “What should be a better contest design to motivate contestants to exert more effort?” We model two commonly observed contest structures ( one stage and two stage ) and two widely adopted prize structures ( high spread and low spread ). We employ economic experiments to examine how contest design affects contestants’ effort level. The results reject the base model with rationality assumption. We find that contestants exert significantly more effort in both the first stage and the second stage of the two‐stage contest. Moreover, it is better to assign most prizes to the winner in the two‐stage contest while it does not matter in one stage . To explain the empirical regularities, we develop a behavioral economics model that captures contestants’ psychological aversion to falling behind and continuous exertion of effort. Our findings demonstrate that it is important for contest organizers to account for the nonpecuniary factors that can influence contestants’ behavior in designing a competition.},

  abstract     = {In practice, many retailers employ price‐matching guarantees (PMGs), committing to meet the price of an identical product at a competitor&#39;s outlet. Despite the profound linkage between retailers and manufacturers, existing literature has predominantly explored retailers&#39; PMGs without contemplating the influence of manufacturers&#39; wholesale pricing strategies. Employing a supply chain model comprising one manufacturer and two retailers, we scrutinize the implications of wholesale pricing—uniform or discriminatory—on supply chain members and consumers when retailers have the option to extend PMGs. Our analysis uncovers that retailers refrain from offering PMGs when the manufacturer is granted the discretion to set discriminatory wholesale prices—even if such offers align with the manufacturer&#39;s preferences. Conversely, under uniform wholesale pricing, PMGs thrive at equilibrium—even if the manufacturer opposes the practice—as long as the degree of demand or cost asymmetry between retailers and average hassle costs remains relatively modest. Although firms&#39; preferences regarding PMGs vary, a Pareto zone exists where all entities prefer that either the efficient retailer under demand asymmetry or the inefficient retailer under cost asymmetry extends the PMG. Despite the potential advantages of PMGs for the more efficient retailer, the enforcement of uniform wholesale pricing diminishes supply chain profit, consumer welfare, and overall social welfare. The detrimental impacts on welfare owing to the imposition of uniform wholesale pricing persist, even amid the presence of hassle costs associated with price matching. Our findings thus instigate a dialogue for policymakers concerning the validity of regulating wholesale pricing when PMGs are in effect.},

  abstract     = {We consider a two‐stage project supply chain with a downstream project firm producing an engineer‐to‐order (ETO) complex product or a make‐to‐order (MTO), low‐volume, customized industrial product as a project, and an upstream contract supplier supplying a key material to the project. The project faces two uncertainties: project activity time uncertainty and material consumption uncertainty, which may be positively or negatively correlated. In anticipation of these uncertainties, the project firm has to carefully decide its promised project due date to its project customer, against which harsh penalties will be assessed, and his material order quantity to commit to the contract supplier in advance. In most practical settings, project firms order from contracted suppliers via a flexible wholesale price contract consisting of a discounted advance order price and a risk‐premium adjusted expedite order price. The discounted advance order price encourages the project firm to take more inventory risk in the supply chain, and the expedite order price incentivizes the supplier to bear more inventory risk by carrying safety stock in excess of the project firm&#39;s advance material order. We formulate an optimization model that solves the project firm&#39;s project due date and material order problem, which takes into account the supplier&#39;s strategic reaction to the project firm&#39;s material order under the flexible wholesale price contract. We show that for MTO projects, risk‐sharing with suppliers on project materials is less important to the project firm, with the project firm assuming ownership of all material inventory in the channel and setting a deliberate project due date being the key. On the other hand, for ETO projects, risk‐sharing with contracted suppliers assumes critical importance. Project firms managing ETO projects should fully exploit the flexibility in the material supply contract to optimally drive the supplier&#39;s safety stock level and set the project due date reflecting the shared risk in the supply chain.},

  abstract     = {This work addresses the practical anesthesiologist scheduling (AS) problem motivated by the needs of an academic anesthesiology department. The AS problem requires the department to plan and deploy providers to adequately meet clinical demand and institutional protocols of various clinical units over a planning horizon of up to several weeks. A data‐driven two‐step AS framework is developed by exploiting the historical demand data of anesthesia cases. The first step is a shift design which obtains the optimal shifts considering clinical demand under uncertainty using conditional value‐at‐risk constraints, and the second step is provider assignments that generate the schedule considering optimal and equitable workload distribution and provider availability using multiobjective mixed‐integer programming models. Moreover, the AS framework incorporates the provider specialties, and clinical and lifestyle preferences and aligns with the existing scheduling practices. An ɛ‐constraint solution method is applied for multiobjective optimization, and an iterative solution method is developed to improve solution quality for workload equity in clinical applications. Computational experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of three alternative forms of the workload equity objective function, and the results show that the minimization of the sum of the absolute deviations of provider workloads best balances solution runtime and quality. In the concerned academic anesthesiology department, two clinical problems, the budget and hiring planning and the monthly scheduling, are addressed via the application of the proposed AS framework. For budget and hiring, decision‐makers can make trade‐offs based on their preference using the nondominated frontiers obtained via the ɛ‐constraint method. For monthly scheduling, the iterative solution method can accommodate preassigned shifts capturing institutional requirements while improving workload equity. The workload variance has been substantially reduced from 2.92 to 1.39 after the implementation based on the historical schedule data. The provider schedule satisfaction is improved from 3.13/5 to 3.44/5, and at least 82% of scheduling burden on department leaders is relieved. The developed AS framework is generic and can be extended to the scheduling of other types of care providers, including nurses and residents.},

  abstract     = {Medical rumors have become a threat to modern society. To study the spread and control of rumors, nonlinear differential equations modeling with the well‐mixed assumption is commonly used. However, this approach ignores the underlying network structure which plays an important role in information spreading. We establish a generalized differential equations model to study the spread and control of medical rumors in a highly asymmetric social network. In our model, each node represents a group of people and a “weighted” and “directed” network describes the communications between these nodes. This network can be generated from real‐world data by community detection algorithms. We provide methods to numerically calculate the final size of a rumor in each node and its derivatives with respect to each parameter. With these methods, if the government has resources to influence the parameters subject to certain constraints or cost functions, one can obtain the optimal resources allocation easily through nonlinear programming algorithms. We show that the implications on the government&#39;s resources allocation from the well‐mixed special case in the literature or conventional wisdom may become inapplicable in the general situation. Therefore, the underlying network should not be ignored. Because the final size of a medical rumor is not always the best measure of its damage, we extend our results to a wide class of objectives and show that different objectives result in very different implications. While the lack of a rule of thumb may sound negative, our flexible framework provides a powerful workhorse for interested parties to work out the details in their specific situations. Finally, we provide a sufficient condition for no outbreak of rumors. This condition can serve as a heuristic that a government with abundant resources can use to prevent the outbreak of rumors.},

Our empirical model provides evidence that data‐based intelligence improves taxi drivers’ routing decisions by close to 3% as measured by trip speed. Our results further demonstrate that inexperienced drivers have a higher chance of choosing the fastest route, as they are more likely to rely on the real‐time traffic information from GPS technology than experienced drivers.

  abstract     = {We consider an e‐tailer&#39;s upstream supplier who wants to encroach into retailing to earn additional revenue. The supplier needs to decide whether or not to enter the retail market by either selling to consumers on the e‐tailer&#39;s platform by paying commission fees (agency encroachment) or opening an independent online/offline retail store (direct encroachment). The e‐tailer has private demand information and decides whether or not to share it with the supplier. Two leadership scenarios—the supplier‐leads (i.e., the supplier selects the channel before the e‐tailer decides whether to share information) and the e‐tailer‐leads (i.e., the supplier selects the channel after the e‐tailer decides whether to share information)—are examined. Our main findings are as follows. First, we show that the e‐tailer has no incentive to share information under no encroachment and direct encroachment. Interestingly, this result holds in both leadership scenarios. Second, a medium commission rate gives rise to an equilibrium of agency encroachment with information sharing by the e‐tailer. This equilibrium is more likely to sustain in the supplier‐leads scenario than in the e‐tailer‐leads scenario. Third, agency encroachment brings the supplier the highest sales volume (at retail in the encroaching channel plus on wholesale to the e‐tailer) when the two parties compete in quantity while direct encroachment does so for a price competition. Fourth, supplier encroachment always improves consumer surplus, but it is not necessarily welfare‐improving. Last, we find that the e‐tailer is more willing to share information to induce the supplier to encroach through his agency channel if he has a significant selling cost advantage over the supplier or can endogenously determine the commission rate.},

  abstract     = {The tariff rate quota (TRQ) is a widely utilized market access instrument in global agricultural trade that allows a predetermined quantity of a product to be imported at a lower tariff rate than the usual rate. This study examines the design and administration of TRQ systems from an operations management perspective and analyzes their impact on market access, fill rates, and revenue for policymakers. We investigate the two most common TRQ administration methods, namely, licensing and first‐come, first‐served (FCFS) systems. We characterize the Nash equilibria (NE) of importers&#39; strategies and observe how information delays and lead times can result in under‐utilization (i.e., imports being less than the quota limit) in licensing and over‐utilization (i.e., imports exceeding the quota limit) in FCFS TRQ systems. We introduce a dual TRQ system and demonstrate its superiority over licensing and FCFS systems. We study the effects of stock‐keeping options through customs‐bonded warehouses and the choice of logistics channels on arrival patterns and fill rates. We conduct a case study of the United Kingdom and the European Union imported beef market using customs data. Our numerical study provides an explanation for the suboptimality of the current TRQ systems and proposes modifications to transform the existing systems. Our findings offer practical directions for agricultural traders to reassess their supply chain strategies by considering the logistical implications of TRQ systems and understanding their competition. This study also urges policymakers to adopt an integrative approach in (re)designing TRQ systems, recognizing the pivotal role of supply chains in global agricultural trade.},

We show that except for at most one lot, the optimal capacity of each lot takes one of three possible values. Based on analytical results, we develop a one‐variable search algorithm to solve the model. We learn from numerical results that the optimal capacity of a lot with a high intrinsic utility tends to be equal to the upper bound. By contrast, a lot with a low or moderate‐sized intrinsic utility tends to attain an optimal capacity on its effective lower bound. We evaluate the performance of the optimal solution under different choice scenarios of commuters who are shared with real‐time parking information. We learn that commuters are better off in an average choice scenario when both the effects of parking information and congestion are considered in the model than when either effect is ignored from the model.},

With the passage of time, consumers decide whether to preorder the product by paying the deposit, whether to settle the balance by paying the arrear by the due date, and, when returns are allowed, whether to return a fully paid product for a refund after its fitness is revealed. Canceling a preorder before settling the balance or failing to settle the balance on time causes a deposit payer to lose deposit. Consumers use quasi‐hyperbolic discounting to weigh intertemporal utilities and exhibit time inconsistency when making purchase decisions. Our results indicate that, as consumers&#39; time inconsistency weakens, the firm manages the deposit and the arrear to induce no, some, and all deposit payers, in that sequence, to settle the balance. It has mixed effects on the profit of the firm and consumer surplus but always causes social welfare to improve since actual sales increase. Regarding the choice of return policy, the firm prefers full returns while consumers prefer no returns when consumers are time‐inconsistent; they share similar preferences when consumers are time‐consistent. Moreover, we find that consumers&#39; imbalance (caused by time‐inconsistent preference) is less likely to occur as consumers are more sophisticated, as the presales period shortens, as the product value increases, or as the product is more likely to be a good fit. In addition, allowing a quick refund for fully paid but not yet delivered products can completely deter imbalance, while this option harms the firm and may or may not benefit consumers. All this yields novel insights into managing presales with two payments and returns when consumers are time‐inconsistent.},

  abstract     = {When scheduling the distribution of ordered items from a warehouse to customers, the transportation planning is generally done first and serves as input for planning warehouse operations. Such a sequential approach can lead to substantial inefficiencies when the customer deliveries are restricted by time windows, and the warehouse has limited resources available (both order pickers and space in the staging area). This paper studies the trade‐offs between warehouse operations and transportation planning. The goal is to understand the impact of three specific managerial interventions: adopting an integrated planning approach, expanding the available staging space, and expanding the delivery time windows. To this end, we propose a mathematical model for a general vehicle routing problem that incorporates order batching, order picker scheduling, staging, and vehicle loading. We introduce a novel idea to express the picking time of an order batch as a function of the batch size and develop a metaheuristic to solve this integrated problem. Furthermore, we develop exact algorithms to provide optimal solutions for the individual warehouse and transportation problems in a sequential planning approach. Managerial insights are distilled from case studies in two warehouses, one for ambient products and the other for refrigerated products, of a leading grocery retailer in the Netherlands. Our results show that integrated planning outperforms the other managerial interventions and generates cost savings between 9% and 11%. Savings are generally realized by executing larger order batch sizes to be picked in the warehouses at the expense of additional routing cost (around 2–3%). The second intervention in the form of time window expansions of only 15 minutes for customer deliveries can lead to cost savings between 4% and 6%, which results from a reduction in both transportation and warehousing cost. Expanding the capacity of the staging area is only meaningful when the staging space is highly utilized and only results in cost savings for the warehouse operations.},

  abstract     = {Airlines showcase their on‐time performance (OTP), a globally accepted operational performance metric, to demonstrate punctuality, service reliability, and attract air travelers. Airlines can adopt passive strategies , such as “schedule padding,” and active strategies , such as making “operational changes/improvements,” to improve their OTP. While there is a high degree of variation in airlines&#39; OTP from year to year, it is unclear if and the extent to which airlines&#39; active or passive actions impact their OTP because of factors, like weather, outside an airline&#39;s control. We develop a framework in this paper to study the impact of these active and passive actions on the OTP of airlines. Additionally, we study the effect of these strategies on OTP rankings , routinely used to compare airlines. Our methodology builds on the structural estimation model developed in prior literature and replicates the typical schedule planning process observed in the airline industry. We use an 11‐year panel data of flights operated by US domestic carriers from 2005 to 2015 to measure OTP changes, schedule padding, and operational changes. Broadly, active actions include (i) changes to the airline&#39;s network structure (e.g., flight routes and schedules) and (ii) other operational changes to improve flight performance (operational improvement). We demonstrate through our analysis that operational improvements have the highest association with both the change in OTP and OTP rankings of airlines, followed by schedule padding; the impact of network changes on OTP and OTP rankings is the lowest. Our framework also accounts for the impact of competition on an airline&#39;s OTP ranking. We show that while an airline&#39;s own actions can improve its OTP ranking, a competitor&#39;s action may negatively affect the ranking. In fact, a competitor&#39;s passive strategy of schedule padding may have a higher impact than an airline&#39;s own active strategy of changes in network structure. Our results also indicate that the potential impact of operations improvements is the highest for full‐service airlines and the lowest for leisure airlines. Furthermore, we show that the impact of operational improvements and buffer adjustments decreases with an increase in the variability of the travel time of a route.},

  abstract     = {Large‐scale platforms (LSPs) with valuation and awareness advantages have enabled competing small‐scale platforms (SSPs) to be embedded in their platforms. This compatibility strategy creates a new channel, that is, the compatible channel, through which customers can purchase services from SSPs via the LSPs. Additionally, numerous platforms have been introducing add‐on services to enhance their profitability. In this study, we develop stylized game models to characterize the interaction between an LSP and an SSP and explore their strategic and operational decisions on platform compatibility under add‐on services. Our major research findings are as follows: First, compatibility has opposite impacts on service pricing. That is, at a low proportion of demand through the compatible channel, the two platforms engage in a price war; otherwise, they both raise prices. Second, we identify the conditions for platform compatibility: Compatibility becomes an equilibrium strategy if the proportion of demand through the compatible channel falls within an intermediate range. Third, we find that homogeneous add‐on services stimulate rather than inhibit compatibility due to the different profit foci of two platforms. Finally, we conduct extensions to further verify the robustness of the conclusions. Our results provide important implications to the burgeoning debate on when platforms should implement compatibility to achieve a win–win scenario under a variety of settings.},

  abstract     = {Should a firm begin its production even before its new product is approved? In a competitive market with time‐sensitive consumers, a firm may choose to adopt the “concurrent process” by conducting the approval process and the production process in parallel so that the product will become available for sale once approved. However, to avoid incurring upfront (production related) investments that are nonrecoverable should the product fail to receive approval, a firm may opt for the “sequential process” so that the production process will only begin after approval. But such a sequential process can delay product launch, making the firm less competitive. These trade‐offs between the concurrent and sequential development processes and the recent Covid‐19 vaccine development motivate us to examine the process choice in the presence of three salient factors: (a) uncertain product approval, (b) time‐sensitive consumers, and (c) asymmetric firm competition —firms have different ex ante approval probabilities. Our equilibrium analysis reveals that it is possible for the laggard firm (the firm with lower ex ante approval probability) to aggressively adopt the concurrent process whereas the leading firm (the firm with higher ex ante approval probability) adopts the sequential process. First, as the approval requirement tightens, both firms have a lower chance of receiving approval, and the laggard firm is more likely to adopt the sequential process than the leading firm. Second, as consumers become more time sensitive, the leading firm is more eager to adopt the concurrent process than the laggard firm. Finally, when the firm asymmetry is large, competition does not always soften and both firms may compete directly by adopting the sequential process. We also examine the case when consumers are “forward‐looking” instead of “myopic.” We find that forward‐looking behavior increases competition and motivates both firms to adopt the concurrent process. Finally, we consider the case when the government offers subsidies to defray the nonrecoverable investments to increase the chance of having an approved product available sooner. Interestingly, we find such a subsidy can backfire resulting in lower consumer welfare and lower profit for the firms especially when consumers are time insensitive.},

  abstract     = {Firms in interorganizational networks are exposed to interdependent risks that are transferable across partner firms, such as contamination in food supply chains or data breaches in technology networks. They can be decomposed into intrinsic risks a firm faces from its own operations and extrinsic risks transferred from its partners. Firms have access to two security strategies: either they can independently eliminate both intrinsic and extrinsic risks by securing their links with partners or, alternatively, firms can cooperate with partners to eliminate sources of intrinsic risk in the network. We develop a graph‐theoretic model of interdependent security and demonstrate that the network‐optimal security strategy can be computed in polynomial time. Then, we use cooperative game‐theoretic tools to examine, under different informational assumptions, whether firms can sustain the network‐optimal security strategy via suitable cost‐sharing mechanisms. We design a novel cost‐sharing mechanism: a restricted variant of the well‐known Shapley value, the agreeable allocation , that is easy to compute, bilaterally implementable, ensures stability, and is fair. However, the agreeable allocation need not always exist. Interestingly, we find that in networks with homogeneous cost parameters, the presence of locally dense clusters of connected firms precludes the existence of the agreeable allocation, while the absence of sufficiently dense clusters (formally, k ‐cores) guarantees its existence. Finally, using the SDC Platinum database, we consider all interfirm alliances formed in the food manufacturing sector from 2006 to 2020. Then, with simulated cost parameters, we examine the practical feasibility of identifying bilaterally implementable security cost‐sharing arrangements in these alliances.},

Due to the volatile nature of the sharing economy and its disruption to industry norms, these platforms encounter legitimacy challenges that impede user base growth. This paper integrates competitive repertoire and institutional legitimacy theories to develop a research model that explains early‐stage user base development in the sharing economy. We posit that the early‐stage user base is associated with structural characteristics of the competitive repertoire, whose effects are moderated by a platform&#39;s socio‐political legitimation efforts that address stakeholders’ regulatory and normative concerns. Using a comprehensive sample of 4644 monthly observations of 129 sharing economy platforms in China, we find that the volume of two context‐specific competitive actions, offering economic incentives and staging high‐visibility events, along with competitive repertoire complexity, are positively related to the platform&#39;s early‐stage user base. We also identify a significant negative relationship between repertoire differentiation and user base. Direct relationships are moderated by socio‐political legitimation, however, such that legitimation weakens the positive impact of context‐specific action volume but enhances those of repertoire complexity and differentiation. Managerial and practical implications are discussed in light of the findings.},

  abstract     = {Ending‐9 prices are extremely popular among retailers, leveraging consumers’ perception biases. However, despite the popularity of this pricing strategy, understanding of its impact on online retailers is still limited. This is particularly true given the complexity of online retail where consumers need to traverse a shopping funnel, consisting of decisions with shopping cart and purchases. This study aims to answer the following three questions: First, do consumers hold a perception bias toward prices with online retailers? Second, whether and how effective is this bias in shifting consumer decisions? Third, what is an alternative pricing strategy for online retailers, to better leverage consumers’ perception bias? The results of a structural model reveal the impact of a perception bias on consumer decisions, toward both the shopping cart and purchases, at the online retailer. However, while ending‐9 prices exert a sizable impact on shopping cart additions (by nearly 20%), the impact on final purchases is marginal (by less than 4%). A possible reason could be that even if each individual product adopts its ending‐9 price, the cost of the shopping cart (which can involve multiple items) might still not preserve such a pricing structure. Consequently, a firm&#39;s ending‐9 pricing strategy for each individual product cannot effectively induce consumers’ perception bias toward the cost of the shopping cart, leading to very limited carryover in lifts from shopping cart additions to purchases. Motivated by these observations, we consider an alternative strategy in which the online retailer adjusts the cost of the shopping cart to end in 9, in addition to its current ending‐9 pricing strategy for individual products. By doing so, the retailer can induce perception bias for both the shopping cart and purchases. Our simulation results suggest that such a strategy not only promotes purchases (by 16%) but also helps reduce shopping cart abandonment (by 3%), the latter of which has become a critical concern for many online retailers.},

  abstract     = {Facing consumers&#39; growing demand for fast order fulfillment, it is important yet challenging for franchise companies to best incentivize frequent inventory sharing among their independent franchise retailers or dealers to achieve channel coordination. Past literature has only addressed such channel coordination for one‐time inventory sharing using contractual agreements, which unfortunately do not work for frequent inventory sharing. In this study, we consider multiple inventory‐sharing opportunities and propose a novel coordinating mechanism: internal inventory trading , enabled by disruptive IT platforms, such as the OneView platform&#39;s Inventory Management module (OVIM). On the OVIM, designed and operated by a brand (franchiser), every retailer (franchisee) can frequently access to all brand inventories virtually as they trade (buy or sell) inventory with one another and the brand. Using dynamic multiperiod games, we investigate how the brand should craft the trade rules and how the retailers should respond and trade periodically in equilibrium. We prove that channel coordination can be achieved in equilibrium, and the coordination requires both an internal inventory‐trading platform and the brand&#39;s proactive involvement in trading as the rule and market maker. Specifically, the coordinating trade rules require the brand to (1) only profit from the royalties (not from trading), (2) set the coordinating trade prices (CTPs) to respond to the real‐time channel inventory, and (3) let the buyer and the seller split shipping costs in any proportion, but not offering any subsidy. We provide a detailed characterization of the CTPs for each period, serving multiple purposes beyond simply removing double marginalization. When the channel inventory is high and imbalanced, the CTPs must include a trading reward to prevent retailers from strategically holding more or less inventory than the channel‐optimal amount to “manipulate” future trade prices. The good news is that these CTPs are intuitive (constant or market‐clearing) and can be automated into the trading platform ex ante. These actionable insights can guide franchise companies toward best utilizing their channel inventory and improving their profit and customer satisfaction.},

This setting is in contrast to those where the output is only qualitative and cannot be objectively quantified, for example, when the goal of the contest is to design a logo. The literature on crowdsourcing contests focuses largely on ordinal contests, where contestants&#39; outputs are ranked by the designer and awards are based on relative ranks. Such contests are ideally suited for the latter setting, where output is qualitative. For our setting (quantitative output), it is possible to design cardinal contests, where awards could be based on the actual outputs and not on their ranking alone—thus, the family of cardinal contests includes the family of ordinal contests. We study the problem of designing an optimal cardinal contest. We use mechanism design theory to derive an optimal cardinal mechanism and provide a convenient implementation—a decreasing reward‐meter mechanism—of the optimal contest. We establish the practicality of our mechanism by showing that it is “Obviously Strategy‐Proof,” a recently introduced formal notion of simplicity in the literature. We also compare the optimal cardinal contest with the most popular ordinal contest—namely, the Winner‐Takes‐All (WTA) contest, along several metrics. In particular, the optimal cardinal mechanism delivers a superior expected best output, whereas the WTA contest yields a greater expected contestant welfare. Furthermore, under a sufficiently large budget, the contest designer&#39;s expected net‐benefit is higher under the optimal cardinal mechanism than that under the WTA contest, regardless of the number of contestants in the two mechanisms. Our numerical analysis suggests that, for the contest designer, the average improvement provided by the optimal cardinal mechanism over the WTA contest is about 23%. For a given number of contestants, the benefit of the optimal cardinal mechanism is especially appreciable for projects where the ratio of the designer&#39;s utility to agents&#39; cost‐of‐effort falls within a wide practical range. For projects where this ratio is very high, the expected profit of the best WTA contest is reasonably close to that of the optimal cardinal mechanism.},

To explicitly assess the value of LJL financing, we assume that the firms either use LJL financing scheme or traditional individual financing scheme to finance their operations. Under LJL financing scheme, we construct a non‐cooperative game model in which the two firms separately determine their own inventory decision to serve random demand, according to the prior joint liability agreement between the two firms and the bank. We prove that the non‐cooperative game between the two firms under the LJL financing scheme is a supermodular, and thus establish the existence of equilibrium inventory decisions of the firms. We then characterize the optimal loan terms of the profit‐seeking bank under the proposed two financing schemes. Our results show that the joint‐liability mechanism of the LJL financing scheme always induces the firms to overinvest in their ordering decisions (relative to the case of the individual financing scheme), which reveals that the endogenous financial terms of the LJL financing scheme have a positive effect on the firms&#39; operational decisions. Importantly, we provide conditions under which the loan terms of the proposed two financing schemes can be properly set by the bank to make the LJL financing scheme more beneficial to the bank and the two firms, and the bank offering this financing scheme can obtain two additional benefits—that is, a higher probability of recouping all the loans and a lower profit risk (i.e., the standard derivation of the bank&#39;s random total profit), compared to individual financing scheme. The research findings provide managerial insights for a profit‐seeking bank on how to offer financial loans to capital‐constrained firms and for those capital‐constrained firms on how to cooperate with one another.},

We investigate the effect of assortment size on consumers&#39; purchase probability using a unique click‐stream dataset from a large peer‐to‐peer meal delivery platform. To resolve the key endogeneity challenge that assortment size may be larger in areas where consumers experience greater utility from purchase, we introduce a novel causal inference strategy that exploits a common but imperfect geographic targeting tool employed by the platform: limiting kitchens to a set of fixed delivery radii. We argue and show through simulation exercises that true assortment size effects on purchase probability can be estimated when we employ clustering algorithms to recover and account for neighborhoods that may be targeted by suppliers. Applying our causal inference strategy to the home‐cooked delivery setting, we find that purchase rate effects of assortment size are rapidly diminishing. In fact, our findings suggest that up to 18% of active users experience choice overload. These effects persist despite accounting for potential pricing, assortment variety, and personalization confounds and are robust to nonparametric specifications and accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in assortment effects. We further document the novel moderating role of new‐to‐user and off‐platform options on assortment size effects.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider an assortment optimization problem in which a platform must choose pairwise disjoint sets of assortments to offer across a series of T stages. Arriving customers begin their search process in the first stage, and progress sequentially through the stages until their patience expires, at which point they make a multinomial logit–based purchasing decision from among all products they have viewed throughout their search process. The goal is to choose the sequential displays of product offerings to maximize expected revenue. Additionally, we impose stage‐specific constraints that ensure that as each customer progresses farther and farther through the T stages, there is a minimum level of “desirability” met by the collections of displayed products. We consider two related measures of desirability: purchase likelihood and expected utility derived from the offered assortments. In this way, the offered sequence of assortments must be both high earning and well liked, which breaks from the traditional assortment setting, where customer‐centric considerations are generally not explicitly accounted for. We show that our assortment problem of interest is strongly NP‐Hard, thus ruling out the existence of a fully polynomial‐time approximation scheme (FPTAS). From an algorithmic standpoint, as a warm‐up, we develop a simple constant factor approximation scheme in which we carefully stitch together myopically selected assortments for each stage. Our main algorithmic result consists of a polynomial‐time approximation scheme (PTAS), which combines a handful of structural results related to the make‐up of the optimal assortment sequence within an approximate dynamic programming framework. We also provide an additional approximation scheme, which, under mild assumptions, can handle a cardinality constraint that enforces that an exact number of new products are introduced at each stage. Using an extensive set of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that both algorithms exhibit excellent practical performance, producing sequences of assortments that are, on average, always within 2% of optimal.},

  abstract     = {We study inventory control with volume flexibility: A firm can replenish using period‐dependent base capacity at regular sourcing costs and access additional supply at a premium. The optimal replenishment policy is characterized by two period‐dependent base‐stock levels but determining their values is not trivial, especially for nonstationary and correlated demand. We propose the Lookahead Peak‐Shaving policy that anticipates and peak shaves orders from future peak‐demand periods to the current period, thereby matching capacity and demand. Peak shaving anticipates future order peaks and partially shifts them forward. This contrasts with conventional smoothing, which recovers the inventory deficit resulting from demand peaks by increasing later orders. Our contribution is threefold. First, we use a novel iterative approach to prove the robust optimality of the Lookahead Peak‐Shaving policy. Second, we provide explicit expressions of the period‐dependent base‐stock levels and analyze the amount of peak shaving. Finally, we demonstrate how our policy outperforms other heuristics in stochastic systems. Most cost savings occur when demand is nonstationary and negatively correlated, and base capacities fluctuate around the mean demand. Our insights apply to several practical settings, including production systems with overtime, sourcing from multiple capacitated suppliers, or transportation planning with a spot market. Applying our model to data from a manufacturer reduces inventory and sourcing costs by 6.7%, compared to the manufacturer&#39;s policy without peak shaving.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by interactions with a major player in the aerospace industry, we consider the relationship between a supplier of specialty material forgings and a buyer that manufactures airplane components by extensively machining down these forgings as per component design specifications. Due to high material removal costs, the buyer prefers these forgings to be as similar in geometry and size to the component as possible, that is, near‐net‐shape. The supplier, by default, is unable to deliver such near‐net‐shape forgings as per technological constraints, but can utilize costly effort and/or invest in the required technologies to achieve such capabilities. By taking into account uncertainty regarding the correspondence between supplier&#39;s effort and resulting forging size, we assess the implications of two innovative approaches for improving supply chain performance: (i) input material reduction incentives via contracting and (ii) scrap material recycling. We characterize the optimal decisions with respect to final component geometry, various costs, and which party in the supply chain controls the strategic recycling decision. We find that the supply chain should utilize both approaches in a complementary way for components with complex geometry, yet deliberately limit recycling and eliminate contracting for components with simple geometry—a strategy the buyer always implements when controlling the recycling decision. Furthermore, we show these contracting and recycling strategies to be robust by considering linear, expected cost sharing, and nonlinear contract alternatives. Finally, we study supply chain inefficiencies that result from decentralizing the recycling and/or contracting decisions, and highlight whether expected cost sharing and nonlinear contracts can outperform linear contracts.},

This type of mass flow of migrants in transit represents a humanitarian crisis. Understanding migrant flow patterns and ways to ameliorate the conditions for migrants in transit is critical to managing the humanitarian crisis. In this study, we develop a model that examines the influence of migrant networks, inter‐organizational collaboration, and environmental uncertainty on locational advantage, which, in turn, predicts migrant flow patterns. This study contributes to the humanitarian operations management and migration literatures by uncovering how migrant networks and inter‐organizational collaboration help provide access to humanitarian resources. Additional new findings of this study include uncovering different classes of migrants with their respective flow patterns and the role of collaboration along migration paths. The study also uncovers how travel constraints increase the duration of transit and the importance of point‐to‐point transfers to avoid congregation at transit hubs. Furthermore, findings from this research provide insights on how long‐term humanitarian support to migrants through inter‐organizational collaboration morphs to short‐term aid in the event of a crisis.},

This research develops a theoretical model on optimal content policies for streaming media companies in order to maximize customer engagement. We have the following interesting findings. First, in contrast to the results in prior literature that firms produce just enough programs and coverage intervals of the programs do not overlap, we show that placing programs closer can be a better policy for engagement‐based firms. Second, more contents are produced under engagement‐based model when the customer value of the content is high. Third, on learning the distribution of the customers, the media firm will always place programs closer when the distribution density is higher such that neighboring programs always have overlapped target audience. Additionally, in facing the tradeoffs of content quality and quantity, the firm should use a high‐quality and low‐variety policy for crowded clusters but a low‐quality and high‐variety policy for niche clusters. Furthermore, when customers consume multiple shows in a period, a good policy is to produce TV shows or series with multiple episodes, whereas individual movies are more suitable for an infrequent watcher market. Our research contributes to the literature on digital media, and the results provide interesting and insightful implications for streaming companies.},

The literature on optimal inventory policies under fixed order costs does not account for these time‐dependent fixed order costs. By generalizing existing proofs for optimal inventory policies, we close this gap in inventory theory. The optimal inventory policy is complex in the regular order period and in the intraperiods, a period‐dependent ( s , S ) $(s,S)$ policy is optimal. We describe and prove this optimal policy based on the notion of K ‐convexity and the optimal ordering behavior in the presence of non– K ‐convex cost functions. In a numerical study, we find that a major driver of the optimal policy is a forward‐buying effect that shifts the probability of ordering from the intraperiods to the regular order period. The cost differences between the optimal and a pure period‐dependent ( s , S ) $(s,S)$ policy are, however, small.},

  abstract     = {Nonhomogeneous Poisson process models have commonly been used to analyze and forecast arrivals. Such processes require specification of intensity (arrival rate) functions, which are typically defined in a parametric form. The accuracy of the parametric models is highly sensitive to the choice of the specific intensity function for the arrival process. We use a Bayesian framework by proposing a nonparametric form for the intensity function and introduce a robust semiparametric model. The model is suitable for analyzing both time of arrival data and interval censored count data and can capture both monotonic and non‐monotonic arrival intensity. The intensity function in the model can be modulated to incorporate auxiliary information as well as seasonal and random effect components. We develop the Bayesian analysis of the proposed model and implement it on two real call center datasets with different characteristics. We also consider several extensions to our model and develop their Bayesian analyses. Our random effects extension model with cumulative baseline intensity changing on the days of the week and interday correlation with the Markov evolution extension model both provide high predictive accuracy. We also show that our proposed semiparametric model has robust performance for out‐of‐sample predictions. Accurate predictions of arrivals will assist managers in determining appropriate staffing levels and effective workforce scheduling, resulting in more efficient operations.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we analyze how customer perceptions of ex ante unfairness affect a service provider that offers a priority service option. Customers differ in their waiting time costs, but that information is private to each customer. To address this issue and maximize revenue, the service provider offers a regular queue and a priority queue with an additional fee, thereby inducing the self‐selection of customers into those two queues. The customers make their service‐joining decision, based on the publicized queue terms, before entering the queue. In such a service system, the priority customers pay to reduce their waiting time, which increases the average waiting time for regular customers, as compared with a “first come, first served” (FCFS) queue. This increase in the waiting time can lead to a perception of unfairness by the regular customers. In this paper, we model this ex ante unfairness perception as a negative utility for the regular customers that is proportional to the difference in the expected waiting times between the segmented regular queue and a nonsegmented FCFS queueing system and investigate the service provider&#39;s optimal decisions regarding segmentation and pricing. We find that, in a service system where customers can balk, the service provider should focus on only one service offering through a lower priority fee or differentiated services under certain conditions and charge a higher priority fee once the perception of unfairness is taken into consideration. An equilibrium sensitivity study provides guidance on how best to design, construct, and operate queues. Finally, we examine two extension cases in which (1) the customer ex ante unfairness perception is defined as proportional to the waiting time difference between regular and priority queues or (2) priority customers exhibit either a “negative ex ante unfairness perception” or “positive ex ante unfairness perception” of queueing. Our results are robust, and we identify conditions under which a heightened unfairness perception could be beneficial or detrimental to the service provider.},

  abstract     = {Theoretical research in marketing has traditionally focused on centralized brand‐extension strategies where a brand expands its product offerings by controlling the design, production, marketing, and sales of new products “in‐house.” However, luxury brands frequently use “brand licensing” as a decentralized brand‐extension strategy under which a brand licenses its brand name to an “external licensee” that designs, produces, and sells the new product. Licensing is a time‐efficient and cost‐effective brand‐extension strategy for luxury brands to reach out to their aspirational, low‐end consumers (“followers”) who value a brand more when more high‐end consumers (“snobs”) purchase the brand&#39;s primary product (i.e., “positive popularity effect”). On the other hand, over‐licensing might dilute the brand for snobs who value brand exclusivity (i.e., “negative popularity effect”). We develop a game‐theoretic model to study luxury brand licensing in a decentralized setting by incorporating these two countervailing forces. First, in the monopoly setting (a benchmark), we find that the monopoly brand should license only when the negative popularity effect is not too high, and it should prefer “royalty licensing” over “fixed‐fee licensing” when the negative popularity effect is intermediate. Second, to explicate our analysis, we study the duopoly setting under fixed‐fee contracts. In contrast to the monopoly setting, we find that fixed‐fee licensing can “soften” price competition between brands so that licensing is “always” profitable for both brands under competition. Interestingly, in equilibrium under fixed‐fee contracts, competing brands face a prisoner&#39;s dilemma and both brands prefer not to license in some cases, even though both would be better off if they could commit to fixed‐fee licensing. Finally, we expand our analysis of the duopoly model by incorporating royalty licensing in addition to fixed‐fee licensing. We find that, in contrast to fixed‐fee licensing, royalty licensing can “intensify” price competition so that both brands have to lower their prices. Consequently, when the positive popularity effect is sufficiently strong, fixed‐fee licensing “dominates” royalty licensing. We also show that, under competition, luxury brands should adopt royalty licensing contracts only when the follower market is large and positive and negative popularity effects are small enough.},

With either RSI, consumers will be partially compensated by an insurer for their shipping fees associated with product returns. As the consumers&#39; uncertainty about product fit is realized only after purchase, their decisions whether to purchase CRSI may lead to postpurchase regret. Considering these anticipated regret behaviors, we investigate the optimal RSI policy for a monopolistic online retailer and an insurer. We show that the retailer offers RRSI only if the retailer&#39;s return handling cost is relatively low and consumers&#39; return shipping cost is in an intermediate range; otherwise, the consumers&#39; strong propensity for uninsured regret may stimulate them to purchase CRSI. Under the optimal RRSI policy, the retailer always charges a higher product price than under no RSI, and surprisingly the consumer demand could expand. In contrast, under the optimal CRSI policy, the retailer always sets a lower product price, but resulting in consumer demand shrinkage. Counterintuitively, CRSI may become a “win‐win‐win” policy for the retailer, insurer, and consumers.},

  abstract     = {Resale platforms such as Swappa and ThredUP, which provide a channel for product‐holders to sell used products, have become common. Interestingly, in the presence of resale platforms, some firms, such as Apple, set lower rebates for the trade‐in‐for‐upgrade (TU) mode instead of implementing the trade‐in‐for‐upgrade‐and‐cash (TUC) mode as Huawei does. In this paper, we build game‐theoretical models to explore how a firm should adjust its trade‐in strategy (e.g., choose pricing and mode selection between TU and TUC) in reaction to the emergence of third‐party resale platforms. We derive several insights. First, we find that using the TU mode helps to encourage consumer repurchases, whereas the TUC mode may have a greater promotion effect on consumers’ first purchases. Second, we show that in the TUC mode, the amount of the trade‐in rebate is not affected by the presence of the resale platform. Differently, in the TU mode, whether the firm should provide a more generous trade‐in rebate depends on the unit product cost when the resale platform is present. Third, in response to the resale platform, the firm should choose the TU mode to take advantage of the platform&#39;s promotion effect if the unit product cost is high and choose the TUC mode to avoid the platform&#39;s cannibalization effect if the unit product cost is low. To verify the robustness of our findings, we consider the effects of reduced consumer uncertainty and the dynamic pricing mechanism in the extended models. Our main findings concerning trade‐in rebate and mode selection remain valid.},

  abstract     = {As financial institutions increasingly offer robo‐advisors (RAs) as a service, the empirical evidence on their performance, particularly during market downturns, remains limited. We study the impact of using RAs on investment performance during the 2020 financial crisis caused by the COVID‐19 global pandemic. We obtain daily portfolio and transaction data of investors on an online investment platform. Besides making investment decisions by themselves, investors can also leverage an RA system offered by the platform. We match RA users with other investors who did not use the RA with similar investor and portfolio characteristics before the market crash, then compare their portfolio returns after the crash. We find that RA users experienced significantly fewer losses during the market downturn, and this performance advantage came from the RA‐managed assets (rather than assets managed by RA users themselves). We further show that the RA system adjusted its portfolios to hold less risky funds, whereas human investors stayed with their status quo and did not reduce the risk of their portfolios, which partly accounted for the performance discrepancy. Importantly, the RA’s superior performance was not simply a continuation of its performance in a normal market; in fact, we find RA users to have similar portfolio returns as non‐RA investors during normal markets, and the benefits of RA&#39;s risk‐reduction trading strategy only manifested during the financial crisis. Our work offers an empirical assessment of RAs’ performance under different market conditions and advances the understanding of algorithmic decision making in financial markets.},

We extend this literature by investigating how fixture shape, an important environmental factor that has received little attention in previous studies, can influence consumer purchase intentions at retail checkout. Findings from a field study and three online experiments consistently suggest that tower‐shaped fixtures, in comparison to other conventional fixtures, can increase checkout purchase intentions. Moreover, the proposed effect is driven by the increased visual attention to products when displayed on tower fixtures. We also identify consumers’ information processing style (i.e., more vs. less reliant on visual processing) as a theoretically relevant moderator. Specifically, customers who rely more heavily on visual information processing are more susceptible to the influence of a tower fixture than those who rely less on visual information processing. Through this research, we contribute novel insights to the understanding of display fixtures and retail operation management. This study augments the design task from product shape to fixture shape for manufacturers, and sheds light on retailer merchandising strategy as well as retail space management at checkout.},

  abstract     = {We report on the findings of five controlled experiments that test the effectiveness of proposed interventions aiming to improve both the process and outcomes of decision making when performing the newsvendor task. We use eye‐tracking technology aided by interviews to gain new insights into people&#39;s cognitive processes. Our results confirm that human newsvendors exhibit the tendency of mean‐reverting demand prediction using past demand even when the demand is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This points toward the presence of the cognitive bias known as the law of small numbers in the decision‐making process. The interventions involving ordering multiple products instead of the same product repeatedly, feedback frequency reduction, training and provision of optimal solution, all reduce reliance on the past demand, thereby reducing the extent of the mean‐reverting tendency. Yet, none of these interventions eliminated this tendency completely; overall, judgmental forecasting persisted, albeit at a lower extent or in a different form. This tendency provides a plausible explanation for the fact that the interventions (and the resultant reduction in reliance on past demand) fail to lead to performance improvements. While the qualitative analysis of the interviews shows the subjects’ intention to not rely on past demand in some instances, their gaze behavior shows that the past demand continued to impact their orders to varied degrees. Mere reduction (or even removal) of irrelevant information does not automatically make the subjects shift their focus to the relevant information and use them as intended.},

The demands of the two items are correlated. Due to the complexity caused by the lost‐sales assumption and the interplay between pricing and production decisions, we show the optimal value function satisfies five structural properties under certain conditions. The optimal ordering and pricing policies are then fully characterized by five production curves and two pricing functions. Different from existing literature, we show that the optimal price path may not be monotone in the inventory level of either item. Next, we estimate the value of flexibility by comparing two systems, one with the flexible source only and the other with the dedicated source only, and show that the value of flexibility is positive (or negative) if the flexible source has a faster (or slower) production rate and a lower (or higher) production cost. Through numerical experiments, we find that in most cases flexibility and dynamic pricing are substitutes except for a few exceptions; and product substitution can either increase or decrease the value of flexibility.},

Next, we analytically characterize the platform&#39;s optimal information strategy as a function of the underlying market parameters.

In particular, in a seller&#39;s market (high ratio of potential buyers to sellers), the platform should provide both product and market information to the sellers and buyers. However, in a buyer&#39;s market (low ratio of potential buyers to sellers), it is optimal for the platform to only provide the market information—providing both the product and market information would backfire on the platform by jeopardizing its sales.},

  abstract     = {Patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) play an increasingly important role in medical decision making. Yet, patients whose objectives differ from their physician&#39;s may strategically report symptoms to alter treatment decisions. For example, athletes may underreport symptoms to expedite return‐to‐play (RTP) from sports‐related concussion (SRC). Thus, clinicians must implement treatment policies that mitigate the Price of Naïveté , that is, the reduction in health outcomes due to naïvely believing strategically reported symptoms. In this study, we analyze dynamic treatment cessation decisions with strategic patients. Specifically, we formulate the Behavior‐Aware Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (BA‐POMDP), which optimizes the timing of treatment cessation decisions while accounting for known symptom‐reporting behaviors. We then analytically characterize the BA‐POMDP&#39;s optimal policy, leading to several practical insights. Next, we formulate the Behavior‐Learning Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (BL‐POMDP), which extends the BA‐POMDP by learning a patient&#39;s symptom‐reporting behavior over time. We show that the BL‐POMDP is decomposable into several BA‐POMDPs, allowing us to leverage the BA‐POMDP&#39;s structural properties for solving the BL‐POMDP. Then, we apply the BL‐POMDP to RTP from SRC using data from 29 institutions across the United States. We estimate the Price of Naïveté by comparing the BL‐POMDP to naïve benchmark policies. Accordingly, the BL‐POMDP reduces premature RTP by over 44% and provides up to 3.63 additional health‐adjusted athletic exposures per athlete compared to current practice. Overall, changing the interpretation of reported symptoms can better reduce the Price of Naïveté over adjusting treatment cessation thresholds. Therefore, to improve patients&#39; health outcomes, clinicians must understand how strategic behavior manifests in PROs.},

Demand and selling price uncertainty are key features of the online marketplace. Sourcing choices are differentiated by cost and available lead times—delaying shortens the lead time which is more expensive but yields more accurate information about future selling price and demand. Thus, ahead of the season, each retailer faces a continuous‐time decision problem about when to place an order with the manufacturer and in what quantity. The manufacturer is interested in knowing the ordering pattern of the retailers in order to plan production. We consider two sourcing strategies varying in the flexibility of order timing: an optimal precommitted ordering time strategy and an optimal time‐flexible ordering strategy. We prove that the former is optimal when the selling price is constant and the latter when the selling price is uncertain. We show that time‐flexible ordering can be mutually beneficial for the retailer and the manufacturer in a wide range of scenarios and that the manufacturer can favorably influence order timing by adjusting its wholesale price trajectory. The predictions of our model are consistent with the experience of a large U.S. manufacturer that motivated our study.},

  abstract     = {Ships operated by a liner company are scattered around the world to transport goods. A liner company needs to adjust its shipping network every few months by repositioning its ships to respond to uncertain container shipping demand. Few studies investigate a liner company&#39;s multiperiod heterogeneous fleet deployment problem under uncertainty, considering fleet repositioning, ship chartering, demand fulfillment, cargo allocation, and adaptive fleet sizes. To this end, this study formulates a mixed‐integer linear programming model that captures all of these elements. This study also designs a Benders‐based branch‐and‐cut algorithm for this non‐deterministic polynomial‐time (NP)‐hard problem. Two types of acceleration strategies, including approximate upper bound tightening inequalities and Pareto‐optimal cuts, are applied to improve the performance of the algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms CPLEX and its Benders decomposition framework in solving the model. We conduct an intensive analysis and find that multistage stochastic programming can lead to better solutions than two‐stage stochastic programming. We also find that 10% of the benefit provided by the multistage model over the two‐stage model is due to better fleet deployment decisions and that 90% of the benefit is due to better demand fulfillment and allocation decisions. By exploring three practical questions regarding driver analysis of liner company profitability, benefits analysis of adaptive fleet sizes, and the influence of the COVID‐19 pandemic on liner shipping, we show how liner companies can benefit from managerial insights obtained in this study.},

  abstract     = {To meet order fulfillment targets, manufacturers seek to optimize production schedules. Machine learning can support this objective by predicting throughput times on production lines given order specifications. However, this is challenging when manufacturers produce customized products because customization often leads to changes in the probability distribution of operational data—so‐called distributional shifts . Distributional shifts can harm the performance of predictive models when deployed to future customer orders with new specifications. The literature provides limited advice on how such distributional shifts can be addressed in operations management. Here, we propose a data‐driven approach based on adversarial learning, which allows us to account for distributional shifts in manufacturing settings with high degrees of product customization. We empirically validate our proposed approach using real‐world data from a job shop production that supplies large metal components to an oil platform construction yard. Across an extensive series of numerical experiments, we find that our adversarial learning approach outperforms common baselines. Overall, this paper shows how production managers can improve their decision making under distributional shifts.},

  abstract     = {In the United States, food banks play an important role in helping to reduce the rate of food insecurity by distributing donated food among the population in need. One of the challenges that food banks face is to equitably distribute food donations among their clients such that, ideally, each recipient receives the same amount of food. They aim to do so while minimizing waste that occurs due to spoilage and capacity limitations. Perishable food items present specific challenges since they are susceptible to spoilage and need to be distributed before their expiry dates. Based on our longstanding partnership with a large food bank located in the southeastern United States, we present a capacitated, multiperiod, multiproduct network flow model to help them equitably and effectively distribute perishable food donations among the food‐insecure population in their service region. The model is applied within the context of a case study and reveals managerial insights that would be useful to practitioners. Our findings show that although equity is one of the food bank&#39;s highest priorities, inequities cannot be eliminated completely. Given the inevitability of inequitable food allocations in practice, this paper provides food banks guidance on how to strategically control inequities using two approaches: ( i ) by increasing the number of periods for which equity should be satisfied or ( i i $ii$ ) by allowing deviations from a perfectly equitable distribution. The results show that modest deviations from perfect equity using either approach can lead to significant improvements in both the quality and quantity of food distributed and can also reduce food waste. While approach ( i i $ii$ ) is preferable, the most desirable outcomes occur when both are applied simultaneously. We also find that county capacities inhibit a food bank&#39;s ability to achieve balance between equity and effectiveness when distributing perishables. Our framework provides food banks the flexibility to balance the trade‐off between effectiveness and equity based on their preferences.},

This collaboration is often formalized as a “captainship arrangement” between the retailer and her leading supplier in the category. The designated “category captain” assists the retailer with category management decisions. We show that captainship arrangements have the potential to generate a valuable information effect for the retailer: nonprice decisions by the category captain can reveal information that allows the retailer to improve profit through better retail pricing decisions. We also show that captainship arrangements have the greatest potential to make the retailer better off in categories where the retailer is highly uncertain about the impact of category resources on brands&#39; demand. Moreover, the more substitutable the brands in the category, the more valuable a captainship arrangement is to the retailer. The information effect of category captainship is robust to a variety of arrangements. It is present under delegation arrangements (where the retailer delegates the task of category resources deployment to the captain), as well as under advisory arrangements (where the retailer retains control over category decisions, relying on the captain for advice). Interestingly, we find that delegation has a “better” potential to transmit information than advisory. Furthermore, in case of an advisory arrangement, the retailer is better off keeping the captain&#39;s advice confidential rather than sharing it with the other suppliers.},

  abstract     = {One of the major challenges for humanitarian organizations in response planning is dealing with the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in disaster situations. The available information that comes from different sources in postdisaster settings may involve missing elements and inconsistencies, which can hamper effective humanitarian decision‐making. In this paper, we propose a new methodological framework based on graph clustering and stochastic optimization to support humanitarian decision‐makers in analyzing the implications of divergent estimates from multiple data sources on final decisions and efficiently integrating these estimates into decision‐making. To the best of our knowledge, the integration of ambiguous information into decision‐making by combining a cluster machine learning method with stochastic optimization has not been done before. We illustrate the proposed approach on a realistic case study that focuses on locating shelters to serve internally displaced people (IDP) in a conflict setting, specifically, the Syrian civil war. We use the needs assessment data from two different reliable sources to estimate the shelter needs in Idleb, a district of Syria. The analysis of data provided by two assessment sources has indicated a high degree of ambiguity due to inconsistent estimates. We apply the proposed methodology to integrate divergent estimates in making shelter location decisions. The results highlight that our methodology leads to higher satisfaction of demand for shelters than other approaches such as a classical stochastic programming model. Moreover, we show that our solution integrates information coming from both sources more efficiently thereby hedging against the ambiguity more effectively. With the newly proposed methodology, the decision‐maker is able to analyze the degree of ambiguity in the data and the degree of consensus between different data sources to ultimately make better decisions for delivering humanitarian aid.},

Companies such as Daimler, Apple, and Amazon have publicly declared their goal of becoming carbon neutral or “net zero” in a near future. They are responding to a growing demand for sustainable products and services. Companies have a variety of options for carbon emission reductions available to them, including internal reductions such as adopting renewable energy as well as buying carbon offsets. This raises the question of whether consumers perceive the different types of carbon emission reductions as equivalent, or whether they favor the implementation of internal measures. We investigate this issue empirically through surveys and incentive‐compatible discrete choice experiments. We find clear consumer preferences and willingness to pay for companies to reduce their carbon footprint when companies internally reduce their controllable emissions rather than buying carbon offsets for these emissions, and it is especially true for eco‐conscious consumers. Consumers place roughly the same value, however, on internal reductions in controllable emissions and buying offsets for the same amount of uncontrollable emissions.},

  abstract     = {In 2021, access to clean drinking water was still a luxury for millions of people worldwide. Building new water projects, such as handpumps and small piped systems, is the primary operational response by many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to bring people their first access to clean water in rural areas of developing countries. Based on knowledge gained from our collaboration with a local NGO and an international NGO and field research in Ethiopia, our research studies where to build new water projects optimally. We first develop a decentralized water project location optimization model based on current practice of a decentralized decision‐making and project management system and an equal per‐beneficiary budget. We further propose three new models to improve both water access and equity: a minimax model, an equitable budget model, and a centralized model that leverages the existing community involvement. Through numerical studies, we compare the model solutions and generate recommendations for NGOs. Lastly, motivated by the current civil war in Ethiopia, we develop a stochastic model to study how to improve drinking water access while mitigating the negative impact of water project supply shocks such as war. Our work studies the previously overlooked problem of drinking water access in rural areas of developing countries. It provides a generalizable and scalable methodology and managerial insights to NGOs building new water projects by combining large geo‐coded datasets and field data.},

  abstract     = {We consider the security maintenance of information systems where the extent of vulnerability is partially observable. However, the exact extent of the vulnerability can be observed by paying an inspection fee. In each period, the decision‐maker needs to take one of three decisions: (i) do nothing, (ii) inspect and implement (fix the vulnerability) if needed, and (iii) directly implement. We prove that the optimal policy follows a threshold structure. For each value of k (the known vulnerability), there are two thresholds for the partial information: the lower of the two thresholds dictates whether for this value of k , inspection is optimal before a possible implementation or whether direct implementation (i.e., without inspection) is optimal. If inspection is done, another threshold determines whether an implementation is done or not. If neither threshold applies, it is optimal to do nothing. We develop a numerical procedure to find the decision variables in the maintenance policy. We extend the main model to include variable implementation and inspection costs. The optimality of the threshold policy is shown to hold under more general settings. We apply the model to a real‐world problem and demonstrate its applicability and value in managing security systems. Here, we study the security maintenance policies for three different real‐world telecommunications operators and find that these operators can significantly reduce the cost of managing their security by adopting our proposed policy. Another finding is that inspection is more beneficial for medium‐sized to large‐sized operators.},

Difference‐in‐differences tests allow us to draw a causal interpretation of our main findings, which also holds in several robustness tests. Our findings suggest that increased cross‐border financing reflects greater ability to access global financial markets, due to enhanced firm visibility and investor attention, as well as operational forces that arise when establishing new global supply chain partnerships. Specifically, we provide evidence that firms that are small, held less by institutional investors, and followed by fewer analysts have more benefits in cross‐border financing from the formation of the global supply chain.

More interestingly, using this distributionally robust optimization approach, our model recovers the “evil twin” strategy, well known in the field of football pool betting, under appropriate settings. We also address the computational challenges of scaling up our approach to construct a moderate number of candidate solutions to increase the chances of finding one that performs well.

  abstract     = {Ensuring continuity of care for patients after an intensive hospitalization episode is a complex dilemma that plagues the US health‐care system. Despite its influence on health outcomes such as mortality and readmissions, it is difficult to construct policy instruments such as report cards or penalties for improving continuity of care due to the fragmented nature of post‐intensive hospitalization care. However, policy instruments that target other related health outcomes can also benefit continuity of care. We examine whether a quality regulation that penalized hospitals for excess readmissions has implications for an unregulated aspect, that is, continuity of care through intra‐ailment and spillover effects. Intra ‐ailment effects occur from the effects of penalty regulation on the continuity of care of ailments targeted for regulation. Spillovers occur from the effects of penalty regulation on continuity of care for ailments that were not targeted by the policy but share complementarities with targeted ailments. We conduct difference‐in‐differences analyses using patient‐level data for 2004–2014 from the state of California. Our empirical strategy utilizes the nature of the hospital production function, which is organized by medically related specialties. We construct three cohorts of patients, all of whom belong to specialties that house the ailments targeted for readmission penalties. These include (1) ailments targeted by the penalty policy for readmissions, (2) closely related, non‐targeted ailments, and (3) unrelated ailments. Results reveal evidence of intra‐ailment effects, which manifest as increases in continuity of care of targeted ailments, and spillovers, which manifest as increases in continuity of care of non‐targeted but related ailments. We find that processual mechanisms, such as the source of patient admissions and length of stay, and structural mechanisms, such as system size, accentuate the intra‐ailment effects. Our study provides novel insights into how quality regulation can have intra‐ailment and spillover effects and bespeaks the importance of incorporating these effects in the regulatory benefit‐cost calculus.},

The literature acknowledges the impact of cashback strategies on consumers’ purchase and review behaviors; however, it does not focus on how they affect consumers’ return behaviors. Moreover, there are few studies on the effect of cashback strategies on consumer surplus and social welfare in the presence of strategic consumers, especially in relation to analyzing the proportion of fake reviews. By incorporating consumers’ review and return behaviors into a newsvendor model, we establish a sequential procedure for merchants to determine pricing, inventory, and PCS decisions, and then examine the conditions under which merchants prefer to adopt a PCS and its impact. Our results reveal that the adoption of a PCS is a typical prisoner&#39;s dilemma for merchants in markets where PCSs are prevalent. Only when the PCS phenomenon is pervasive in the market, will merchants adopt a PCS with a small cashback amount. A PCS market negatively impacts consumer surplus and social welfare; however, merchants and consumers may benefit from a small cashback amount. Contrary to the common belief that a PCS undermines the organic evolution of online reviews and reduces return rates, we show that a PCS only elicits a few fake reviews, while merchants may face higher return rates from adopting it. These results benefit future studies on cashback strategies and fake reviews and provide evidence that supports the scientific governance of PCSs.},

  abstract     = {Consumers dread shopping during peak hours, and the Covid‐19 pandemic has created additional safety concerns about overcrowding in addition to long waiting times. In view of consumer&#39;s congestion aversion, should competitive brick‐and‐mortar grocery stores charge higher prices during congested peak hours to smooth demand? To examine “whether and when” stores should adopt intraday time‐based pricing under competition, we examine a 2‐stage dynamic duopoly game. At the beginning of each stage, each store can make an irreversible decision to adopt time‐based pricing by setting the peak‐hour and normal‐hour prices. We also endogenize consumer&#39;s shopping decisions (i.e., when and which store to shop) by incorporating the issue of negative congestion externality. Our equilibrium analysis reveals that time‐based pricing is always beneficial for the stores, and both stores would adopt it eventually in equilibrium. As such, only two equilibria can sustain: either both firms adopt time‐based pricing immediately in stage 1, or only one firm adopts in stage 1 while the other postpones its adoption until stage 2. Interestingly, due to the competitive dynamics, it is less likely for both firms to adopt immediately when consumers are more averse to congestion. Moreover, although the adoption of time‐based pricing leads to differentiated price competition, it can “soften” price competition, causing both peak‐hour and normal‐hour prices to rise above the status quo equilibrium uniform prices. We find that time‐based pricing can always induce demand smoothing and reduce congestion. Although time‐based pricing creates value for the stores (through higher prices), it offers no benefit to consumers.},

Current research typically assumes that downstream retailers retain procurement from the encroaching supplier. In reality, however, retailers may have the option of switching suppliers after encroachment. By considering a supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer with outside options, this paper analyzes the effects of the option of switching suppliers on the supply chain players&#39; strategic interactions under the threat of supplier encroachment. We consider that the manufacturer makes encroachment decision preceding the retailer&#39;s switch decision. We capture various outcomes of the encroachment and switch decisions by using a classic encroachment model with quantity decisions (Cournot model). Specifically, we identify two effects of the outside option on the strategic encroachment decision. The first, the deterrence effect, means that the manufacturer&#39;s encroachment is deterred by the threat of switching supplies altogether; while the second, the permissive effect, indicates that the retailer intends to switch to the alternative source after the encroachment. Interestingly, we show that the encroachment could improve the total profit of the incumbent manufacturer and the retailer even when the retailer&#39;s switch has occurred. In this case, however, the manufacturer profits while the retailer is hurt by the encroachment and the switch. Finally, we also investigate several extended cases to demonstrate the robustness of our findings.},

  abstract     = {There has been extensive research on the strategic choice between supply chain centralization and decentralization. However, most research assumes complete centralization or complete decentralization but omits the commonly adopted supply chain structure of partial centralization. With partial centralization, a firm owns a portion, but not all, of its partner. To help fill this research gap, in this paper, we make a major contribution by explicitly analyzing partial centralization in a supply chain where a durable‐good manufacturer owns a portion of its downstream retailer. We start with a two‐period model and derive analytical equilibrium outcomes of the supply chain and its members under complete centralization, complete decentralization, and partial centralization. First, our analysis reveals that partial centralization with an appropriate portion of ownership can yield the desirable product sales pattern over periods and alleviate the time‐inconsistency problem in selling durable goods. As a result, partial centralization can become the equilibrium structure for a durable‐good supply chain. Second, the manufacturer&#39;s optimal ownership level in the retailer decreases in the product durability and decision horizon length, implying that complete decentralization is more likely to be the supply chain structure in equilibrium for higher product durability and longer decision horizon. Third, our extended analyses demonstrate the robustness of the main results with backward partial centralization. Moreover, partial centralization outperforms conventional strategies such as two‐part tariffs that can coordinate a supply chain but not fully solve the time‐inconsistency problem associated with durable goods.},

Our method integrates quasi‐experiments, topic modeling, and deep learning techniques to not only estimate the impact of home sharing but also unveil the performance improvement mechanism. The findings reveal distinctive management response strategies across hotel price segments after home sharing&#39;s entry, which lead to divergent performance outcomes in guest satisfaction and sales. Regardless of their price segments, any hotel that responds more actively to guest reviews demonstrates improved guest satisfaction in service areas where home‐sharing leads (e.g., check‐in/out, cleanliness, sightseeing opportunity, and room conditions) and achieves higher sales. In contrast, hotels that respond less to guest reviews appear to lose guest satisfaction and sales to not only home sharing but also peer hotel cohorts that respond more.

We measure performance as the ratio of the expected cost of supply–demand mismatch from using a heuristic to the value in the full‐information solution. Numerical analysis shows that a simple heuristic that is common in practice—plan rigorously for a few “driver” resources with high‐quality information and use ratios (e.g., 0.25 indirect labor hours per machine hour) to project the capacities for the remaining “non‐driver” resources—is robust and efficient. Using more than one driver resource to plan for the same non‐driver resource delivers significant gains. Reducing measurement error with respect to the consumption of driver resources dominates the gain from reducing errors in other aspects. Indeed, with high measurement error, collecting information that reduces other sources of error could decrease overall performance. Finally, a greedy algorithm of choosing the most expensive resources as drivers is optimal.},

The results of a field experiment and a laboratory experiment show that product popularity and time restriction may not always have a positive influence on consumers’ product approach behavior. In particular, when consumers have not yet formed specific shopping goals, product popularity and time restriction weaken each other&#39;s effects on users’ initial product judgment, whereas these two information cues reinforce each other&#39;s effects on consumers’ final product evaluation when consumers’ shopping goals have become more specific.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the booming online grocery market and the extensive use of contingent free‐shipping (CFS) policies in the e‐grocery industry, we investigate the optimal CFS and pricing decisions for online grocers. Under a CFS policy, consumers enjoy free shipping for orders exceeding a certain threshold value; otherwise, they are charged a flat fee for orders below this threshold. We adopt a utility‐based model to capture consumers&#39; behavior of purchasing additional items to qualify for free shipping under a CFS policy and analyze its impact on policy structure and consumer surplus. We characterize the e‐grocer&#39;s optimal pricing and CFS policy and find that consumer heterogeneity and demand distribution lead to different forms of the optimal shipping policy. When consumer heterogeneity is large enough, the optimal policy induces some consumers to top up and may allow some others to ship for free. In this case, the e‐grocer can charge a high‐profit margin. Otherwise, a top‐up option is unnecessary, and a flat‐rate shipping fee policy is optimal. Moreover, while the optimal policy never induces all consumers to top up when they are rational, it is possible to do so when consumers associate some psychological disutility with the shipping fee. Surprisingly, the total consumer surplus under the optimal policy may increase in the latter case. We further model a Stackelberg game between an e‐grocer and an offline channel and find that the difference between the e‐grocer&#39;s internal shipping cost and consumers&#39; inconvenience cost of shopping offline is a main driver for market segmentation. Lastly, we show that a subscription‐based free‐shipping program, in addition to the jointly optimized CFS and pricing policy, cannot improve profits when consumers&#39; order size and frequency are independent. Our findings help online grocers make operational and marketing decisions under the impact of consumers&#39; top‐up behavior.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the general philosophy of the Operational Data Analytics (ODA) framework for data‐based decision modeling. The fundamental development of this framework lies in establishing the direct mapping from data to decision by identifying the appropriate class of operational statistics. The efficient decision making relies on a careful balance between data integration and decision validation . Through a canonical decision making problem under uncertainty, we show that the existing approaches (including statistical estimation and then optimization, retrospective optimization, sample average approximation, regularization, robust optimization, and robust satisficing) can all be unified through the lens of the ODA formulation. To make the key concepts accessible, we demonstrate, using a simple running example, how some of the existing approaches may become equivalent under the ODA framework, and how the ODA solution can improve the decision efficiency, especially in the small sample regime.},

  abstract     = {The aging population and increasing chronic disease load are rapidly changing the face of primary care delivery, with mid‐level (e.g., nurse) practitioners providing growing proportion of patient care. Potential differences in the quality of care offered by physicians and nurse practitioners may affect patient preferences, thus leading to patient choice behavior. This paper focuses on the problem of appointment scheduling for physician–nurse teams in the presence of patient choice and no‐shows. We propose a novel model that accounts for patient choices in a system with two provider types. Despite the increased structural complexity of the model, we derive sufficient conditions under which the problem is efficiently solvable. To counter the computational challenges arising in the general setting, we propose an easy‐to‐implement heuristic, which is proven to be optimal in the absence of patient no‐shows. Our numerical study shows how the ratio of qualities of care delivered by nurses and physicians affect the profitability of the medical practice, enabling the analysis of the trade‐offs involved in hiring a nurse practitioner. This paper introduces a patient‐controlled approach to incorporating nonphysician providers into physician‐led outpatient care delivery systems and compares it to widely used “ice breaker” and “standalone” modes of using nonphysician providers. Our findings reveal that clinical practices that employ mixed (physicians and nonphysicians) provider pools can significantly improve their financial and operational performance by moving away from the “ice breaker” and “standalone” use of nonphysician providers by delaying the selection of an appropriate care provider till the actual day of care delivery.},

  abstract     = {This study analyzes a monopolistic seller&#39;s optimal differential pricing problem with strategic consumers connected in social networks. The consumers who purchase in the later period can get positive externalities from their friends who purchased in the early period but have to bear a utility discount for the delayed consumption. We first characterize consumers&#39; strategic purchase decisions under general network structures. We then derive the optimal differential pricing strategies and demonstrate that different network structures lead to substantially different strategies. We find that when the intensity of the network externality effect is lower than a threshold and the influence matrix is symmetric, it is always optimal for the seller to conduct an increasing‐pricing strategy. However, when the network externality effect is strong, a decreasing‐pricing strategy may also be optimal. We further examine how the imbalance of influence, degree heterogeneity, and network topology impact the optimal pricing policy and profit. We find that when the intensity of network externality is relatively low, it is more profitable to sell products through many interconnected low‐influencer networks; however, when the network externality intensity is high, it is better to sell through a few high‐influencer networks. Finally, we show that the profit loss caused by uniform pricing strategies or by ignoring consumer network structures can be significant under certain conditions, thereby revealing the substantial value of differential pricing in social networks.},

  abstract     = {Pandemics, trade frictions, and military conflicts may disrupt manufacturers&#39; production capacity. This paper develops a two‐period supply chain model with supply disruption risk in the second period to investigate inventory decisions and the manufacturer&#39;s commitment strategies. We consider three strategies: no commitment, price commitment, and inventory commitment. Inventory holding within the supply chain is investigated under each strategy, and the dominant strategy is determined by comparing them. Distinct results arise due to supply disruption risk. First, the retailer may have two opposite motives for inventory holding: inventory‐building motive and inventory‐shifting motive (i.e., shifting inventory burden to the manufacturer by decreasing order quantity), where the latter is exclusive to situations with supply disruption risk. Price commitment suppresses both motives, and inventory commitment suppresses only inventory shifting. Second, the retailer never holds inventory under price commitment. Under no commitment and inventory commitment, for high (low) holding cost and disruption risk, only the manufacturer (retailer) holds inventory. Furthermore, the manufacturer&#39;s inventory may decrease as disruption risk increases. Third, regarding strategy choice, while each strategy can be the dominant choice for the retailer and the supply chain, the manufacturer (weakly) prefers inventory commitment to the other two strategies. However, the implementation of inventory commitment demands high supply chain transparency, as the manufacturer always has an incentive to secretly deviate by holding less inventory. When inventory commitment is infeasible, the price commitment strategy&#39;s performance varies compared to no commitment, contrasting with the disruption risk‐free literature where wholesale price commitment never outperforms no commitment.},

  abstract     = {Range and charge anxiety remain essential barriers to a faster electric vehicle (EV) market diffusion. To this end, quickly and reliably finding suitable charging stations may foster an EV uptake by mitigating drivers&#39; anxieties. Here, existing commercial services help drivers to find available stations based on real‐time availability data but struggle with data inaccuracy, for example, due to conventional vehicles blocking the access to public charging stations. In this context, recent works have studied stochastic search methods to account for availability uncertainty in order to minimize a driver&#39;s detour until reaching an available charging station. So far, both practical and theoretical approaches ignore driver coordination enabled by charging requests centralization or sharing of data, for example, sharing observations of charging stations&#39; availability or visit intentions between drivers. Against this background, we study coordinated stochastic search algorithms, which help to reduce station visit conflicts and improve the drivers&#39; charging experience. We model a multiagent stochastic charging station search problem as a finite‐horizon Markov decision process and introduce an online solution framework applicable to static and dynamic policies. In contrast to static policies, dynamic policies account for information updates during policy planning and execution. We present a hierarchical implementation of a single‐agent heuristic for decentralized decision making and a rollout algorithm for centralized decision making. Extensive numerical studies show that compared to an uncoordinated setting, a decentralized setting with visit intentions sharing decreases the system cost by 26%, which is nearly as good as the 28% cost decrease achieved in a centralized setting. Even in long planning horizons, our algorithm reduces the system cost by 25% while increasing each driver&#39;s search reliability.},

Expert customers can avail of the service on their own, whereas amateur customers find it challenging to deploy the service and can only procure the service through an intermediary who resolves the technical issues. We develop a model that captures the essential trade‐offs in such settings: heterogeneity in customer expertise, decentralization between a service provider and intermediary, and congestion due to limited capacity. We analyze how customer expertise differences drive the equilibrium outcomes under various pricing and priority schemes. We find that a sufficient base of amateur customers allows expert customers to “free‐ride” under single pricing. Price discrimination can fully allay such free‐riding, but it may drive prices downward. Price discrimination also favors expert customers under the First‐Come‐First‐Served (FCFS) policy, but such preference is generally reversed under prioritization. Specifically, prioritizing amateur customers can bring revenue and welfare gains relative to the FCFS policy and a policy that prioritizes expert customers. Our results offer normative guidelines for managing professional services, clarifying regimes for price and priority discrimination, along with revenue and welfare implications.},

  abstract     = {The promise of consumer data along with advances in information technology has spurred innovation not only in the way firms conduct their business operations but also in the manner in which data are collected. A prominent institutional structure that has recently emerged is a data cooperative —an organization that collects data from its members, and processes and monetizes the pooled data. A characteristic of consumer data is the externality it generates: Data shared by an individual reveal information about other similar individuals; thus, the marginal value of pooled data increases in both the quantity and quality of the data. A key challenge faced by a data cooperative is the design of a revenue‐allocation scheme for sharing revenue with its members. An effective scheme generates a beneficial cycle: It incentivizes members to share high‐quality data, which in turn results in high‐quality pooled data—this increases the attractiveness of the data for buyers and hence the cooperative&#39;s revenue, ultimately resulting in improved compensation for the members. While the cooperative naturally wishes to maximize its total surplus, two other important desirable properties of an allocation scheme are individual rationality and coalitional stability. We first examine a natural proportional allocation scheme —which pays members based on their individual contribution—and show that it simultaneously achieves individual rationality, the first‐best outcome, and coalitional stability, when members&#39; privacy costs are homogeneous. Under heterogeneity in privacy costs, we analyze a novel hybrid allocation scheme and show that it achieves both individual rationality and the first‐best outcome, but may not satisfy coalitional stability. Finally, our RobinHood allocation scheme —which uses a fraction of the revenue to ensure coalitional stability and allocates the remaining based on the hybrid scheme—achieves all the desirable properties.},

We experimentally expose participants to time pressure, noise, and emotional pictures. Using physiological and self‐reported data, we confirm that these manipulations have different effects on two components of the stress response (negative valence and arousal) and on decision‐making quality. Specifically, medium levels of arousal seem to boost decision‐making quality, independent of affective valence. However, high time pressure (characterized by high levels of arousal) leads to a collapse in decision‐making quality. Our results highlight that some level of stress may be beneficial for decision‐making owing to its action‐activating properties. However, excessive time pressure sharply overrides and outweighs these benefits. We discuss the generalizability of our results to other emergency situations (e.g., firefighters) and managerial contexts (e.g., crisis responses).},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of jointly optimizing the price and order quantity for a perishable product in a single selling period, also known as the pricing newsvendor problem, under demand ambiguity. Specifically, the demand is a function of the selling price and a random factor of which the distribution is unknown. We employ the minimax regret decision criterion to minimize the worst‐case regret, where the regret is defined as the difference between the optimal profit that could be obtained with perfect/complete information and the realized profit using the decision made with ambiguous demand information. First, given the interval in which the random factor lies with high probability, we characterize the optimal pricing and ordering decisions under the minimax regret criterion and compare their properties with those in the classical models that seek to maximize the expected profit. Specifically, we explore the impact of inventory risk by comparing the optimal price and the risk‐free price and study comparative statics with respect to the degree of demand ambiguity and the unit ordering cost. We further show that the minimax regret approach avoids the high degree of conservativeness that is often incurred in the application of the commonly used max–min robust optimization approach. Second, when partial distributional information of the random factor is available, we adopt the Wasserstein distance to depict the distributional ambiguity and characterize the set of worst‐case distributions and the maximum regret given the selling price and order quantity. Third, we compare the minimax regret approaches with the traditional profit‐maximization approach in a data‐driven setting. We show via a numerical study that the minimax regret approaches outperform the traditional profit‐maximization approach, especially when the data are scarce, the demand has high volatility, and the number of exercised prices is small. Furthermore, leveraging the partial distributional information of the random factor can further improve the performance of the minimax regret approach.},

We use a unique panel dataset collected between 2001 and 2011 from the Energy Saving through Partnership program in South Korea. Our findings show that, within the community for energy saving, firms that share their knowledge through presenting their best practices improve energy efficiency to a greater extent (approximately 11.8–14.8%) than free‐riders. Our results suggest that the improvement in knowledge‐sharing firms’ energy efficiency is attributed to relevant and tailored feedback gained from other participants. Further, we find that the understanding and activeness of other participants, which determine the quality and quantity of feedback respectively, significantly affect knowledge‐sharing firms’ energy efficiency. Overall, our analysis has implications for firms on how they can contribute to a collective response to climate change through their collaborative activities in an interfirm knowledge community.},

  abstract     = {Supply chains are dynamic and complex systems. This holds particularly true for humanitarian supply chains that operate under strong uncertainty. In view of an ever‐growing gap of unmet humanitarian needs, it is essential to gain a better understanding of the behavior of humanitarian supply chain systems. Despite a growing academic output in this field, there is a lack of empirical studies that take an integrated view on humanitarian supply chains and support decision makers with fact‐based evidence. Based on four extensive case studies and existing literature, we developed a system dynamics model that reflects the operational reality of humanitarian organizations in form of their centralized, hybrid and decentralized settings. The model provides a holistic supply chain view and measures the operational performance with regard to response cost, delivery lead time and impact on the local economy. Furthermore, we studied the impact of preparedness investments to enhance operational performance in the supply chain and deliver more humanitarian assistance with the limited resources available. Finally, we used our model to analyze the impact of major shocks such as the COVID‐19 pandemic to assess the vulnerability of humanitarian supply chains. The results indicate that operational settings, product and disaster characteristics have a major influence on the supply chain performance both in the noninvestment case as well as in the case where preparedness investments have been made. Specifically, for low‐value items, we find that decentralized settings have the lowest supply chain costs while for high‐value items the price difference between local and international procurement determines which setting is the most cost‐effective one. The preferability of the supply chain setting strongly depends on the indicator chosen. Hence, ultimately, the findings emphasize the need to apply appropriate indicators and identify their trade‐offs to comprehensively analyze the performance of humanitarian supply chain settings. The newly introduced Humanitarian Return‐on‐Investment concept can play an important role in this context.},

  abstract     = {To maintain future supplier competition, manufacturers may support financially distressed suppliers by sourcing from them, even if they are less efficient than competitors, and by procuring larger quantities from them at higher prices. We analyze these strategies in a model in which a manufacturer decides for one of two available suppliers, supplier bankruptcy risk is endogenous, and financial distress can lead to internal or external reorganization. Following bankruptcy, the remaining supplier may serve as a backup option. Our research identifies settings in which the manufacturer should support the distressed supplier. We also find that in some cases, a nondistressed supplier may charge price premiums due to its competitor&#39;s distress, while in other cases, it may use predatory pricing to drive its competitor into bankruptcy. We complement our results with a small case study and show how our model can explain patterns observed in industry.},

  abstract     = {We propose a general modular approach to support decision‐makers&#39; response in the early stages of a pandemic with resource expansion, motivated by the shortage of Covid‐19‐related intensive care units (ICU) capacity in 2020 in Italy. Our approach uses (1) a stochastic extension of an epidemic model for scenarios of projected infections, (2) a capacity load model to translate infections into scenarios of demand for the resources of interest, and (3) an optimization model to allocate this demand to the projected levels of resources based on different values of investment. We demonstrate this approach with the onset of the first and second Covid‐19 waves in three Italian regions, using the data available at that time. For epidemic modeling, we used a parsimonious stochastic susceptible‐infected‐removed model with a robust estimation procedure based on bootstrap resampling, suitable for a noisy and data‐limited environment. For capacity loading, we used a Cox queuing model to translate the projected infections into demand for ICU, using stochastic intensity to capture the variability of the patient arrival process. Finally, we used stochastic dynamic optimization to select the best policy (when and how much to expand) to minimize the expected number of patients denied ICU for any level of investment in capacity expansion and obtain an efficient frontier. The frontier allows a trade‐off between investment in additional resources and the number of patients denied intensive care. Moreover, in the panic‐driven early days of a pandemic, decision‐makers can also obtain the time until which they can postpone action, potentially reducing investment costs without increasing the expected number of denied patients.},

In this quest, location‐based advertising on mobile devices has emerged as an important marketing tool for targeting potential customers. The design of such advertising campaigns is complex, and their effectiveness depends on the ability to collect and examine data that aids in targeting the right customers at the right time and place. We develop a campaign design framework that explicitly accounts for the costs of acquiring and utilizing targeting data and the heterogeneous effects of such data in affecting the performance outcomes of mobile advertising campaigns. We illustrate the application of our campaign design framework through a real‐world case study of a mobile advertising campaign undertaken by a large global retail firm. Our findings suggest that the optimal set of attributes to use for effectively targeting the potential customers of a brick‐and‐mortar retail store varies with the distance between the customers&#39; current locations and that of the store. As a result, mobile campaign design approaches that utilize all or a naive subset of data attributes for targeted advertising yield lower levels of return on investments, relative to our proposed approach. Based on our results, we discuss implications for the design and deployment of mobile advertising campaigns and for further research on targeted advertising.},

While “amateurs” with low self‐design capability prefer a standard, pre‐configured product and can have strong preference for a particular brand, “experts” with high self‐design capability prefer a self‐designable package and tend to be indifferent between competing brands. First, we find that asymmetric equilibrium can arise where only one brand offers a self‐designable package and the other brand offers a standard product only. That is, brands can avoid the lose–lose situation, where both offer the self‐designable package but intensified price competition makes both lose profit. This lose–lose situation can be completely avoided when the two brands offer self‐designable packages that are completely nondifferentiated, but may arise in equilibrium and cause the “prisoner&#39;s dilemma” when the packages are slightly differentiated. Second, we show that between two competing brands whose standard products have different attractions, the less powerful brand that offers the less attractive standard product is more likely to be the only provider of the self‐designable package. Finally, we find that consumer surplus can be greater when the more powerful brand is the only provider of the self‐designable package than when the less powerful brand is the only provider.},

We construct a unique panel dataset combining data collected from multiple public and proprietary sources. To operationalize visual nudges from user‐generated content, we engage in extensive manual classification of images collected from Instagram (IG), Twitter (TW), and Facebook (FB). To examine the relationship between visual nudging and COVID‐19 positivity, we rely on a combination of econometric and epidemiological models. We find that when institutional actors share more images containing mask‐related information on IG, their COVID‐19 positivity rates decrease by up to 25%, on average. Also, given the fragmentary evidence behind FB and TW effects, our results provide suggestive evidence of the “boundary condition” of the visual nudge effect. Finally, empirical evidence indicates the dynamic and curvilinear effect of visual nudges on positivity over time, such that the informational value of visual nudging is most prominent if communicated 3 to 5 weeks ahead of time, on average. Our results demonstrate the informational value of visual nudges communicated through pertinent social media channels, as well as their capacity to improve public health outcomes. This suggests the feasibility of institutional actors using social media engagement to promote safe behaviors. We conclude by discussing how our findings may be used to develop more effective communication strategies regarding public perceptions of mask use and other relevant safety measures.},

  abstract     = {Online arbitrage, a recent trend on e‐commerce platforms, occurs when a firm (the “arbitrage firm”) copies the product description of another firm (the “designer firm,” who is the original seller of the product) and sells the product at a marked‐up price on a different platform from the designer firm. Once receiving a consumer&#39;s order, the arbitrage firm creates an order at the designer firm with a fake account and the consumer&#39;s shipping information. In this process, the designer firms fulfill all the purchase orders, and the arbitrage firm earns a profit without even touching the product. While the designer firm can enjoy a market expansion benefit, it also suffers from a high volume of product returns as some consumers eventually learn the true product price (from the receipt) and return the product they ordered from the arbitrage firm. We analyze the online arbitrage practice with a game‐theoretic model and show how the entry of an arbitrage firm can hurt the designer firm&#39;s profit. In the current practice, many designer firms cope with this issue by simply adjusting the price, but we show that such a strategy does not necessarily alleviate the problem. We propose a different strategy: the designer firm adjusts its refund policy to curb the greedy behavior of the arbitrage firm. We show that the proposed strategy leads the arbitrage firm to decrease its retail price, resulting in a smaller number of returns and higher profit for the designer firm.},

A related phenomenon is personal fabrication (PF) in which a firm sells products&#39; design and lets the customers personalize and manufacture the product using 3D printing services. In this paper, we characterize the market and operational conditions that make PF an attractive operational strategy. We propose a demand market model that captures customer heterogeneity in taste (horizontal) and quality (vertical) dimensions while allowing the market to be skewed with high versus low valuation customers. We quantify three key benefits of PF strategy: (i) the PF strategy enables personalization and improves product fit, (ii) the PF strategy can help the firm through postponement of product configuration, and (iii) the PF strategy enables easier design adjustments and allows design for manufacturability initiatives. Intellectual property and liability risks are significant barriers to the adoption of PF strategy. Furthermore, 3D printing may not be feasible for some parts of the product. In these cases, the firm may pursue the partial PF strategy: delegating only a proportion of the product for customer production. We also identify when partial PF becomes an attractive strategy.},

  abstract     = {Global trade is seafaring commerce; 90% of traded goods are carried by maritime transport, which has become vulnerable to security risks. This has led governments to initiate security programs serving tens of thousands of members worldwide. This paper studies the government&#39;s incentive design and the interaction between Customs inspection capacity and the incentives offered in security programs. Using the theory of incentives, we investigate the value of a partnership in improving the security of containerized supply chain. We developed a sequential game featuring the government, firms, and an adversary. The government selects the inspection capacity and incentives to foster the partnership, namely, an operational benefit in the form of a reduced inspection rate, and a security benefit obtained through reductions in the risks of adversarial infiltration. Firms subsequently decide on a collaboration level, followed by a strategic adversary&#39;s decision to infiltrate. Using the adversary&#39;s best response, we show that, in equilibrium, the government ranks all the firms and induces collaboration with only a subset of them. We demonstrate that, in equilibrium, while security incentives may benefit all participants, tailored operational incentives should be offered strictly to foster collaboration. The required condition to implement the inspection‐free lane for members is also characterized. Our results also inform practice to help security policymakers understand the underlying interaction between Customs inspection capacity and incentive design in forging collaboration with private firms. In particular, as firms opting for collaboration experience lower inspection rates, this further reduces overall congestion, which, in turn, creates a positive externality for nonmember firms. Therefore, having an excess inspection capacity may result in shorter wait times that could dissuade firms from collaborating.},

  abstract     = {Many companies are under pressure to improve pay transparency; however, its impact on their agents and principals remains unclear. As a way to investigate the upside and downside of pay transparency, we conduct our study based on a scenario in which agents have “cognitive bias” (namely, over‐ or underconfident ). We also capture the notion of “social comparisons” behavior (namely, behind‐averse and ahead‐seeking ) that occurs under pay transparency. By exploring a one‐principal‐two‐agent model, we find that agents&#39; optimal effort decisions are affected by the “intersection” between agents&#39; social comparison behavior and cognitive bias. Specifically, relative to the opaque policy, we find that pay transparency can entice agents to improve their job performance (in general). Our analysis also provides a guideline for principals to implement transparent payment policies properly (including the optimal payment scheme and the recruitment strategy). Specifically, pay transparency could enable the principal to offer a lower merit‐based factor level but a higher base salary level than opaque policy to motivate agents. To obtain high retained earnings, it is profitable for the principal to hire an overconfident agent if the principal chooses to adopt the opaque policy, but hire a mildly underconfident agent if pay transparency is selected. Moreover, we extend the base model to incorporate working capability heterogeneity across agents. We find that the agent&#39;s effort incentive and his opponent&#39;s working capability move in the same direction when the two agents&#39; working capabilities are comparable under the transparent policy. Finally, by incorporating the environment&#39;s relative favoritism into the base model, we observe that when the environment is highly uncertain, the underconfident agent is willing to leverage environment uncertainty but the overconfident agent is willing to exert more effort.},

  abstract     = {One of the most important trends in the pharmaceutical industry is the rapid growth of specialty drugs. Specialty drugs, mostly bio based, tend to be high risk, high priced, and more regulated than traditional drugs, resulting in unprecedented challenges in distribution. Such challenges lead to the emergence of specialty distributors (SDs), which, compared with traditional wholesalers (WSs), represent a more controlled channel and carry a smaller variety of drugs. Due to the risky nature of specialty drugs, manufacturers must consider the trade‐off between access and control in determining whether to use SDs (partially or exclusively). Using a unique dataset assembled from multiple proprietary and public data sources on the transactions for 419 specialty drugs across 11 manufacturers (including 8 of the top 15 manufacturers), 161 distributors, and 129,911 points of care (POCs) in 2012–2015, we investigate how the competing factors of access and control influence manufacturers’ usage of SDs (vs. WSs), with access indicated by downstream POCs’ required product variety and control indicated by regulations on the network. We find that interestingly, the imposition of the regulations in general on the product is not associated with higher usage of SDs, but the imposition of the regulations with a specific element (restrictive access) is.

  abstract     = {Disputes between retailers and manufacturers often result in the retailer delisting the manufacturer&#39;s products, which dramatically alters competition in the retail market. When rival products are temporarily delisted, the products remaining on retail shelves are expected to gain sales due to substitution. However, it is unclear how much sales gain of remaining products can be expected, how long the sales gain persists after the rival products are relisted, whether the sales gain varies in different product categories, and whether the sales gain spills over from the delisting retailer to nearby retailers. In this research, we exploit a natural experiment enabled by a dispute between a retail chain and a beverage manufacturer that resulted in a 4‐week delisting of all products by the manufacturer (the delisted manufacturer) across all of the retailer&#39;s U.S. stores. We focus on a manufacturer (the focal manufacturer) that directly competes with the delisted manufacturer and quantify the sales gain for this focal manufacturer during the delisting and after the relisting event. Interestingly, in a near‐duopoly market, the focal manufacturer only gained 12.2% of sales during the delisting. After the dispute was settled and competition restored, the focal manufacturer&#39;s sales fluctuated for about 2 months before returning to the pre‐delisting level. Additionally, we find a spillover in sales gain to nearby stores during the delisting, which was mainly to small‐box retail stores rather than big‐box stores. Moreover, at both delisting and nearby stores, we find the focal manufacturer&#39;s sugar‐sweetened, caffeinated, and star products gained sales during the event while other products did not. We check the robustness of our results with a machine learning nonparametric method, among a few other alternative methods, to measure the average treatment effects. Understanding the size and duration of these heterogeneous effects can help manufacturers and retailers better respond to changes in market competition and evaluate their delisting decisions.},

  abstract     = {Discrete games provide the means to analyze market dynamics with limited data. However, computing such games with many players—especially in a complete information setting—is computationally infeasible because the strategy space increases exponentially with the number of players. This study presents a novel and practical method to compute and estimate discrete games. To do so, the study introduces two methodological innovations. First, we develop an efficient simulator that requires fewer random draws to evaluate the likelihood of discrete games with multiple equilibria. The augmented simulator avoids random draws that are not compatible with the observed equilibrium outcome and, thus, efficiently uses all draws to evaluate the likelihood. Second, we utilize general‐purpose computing on graphics‐processing unit (GPGPU), using multiple processing cores in a graphics‐processing unit, to increase computational speed. The two features allow us to estimate the model significantly faster compared to traditional methods. The study&#39;s empirical application examines the effect of Apple&#39;s company‐owned stores on the retail market structure. The results show that agglomeration effects exist between Apple and upscale firms. The presence of an Apple store attracts high‐income customers, promoting the entry of upscale firms and the exit of discount firms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate whether and how investors of suppliers learn from the private information embedded in the customer credit default swap (CDS) market prior to customer earnings announcements. We find that investors of suppliers indeed incorporate the customer private information revealed in the CDS market into the supplier valuation, thereby leading to significant changes in suppliers’ future stock prices. Moreover, such price discovery effect is more pronounced when: (i) the level of customer private information revealed in the CDS market is more prominent; (ii) the customer bond market is more illiquid; (iii) the customers are expected to report bad earnings news or experience deteriorated credit conditions; (iv) the strength of the supplier–customer economic bond is stronger. Our results remain robust when we control for the supplier&#39;s own CDS market price discovery effect or conduct matched sample analyses. Finally, utilizing the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd–Frank Act) as an exogenous shock, we show that the effect of customer CDS trading on suppliers’ future stock prices is less pronounced after the Dodd–Frank Act due to more explicit regulation on informed trading activities. Overall, our study documents significant cross‐market information transmission along the supply chain network (i.e., from the customer derivative market to the supplier equity market).},

  abstract     = {Although past studies have found differences in clinical quality outcomes based on patients&#39; insurance type, the extent of these discrepancies, the underlying mechanisms supporting this relationship, and factors that can moderate this effect have not yet been addressed. We seek to fill this gap by studying the relationship between insurance type and clinical quality outcomes using the level of care received, that is, treatment intensity, as a mediator. Using agency theory, we argue that underinsured patients (patients insured by Medicaid) will experience more adverse clinical quality outcomes due to lower treatment intensity compared to privately insured patients. We then explore whether two contextual factors—patient complexity and resource utilization—influence the relationship between insurance type and treatment intensity, and in turn clinical quality outcomes. We use 2010–2016 data from California to test these relationships. The insurance types used for comparison are private and Medi‐Cal (California&#39;s equivalent of Medicaid, representing underinsured patients). A patient&#39;s 30‐day readmission rate is used as a measure of clinical quality and the log of charges normalized by wage index and inflation (called treatment intensity) is used as a proxy for the level of care they received. We use within‐hospital coarsened exact score matching to create a comparable group of patients using private and Medi‐Cal insurance followed by a hospital fixed effects regression with errors clustered by hospital to test these relationships. Results indicate that treatment intensity mediates the relationship between insurance type and clinical quality outcomes. Further, the difference in treatment intensity based on insurance type is reduced as patient complexity increases, while higher utilization at a hospital lowers its incentive to provide equitable care to underinsured patients.},

Such information influences the behavior of the passengers who think strategically and consequently the throughput and the welfare that are generated by the system. In the present work, we consider a general model of a transportation station where strategic customers arrive according to a Poisson process, the arriving instants of the transportation facilities form a renewal process and the capacities of successively arriving facilities are finite. Customers decide whether to stay or balk based on their expected waiting costs and the probability of being served, conditioning on the information provided. The information may include the capacity of the next facility, the elapsed time from the previous visit of the facility and/or the number of waiting customers in the station. We derive the customer equilibrium strategies and compare the equilibrium throughput and social welfare, under various information structures. We then determine the ideal level of information that should be provided according to the operational and economic parameters of a given system. Providing the elapsed time from the previous visit of the facility is of utmost importance for infrequent transportation visits. On the other hand, revealing the number of waiting customers is the most advantageous piece of information in the case of frequent facility&#39;s visits and small mean capacity.},

  abstract     = {Products approaching the end of their shelf life on retail store shelves are more likely to result in food waste. For this reason, manufacturers establish shipping policies related to the age of the products that leave their warehouses, that is, they set a maximum age beyond which shipping to retail stores is no longer allowed. In practice, most existing policies are simple one‐size‐fits‐all rules that do not accommodate the varying characteristics of the products. We offer a framework that manufacturers can use to determine maximum shipping age thresholds based on a Markov chain model, where the objective is to maximize profit, net of the cost of expiration at the warehouse and retail stores. We derive analytical insights about the impact of a shipping age threshold on food waste in the supply chain and obtain sufficient conditions under which a maximum shipping age threshold is suboptimal within the class of Ship‐Oldest‐First (a.k.a. First‐In‐First‐Out ) issuing policies. We also numerically investigate the relationship between different system parameters (e.g., demand rate, waste cost at warehouse and retail, warehouse inventory, total shelf life) and the optimal shipping age threshold. Using real data from our industry collaborator, we compute the optimal shipping age thresholds at the stock‐keeping‐unit (SKU) level for over 450 products and find that 9–10% of the SKUs currently have suboptimal shipping age thresholds. This presents an opportunity to improve profits by up to 8.7% and reduce food waste by up to 14.7%. These improvements correspond to up to $292,561 savings and 1846 truckloads of waste reduction annually. Our framework can be adopted by any firm and satisfies a much emphasized need in industry to control food waste through shelf life management.},

In this study, we strive to advance this line of inquiry by exploring the dynamics of such socially embedded supply chains, examining whether and when the dissolution of managerial ties between two firms would cause the subsequent termination of their supplier–buyer exchanges. We address this question by distinguishing two types of socially embedded supply chains based on their different relational origins: business‐with‐friend links in which the managerial ties precede the supply chains, and friend‐in‐business links in which the supplier–buyer exchanges precede the managerial ties. We posit that the managerial tie dissolution has a negligible effect on the subsequent termination of supply chains in business‐with‐friend links. In contrast, in friend‐in‐business links, the dissolution of managerial ties between two firms is associated with a significantly higher likelihood for their supplier–buyer exchanges to dissolve afterward. We find strong empirical evidence for the above propositions using a nuanced data set that integrates the managerial tie information and the supply chain data. In sum, we show that socially embedded supply chains with different origins (“doing business with friends” vs. “making friends in business”) would have distinct patterns of evolution and dissolution.},

  abstract     = {We study the optimal selling scheme when a seller sells a product/service with a positive consumption externality, and customers are uncertain about the product&#39;s/service&#39;s value. Because early adopters learn this value, we consider the customers&#39; intrinsic signaling incentives and positive feedback effects. Allowing the seller to choose the sequence of customers&#39; decisions (as an endogenous hierarchy) implies that signaling takes place in multiple rounds. To tackle this hierarchical signaling problem, we develop a novel dynamic‐programming approach that yields analytical expressions of the equilibrium outcomes. The profit‐maximizing structure turns out to be a chain in which the seller sells to the customers one by one. The sequential selling scheme is not only profitable for the seller but also beneficial to the society. The profit‐maximizing pricing exhibits a cream‐skimming property–decreasing prices along the sequence. The lack of seller&#39;s commitment is detrimental to the social welfare; nonetheless, the sequential selling still boosts up the seller&#39;s profit. When customers are allowed to freely disclose their quantity decisions to others, they willingly comply with the seller&#39;s plan of information transmissions. Despite the inherent value uncertainty, the optimal usage of information transmissions requires deliberate restricted access to information among customers. Our result also suggests some congruence between the profit and welfare maximization.},

  abstract     = {We consider a general class of price‐based network revenue management problems that a firm aims to maximize revenue from multiple products produced with multiple types of resources endowed with limited inventory over a finite selling season. A salient feature of our problem is that the firm does not know the underlying demand function that maps prices to demand rate, which must be learned from sales data. It is well known that for almost all classes of demand functions, such as linear, exponential, multinomial logit, and nested logit models, the revenue rate function is not concave in the products&#39; prices but is concave in products&#39; market shares (or price‐controlled demand rates). This creates challenges in adopting any stochastic gradient descent based methods in the price space. We propose a novel nonparametric learning algorithm termed the online inverse batch gradient descent (IGD) algorithm. This algorithm proceeds in batches. In each batch, the firm implements each product&#39;s perturbed prices and then uses the sales information to estimate the market shares. Leveraging these estimates, the firm carries out a stochastic gradient descent step in the market share space that takes into account the relative inventory scarcity for the entire horizon and then inversely maps the updated market shares back to the price space to obtain the prices for the next batch. Moreover, we also propose an inventory‐adjusted algorithm (IGD‐I) that the feasible market share set is dynamically adjusted to capture the real‐time relative inventory scarcity for the remaining season. For the large‐scale systems wherein all resources&#39; inventories and the length of the horizon are proportionally scaled by a parameter k , we establish a dimension‐independent regret bound of O ( k 4 / 5 log k ) $O(k^{4/5} \log k)$ . This result is independent of the number of products and resources and works for a continuum action‐set prices and the demand functions that are only once differentiable . Our theoretical result guarantees the efficacy of both algorithms in the high‐dimensional systems where the number of products or resources is large and the prices are continuous. Our algorithms also numerically outperform the existing algorithms in the literature.},

Yet, online platforms face an operational challenge in implementing machine learning algorithms for managing online content due to the labeling problem, where labeled data used for model training are limited and costly to obtain. To address this issue, we propose a domain adaptive transfer learning via adversarial training approach to augment fake content detection with collective human intelligence. We first start with a source domain dataset containing deceptive and trustworthy general news constructed from a large collection of labeled news sources based on human judgments and opinions. We then extract discriminating linguistic features commonly found in source domain news using advanced deep learning models. We transfer these features associated with the source domain to augment fake content detection in three target domains: political news, financial news, and online reviews. We show that domain invariant linguistic features learned from a source domain with abundant labeled examples can effectively improve fake content detection in a target domain with very few or highly unbalanced labeled data. We further show that these linguistic features offer the most value when the level of transferability between source and target domains is relatively high. Our study sheds light on the platform operation in managing online content and resources when applying machine learning for fake content detection. We also outline a modular architecture that can be adopted in developing content screening tools in a wide spectrum of fields.},

  abstract     = {In recent decades, manufacturers have relied on giant retailers or e‐tailers to distribute their products. Given this evolution, some retailers have started demanding a profit‐margin‐guarantee contract (PMG contract), under which the manufacturer must ensure that the retailer&#39;s profit margin does not fall below a certain level (PMG rate). Conventional wisdom suggests that a PMG contract creates a life‐or‐death struggle for the manufacturer and that a retailer with a PMG contract can gain a competitive edge over his competitors. This study investigates the strategic impact of the PMG contract in a competitive environment. We consider a distribution channel consisting of one manufacturer and two competing retailers. In this channel, the manufacturer has signed a PMG contract with one retailer (signed retailer) but not with the other (unsigned retailer). Our analyses show that in response to the PMG contract, the manufacturer can adopt a “ cost‐independent ” pricing strategy (i.e., setting the wholesale price independent of the production cost) to strategically trigger or void the PMG contract. For this reason, interestingly, the manufacturer is not always hurt by, nor does the signed retailer always benefit from, the PMG contract. Depending on the production cost and the downstream competition intensity, the PMG contract may yield a win–win , win–lose , lose–win , or lose–lose outcome for the manufacturer and the signed retailer. Moreover, the unsigned retailer may be able to free ride on the PMG contract, making her even better off under this unfavorable competitive situation. Nevertheless, the PMG contract cannot yield a win–win–win outcome for all firms, whereas a lose–lose–lose outcome may arise under certain conditions. Our results have useful managerial and regulatory implications.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the challenge of allocating scarce resources from the federal government to different states during the COVID‐19 pandemic, this paper studies optimal schemes for allocating scarce resources to agents with private demand information under different favoritism structures. Through an investigation of a mechanism design model that aims to induce agents to report their demands truthfully, we find the following results. First, when the principal purely cares about social welfare and when the principal has sufficient resources to satisfy all agents&#39; demands, we find that the optimal allocation scheme is efficient in the sense that it is identical to the optimal scheme for the “benchmark” case when favoritism differentials and information asymmetry are both absent. Second, when rationing is needed due to resource scarcity, we show that heterogeneity in “event‐independent” favoritism across agents will cause the principal to allocate more resources to agents with larger favoritism and less resources to others, resulting in inefficient allocations. Third, when agents possess heterogeneous “event‐specific” favoritism due to the existence of outside options, the resulting allocation may boost all agents&#39; expected utilities, including those agents who do not have any outside option. Finally, we show that the “allocation distortion” caused by both information asymmetry and heterogeneous favoritism can be reduced when “positive externality” is present (i.e., allocating resources to one agent can benefit other agents).},

  abstract     = {The rise of contract farming has transformed millions of farmers&#39; lives. We study a new class of contract farming problems, where the farmer holds superior information and can invest effort to improve productivity over time. Despite their prevalence, the literature offers little guidance on how to manage such farmers with dynamic incentives. We build a game‐theoretic model that captures the dynamic incentives of learning and gaming, with hidden action and information. We characterize the optimal contract: it internalizes both the vertical and intertemporal externalities, with performance pay and deferred payment; the performance pay is to motivate the farmer to invest and improve the relationship‐specific productivity; the deferred payment is to ensure that the farmer is willing to share information and behave honestly over time. Even with random yield, the optimal contract can still have a simple implementation of a yield‐adjusted revenue‐sharing policy. Using real data, we show that the learning effect is significant. We then quantify when and how contract farming can improve smallholder farmers&#39; productivity and income, creating shared value. We find when buyers have a long‐term perspective and can internalize the benefit of farmer improvement, they will pay higher prices to ensure farmers&#39; long‐term viability. Our results inform the policy debate on contract farming: traditional procompetitive policies (based on spot transactions) can be counterproductive for modern agrifood value chains, hurting both buyers and farmers.},

As the provision of online review videos grows and consumers increasingly rely on them for their purchase decisions, understanding factors that contribute to the perceived helpfulness of video reviews becomes critical for video review management. This paper examines how various visual and vocal characteristics of online review videos are associated with the perceived helpfulness of videos. We collect detailed observational data on 13,840 electronic product review videos posted on YouTube and employ video content analysis, speech recognition, and natural language processing techniques to extract the visual and vocal characteristics of review videos. By using econometric models, we find that the increase in visual stimulation, captured by brightness and visual dynamics, increases the perceived helpfulness of reviews. In addition, featuring reviewers’ faces in review videos increases the perceived helpfulness of videos. Consumers also perceive review videos in which reviewers express more positive facial emotions as more helpful. Furthermore, lower voice pitch and faster speech rates are associated with higher perceived helpfulness of reviews. To complement the empirical analysis and further isolate the causal effects of review brightness and pitch, we conduct controlled experiments. Overall, the findings can facilitate the management and operation of online review videos for product reviewers, businesses, review platforms, and consumers. In particular, the findings provide direct and actionable guidance to content generators who aim to create more helpful product reviews.},

  abstract     = {Traditionally, manufacturer encroachment is investigated under an integrated organizational structure where online business decisions are made at the whole firm level. However, with the establishment of a specific e‐commerce division, the manufacturer has the flexibility to delegate the decision‐making of the online business to its e‐commerce division to maximize the online revenue under a decentralized structure. We study manufacturer encroachment in a supply chain, where a manufacturer sells through a bricks‐and‐mortar retailer and plans to deploy its e‐commerce division to launch the online direct‐to‐consumer business. Different from prior research, we endogenize the manufacturer&#39;s choice between the integrated and the decentralized structures in its encroachment pursuit. Our results suggest that the decentralized structure could enlarge the manufacturer&#39;s feasible range to encroach, but it would also intensify the competition between the e‐commerce division and the retailer. Therefore, choosing the decentralized structure does not necessarily yield a higher profit for the manufacturer because the loss in the retail channel may be hard to offset due to the intensified competition. Instead, choosing the integrated structure could lead to a win–win–win outcome for the manufacturer, retailer, and e‐commerce division when the direct selling cost is sufficiently low. Although the manufacturer may benefit from encroachment under both organizational structures, it should not encroach when the direct selling cost is between low and moderate. Notably, the bright side of manufacturer encroachment&#39;s impact on the retailer still exists under the decentralized structure. We also study some alternative settings, including consumers’ offline hassle cost, market‐based transfer price, and quantity competition, to obtain additional insights.},

We parameterize the uncertainty level via a mean‐preserving spread and investigate the behavior of both retailers&#39; equilibrium stocks and their expected profits in response to demand uncertainty reduction.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates how managers in the upstream firm (i.e., supplier) adjust their allocations of cost resources in response to managerial expectations of the downstream firms (i.e., customers) on the future demand and prospects. We conduct an empirical analysis to examine the impact of the tone of customers’ forward‐looking disclosures (FLDs) contained in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of 10‐K filings on suppliers’ asymmetric cost behaviors, characterizing costs decreasing less for sales fall than increasing for equivalent sales rise (i.e., “cost stickiness”). We show that the degree of suppliers’ asymmetric cost management is positively associated with their customers’ tone of FLDs. Moreover, such an association is stronger when the suppliers produce more unique products for their major customers. Our inferences remain robust after controlling for the strategic disclosure behavior of the customer firms, ruling out an alternative mechanism of suppliers’ own managerial expectations and managerial empire‐building incentives. Lastly, using a decision made by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 as a quasi‐natural experiment setting, we show that the effect of customers’ tone of FLDs on suppliers’ cost stickiness becomes stronger when FLDs are more informative. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to introduce cost stickiness in the operations management context to capture management&#39;s operational decision intervention regarding resource allocation. We also contribute to information sharing literature by highlighting the importance of channels other than the traditional explicit information sharing channel in obtaining demand‐relevant information in supply chains.},

  abstract     = {In current clinical practice, priority‐specific wait time targets are usually determined based on the consensus of medical specialists and health care administrators. The rationale behind this approach considers clinical urgency but it does not consider the efficient use of clinical resources and the patient volume associated with each priority class. The approach we present here aims to determine wait time targets in a systematic fashion that both respects clinically acceptable maximum recommended wait times and considers clinic size and demand distribution across patient classes. First, we discuss the performance of several advance patient scheduling policies in the literature in terms of average wait times and overtime and select one for illustrative purposes. Second, we simulate the chosen policy given a demand distribution and a fixed system capacity and approximate (using regression and neural networks) the average wait time for each priority class and the use of overtime as a function of potential wait time targets. Finally, using a parameterized cost function, we formulate forward and inverse mathematical problems to determine when the implicit unit wait time costs drop to zero as wait time target values increase. Using illustrative examples with two patient classes, and a practical application with four patient classes, we demonstrate the potential managerial benefits of the proposed approach in terms of improved clinic efficiency and reduced wait times. This approach ensures that wait times are set to the minimum value that still achieves the maximal resource efficiency ensuring that patients wait for service is not extended unnecessarily.},

  abstract     = {Online peer‐to‐peer (P2P) lending has emerged as an innovative financial technology (FinTech) platform that renders financial services that are potentially more inclusive and affordable than those offered by traditional financial institutions. A similar purpose is served by cryptocurrency markets, where transaction costs are reduced and financial accessibility is improved based on disruptive technologies such as blockchain and distributed ledgers. Despite these developments, however, in the operations management literature limited attention has been devoted to the contribution of online P2P lending to the promotion of financial inclusion (i.e., the availability and usage of financial services for all groups of people) and its dynamic interplay with cryptocurrency markets. The rise of cryptocurrency markets affects the composition and activity of borrowers and investors in P2P lending markets and hence the capacity of the latter to support financial inclusion, leading to an operations management challenge in online P2P lending. We examine how cryptocurrency markets influence P2P lending markets&#39; democratization of access to financial services, particularly P2P borrowing. To investigate these effects in depth, we develop a simple theoretical model to derive testable propositions, which are then empirically validated on the basis of unique data sets. We find that the growth in cryptocurrency markets is associated with increased loan requests and larger loan amounts in P2P markets, especially from borrowers who maintain good credit ratings, possess technical knowledge about cryptocurrencies, and intend to borrow for investment purposes. Our results suggest that cryptocurrency markets bring economic gains to the P2P lending market, at least in the short term. Nonetheless, the transfer of funds from P2P lending to cryptocurrency markets, particularly by highly creditworthy and tech‐savvy investors, may provoke increased inequality in access to P2P lending markets. By scrutinizing the interdependence between two representative FinTech markets we uncover important operations management implications for theory and practice regarding the healthy growth and effective governance of crowdfunding platforms and the corresponding sustainability of their role in upholding financial inclusion.},

Using feature data, we classify patients into different types using machine learning methods and characterize the uncertain surgery duration via a feature‐based cluster‐wise ambiguity set. We propose a feature‐driven adaptive robust optimization model that minimizes an overtime riskiness index, which helps mitigate both the magnitude and probability of working overtime. The model can be reformulated as a second‐order conic programming problem. From the reformulation, we find that minimizing the overtime riskiness index is equivalent to minimizing a Fano factor. This makes our robust optimization model easily interpretable to healthcare practitioners. To efficiently solve the problem, we develop a branch‐and‐cut algorithm and introduce symmetry‐breaking constraints. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms benchmark models in a variety of performance metrics.},

Prior researchers have called for a systems approach in these contexts, arguing that standard OM methodologies such as mathematical programming, and queuing theory often cannot fully address these problems. Researchers have employed one such systems approach, system dynamics, successfully for decades for studying OM problems in public policy because it can address such complexity and can also integrate disciplines from outside OM such as political science, epidemiology, ecology, etc. In this paper, we create a roadmap for researchers—both those who are familiar with systems dynamics and those who are not—for the expanded use of system dynamics studying public policy‐related OM problems. We review and organize relevant system dynamics literature in both traditional operations management venues as well as public policy venues unfamiliar to OM audiences . We then identify a set of interesting open questions and potential system dynamics building blocks for answering them by topic. Leveraging this review, we describe under what conditions system dynamics is most appropriate. We then identify several overarching methodological and domain gaps for future research. Finally, we build on previous work to extend a process for using system dynamics with traditional operations management methodologies. It separates model building into two sequential phases: consensus‐building models and detailed operational models. It also incorporates scenario planning and feedback from implementation outcomes.},

  abstract     = {A downstream manufacturer can procure high‐quality inputs from its upstream raw material supplier to produce finished products with high quality. The manufacturer may also have the option to source alternative cheaper low‐quality inputs to partially replace the inputs from its supplier to produce finished products of lower quality. That is, the manufacturer can use a mixture of the supplier&#39;s inputs and alternative ones in product design such that product quality depends on the proportion of each input used in products. We endogenize this product quality decision in a simple analytical model to study the impact of this option on the supplier&#39;s profits. Intuitively, the option of sourcing alternative inputs could hurt the supplier in two ways: It sells fewer inputs, and it needs to set a lower wholesale price due to competitive pressure. However, our study reveals an opposite finding: The supplier can benefit not only by selling more inputs but also by setting a higher wholesale price when the manufacturer has the option of sourcing alternative low‐quality inputs. This interesting finding is due to the wholesale price push‐up effect : The upstream supplier may deliberately raise the wholesale price when sourcing alternative inputs is an option for the downstream manufacturer. This increased wholesale price encourages the manufacturer to use a higher proportion of alternative cheaper inputs in its product design; as a result, the manufacturer&#39;s marginal cost is reduced, which leads to a decrease in its retail price. Therefore, consumer demand for the manufacturer&#39;s products becomes higher, which in turn results in higher manufacturer demand for the supplier&#39;s inputs. Moreover, we show that despite this higher wholesale price, the manufacturer can earn higher profits by optimally charging a lower retail price. Furthermore, we find that the wholesale price of the supplier&#39;s inputs can exceed the manufacturer&#39;s retail price, thereby leading to a negative profit margin for the manufacturer from using the supplier&#39;s inputs. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our findings under several model extensions.},

Brand marketers have recently begun using online intent advertising (OIA), which is online advertising such as search or display advertising targeted at consumer intent, for brand building. Unlike traditional media advertising, OIA is sold through an auction of indicators of consumer intent such as keyword phrases. This practice raises questions about how media planners should incorporate OIA in their decision making. We analyze this critical issue using a model of horizontally differentiated competing firms. Our analysis finds that traditional advertising spending strategically affects online ad bids in a way that is new to the literature. We find that even when traditional and OIA have similar benefits, a firm may optimally bid more for OIA per consumer reached than the maximum cost it would pay for reaching a consumer in a world with only traditional media. We also find that interestingly, a firm may be willing to pay more for traditional advertising when OIA is an option than when it is unavailable.},

  abstract     = {Employers are under increasing pressure from regulators, investors, and their own employees to address gender pay inequity in their compensation structure. However, managers tasked with measuring and closing gender and other pay gaps have few helpful quantitative tools at their disposal. We design and implement an algorithm that measures whether an employer has a pay gap and suggests salary adjustments to close it, all while supporting the employer&#39;s goals with respect to equity, culture, and incentives in its pay structure. We present our approach through a case study of one of the first firms we worked with. We also discuss the application of the approach at other organizations ranging from 75 to 130,000 employees. Our work not only provides management personnel with an accessible solution to a problem of growing social and practical importance but also demonstrates how the operations management toolkit may be applied to improve human resources management and address an important social problem.},

  abstract     = {We study a long‐term service agreement (LTSA) between an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a conventional power generator and a utility firm in the electricity supply chain. The OEM offers the LTSA to the utility firm, which specifies the service fee and the maintenance interval. The utility firm dynamically chooses among different resources (conventional, renewable, or emergency) to meet energy demand. An LTSA contracts on a generator&#39;s long‐term production schedule (i.e., the usage time and number of starts). We first characterize that the conventional generator&#39;s optimal operating mode (i.e., on or off) follows a two‐threshold policy, which shows a hysteresis phenomenon. Then, the optimal production from different resources can be obtained by minimizing the utility firm&#39;s cost of the current period. We prove that the OEM&#39;s optimal LTSA design on the maintenance interval and service fee can be solved sequentially, and capture the trade‐off between the service margin and the usage of conventional generator. Our numerical results show that the utility firm starts the conventional generator less often as the maintenance service fee of a start increases and the minimum conventional output decreases. The OEM has incentives to reduce the minimum output to make the conventional generator more flexible, but such improvement may not benefit the utility firm. Finally, increasing renewable penetration leads to more frequent cycling of the conventional generator and less conventional output. With more renewable generation and less conventional and emergency generation, higher renewable penetration reduces the utility firm&#39;s cost, the OEM&#39;s profit, and the total emission.},

The operations of the firm are organized as a process , consisting of a sequence of tasks, each of random duration. The firm shares real‐time information with the consumer about the progress of their flow unit in the firm&#39;s process via a process tracker . The consumer is delay‐sensitive and experiences gain–loss utility (loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity) over time due to changes in beliefs about anticipated delay, as he awaits completion of the process. We analyze when providing such real‐time progress information via process trackers help, or can possibly hurt a consumer. Our work draws upon the recent literature on belief‐based/news utility in Economics. We find that in the presence of loss aversion alone, not sharing progress information is beneficial. In the presence of loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity, if low delays are likely, then sharing information is beneficial; otherwise, not sharing information is preferred.

Through the lens of Porter&#39;s diamond model, this study conceptualizes government support as slack resources and investigates how it affects a firm&#39;s inventive activities in an uncertain, competitive global market. This study examines Chinese firms&#39; patent filings in the United States under the enactment of the “innovative city” policy. We apply matching and generalized difference‐in‐differences techniques to this staggered quasi‐experimental setting and find that government support stimulates firms&#39; cross‐border innovation. We further show that firms with higher research and development capacity take better advantage of government support. Finally, we show that government support leads to a rebalancing of exploratory and exploitative innovation such that a firm that has conducted more exploration will perform more exploitation and vice versa. Taken together, this study extends our understanding of slack from internal resources to government support in the context of global operations. Findings suggest that government actions that improve the ecosystem of innovation in one country strengthen firms&#39; innovation and competitiveness overseas.},

We further show that the thresholds and optimal allocation quantity for each community are nondecreasing in resource levels, realized demand from the current community, and weight of the efficiency objective. Based on these results, we propose a simple heuristic policy and numerically show that it performs well and generates fair allocations in a stochastic majorization order. The numerical results show that adding a small weight to the fairness objective significantly improves the system&#39;s fairness at a small efficiency cost. Moreover, the optimal initial capacity level is increasing (decreasing) in demand variance if the efficiency weight is small (large).

We hypothesize that (i) the main effects of these team composition factors reduce a team&#39;s invention value but, more importantly, that (ii) invention integrality positively moderates those effects.

With increased pressures from customers and decreased profits due to marked‐down leftover inventories in each channel, the retailer considers integrating the supply chain operations of both channels and using in‐store inventory more effectively across different channels. In contrast to the existing literature, we focus on the firm&#39;s choice of the best omni‐channel strategies considering demand segmentation, cost structure, and, more importantly, the inventory rationing ability of the firm. We formulate our problem as a two‐stage stochastic programming model and use first‐order optimality conditions to study the optimal inventory ordering decisions. Based on different omni‐channel strategy decisions, we explore four supply chain design options. We identify the optimal inventory ordering policy under each option and explicitly describe the optimality conditions on cost and demand under perfect and imperfect demand information. When the demand information is imperfect, the demand fulfillment decisions can be characterized as nested protection‐level policies. First, we show that omni‐channel strategies are not necessarily profitable under all settings as dictated by market conditions. Second, we demonstrate that when the company can allocate its inventory perfectly, running omni‐channel strategies may help better serve web‐based customers and in‐store customers. Finally, we show that, in the worst case, the imperfect demand information may result in losing all the claimed inventory integration benefits when running omni‐channel strategies.},

This study examines inventory and flexibility patterns in manufacturing firms in the years following an lp‐hc event, the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011. We find patterns suggesting that most firms exposed to the event began to increase their raw material inventories (RAW) over the longer term and increased their volume flexibility for a shorter period. Furthermore, we found that firms increased their RAW mainly when inventories were already at high levels, while the opposite is true for volume flexibility. Firms that were classified as risk‐averse before the event show stronger swings after the event. Preliminary explorations suggest that the performance of firms that have engaged in these inventory shifts is significantly impeded. This study provides insight into a previously unexplored phenomenon, namely, the longer‐term responses of firms to exposure to lp‐hc events. It opens the possibilities of new research regarding causality, economic consequences, and mechanisms of the identified patterns. Increased efforts in this direction should enable our discipline to provide improved normative guidance both socially and operationally.},

  abstract     = {Firms sometimes acquire partial ownership of their upstream suppliers. Such ownership entails no direct control over the target firm&#39;s decision‐making; however, both firms might change their pricing strategies after forming a partial ownership relationship. This paper studies the economic impacts of partial vertical ownership (PVO) in a market with downstream competition, where a manufacturer supplies two competing retailers. We find that dividend payments between firms can alter firms’ incentives in their operational decisions and, hence, serve as an “invisible hand” to downstream competition and vertical interaction. We show that a higher PVO percentage can have both positive and negative effects because the acquiring retailer&#39;s gain from PVO depends on not only its own sales but also the competitor&#39;s sales. Thus, the PVO decision (i.e., the percentage of ownership to acquire) has an inverted U‐shaped effect on the resulting profit for both the acquiring retailer and the manufacturer, which implies an intermediate PVO percentage in equilibrium. Second, the relative strength of the positive and negative effects depends on the acquiring retailer&#39;s competitive position. We show that the manufacturer prefers establishing PVO with the retailer with a valuation disadvantage because the disadvantaged retailer can obtain more benefits from PVO and is willing to pay higher than the competitor. Last, we find that consumers benefit from PVO when the acquiring retailer is the retailer with a valuation advantage but may become worse off when the disadvantaged retailer acquires PVO. Our research provides managers with guidance on the optimal PVO percentage and policymakers with insights on regulating PVOs for consumer protection.},

We consider a market where a monopolist firm in product category A also sells a product in product category B . We analyze three scenarios in category B : (1) an independent firm selling a higher quality product, (2) two independent firms selling the higher quality product, and (3) the monopolist in category A is also a monopolist in category B . We find that CDPs can indeed change the firm&#39;s optimal bundling strategy. When the firm has a competitive disadvantage in category B , CDPs encourage the firm to offer the bundle (by either pure bundling or mixed bundling). Furthermore, if category B market is so competitive that the firm possesses negligible market power, mixed bundling can be strictly more effective at increasing the firm&#39;s profit than pure bundling because mixed bundling can better take advantage of CDPs. In contrast, if the firm has monopoly power in both categories, CDPs discourage the introduction of the bundle, and pure‐component selling is optimal.},

  abstract     = {We consider a firm selling heterogeneous products with prices customized for each customer and the final price is set by negotiations between the seller and the customer. This type of pricing modality is referred to as customized pricing with discretion and is commonly used in insurance, consumer loans, mortgages, and many business‐to‐business markets. We assume that each sales agent has a reserve price and each customer has a willingness‐to‐pay , which are jointly drawn from a distribution and, if the transaction is successful, they agree on a price between these two values based on their relative bargaining power. Given the outcomes of a series of negotiations, our goal is to estimate the underlying joint distribution of reserve price and willingness‐to‐pay, and predict the outcomes of future transactions. We assume that the price that prevails as the outcome of the negotiation can be represented as a generalized Nash bargaining equilibrium. We develop a structural estimation method based on the expectation‐maximization algorithm to estimate the parameters of reserve price and willingness‐to‐pay distribution. Using a real‐world data set from indirect auto‐lending industry, we show that our proposed method, which accounts for heterogeneity in sales agent&#39;s reserve price and customer&#39;s willingness‐to‐pay, improves the predictive accuracy of final price (APR) and take‐up probability (i.e., probability of a customer accepting the loan) on real‐world test data by about 8.70% and 3.68%, respectively, compared to a (Tobit‐based) model, which accommodates unobserved heterogeneity in customer&#39;s willingness‐to‐pay only. Using the structural EM estimates, we conduct counterfactual analyses to understand the impact of different pricing policies, which vary in the amount of discretion provided to the sales agent during the negotiation process. For example, we find that the lender may increase profits by 13.63% compared to the status quo by optimally imposing a customized minimum price (annual percentage rate) below which a loan should not be offered to the customer.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines the effect of product substitutability on the equilibrium profits in a distribution channel of two symmetric manufacturers selling substitutable products to consumers through a nonexclusive retailer. Conventional wisdom suggests that when the products are more substitutable, the retailer will be better off while the manufacturers will be worse off, owing to the dominance of the competition effect of substitutability. In this work, we identify the hitherto neglected demand effect of substitutability and show that the relative strength between the competition and demand effects is the key to this result. As the products become more substitutable, the upstream competition does intensify, but vitally, the demand may expand. We show that the interests of the retailer and manufacturers can be aligned in terms of product substitutability, depending on both the demand and supply factors. Surprisingly, the conventional result can even be completely reversed such that the manufacturers benefit from a certain level of substitutability for some demand patterns. Assuming linear demand, we further isolate the important role of the bargaining power balance and the alternative of agency selling format in moderating the competition effect. For example, as the retailer gains more bargaining power, the (negative) demand effect can overshadow the (positive) competition effect such that a higher degree of substitutability can actually hurt the retailer. Our findings provide valuable implications for persuasive advertising and category management.},

  abstract     = {We consider a dynamic Stackelberg game between a manufacturer and a retailer facing a randomly changing market environment (boom–bust cycle) modeled as a Markov process over time. The manufacturer announces the national advertising effort and a cooperative (co‐op) advertising subsidy, and the retailer sets the local advertising effort. We derive the optimal feedback equilibrium advertising strategies and show that the channel members are forward‐looking in their advertising decisions. In the single‐crisis case, both the necessary and sufficient conditions for a positive subsidy reveal that the subsidy decision hinges on the relative profit margins before and after the crisis. Our comparative statics analysis indicates that the presence of national advertising enriches the members&#39; advertising behaviors significantly. Furthermore, the pre‐crisis (post‐crisis) aggregate advertising contribution of the supply chain generally decreases (increases) in the damage rate and the crisis likelihood, as in the single‐firm case. But the individual advertising behaviors of the members may exhibit richer structures, depending on the comparative advantages of the members in each state. In addition, our numerical studies demonstrate that channel members can suffer sizable losses when they adopt myopic advertising strategies over their regime‐switching counterparts. Finally, we extend our analysis to incorporate retail and brand competition and show that the channel members&#39; advertising behaviors are reasonably consistent with those without competition.},

  abstract     = {Appointment systems are widely adopted in many service organizations. The simplest and most common format is the equally‐spaced (ES) system, in which the inter‐appointment times between consecutive arrivals are equal. One major drawback of such a system is the long expected waiting time for later arrivals, which makes later appointment positions unappealing to customers. As a result, customers who take these positions are more likely to abandon their appointments, leading to a higher no‐show rate. To address this issue, we examine a novel equal‐waiting (EW) scheduling system under which the expected waiting times are equal across appointments. Through a series of controlled lab experiments, we establish that the EW system increases the attractiveness of later appointments and that customers who are willing to take these appointments are more likely to show up. We then incorporate this individual‐level preference and no‐show behavior into models to evaluate its impact on the system‐level performance. We find that, compared with the traditional ES system, the EW system can significantly increase customers&#39; show‐up rate and improve system utilization.},

However, during the last two decades, farmers’ welfare and the interests of other stakeholders have drawn OM researchers’ attention. This expanded focus on farming research has become possible due to the proliferation of mobile communication devices and the Internet as well as advancements in information technology platforms and social media. Our review also shows that there is a paucity of OM literature that leverages increased data availability from the emergence of precision agriculture and blockchain to address major challenges for the farming sector emanating from climate change, natural disasters, food security, and sustainable and equitable agriculture, among others. Big data, in conjunction with opportunities for field‐based experimentation, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and integration of predictive and prescriptive analytics, can be leveraged by OM scholars engaged in farming research.

We develop analytical models to compare two vaccine production modes: (1) the integrated mode (a single company determines the at‐risk capacity and produces in‐house) and (2) the outsourcing mode (a manufacturer determines the at‐risk capacity and a developer determines a funding level to share the capacity‐building cost). Our study reveals that outsourcing can achieve a higher at‐risk capacity only if it can achieve sufficient cost savings compared to the integrated mode. Our research also proves that both vaccine production modes tend to underinvest in the at‐risk capacity. Following this, we suggest measures to improve the at‐risk capacity building in both vaccine production modes. Our signaling game model reveals that a developer with high competence cannot always send credible signals of its true competence level to the manufacturer. Our incomplete contract model verifies that the relative performance of the two vaccine production modes is robust when ex post negotiation occurs under the outsourcing mode; however, the two parties may show incompatible preferences for the ex post negotiation. Our study also analyzes the optimal allocation of government financial support to development funding and capacity funding to incentivize at‐risk capacity building. We present comprehensive guidelines for the different stakeholders to collectively contribute to ramping up the at‐risk capacity of promising vaccines.},

  abstract     = {The extreme demand volatility caused by corona virus 2019 (COVID‐19) overwhelmed most preemptive measures enacted by firms to mitigate disruptions in their supply chains. This led to the rapid implementation of reactive measures to provide business continuity. The operations and supply chain management literature has grouped these reactive techniques into those that involve the reconfiguration of firm resources and those that involve changes to its decision‐making processes. Unfortunately, little of this work has empirically assessed the efficacy of individual reactive techniques on business continuity after the onset of a disruption such as COVID‐19. The research reported in this paper addresses this gap through an experimental design and discrete‐event simulation to empirically test the impact on firm outcomes of resource reconfiguration techniques versus those related to adaptive decision‐making processes. Data from a canned foods manufacturer is used to populate the simulation and isolate the impact of these reactive changes implemented in March 2020 at the beginning of the COVID‐19 disruption on the attainment of business continuity in the 3 months following the COVID‐19 disruption. The results show that for this company, decision‐making changes—specifically changes to planning process cadence and time horizon—had more impact on business continuity than those focused on resource reconfiguration (increasing capacity through stock keeping unit (SKU) prioritization and increasing the number of shifts). These results, in addition to qualitative data collected from company executives to provide context for the modeling results, are used to provide insights that are generalizable to many firms.},

One such program is cash and voucher assistance (CVA), which is used to bolster beneficiaries&#39; freedom of choice regarding their consumption. In this vein, WFP supports local retailers to provide CVA to beneficiaries who do not have access to a functioning market. However, the operations of these stores can suffer from a very high transmission risk of COVID‐19 unless preventive measures are put in place to reduce it. This paper discusses strategies that retailers and HOs can enact to maximize their service and dignity levels while minimizing transmission risk under a CVA program during a pandemic.

  abstract     = {The unprecedented scale of the Covid‐19 pandemic has been a challenge for health supply chains around the world. Many international humanitarian organizations have had to ensure the continuity of their already complex development programs, while addressing their supply chain disruptions linked to the pandemic. Process modularity has frequently been advocated as a strategy to mitigate such disruptions, although empirical evidence regarding its impact on supply chain responsiveness and what moderates this impact is scarce. This exploratory research uses supply chain data analysis, qualitative content analysis, interviews, and a three‐round Delphi study to investigate how Doctors without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières; MSF) and its 151 missions employed process modularity during the Covid‐19 pandemic. Our results show that despite severe disruptions, process modularity—based on a modular architecture, interfaces, and standards—has helped MSF maintain supply chain responsiveness. Specifically, it (1) enabled time‐consuming, nonessential tasks to be skipped, (2) relieved internal and external bottlenecks, and (3) facilitated better allocation and prioritization. Our analyses also put forward eight moderators, structured in three dimensions (visibility, alignment, and resource orchestration), which can affect the impact of process modularity on supply chain responsiveness. We extend the literature on supply chain responsiveness and process modularity by presenting extensive empirical results suggesting that process modularity improves responsiveness in crisis situations, how it does so, and what moderates this impact. Our study thereby highlights the potential of this strategy and provides operationally relevant insights that could help organizations to implement or to review and redesign their process modularity.},

We bring together the SIR model&#39;s compartmental structure with a change‐point detection martingale process to identify new waves. We create a dynamic process where new waves can be flagged and learned in real time. We use this approach to extend the traditional susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered–dead (SEIRD) model into a multiwave SEIRD model and test it on forecasting COVID‐19 cases from the John Hopkins University data set for states in the United States. We find that compared to the traditional SEIRD model, the multiwave SEIRD model improves mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by 15%–25% for the United States. We benchmark the multiwave SEIRD model against top performing Center for Disease Control (CDC) models for COVID‐19 and find that the multiwave SERID model is able to outperform the majority of CDC models in long‐term predictions.},

We showcase how our metric can be used to explore the efficacy of a variety of interventions aimed at curbing the spread of disease inside service facilities. Specifically, we focus on some prevalent interventions employed during the COVID‐19 pandemic: limiting the occupancy of service facilities, protecting high‐risk customers (via prioritization or designated time windows), and increasing the service speed (or limiting patronage duration). We discuss a variety of directions for adapting our transmission model to incorporate some more nuanced features of disease transmission, including heterogeneity in the population immunity level, varying levels of mask usage, and spatial considerations in disease transmission.},

  abstract     = {At the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic, hospitals were in dire need of data‐driven analytics to provide support for critical, expensive, and complex decisions. Yet, the majority of analytics being developed were targeted at state‐ and national‐level policy decisions, with little availability of actionable information to support tactical and operational decision‐making and execution at the hospital level. To fill this gap, we developed a multi‐method framework leveraging a parsimonious design philosophy that allows for rapid deployment of high‐impact predictive and prescriptive analytics in a time‐sensitive, dynamic, data‐limited environment, such as a novel pandemic. The product of this research is a workload prediction and decision support tool to provide mission‐critical, actionable information for individual hospitals. Our framework forecasts time‐varying patient workload and demand for critical resources by integrating disease progression models, tailored to data availability during different stages of the pandemic, with a stochastic network model of patient movements among units within individual hospitals. Both components employ adaptive tuning to account for hospital‐dependent, time‐varying parameters that provide consistently accurate predictions by dynamically learning the impact of latent changes in system dynamics. Our decision support system is designed to be portable and easily implementable across hospital data systems for expeditious expansion and deployment. This work was contextually grounded in close collaboration with IU Health, the largest health system in Indiana, which has 18 hospitals serving over one million residents. Our initial prototype was implemented in April 2020 and has supported managerial decisions, from the operational to the strategic, across multiple functionalities at IU Health.},

We use the model to propose and evaluate ways to manage limited equipment capacity. Early‐stage infection growth is captured by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and is part of a two‐period community spread and shutdown model. We use the running‐maximum process of a geometric Brownian motion to develop a performance metric, probability of breach, for a given capacity level. Decision‐maker estimates costs of economy versus health and the time till the availability of a cure; we develop a heuristic rule and an optimal formulation that use these estimates to determine the required medical equipment capacity. We connect the level of capacity to a menu of actions, including the level and timing of shutdown, shutdown effectiveness, and enforcement. Our results show how these actions can compensate for the limited medical equipment capacity in a region. We next address the sharing of medical equipment capacity across regions and its impact on the breach probability. In addition to traditional risk‐pooling, we identify a peak‐timing effect depending on when infections peak in different regions. We show that equipment sharing may not benefit the regions when capacity is tight. A coupled SDE model captures the messaging coordination and movement across regional borders. Numerical experiments on this model show that under certain conditions, such movement and coordination can synchronize the infection trajectories and bring the peaks closer, reducing the benefit of sharing capacity.},

  abstract     = {COVID‐19 is a highly contagious disease that has spread to most countries at unprecedented transmission speed. Medical resources and treatments provided by the healthcare system help reduce the mortality rate and spread of COVID‐19 by isolating infectious individuals. We introduce a modified SEIR model that considers individuals access to limited medical resources to characterize the central role of medical resources during the pandemic. We discuss how the three hospital admission policies (hierarchy, mixed, and Fangcang healthcare system) affect the spread of the disease and the number of deaths and infections. We find that the Fangcang system results in the least number of infections, deaths, and occupied beds. When hospital capacity is relatively high or the transmission rate of the mildly infected patient is not ignorable, a mixed system can lead to fewer infections and deaths than a hierarchy system, but greater numbers of occupied beds. This occurs by preventing disease transmission to a great extent. The results are confirmed by our surveys with healthcare workers in major hospitals in Wuhan, China. We also investigate the performance of the three healthcare systems under a social distancing policy. We find that the Fangcang system results in the largest reduction in infections and deaths, especially even when the medical capacity is small. Moreover, we compare a one‐time off policy with a bed trigger policy. We find that a one‐time off policy could achieve the similar performance as bed trigger policy when it is initiated neither too early nor too late.},

  abstract     = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has disrupted normal operating procedures at transplant centers. With the possibility that COVID‐19 infection carries an overall 4% mortality rate and potentially a 24% mortality rate among the immunocompromised transplant recipients, many transplant centers considered the possibility of slowing down and even potentially pausing all transplants. Many proposals regarding the need for pausing organ transplants exist; however, much remains unknown. Whereas the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the overall healthcare system is unknown, the potential impact of pausing organ transplants over a period can be estimated. This study presents a model for evaluating the impact of pausing liver transplants over a spectrum of model for end‐stage liver disease‐sodium (MELD‐Na) scores. Our model accounts for two potential risks of a pause: (1) the waitlist mortality of all patients who do not receive liver transplants during the pause period, and (2) the impact of a longer waiting list due to the pause of liver transplants and the continuous accrual of new patients. Using over 12 years of liver transplant data from the United Network for Organ Sharing and a system of differential equations, we estimate the threshold probability above which a decision maker should pause liver transplants to reduce the loss of patient life months. We also compare different pause policies to illustrate the value of patient‐specific and center‐specific approaches. Finally, we analyze how capacity constraints affect the loss of patient life months and the length of the waiting list. The results of this study are useful to decision makers in deciding whether and how to pause organ transplants during a pandemic. The results are also useful to patients (and their care providers) who are waiting for organ transplants.},

  abstract     = {Throughout the current COVID‐19 pandemic, governments have implemented a variety of containment measures, ranging from hoping for herd immunity (which is essentially no containment) to mandating complete lockdown. On the one hand, containment measures reduce lives lost by limiting the disease spread and controlling the load on the healthcare system. On the other hand, such measures slow down economic activity, leading to lost jobs, economic stall, and societal disturbances, such as protests, civil disobedience, and increases in domestic violence. Hence, determining the right set of containment measures is a key social, economic, and political decision for policymakers. In this paper, we provide a model for dynamically managing the level of disease containment measures over the course of a pandemic. We determine the timing and level of containment measures to minimize the impact of a pandemic on economic activity and lives lost, subject to healthcare capacity and stochastic disease evolution dynamics. On the basis of practical evidence, we examine two common classes of containment policies—dynamic and static—and we find that dynamic policies are particularly valuable when the rate of disease spread is low, recovery takes longer, and the healthcare capacity is limited. Our work reveals a fundamental relationship between the structure of Pareto‐efficient containment measures (in terms of lives lost and economic activity) and key disease and economic parameters such as disease infection rate, recovery rate, and healthcare capacity. We also analyze the impact of virus mutation and vaccination on containment decisions.},

  abstract     = {Testing for COVID‐19 is a key intervention that supports tracking and isolation to prevent further infections. However, diagnostic tests are a scarce and finite resource, so abundance in one country can quickly lead to shortages in others, creating a competitive landscape. Countries experience peaks in infections at different times, meaning that the need for diagnostic tests also peaks at different moments. This phase lag implies opportunities for a more collaborative approach, although countries might also worry about the risks of future shortages if they help others by reallocating their excess inventory of diagnostic tests. This article features a simulation model that connects three subsystems: COVID‐19 transmission, the diagnostic test supply chain, and public policy interventions aimed at flattening the infection curve. This integrated system approach clarifies that, for public policies, there is a time to be risk‐averse and a time for risk‐taking, reflecting the different phases of the pandemic (contagion vs. recovery) and the dominant dynamic behavior that occurs in these phases (reinforcing vs. balancing). In the contagion phase, policymakers cannot afford to reject extra diagnostic tests and should take what they can get, in line with a competitive mindset. In the recovery phase, policymakers can afford to give away excess inventory to other countries in need (one‐sided collaboration). When a country switches between taking and giving, in a form of two‐sided collaboration, it can flatten the curve, not only for itself but also for others.},

  abstract     = {The COVID‐19 pandemic presented the world to a novel class of problems highlighting distinctive features that rendered standard academic research and participatory processes less effective in properly informing public health interventions in a timely way. The urgency and rapidity of the emergency required tight integration of novel and high‐quality simulation modeling with public health policy implementation. By introducing flexibility and agility into standard participatory processes, we aligned the modeling effort with the imposed reality of the emergency to rapidly develop a regional system dynamics (SD) model integrating diverse streams of data that could reliably inform both health system restructuring and public health policy. Using Lombardy data, our SD model was able to generate early projections for the diffusion of the pandemic in neighbor Ticino. Later, it projected the timing and size of peak patient demand. Our work also supported the need for reorganization of the healthcare system and volume flexibility strategies increasing hospital capacity (e.g., intensive care unit [ICU] and ward beds, medical and nursing staff, and oxygen supply) in Ticino. Counterfactual analyses quantify the impact of the decisions supported by our interventions. Our research contributes to our understanding of volume flexibility strategies used by healthcare organizations during emergencies, highlighting the critical role played by available response time in the deployment of strategies that either prioritize critical services or leverage available resources. It also contributes to the literature on participatory systems modeling by describing a flexible and agile participatory process that was successfully deployed in a rapidly evolving high‐stakes emergency.},

  abstract     = {The widespread lockdowns imposed in many countries at the beginning of the COVID‐19 pandemic elevated the importance of research on pandemic management when medical solutions such as vaccines are unavailable. We present a framework that combines a standard epidemiological SEIR (susceptible–exposed–infected–removed) model with an equally standard machine learning classification model for clinical severity risk, defined as an individual&#39;s risk of needing intensive care unit (ICU) treatment if infected. Using COVID‐19–related data and estimates for France as of spring 2020, we then simulate isolation and exit policies. Our simulations show that policies considering clinical risk predictions could relax isolation restrictions for millions of the lowest risk population months earlier while consistently abiding by ICU capacity restrictions. Exit policies without risk predictions, meanwhile, would considerably exceed ICU capacity or require the isolation of a substantial portion of population for over a year in order to not overwhelm the medical system. Sensitivity analyses further decompose the impact of various elements of our models on the observed effects. Our work indicates that predictive modeling based on machine learning and artificial intelligence could bring significant value to managing pandemics. Such a strategy, however, requires governments to develop policies and invest in infrastructure to operationalize personalized isolation and exit policies based on risk predictions at scale. This includes health data policies to train predictive models and apply them to all residents, as well as policies for targeted resource allocation to maintain strict isolation for high‐risk individuals.},

  abstract     = {Up to 20% of all business‐to‐consumer deliveries fail on the first attempt. Failed deliveries not only carry cost implications but also incur damage to retailers’ brand reputation. Despite its economic significance, research has paid little attention to delivery attempt as an operational outcome or seldom accounted for its effects in routing models. This is partly due to the many factors that can influence delivery outcomes. We address this knowledge gap by first demonstrating that failed delivery attempts can be reasonably predicted using common routing, demand, environmental, and market attributes at both the individual package and route levels. For model‐building, we use transaction data from an e‐commerce retailer in South America. We then explore the value of accounting for failed delivery attempts in routing models. We propose a two‐stage greedy algorithm for solving large problem instances. Our analysis indicates that not accounting for the probability of failed attempts in routing models may create a significant downward bias in the total cost of delivery. The analysis also suggests that manipulating the sequence in which packages in a route are delivered can be a cost‐efficient lever that firms can employ at almost zero cost to profoundly affect delivery outcomes. We replicate the prediction model to a new sample from a delivery company in Singapore and calibrate it for a randomized field experiment to validate our algorithm&#39;s performance. Packages and drivers are randomly assigned to either our algorithm or the focal company&#39;s existing algorithm. Results suggest that our algorithm, on average, reduces the share of failed delivery attempts by 10% and the total cost of delivery by $13 per route. We further propose drivers’ discretionary work effort and the goal‐gradient hypothesis as a mechanism for the efficacy of our algorithm. Controlling for time of day and other fixed effects, we empirically find that packages assigned to slots later in the route tend to have a lower failure rate because drivers display a higher degree of discretionary work effort toward the end of a route. Our approach can be applied to other firms’ last‐mile delivery operations to improve their delivery execution.},

Unlike wholesale price contracts, service‐level contracts can be parameterized such that they have steep expected profit functions, making the expected profit‐maximizing order more salient, in the sense that deviations from optimal ordering are more costly. Utilizing an analytical model and results from existing literature, we hypothesize that people will order closer to optimality under service‐level contracts with steeper expected profit functions. In a laboratory experiment, we find that subjects achieve up to 97.2% supply chain efficiency under a steep service‐level contract, compared with 92.2% under a flat service‐level contract, and steep service contract ordering also exhibits lower variability. Our results suggest that managers can benefit by designing service‐level contracts with higher penalty costs and lower fill rates.},

  abstract     = {In many settings, consumer surplus directly impacts a firm or organization&#39;s objective, and the profit‐only objective becomes inadequate. Our paper is the first to consider the dual objective of profit and consumer surplus in multi‐product pricing under the multinomial logit demand, where the prices are continuously set. We define a firm&#39;s marginal consumer surplus as its marginal contribution to the expected customer utility transformed into monetary unit. Although the profit is concave in the choice probability space, the marginal consumer surplus is convex, complicating the analysis. We identify the optimal monopoly pricing solution and develop solution approaches for the equilibrium solutions of both price‐competition and quantity‐competition oligopolies. In the monopolistic setting, we solve the optimal solution in a near‐closed‐form expression, and show that the firm&#39;s markup and profit decline as its emphasis for marginal consumer surplus increases and eventually drops to zero when the firm turns into a social welfare maximizer. Therefore, social welfare is maximized only when the monopolist is willing to endure zero profit. In competitive settings, if one firm&#39;s emphasis on marginal consumer surplus increases, then the improvement in marginal consumer surplus can magnify through competitive forces, reflected in reduced equilibrium prices for all firms. Moreover, we find that, while the overall marginal consumer surplus always increases with any firm&#39;s weight on marginal consumer surplus in its objective (referred to as the CS weight), a firm&#39;s marginal consumer surplus increases in its own CS weight but decreases in other firms&#39; CS weight. Finally, we prove that, all else equal, a firm with a higher CS weight can earn a higher profit than its profit‐maximizing competitors, which is counterintuitive. In the quantity competition, a firm may even increase its absolute profit level by increasing its CS weight.},

We focus on two widely studied objectives in this field, that is, the share of choice (SOC) and buyers&#39; welfare (BW). The two objectives are vulnerable to different types of customer preference misspecification, that is, deviation from the nominal utility distribution and effects of outliers, respectively. We formulate a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) SOC maximization model and a winsorized BW maximization model to obtain robust solutions to the two problems. Interestingly, we show that the two robust models are equivalent in a certain sense—for appropriate choices of robustness parameters, both models return the same solution. This observation has important ramifications. For instance, it indicates that a product designed to yield higher BW is more robust to the deviation from the nominal utility distribution for the SOC problem, while that with higher SOC is less sensitive to the effect of outliers for the BW problem. Last but not least, we use the equivalence to develop a new approach to solve the DRO model for the SOC problem, using a version of the winsorized BW model. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {We consider dynamic pricing and demand learning in a duopoly with multinomial logit demand, both from the perspective where firms compete against each other and from the perspective where firms aim to collude to increase revenues. We show that joint‐revenue maximization is not always beneficial to both firms compared to the Nash equilibrium, and show that several other axiomatic notions of collusion can be constructed that are always beneficial to both firms and a threat to consumer welfare. Next, we construct a price algorithm and prove that it learns to charge supra‐competitive prices if deployed by both firms, and learns to respond optimally against a class of competitive algorithms. Our algorithm includes a mechanism to infer demand observations from the competitor&#39;s price path, so that our algorithm can operate in a setting where prices are public but demand is private information. Our work contributes to the understanding of well‐performing price policies in a competitive multi‐agent setting, and shows that collusion by algorithms is possible and deserves the attention of lawmakers and competition policy regulators.},

  abstract     = {In practice, lead time demand (LTD) can be skewed, multi‐modal or highly variable, and these factors compromise the validity of typical approaches used for setting safety stock levels. Motivated by encountering this problem at our industry partner, we develop an approach for setting safety stock levels using the bootstrap, a widely used statistical procedure. Existing bootstrap approaches for inventory management either operate directly on observed LTD or assume deterministic lead times, permitting direct application of the bootstrap approach for univariate quantile estimation. As LTD is a convolution of multiple random demands over a random lead time, a multivariate bootstrap approach is required. As we demonstrate, when lead times are stochastic, our multivariate approach provides improved safety stock estimates. We develop a multivariate central limit theorem for the bootstrap mean and bootstrap quantile—components of the safety stock calculation—highlighting why the generalization of these bootstrap methods is critical for inventory management. These results provide a theoretical underpinning for the bootstrap estimator of safety stock and permit the construction of confidence intervals for safety stock estimates, allowing decision makers to understand the reliability with which the desired service level will be achieved. Building on our theoretical results, and supported by numerical experiments, we provide insights on the behavior of the bootstrap for various LTD distributions, which our results demonstrate are critical when employing the bootstrap method. Implementation of our approach with our industry partner resulted in an inventory investment reduction of $1.17 million combined with an overall increase in service level. Our approach is general and can be implemented without modification in other settings.},

  abstract     = {Many individuals have strong preferences regarding COVID‐19 vaccines and would like to choose the vaccine they get. This practice, known as “vaccine shopping,” presents unique challenges to timely vaccine rollout: On the one hand, people may not get vaccinated if they are unable to receive their preferred vaccine, and on the other hand, a policy maker is inclined to distribute vaccines in a brand agnostic fashion to avoid wastage. We study whether a policy maker should allow individuals to choose their vaccine, and the optimal mix of single‐ and two‐dose vaccines to procure. We develop a stylized queueing game‐theoretic model that captures the main trade‐offs in the interaction between individuals and a policy maker to examine the impact of vaccine choice on the number of vaccinations. Individuals obtain a reward from the vaccine administered at a server and decide whether to get a vaccine based on the wait time, their inclination toward vaccinating, and the level of choice provided. We find that restricting choice results in a greater number of vaccinations when vaccine supply is low by administering doses as and when they become available. Contrary to popular belief that restricting choice wastes fewer vaccines, we find that fewer vaccines are wasted when patients who are moderately hesitant about vaccinating are allowed to choose their vaccine. In this case the possibility of being assigned a nonpreferred vaccine leads patients to forego vaccination, and allowing a choice alleviates this concern. Using a mathematical model for COVID‐19 transmission, we find that providing choice results in fewer infections in the United States than limiting choice, and the number of infections is lowest when a lower efficacy, single‐dose vaccine forms 5%–8% of the total vaccine dose supply. Our findings provide guidance to policy makers, especially as they plan to vaccinate effectively using a diverse vaccine supply.},

  abstract     = {Supply diversification and pricing are two common mechanisms for dealing with supply yield uncertainty. This paper characterizes a firm&#39;s pricing and sourcing decisions under supply yield uncertainty, and studies the interplay between the two mechanisms. We compare the optimal sourcing decisions under two distinct pricing schemes: (1) ex ante pricing—the firm simultaneously makes the sales price and sourcing decisions before production takes place; (2) responsive pricing—the pricing decision is postponed until after the production yield realization. Although the firm is better off with responsive pricing, the effect of price postponement on the optimal sourcing decision and the firm&#39;s need for supply diversification varies and is influenced by factors such as unit procurement cost, supply portfolio, and supply reliability. For the case of one unreliable supplier, we show that responsive pricing mitigates the overage and underage risks imposed by yield uncertainty, and results in a lower optimal order quantity than that under ex ante pricing when the procurement cost is low, and a higher quantity otherwise. For the case of two unreliable suppliers, we show that responsive pricing promotes supply diversification when the sole‐sourced supplier&#39;s reliability is low, and discourages when it is high. By contrast, when the sole‐sourced supplier&#39;s reliability is moderate, responsive pricing promotes supply diversification when its unit procurement cost is low and discourages otherwise. The composition of supply portfolio also has a fundamental impact on such strategic interplay: When the supply portfolio consists of one unreliable and one reliable supplier, diversified sourcing is never optimal under ex ante pricing, but may be optimal under responsive pricing. Thus, responsive pricing promotes dual sourcing in this setting. We also conduct comprehensive numerical experiments to both confirm the robustness of the main results and derive additional insights.},

  abstract     = {The choice of market mechanism is key to success for any online marketplace. In recent years, as peer‐to‐peer (P2P) lending has seen phenomenal growth, leading P2P lending platforms have used various market mechanisms and, in some cases, even switched from one mechanism to another, chasing higher market share and overall growth. While Prosper.com, a leading P2P lending platform, has switched from the auction lending model to a fixed price lending model, recent studies show that overall social welfare was higher with the auction lending model. While the auction lending model gives more power to the lenders, the success of the auction lending model hinges on the accuracy of lenders’ assessment of the credit risk of the borrowers. Building on extant literature and in support of the auction lending model to increase social welfare, we design an artifact to dynamically estimate borrower reputation to help the lenders and improve the allocative efficiency in P2P lending markets. We posit that borrowers’ reputation built on transactional data, readily available on P2P lending platforms, represents the collective perception of the lenders about the borrowers. We propose a dynamic latent class model of reputation and use the latent instrumental variable approach to deal with endogeneity. We test our artifact using real‐world P2P lending data. We show that accounting for reputation improves the model&#39;s explanatory power and provides a way to empirically model the evolution and impact of reputation in online platforms where repeated transactions are performed.},

  abstract     = {When considering a purchase, consumers often augment their private information about a product with anonymous online social information (reviews, etc.). We examine the impact on firm strategy of how consumers weight these two information sources—private and social—in their purchase decisions. An increase in weight on private information always results in higher prices at the interior equilibrium. However, the effects on profits, consumer, and total surplus are nonmonotonic: all increasing with the weight on private information when weight is high but decreasing when weight is low. Profit and surplus decrease with weight when weight is low because a marginal increase in a low weighting leads to a contraction of demand. The dynamic reverses when weight is high. Besides weighting of information sources, our model incorporates the questionable credibility of social information. A firm&#39;s optimal investment to improve social information credibility depends on whether consumers process information in a Bayesian or non‐Bayesian manner. We show that, compared to Bayesian consumers, non‐Bayesian consumers endogenously trust (distrust) social information from firms with high(low)‐positivity ratings. This distinction in information processing results in a stark contrast in how firms manage social information credibility: when facing Bayesian consumers, with an increase in the positivity of its social information, a firm with high(low) positivity spends less (more) to improve credibility. On the contrary, when facing non‐Bayesian consumers, a firm with high(low) positivity spends more (less) to improve credibility. Product quality also affects optimal credibility investment, following an inverted U‐shape.},

  abstract     = {Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) by first‐tier suppliers, referred to as the supply base, are dynamic and drastic changes in supply chain structure and relationships that affect focal firm performance. In particular, the impact of M&amp;As in a supply base depends on the concentration and differentiation of the supply base, which affects power–dependence relationships in the supply chain. This study examines the effect of supply base M&amp;As on focal firms’ cost of goods sold (COGS). In addition, this study explores the role of power relationships by investigating the moderating effects of supply base concentration and differentiation. Using secondary panel data assembled from four different data sources, this study constructs econometric models and empirically examines the relationship between supply base M&amp;As and focal firm cost efficiency. Our findings indicate that supply base M&amp;As are positively associated with focal firm COGS. This result suggests that potential efficiency gains from M&amp;As in supply bases may not translate to benefits for the focal firm because suppliers may also gain bargaining power from M&amp;As. However, the effect of supply base M&amp;As on focal firm COGS is attenuated when the supply base is less concentrated in terms of their transaction percentage with suppliers and more differentiated in terms of industry and business scopes. These are situations where suppliers less effectively obtain or employ bargaining power from M&amp;As. These findings make important contributions to the operations management literature.},

  abstract     = {This study examines long‐term care (LTC) discharge planning among older delayed discharge patients. While awaiting placements in alternate care such as LTC, these patients occupy hospital beds despite not requiring an intensive level of care. This study proposes a novel discharge decision model based on the Markov decision process (MDP) framework, which incorporates predictions regarding the patients&#39; health trajectory and the associated hospital costs. Our machine learning (ML)‐based predictive analytics allow for considering heterogeneous health transitions, hence personalized decision making, leading to valuable information for reducing hospital costs. We also develop data‐driven cost functions using patient characteristics to estimate the person‐level costs associated with the decisions in the optimization model, that is, whether or not to discharge a patient to LTC. The data analyses and cost estimations are based on large historical data collected over 13 years in Ontario, Canada. To solve the resulting high‐dimensional MDP models, we develop an index policy, where each patient&#39;s index value is calculated using their health complexity (comorbidity), sex, age, and acute length of stay in the hospital. Using extensive numerical experiments, we illustrate the superior performance of the proposed index policy against some benchmarking policies and demonstrate the significance of predictive information in optimizing discharge decisions. Our results also indicate that the value of predictive information increases with LTC bed availability and decreases with hospital capacity. We also demonstrate that with the anticipated exacerbating mismatch between supply and demand, targeted prediction‐driven discharge policies, such as the proposed index policy, become even more critical.},

Using US firm patent data in nanotechnology, we find that the relationship between the rareness and value of a technology exhibits an inverted‐U shape, consistent with our theoretical expectation. Further, the search basis of the focal technology moderates this relationship such that the rareness–value relationship becomes steeper when the technology is built on more local knowledge but flatter if the technology embeds more mature knowledge.

However, there is little evidence that sheds light on how the implementation of AI systems impacts customer behavior, as well as AI systems’ effects on call center customer service performance. By leveraging the proprietary data obtained from a natural field experiment in a large telecommunication company, we examine how the introduction of a voice‐based AI system affects call length, customers’ demand for human service, and customer complaints in call center customer service. We find that the implementation of the AI system temporarily increases the duration of machine service and customers’ demand for human service; however, it persistently reduces customer complaints. Furthermore, our results reveal interesting heterogeneity in the effectiveness of the voice‐based AI system. For relatively simple service requests, the AI system reduces customer complaints for both experienced and inexperienced customers. However, for complex requests, customers appear to learn from the prior experience of interacting with the AI system, which leads to fewer complaints. Moreover, the AI‐based system has a significantly larger effect on reducing customer complaints for older and female customers as well as for customers who have had extensive experience using the IVR system. Finally, we find that speech‐recognition failures in customer‐AI interactions lead to increases in customers’ demand for human service and customer complaints.

  abstract     = {Ride‐hailing platforms such as Uber and Lyft promise to reduce the negative externalities of driving and improve access to transportation. However, recent empirical evidence has been mixed about the impact of ride‐hailing on US cities, often resulting in a net increase in traffic congestion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, largely due to increased travel demand and competition with public transit. Pooled rides, in which multiple passengers share a single vehicle, are an effective solution to improve the sustainability of ride‐hailing, reducing GHG emissions and traffic congestion and appealing to price‐sensitive population segments by offering relatively cheaper rides. Yet, most ride‐hailing trips are unprofitable currently, resulting from ride‐hailing rides being subsidized (especially pooled) to compete with cheaper transportation alternatives such as public transit. In this paper, we consider whether price optimization can be used to improve ride‐hailing revenues while also reducing the environmental impacts of ride‐hailing, particularly as the cost of ride‐hailing is expected to fall into the future with the introduction of automated vehicles. Using a discrete choice experiment and multinomial logit choice model with a representative sample of the US population, we estimate consumer preferences for the attributes of ride‐hailing services and use them to explore how ride prices affect the revenue of ride‐hailing platforms and the total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by the ride‐hailing fleet. We show that as the costs of driving fall, continuously increasing the difference between the prices of individual and pooled rides is financially optimal for ride‐hailing platforms. Importantly, this pricing strategy also significantly reduces total VMT, resulting in a win–win for ride‐hailing platforms and cities. We perform extensive sensitivity analyses and show that our results are qualitatively robust under a wide range of consumer preferences and market conditions but that the optimal trajectory of prices and realized gains vary, highlighting opportunities for ride‐hailing services to influence the future of urban transportation.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is a major global risk and a key driver for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Yet, firms’ internal emissions reduction may create a leakage leading to higher emissions in the supply chain. The related literature suggests that the pollution‐haven hypothesis explains such emissions leakage. In contrast, we explore an alternative reason for supply chain leakage, which is related to optimization of supply chain activities and supply chain innovation. Based on panel data from Bloomberg Environmental, Social, and Governance and Bloomberg Supply Chain, we estimate our models at a dyadic (i.e., firm and supplier) level using two‐way cluster‐robust standard error, treating various sources of endogeneity. We find empirical evidence of a supply chain leakage effect—a higher level of a supplier&#39;s emissions is associated with a lower level of a firm&#39;s internal emissions. More importantly, the supplier&#39;s innovation can be a major reason behind the leakage; the supply chain leakage effect is stronger when a supplier is more innovative. Furthermore, the role of innovation is strengthened when a supplier invests in eco‐innovation and has technological capabilities similar to those of the focal firm. Our findings suggest that supply chain leakage may not be completely driven by the pollution‐haven effect, but instead is associated with supply chain optimization and innovation that may be beneficial in the long run.},

Whereas this model may actually reflect the relative market power in some situations, its implementation misses out on certain win–win opportunities that could arise from information sharing. We propose a new wholesale pricing mechanism that promotes information sharing between a relatively weaker retailer and a more powerful manufacturer such that both parties become better off. The novel feature of the new mechanism is an extra stage of interaction, which happens before the retailer&#39;s information sharing decision: at the very outset the manufacturer and the retailer reach a contractual agreement on an upper bound which the wholesale price will not exceed if the retailer shares his information. This new, easily implementable, mechanism can be a win–win for both supply chain firms. In other words, facing market uncertainty, the manufacturer, while having the market power to dictate the wholesale price, can gain from a contractual restriction on the exercise of that power in order to induce the retailer, who is in a weaker position, to share useful demand information.},

We prove convexity for the penultimate period and show convexity may not hold any earlier. A dynamic program can be solved optimally for small instances. We introduce both a one‐stage‐lookahead heuristic and a heuristic which is a combination of two existing standard approaches, the newsvendor and periodic review models. For simulated data, we compare these heuristics to the optimal solution for small problem instances and to further lookahead policies for larger problem instances. We show that the two new heuristics achieve results close to optimal.

One unique feature of the proposed approach involves integrating a real‐time data‐driven stochastic‐dynamic model with a fatigue accumulation function. The optimal solutions help achieve coordination between human pickers and robots, such that robots can agilely adapt to the coordinated pickers’ efficiency and fatigue conditions. Specifically, the proposed method estimates human pickers’ instantaneous performance and robot queue lengths, which are then fed back in real time as indexes to adjust robots’ speeds of handling racks and moving them to human pickers. Using data that are provided by a giant electronic commerce (e‐commerce) company, our analyses demonstrate that the proposed robot–picker coordination system permits alleviating a picker&#39;s fatigue without much influence on picking efficiency. In particular, a picker&#39;s accumulated fatigue can be reduced by 53.74% at the expense of lowering picker efficiency by 14.79% if the proposed robot–picker coordination system is applied in the focal firm of the study case. Through our scenario design and sensitivity analysis, additional findings and managerial insights, including the rules of human‐friendly robot behaviors for coordination with human pickers in different operational scenarios are provided.

Based on different information structures regarding the direct‐selling cost for the manufacturer, we analyze three models: incomplete information model, asymmetric information model, and full information model. By comparing the firms&#39; profits in these models, we derive the value of the manufacturer&#39;s information acquisition and the value of sharing that information with the retailer. We find that the manufacturer&#39;s information acquisition may hurt the manufacturer but benefit the retailer simultaneously. However, we also find a win–win outcome for the manufacturer and the retailer due to the manufacturer&#39;s learning of its direct‐selling cost. Further, in expectation, the manufacturer always benefits from sharing its private cost information with the retailer, while the retailer does not. We also show that the direct‐selling channel is always valuable to the manufacturer, while the retailer&#39;s preference will depend on the information structure. Finally, we consider a supply competition model where the manufacturer competes with a spot supply source to sell to the retailer. In contrast to the case of no supply competition, the manufacturer sells less using direct selling. However, direct selling can become more valuable as it may contribute higher profit for the manufacturer due to the reduced wholesale price charged to the retailer. We find that supply competition can completely reverse the manufacturer&#39;s disincentive into incentive for information acquisition and facilitate information sharing with the retailer.},

  abstract     = {We study an optimal matching problem in the context of dual‐donor organ exchange, where a portion of two living donors&#39; organs are transplanted to a single patient. This dual‐donor transplant technique is becoming more widespread for lung and liver transplants. However, multiple medical compatibility criteria pose a serious challenge for matching a patient with two compatible donors. In the United States and many other countries, laws prohibit commercial (for‐profit) deals for human organs, so donor exchanges are run by nonprofit organizations connecting donors with people in need of organs, with the goal of increasing transplant matches. We propose a simple chain mechanism in dual‐donor organ exchange to increase the number of patient–dual‐donor matches, which would maximize the number of patients receiving transplants. Based on this objective, we propose a general simple chain optimization framework for finding the maximum patient matching, taking into account multiple compatibility criteria (e.g., blood type and weight), and determine the complexity status of the problem. We provide theoretical results on the structures of simple chains, as well as a polynomial time algorithm to obtain the maximum patient matching simple chain with blood type compatibility. Through a numerical study for multiple compatibility criteria, we show that in many scenarios, a simple chain substantially increases the number of patients matched with dual donors for transplants, as opposed to exchange cycles. We also address the problem of maximizing the number of patients matched for dual‐donor organ transplants via two‐way and three‐way exchange cycles, subject to donors&#39; and recipients&#39; medical compatibility criteria, along with a discussion of their computational complexity. Finally, we characterize the general configurations of large n ‐way exchange cycles and provide theoretical insights for their structural properties. Our findings provide general optimization models for dual‐donor organ exchange operators to increase the number of patients matched for transplant, given multiple compatibility criteria. In addition, we show how exchange operators, using simple chains, can increase patient matches and reduce simultaneous surgical resource requirements over exchange cycles.},

  abstract     = {Firms who buy from suppliers often engage in supplier development to reduce the supplier&#39;s production cost. Being aware that their efforts may benefit a rival firm when there is a shared supplier, some buyers only invest in “specific supplier development,” that is, in those processes or technologies where spillover cannot occur. Other buyers willingly accept the spillover that arises from supplier development, and invest in “generic supplier development.” Our game‐theoretic model captures a buyer&#39;s choice to invest in these distinct supplier development types as a way to endogenize spillovers. In contrast to the literature, this paper considers the benefits of investing in a combination (i.e., portfolio) of cost‐reducing generic and specific supplier development. We demonstrate how supplier development affects a shared supplier&#39;s wholesale pricing decisions; whereas generic supplier development lowers wholesale prices equally across buyers, specific supplier development only lowers the wholesale price of the investing party. Our model shows that buyers should treat the spillovers from generic supplier development as an investment opportunity rather than a threat. In equilibrium, a buyer will always invest in a portfolio of both supplier development types, and having a better generic than specific investment capability may even make generic supplier development the most prevalent option for him, depending on the level of competition. Moreover, even if the buyers can commit to only investing in specific supplier investment, the resulting equilibrium gives lower buyer profits than a portfolio that includes generic investments. We also find that the presence of specific investments may raise generic supplier development, benefiting all supply chain actors. However, incorporating specific supplier development into a supplier development portfolio or a commitment to investment in only specific supplier development can lead to a prisoner&#39;s dilemma in terms of buyer profits. We show how investment capabilities and competitive intensity drive the buyers&#39; investment decisions and supply chain actors&#39; profits. The paper&#39;s main results also hold for asymmetric generic investment capabilities, though we highlight that the least capable buyer will free‐ride on his rival&#39;s investments, consequently making him earn higher profits.},

The existing high work content deviations on such assembly lines stress production planning, especially the assembly line sequencing. Most manufacturers set the launching rate for all assembly line products to a fixed launching rate resulting in rising utility work and idle time when system load increases. We present an “ideal” variable rate launching (VRL) case resulting in minimal computation and achieving 100% productivity (full elimination of idle time and utility work) for balanced assembly times and homogeneous station lengths. Managers should foster the ideal circumstances where operators need not wait for a preceding task to be completed and product sequence restrictions are eliminated, thus enabling unmatched production flexibility. Furthermore, we present a mixed‐integer model to analyze both closed and open workstations on an MMAL for fixed rate launching and VRL. This model incorporates costs not only for labor inefficiencies but also for extending the line length. We present a heuristic solution method when process times and station lengths are heterogeneous and demonstrate that the variable takt dominates the fixed takt. In a numerical, industrial benchmark study, we illustrate that a VRL strategy with open stations has significantly lower labor costs as well as a substantially reduced total line length and thus lower throughput time.},

  abstract     = {The past three decades have witnessed a tremendous shift in public health policies toward marijuana legalization in the United States. Adopting the process‐based view of innovation, we hypothesize that marijuana&#39;s increased use and related consequences after its legalization affect innovators’ behavior and social environment during the innovation process, which in turn impacts regional innovation. Utilizing the staggered adoption of medical marijuana laws (MMLs) by 20 states between 1996 and 2013 as a quasi‐experimental setting, we find that legalizing medical marijuana reduces the overall output of regional innovation as proxied by patents’ total forward‐citation count aggregated by innovator location. Further analyses decomposing the overall output into patent quantity and quality reveal that the quantity of certain patents rises after states’ medical marijuana legalization. More importantly, these analyses show that the quality of all patents, especially that of “hit” patents, deteriorates, leading to a net negative effect on the overall output. These tests further suggest that different findings concerning patent quantity and quality are related to marijuana legalization&#39;s diverse influence on innovators’ individual and collaborative effectiveness during the innovation process. The decline in innovation output and quality after the adoption of MMLs is robust to the use of additional identification strategies. The evidence suggests that legalizing medical marijuana has an adverse effect on regional innovation activity.},

The functional model treats PLC curves as target variables and includes both scalar and functional predictors, capturing time‐varying promotional activities. Harnessing the power of basis function transformation, the developed model can effectively characterize the local features and temporal evolution of sales curves. Our Bayesian framework can generate initial curve forecasts before the product launch and update the forecasts dynamically as new sales data are collected. We validate the superior performance of our method through extensive numerical experiments using three real‐world data sets. Our forecasting framework reduces the forecasting error by 5.35%–30.76% over JD.com&#39;s current model and outperforms alternative models significantly. Furthermore, the estimated promotion effect function provides useful insights into how promotional activities interact with sales curves.},

  abstract     = {Different versions of mobile operating systems or shopping apps enable different functionalities and information flows, thus creating various mobile shopping environments. In general, up‐to‐date versions provide better information flows and richer functionalities. However, mobile operating systems and shopping apps affect consumer behavior through different mechanisms. An up‐to‐date mobile operating system reduces the system response time, while an up‐to‐date shopping app improves algorithms for better search accuracy. The former encourages consumer explore and search, whereas the latter improves consumer search efficiency and reduces chances for consumers to discover more products. Using a unique large‐scale clickstream data set from a mobile commerce retailer, we examine the effect of mobile operating system and app versions on consumer search and impulse purchase behaviors in mobile commerce. Our results show that consumers with an up‐to‐date mobile operating system or a previous version of a shopping app conduct more searches in terms of increased product page views and time spent on product pages, which results in a higher probability of consumer impulse purchase. However, consumers&#39; search for individual products is not affected by versions. Surprisingly, though more page views or time spent may boost purchases, we find that consumer search affects impulse purchases nonlinearly in that page views and time spent have a decreasing rate of impact. Our computations show that using an up‐to‐date operating system increases consumer search activities by 60.45 product pages or 521.30 seconds spent browsing compared to using a previous version of an operation system. Using an up‐to‐date app decreases consumer search activities by 129.34 product pages or 1446.48 seconds spent browsing compared to using a previous version of a mobile app.},

  abstract     = {Our research question is motivated by a real problem faced by an existing demand aggregator. The aggregator represents multiple advertisers, each of whom signs one of two types of contracts with the aggregator for bidding on an RTB (real‐time bidding) platform. A quality contract occurs on a cost‐per‐impression (CPM, i.e., cost per thousand impressions) basis. The advertiser is promised a minimum number of impressions and pays a CPM that is a function of the targeting quality as measured by the realized click‐through rate (CTR). In a performance contract the advertiser pays on a CPC (cost‐per‐click) basis constrained by a budget. We develop and solve a generalized profit maximization problem that jointly optimizes the aggregator&#39;s bidding and allocation decisions. The allocation policy optimally assigns each arriving bidding opportunity to a specific advertiser. The bidding policy then computes a bid amount for that allocation based on the estimated click probability of the opportunity. Our solution has nice theoretical properties. First, neither policy depends on the memory carried in the system, that is, the sequence of previous states and decisions, making the solution easy to implement. Second, the allocation policy is shown to have a threshold structure. This enables the assignment of arriving opportunities into one of two distinct sets, each corresponding to a specific advertising contract type. The assessment of the impact of the change in various parameters on the solution is used to derive several interesting and important implications for the management of advertising contracts.},

For customers who received coupons but did not redeem them (i.e., exposure effect), they purchased less than those who did not receive coupons after the promotion ends; and for the customers who redeemed coupons (i.e., redemption effect), they purchased more than those who did not redeem them after the promotion ends.

In this paper, we propose a nuanced method to detect frauds by tracking granular changes in disclosures over time. Specifically, we first align paragraphs between consecutive disclosures by their similarities. This alignment can be solved as an optimization‐based matching problem. Then we identify three types of changed contents: recurrent, newly added, and deleted contents. For each type, we measure the changes in terms of fraud‐relevant linguistics features, such as sentiment and uncertainties. Further, we formulate a firm&#39;s Management Discussion and Analysis change trajectory over years as a multivariate time series composed of these granular metrics. We implement a deep learning model to predict frauds using the change trajectory as an input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms benchmark models, and its performance increases with the length of the change trajectory. Moreover, we found specific types of changes are strongly associated with frauds, including weak modal or reward words in newly added or deleted contents. Our work provides an optimization‐based method to define change trajectories and trace information mutation in narratives. Finally, our study contributes to the fraud detection literature with a new predictive signal—disclosure change trajectories with an effective deep learning architecture.},

This paper examines the integration of stockpile inventory, backup capacity, and standby capability to meet the disaster‐related surge in demand in the future. We present a two‐period model of such an integrated system for consumable items with uncertain demand that follows a general probability distribution. Our model incorporates standby capability in period 1 that can be converted to additional capacity for use in period 2, with the conversion yield being deterministic or stochastic. Our main results are: (1) Adding capacity in addition to inventory is beneficial only when the capacity reservation‐related costs are relatively lower than the inventory‐related costs. In this case, adding capacity will decrease the inventory needed in both periods, the shortfall probability, and the total expected cost. (2) Adding capability in period 1 is cost‐effective only when the ratio of capability‐development cost to conversion yield is lower than the capacity reservation cost. In this case, investing in capability results in less inventory and less reserved capacity in period 2. (3) Higher uncertainty in capability conversion yield reduces the attraction of developing capability in period 1. Consequently, less capability would be developed in period 1, while more inventory and capacity would be needed in period 2 in the face of a higher shortfall probability.},

Our work is motivated by the aforementioned operational challenges that typically face adopters of new technologies in the healthcare sector. We anchor our study on a partnership with the proton therapy center of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which offers a new radiation technology for cancer patients. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear integer optimization problem. However, as the solution to this formulation lacks both tractability and interpretability, to be relevant to practice, we limit our study to simple and interpretable policies. In particular, we propose a simple index‐based rule and derive analytical performance guarantees for it. We also calibrate our model using empirical data from our partner hospital, and conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed policy under practical circumstances. The analytical performance guarantees and our numerical experiments demonstrate (a) the strong performance of the proposed policies, and (b) their robustness to various practical considerations (e.g., to potential misspecification of no‐show probabilities). Our results show that our proposed policy, despite being a simple and interpretable index‐based rule, is capable of improving performance by about 20% at an organization such as MGH, and of delivering results that are not far from being optimal across a wide range of parameters that might vary between organizations. This suggests that the proposed policy can be viewed as an effective “one‐fits‐all” capacity allocation rule that can be used in a variety of environments in which operational challenges such as no‐shows and overtime costs need to be navigated using simple and interpretable rules.},

To survive the crisis, it is critical to rethink the proper setting of global supply chains and reform many related operational strategies. We hence attempt to reform the GSCM from both supply and demand sides considering different pandemic stages (i.e., pre, during, and post‐pandemic stages). In this research paper, we combine a careful literature review with real‐world case studies to examine the impacts and specific challenges brought by the pandemic to global supply chains. We first classify the related literature from the demand and supply sides. Based on the insights obtained, we search publicly available information and report real practices of GSCM under COVID‐19 in nine top global enterprises. To achieve responsiveness, resilience, and restoration (3Rs), we then propose the “GREAT‐3Rs” framework, which shows the critical issues and measures for reforming GSCM under the three pandemic stages. In particular, the “GREAT” part of the framework includes five critical domains, namely, “government proactive policies and measures,” “redesigning global supply chains,” “economic and financing strategies under risk,” “adjustment of operations,” and “technology adoption,” to help global enterprises to survive the pandemic; “3Rs” are the outputs that can be achieved after using the “GREAT” strategies under the three pandemic stages. Finally, we establish a future research agenda from five aspects.},

  abstract     = {Buy‐one‐get‐one‐free (BOGOF), a ubiquitous sales promotion scheme by which consumers get two items for the price of one, encourages consumers to buy and waste food. An alternative promotional scheme is one where consumers receive a coupon for a second item available for free at a later time. Our work is motivated by British supermarkets which, facing criticism from lawmakers for running BOGOF promotions on perishables, started a “BOGOF Later” campaign with the claim that it would reduce the amount of waste. Food waste is indeed a very pressing issue, which has not yet been explored in connection to sales promotions. We compare the impact of these promotion schemes on a retailer&#39;s profit as well as on the amount of product wasted at the retail and household levels. We consider two possible applications: unexpected high inventory of a fresh product with a short shelflife and excess leftover inventory for an item at the end of its season or product life. We propose a two‐period newsvendor model which captures the sales‐boosting effect of promotions, the postpromotion sales drop due to satiation, the coupon‐redemption behavior, and the increased consumer wastage rate from BOGOF promotions. We obtain analytical comparisons of order quantity, profit, and waste across the different promotion schemes and use numerical experiments to generate further insights. We find that, in general, BOGOF promotions are profitable ways to liquidate inventory. In many instances, the increase in waste at the consumers&#39; homes is offset by the decrease in waste at the retail store. As a result, BOGOF promotions often constitute “win‐win propositions” by simultaneously increasing the retailer&#39;s profit and decreasing total waste. Overall, our results paint a more favorable picture of the BOGOF promotion scheme than commonly perceived and suggest that its environmental criticism emanates from a too narrow and too consumer‐centric view of the waste problem.},

To study the profit and welfare implications of the emergence of sharing economy and manufacturer&#39;s platform‐building strategy, we employ a vertically differentiated duopoly setting and consider three scenarios: no‐sharing benchmark, a single third‐party platform emerged, and manufacturer‐built platform co‐existing with the third‐party platform. Formulating and solving the game in each scenario, we compare the equilibrium outcomes, including manufacturers&#39; profits, consumer surplus and social welfare, before and after scenario transitions. For the manufacturers&#39; profits, no matter which manufacturer builds the platform in presence of the third‐party platform, that manufacturer will be better off, whereas the opponent manufacturer may also benefit, depending on the quality differentiation perceived by consumers in the product selling market and in the sharing market. Moreover, when comparing against the no‐sharing benchmark, the manufacturers benefit from the sharing only when the quality differentiation is large enough and the production cost is not small. For the welfare implication, if the renters derive the same usage utility as the owners in the sharing market, the consumer surplus and the social welfare will always increase as the third‐party platform emerges or a manufacturer builds its platform. Otherwise, either platform could hurt the consumer surplus and the social welfare, especially when the quality differentiation is large.

We allow class‐dependent rejection and backlogging costs. We also incorporate holding costs and procurement costs. We obtain the optimal restocking and inventory dispensation policies under the total discounted cost criterion as well as the long‐run average cost criterion. In particular, we develop efficient algorithms to compute the optimal policies (OPs) by decoupling the inventory dispensation policy from the restocking policy. We show that the OP operates as follows: At the restocking epochs, we order up to a fixed base‐stock level. We satisfy the demands from a class if the inventory is above a critical level that depends on the class and time to the next restocking epoch; else we reject or backlog it depending on whether the next restocking epoch is later or earlier than a class‐dependent critical number.

  abstract     = {Academic approaches considering demand uncertainty in lot sizing are seldom used in practice. Industry typically implements deterministic models and accounts for uncertainties by using a rolling‐horizon planning framework with frequent forecast updates. This paper bridges this gap by proposing a stochastic lot‐sizing methodology adapted to rolling‐horizon processes. Using the martingale model of forecast evolution (MMFE), we are able to anticipate the forecast updates from rolling‐horizon planning in stochastic lot sizing. Our formulation is extended with production recourse to reflect the replanning flexibility of rolling‐horizon planning. Extensive simulations on both synthetic and real‐world data show the value of forecast evolution models. Forecast evolution models reduce actual costs by 14% on average compared to traditional deterministic planning. The advantage of the extended model with production recourse depends on several factors including capacity, correlation, and uncertainty. Sensitivity analyses show that recourse can reduce costs by an additional 3% on average and up to 10% in specific settings. Using real‐world and synthetic data, we provide the first analysis of the value of additive and multiplicative MMFE‐based planning models when the true forecast evolution process is unknown. We show that, contrary to the existing consensus, the additive model performs more robustly than the multiplicative model on a wide array of problem settings.},

  abstract     = {We consider a multi‐item buyer&#39;s make versus buy decision. The buyer sells two substitutable products with uncertain demand. Each product requires a different item, which the buyer procures from two separate suppliers (one for each item) who offer quantity‐payment contracts under asymmetric information. The buyer can make one of the items but not both. We compare the buyer&#39;s expected profit between buying both the items and making one item (and buying the other), when it can make the item at the same cost as the supplier, as well as gain reactive production capability by making. We find that the buyer&#39;s profit when buying both items is higher than for making one item if product substitutability is above a threshold (but not extremely high). This is because the interaction between the suppliers&#39; contracts increases the buyer&#39;s informational rents more when buying from both suppliers, as compared to one supplier, as product substitutability increases. On the contrary, in the complete information scenario (and under wholesale price contracts), we find that the buyer will never prefer to buy both the items as compared to making one item, as long as product substitutability is not extremely high. These are novel findings on how inter‐linked contracts under incomplete information and product substitutability can influence a buyer&#39;s make versus buy decision in a counter‐intuitive manner. Managerially, these results imply that a multi‐product buyer may prefer to keep buying from its supplier even when it can produce the item at the same cost as the supplier.},

  abstract     = {Online volunteering platforms allow humanitarian organizations (HOs) to recruit volunteers to work remotely on projects of varying urgency. While removing time and space constraints enables HOs to scale up their volunteer force, HOs must manage greater heterogeneity in volunteers&#39; experience. We investigate empirically how volunteers&#39; experience impacts two performance metrics on online volunteering platforms: project completion rate and volunteer retention. In addition, we examine the conditions under which experience becomes more relevant to project completion rate and retention. We collected a novel panel data set from the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Tasking Manager. Our data set includes 5,162 online volunteering projects with 2,169,683 contributions by 96,450 volunteers. Results from a panel regression model show that a project&#39;s completion rate improves in diminishing increments with the experience of the contributing volunteers. We further find that the effect of experience on project completion rate is contingent on the urgency of the project. Regarding retention, results from a parametric hazard model indicate that volunteers are incentivized to return to an online volunteering platform more quickly when they are closer to attaining a new experience‐based rank. However, we find that this effect weakens as volunteers gain experience. Overall, our study sheds light on volunteer management in an online context and offers operational insights on the recruitment and allocation of volunteers for HOs as well as online volunteering platforms.},

We model this optimization problem as a mixed‐integer linear program. We show this model can be solved to optimality efficiently using pareto‐optimal Benders cuts for ensembles containing a modest number of trees. We consider a random forest approximation that consists of sampling a subset of trees and establish that this gives rise to near‐optimal solutions by proving analytical guarantees. In particular, for axis‐aligned trees, we show that the number of trees we need to sample is sublinear in the size of the forest being approximated. Motivated by this result, we propose heuristics inspired by cross‐validation that optimize over smaller forests rather than one large forest and assess their performance on synthetic datasets. We present two case studies on a property investment problem and a jury selection problem. We show this approach performs well against other benchmarks while providing insights into the sensitivity of the algorithm&#39;s performance for different parameters of the random forest.},

  abstract     = {Despite the prevalence of multiproduct firms in many industries, the supply chain contracting literature has predominantly focused on problems where an upstream player offers only one product. This paper studies multiproduct contract design for competing manufacturers each with several products to sell via a common retailer. We consider two contracting schemes under multinomial logit demand (MNL): individual contracting , in which the manufacturers set a wholesale price for each of their products separately; and aggregate contracting , in which the manufacturers set the price as a function of the order quantities for their own products. We find that under individual contracting it is optimal for each manufacturer to offer the full range of his products to the retailer and set an equal wholesale margin for these products. This suggests that the classic result of an equal‐margin policy for the retailer also holds true for the manufacturers. Further, there is an equilibrium characterized by a system of nonlinear equations that can be solved using the standard bisection search method. Under aggregate contracting, a simple cost‐plus contract is optimal for the manufacturers. In equilibrium, each manufacturer charges a markup equal to his marginal contribution to the supply chain, and the supply chain profit is maximized. Comparing these two contracting schemes, we find among other results that the retailer prefers aggregate contracting when there is a large number of products from each manufacturer or when consumer heterogeneity is low, while the opposite is true for the manufacturers. In addition, both the retailer and the manufacturers prefer aggregate contracting when there are few manufacturers in the supply chain. It is also found that as the number of manufacturers or the number of products from each manufacturer increases, the supply chain efficiency loss induced by individual contracting is reduced. Finally, we extend our model to a hybrid setting in which one manufacturer adopts aggregate contracting and the other adopts individual contracting, and demonstrate to the manufacturers the value of aggregate contracting. These results provide useful guidance on optimal contract design for multiproduct firms.},

  abstract     = {Hops are the flowers of a specialty crop that provide unique flavors to craft beer. We study a multi‐year crop planning problem for a farmer who seeks to add hops production to the current production of a conventional crop. The farmer must dynamically determine the number of acres to allocate to each crop and design the terms of the forward contract under which brewers purchase the hops, considering the uncertainty of weather conditions, hops yield, hops spot market price, and conventional crop price. We formulate a multi‐period stochastic dynamic programming framework that incorporates statistical learning methods that depend on exogenous factors. We also develop an easy‐to‐implement learning‐based marginal total profit heuristic which can potentially be used as a decision support tool. Our numerical analyses suggest that yield learning is particularly important for a farmer who is considering investing in a high margin, but potentially risky, new crop such as hops. We also characterize the conditions under which yield learning is most beneficial for farmers. This paper contributes to the literature on specialty crop planning by introducing a multi‐year planning framework that incorporates unique characteristics of specialty crop production. We fill a gap in the crop planning literature by considering how farmers can learn about crop yields based on realized yields and exogenous factors such as weather conditions. Our paper is also of practical importance for farmers who seek to diversify their crop portfolio to hedge against risks associated with trade tensions and potential price drops for conventional crops.},

In this context, we define cry wolf as a behavioral syndrome in which the manufacturer becomes less compliant with a forecaster&#39;s valuable recommendation after the forecaster&#39;s prior recommendation is known to be ex post nonoptimal. We find that, although the cry‐wolf syndrome unequivocally leads to lower performance for the manufacturer when the forecaster&#39;s forecast ability is exogenous, cry wolf can help boost the forecaster&#39;s investment in improving forecast ability when the ability can be endogenously determined by the forecaster and, thus, benefit the manufacturer. Moreover, cry wolf can improve the performance of the system—the manufacturer and forecaster together—when the commission that the manufacturer pays to the forecaster is not low. Our findings are helpful for understanding the conditions under which cry wolf can be detrimental or beneficial, and for indicating the need for caution with regard to actions curtailing the cry‐wolf syndrome among managers.},

Customers can purchase from either firm and are strategic in that they choose whether to buy now or later. In a two‐period game theoretical model, we analyze the MPC&#39;s optimal co‐opetition strategy, which mainly concerns whether to sell to the OEM or to enter the end market. The optimal strategy can be characterized by the customer&#39;s patience to wait and the competitor&#39;s product quality. We then extend our model to investigate three key factors: new customers arriving late, cost differentiation between the two firms, and the existence of a third‐party supplier. While in the first two extensions the optimal strategies remain qualitatively the same as in the main model, the existence of a third‐party supplier impacts the MPC&#39;s choice of co‐opetition strategy crucially. We discuss how the MPC should balance cooperation and competition, and characterize the conditions when the MPC should change strategy.},

In the widely implemented partitioned templating strategy, appointment capacity is allocated exclusively to each patient group defined by a combination of patient attributes and medical conditions, which often results in utilization challenges for SPs. Motivated by problems faced by an SP within a large academic medical center, we propose partially partitioned templating strategies that cluster patient groups into access classes and allocate appointment slots to these classes. We formulate a two‐stage stochastic optimization model to simultaneously optimize decisions on patient group clustering and capacity allocation in the templating strategy design. We develop an efficient solution algorithm for the problem, which otherwise poses a combinatorial challenge, based on Benders&#39; cuts and an anticipatory approximation. Numerical experiments using real‐world data show that the partially partitioned strategies outperform benchmark strategies used by SPs through maintaining a balance of high capacity utilization and providing timely access for priority patients. In addition, we study a wide range of SP setups for transferable insights on templating strategies based on practice specifics.},

  abstract     = {The enforcement of ever‐stringent regulatory requirements capping emission limits is challenging the traditional operations of various transportation sectors. In maritime transportation, the recent regulation tightening fuel sulfur limits to 0.50%, known as the “IMO 2020,” has been enforced. There is a flurry of activities by ocean carriers to equip their vessels to comply with this regulation. Although the technical conditions are clear, investment decisions are hard to make due to inevitable uncertainties in the current transition period, especially on the impact of fuel prices in the long run. In this study, we consider an ocean carrier&#39;s technology investment decisions. Each compliance solution is subject to uncertain operating costs with a partially characterized probability distribution that may deviate from current expected norms. The carrier chooses a portfolio of compliance solutions for its entire fleet that would best adhere to two decision criteria characterized by a net present value (NPV) target in investment and a capacity utilization rate target in fleet deployment. To find optimal decisions that will perform well in the uncertain transition period, we introduce a tractable mathematical model, termed the ambiguous robustness optimization model, to minimize the financial riskiness index associated with the risk of expected NPV not meeting a specified target. We further propose a solution scheme through mixed‐integer second‐order cone programming approximation that can be efficiently solved by off‐the‐shelf solvers. We show that this decision support system performs well in numerical experiments constructed using real data on the Asia‐North America West Coast shipping network.},

The problem is formulated as an infinite‐horizon cyclic stochastic dynamic program to account for the time‐varying and cyclic nature of car rental businesses. To tackle the curse of dimensionality , we propose a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) approach with product‐ and time‐dependent Lagrangian multipliers to decomposing the dynamic network problem into multiple single‐station single‐day subproblems. We show that the Lagrangian dual problem is a convex program and then develop a subgradient‐based algorithm to solve the dual problem and derive an LR‐based bid price policy. To improve the scalability of the LR approach, we further propose three simpler LR‐based bid price policy variants with either location‐dependent or leadtime‐dependent Lagrangian multipliers, or both. Our numerical study indicates that the LR‐based bid price policies can outperform some commonly used heuristics. Using a set of real‐world booking data, we provide a case study in which we empirically demonstrate the operational characteristics of car rental services, calibrate the arrival process of booking requests using a Poisson regression model, and demonstrate that the LR‐based bid price policies indeed outperform other heuristics consistently in both in‐sample and out‐of‐sample horizons.},

Although leading online retailers commonly seek to enhance service transparency to consumers by providing fulfillment service information, such as inventory ownership (i.e., sold by) and order fulfillment (i.e., shipped by), their impact remains poorly understood, particularly in the context of when consumers receive deceptive counterfeit products. Drawing on signaling and attribution theory, we develop a series of six scenario‐based experiments to explore the impact of fulfillment service options in combination with deceptive counterfeits on consumer perception of product quality, blame, trust erosion, and repurchase intention across three different retailing contexts. Our results highlight the efficacy of fulfillment service information as a signal set in setting a priori product quality perceptions for the small and predominantly online retailer. Further, we find that consumers follow the premise of causal schemata to attribute more blame to the entity responsible for selling the product when they receive a counterfeit product. Our results show that while there is a significant decrease in trust for a small retailer or startup this decrease does not significantly differ between the fulfillment service configurations. Furthermore, the erosion in trust does not negatively impact repurchase intentions. However, for the predominantly online retailer and omni‐channel retailer trust erosion is higher when inventory ownership (i.e., sold by) and order fulfillment (i.e., shipped by) are associated with the online retailer than with a third‐party seller and subsequently negatively impacts repurchase intentions.},

  abstract     = {The path for elevating the role of manufacturing in the company strategy in the last few decades has been rather clear: Improve the basic production capabilities—typically quality, reliability, lead times, and cost efficiency of production processes. Leading Japanese companies, like Toyota, showed the way. But as many have heeded the advice and followed suit, this approach has become essentially a defensive strategy; you must do it not to fall behind. Has manufacturing lost its potential to create capabilities on which a company&#39;s strategy can rest? Our answer is absolutely not. In fact, unlike before, manufacturing has multiple paths for creating a competitive advantage and these paths require development of new and often nontraditional capabilities. We identify five sets of new capabilities, and since it is hard to excel in all of them, we provide a framework for choosing the right mix depending on the company&#39;s business strategy. The framework focuses on the implications of two recent trends: increasing information density embedded in products and increasing connectedness of manufacturing processes. We suggest specific mixes of the five groups of capabilities that can support and accelerate a company&#39;s strategy to exploit these trends. We use examples from three multinationals to illustrate the process. These new opportunities change the traditional role of manufacturing executives. Their focus will need to shift exceedingly to collaborating and interfacing with colleagues in other functions as well as managing relationships beyond the boundaries of the company.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the interaction between two key quality management decisions—input conformance quality and inspection policy—and related wholesale and retail prices in a two echelon supply chain. Market demand depends on the retail price as well as the end‐product conformance quality, which itself depends on the input quality and the inspection scheme. Consistent with previous empirical findings in the literature, we show that an increase in quality does not always result in higher prices for consumers due to the cost‐lowering effect of better quality. We also show that a lower input quality may still result in higher end‐product quality because of how it might incentivize more and/or better inspection. Any interaction between input quality and inspection policy becomes more pronounced in the decentralized system due to incentive asymmetry between the channel partners. This makes the adoption of a full‐inspection policy more likely there compared to an integrated system. Indeed, while vertical competition due to decentralization results in higher prices for customers, it can also result in better quality of end products. Another interesting finding in the decentralized setting is that, somewhat counterintuitively, a player may indeed opt to bear a higher share of the penalty for defective products sold to consumers resulting in higher profits for the player.},

  abstract     = {Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are responsible for the quality and cost of care of specified patient populations, including the cost of referrals. Motivated by this environment, we study care coordination for healthcare referrals. We consider an ACO that refers an uncertain number of patients from its attributed population to a preferred external provider for specialized health services. ACOs are typically paid under the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP). Under the MSSP, the payer sets a spending benchmark for the beneficiary population during a fixed time period and shares any gains (losses) relative to it with the ACO. During the billing period, all services delivered to the attributed population by the ACO and external providers continue to be reimbursed under fee‐for‐service. Gains (losses) are determined at the end of the period by comparing the actual spending, which includes all care expenses (regular visits, referrals, and failed treatments) incurred by the payer in the period to the predefined benchmark. In this environment, the ACO and external providers—the latter not compensated under the MSSP—lack incentives to invest enough in care coordination initiatives. We study financial incentive mechanisms between the ACO and its preferred external provider to achieve integrated care coordination in referral markets under the MSSP. We show that traditional fee‐for‐service and capitation agreements do not provide sufficient incentives for care coordination in referral markets. However, a risk‐ and cost‐sharing mechanism can induce integrated care coordination efforts while satisfying the ACO and provider&#39;s participation constraints. We characterize a family of such mechanisms and numerically study the variability of the ACO and the external provider&#39;s profit. We demonstrate that this type of agreement can be used not only to induce integrated care coordination but can also result in a Pareto improvement in profit variability. We also illustrate the impact of the different MSSP risk tracks parameters on the performance of this care coordination mechanism, including their effect on the quality of care and the payer&#39;s mean spending.},

Although it is possible to select the ideal order quantity given the costs of over and undersupplying demand, prior research demonstrates that decision‐makers consistently make suboptimal inventory choices. Drawing on construal level theory and psychological distance, this paper explores how differences in the spatial distance (suppliers that are geographically near or far) and temporal distance (short or long lead time from order to receipt) impact newsvendor decision‐making. Across four experiments ( N = 663), we find that a far psychological distance increases order quantities, which improves performance for high‐margin products but results in added costs for low‐margin goods. Given that spatial and temporal distances occur naturally in supply chains, our research shows that psychological distance is a cognitive explanation for biased inventory ordering and can be applied to improve decision‐making.},

  abstract     = {Most developed countries hold significant quantities of medical supplies in reserve for emergency response. Due to high handling costs and remote storage locations, such stocks are typically not used for day‐to‐day operations. In consequence, the expiry of reserve supplies (without use) is a significant problem. One possible remedy for such wastage is to donate large batches of dated supplies to developing nations, which often do without adequate medical supplies in their health systems. Here, we focus on personal protective equipment (PPE) and similar products, which have low risks associated with aging and safety. However, the international community is cautious about donating dated medical supplies, with the World Health Organization explicitly recommending against it. Issues of safety, while important, are not the primary concern as recent studies have shown expiration dates to be conservative. Instead, most concerns relate to macrolevel effects on the recipient country. Taking safety as given, we carefully model the incentives in the medical supplies donation supply chain, providing insights into the likely effects of corruption and impacts on the local industry. Overall, we find that the impact of donation is not monotone in the quality of donated products. In particular, dated donations whose quality is slightly lower than the quality of products in the local market are likely to be more beneficial than fresh donations; thus, we suggest that the international community reconsiders its stand on banning donations from dated reserves. We provide concrete guidelines for such donations and suggest a possible path for implementation of a donation program.},

  abstract     = {For generation products characterized by frequent releases of new versions, when a new version is introduced to the market, the current version usually still has a remaining useful life. This creates a challenge for a firm to manage used product collection and upgraded product introductions at the same time, especially with the presence of a secondary market. This paper develops an analytical model to study the design and evaluation of two widely adopted collection policies for used products. Specifically, depending on whether a monetary reward for returning used products is associated with further purchases, we examine both unconditional (buyback) and conditional (trade‐in) collection policies that take place in practice. We find that, in the absence of a secondary market, a conditional collection policy can outperform an unconditional one when the base product is durable and the residual value that the manufacturer can obtain after collection is intermediate. However, when an independent secondary market exists, allowing customers to trade used products with each other, any conditional policy cannot outperform the optimal unconditional policy. In particular, the two policies generate the same profit when the residual value is low; otherwise, the unconditional policy dominates as it effectively mitigates the cannibalization of the upgraded product sales by collecting more used products and reducing the supply to the secondary market. We also discuss the environmental impacts of these two collection policies. Our study helps to understand the impact of strategic customer behavior and the secondary market on the choice of used product collection policies, and provides manufacturers with guidance on the design of the optimal collection policy.},

To meet the rising expectation of high‐quality services, efficiently allocating resources is vital for service systems to balance service qualities with costs. In particular, this paper focuses on a class of resource allocation problems where the service‐level objective and constraints are in the form of probabilistic measures. Further, process complexity and system dynamics in service systems often render their performance evaluation and optimization challenging and relying on simulation models. To this end, we propose a generalized resource allocation model with probabilistic measures, and subsequently, develop an optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) formulation to select the optimal solution subject to random noises in simulation. The OCBA formulation minimizes the expected opportunity cost that penalizes based on the quality of the selected solution. Further, the formulation takes a Bayesian approach to consider the prior knowledge and potential performance correlations on candidate solutions. Then, the asymptotic optimality conditions of the formulation are derived, and an iterative algorithm is developed accordingly. Numerical experiments and a case study inspired by a real‐world problem in a hospital emergency department demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for solving the resource allocation problem via simulation.},

Our discrete‐item setting has rendered the presence or absence of strong censoring indicators or equivalently, being knowledgeable or ignorant of one more demand request after the depletion of the inventory, a critical issue and any gradient‐based method designed for the continuous‐item case ineffective. We propose a policy that deliberately orders up to very high levels in designated learning periods and in the remaining doing periods, uses base‐stock levels tailored to near‐empirical distributions formed over the learning periods. A matching O ( T 2 / 3 ) $O(T^{2/3})$ upper bound can be achieved by this policy. The results can hold even when items are nonperishable.

This article argues that suppliers with firm‐ and industry‐specific knowledge are uniquely positioned to fill a critical void in boardrooms. It also suggests that the value of having a supplier on the board (SOTB) is influenced by environmental contingencies faced by a firm: operational efficiency, diversification, and demand uncertainty. Using an objective measure of supplier presence in the boardroom, the authors find that a supplier&#39;s presence enhances firm performance. They also find that the value of an SOTB in enhancing performance is greater in firms with lower operational efficiency and higher demand uncertainty and, is lower in firms with higher diversification. These results are robust to potential endogeneity issues, alternative estimation methods, and measures of moderator and outcome variables.},

  abstract     = {Many firms are adopting an “everything or anything” as a service—“XaaS”—model to sell goods and value‐added services. Buyers for such goods are heterogeneous both in the number of units they desire and the valuations for each unit. Suppliers designing such revenue models can offer either a usage‐based per‐unit fee or an access‐based per‐period fee, often combining them both as a nonlinear two‐part tariff plan that imposes both types of fees on all buyers or let buyers self‐select from a menu of per‐unit and per‐period plans. We develop a theoretical model to analyze the economic implications of alternative designs for mixing per‐unit and per‐period fees. Our analysis produces the following practical insights on these plans&#39; profitability and market coverage. First, the menu is generally a better way of combining access and usage fees for a firm selling digital goods with zero variable costs. Second, the preferred design switches to a two‐part tariff if the firm&#39;s production environment resells or runs on top of a back‐end infrastructure or data service provider that imposes nonnegligible variable costs. Third, we show that the revenue advantage of these two designs (which employ both fees) over a simple plan that employs only one fee (best of per unit and per period) is most significant when the rate of change in marginal valuation is relatively similar across buyers.},
