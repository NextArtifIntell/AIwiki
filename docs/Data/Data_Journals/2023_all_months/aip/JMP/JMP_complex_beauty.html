We show that the conjectured allowed values of the cyclotron frequency are a mere artifact of the truncation of the power series used to solve the radial eigenvalue equation. Our analysis proves that the analytical expression for the eigenvalues is incorrect.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the long-time asymptotic dynamics of three types of the higher-order lump in the Davey-Stewartson I equation, namely the linear lump, triangular lump and quasi-diamond lump, are investigated. For large time, the linear lump splits into certain fundamental lumps arranged in a straight line, which are associated with root structures of the first component in used eigenvector. The triangular lump consists of certain fundamental lumps forming a triangular structure, which are described by the roots of a special Wronskian that is similar to Yablonskii-Vorob polynomial. The quasi-diamond lump comprises a diamond in the outer region and a triangular lump pattern in the inner region (if it exists), which are decided by the roots of a general Wronskain determinant. The minimum values of these lump hollows are dependent on time and approach zero when time goes to infinity. Our approximate lump patterns and true solutions show excellent agreement.},

While the theory is well established for so called deterministic standard symmetries (the class originally studied by Kozlov), some points need clarification for so called random standard symmetries and W-symmetries. This paper is devoted to such clarification; in particular we note that the theory naturally calls, for these classes of symmetries, to also consider generalized Ito equations; and that while Kozlov theory is extended substantially unharmed for random standard symmetries, W-symmetries should be handled with great care, and cannot be used towards integration of stochastic equations, albeit they have different uses.},

We first explore this geometry using an analytic expression for the eigenvalues to examine the spectral dimension and volume of the geometry. In the second part of the paper we extend the code from Glaser and Stern [J. Geom. Phys. 159 , 103921 (2021)], in which the truncated sphere was visualized through localized states. This generalization allows us to examine finite spectral triples. In particular, we apply this code to the deformed fuzzy sphere as a first step in the more ambitious program of using it to examine arbitrary finite spectral triples, like those generated from random fuzzy spaces, as show in Barrett and Glaser [J.

  abstract     = {The theory of slow-fast gradient systems leads in a natural way to non-equilibrium steady states, because on the slow time scale the fast subsystem stays in steady states that are controlled by the interaction with the slow system. Using the theory of convergence of gradient systems depending on a small parameter ɛ (here the ratio between the slow and the fast time scale) in the sense of the energy-dissipation principle shows that there is a natural characterization of these non-equilibrium steady states as saddle points of a so-called B -function where the slow variables are fixed. We give applications to slow-fast reaction-diffusion systems based on the so-called cosh-type gradient structure for reactions. It is shown that two binary reactions give rise to a ternary reaction with a state-dependent reaction coefficient. Moreover, we show that a reaction-diffusion equation with a thin membrane-like layer convergences to a transmission condition, where the formerly quadratic dissipation potential for diffusion convergences to a cosh-type dissipation potential for the transmission in the membrane limit.},

Pures Appl. 84 , 509–579 (2005)] determined the existence and completeness of the wave operators, and Itakura [J. Math.

If the decay power of the external potential V is less than −(1 − α /2), V is included in the short-range class. If the decay power is greater than or equal to −(1 − α /2), V is included in the long-range class. In this study, we first prove the new propagation estimates for the time propagator that can be applied to scattering theory. Second, we prove that the wave operators do not exist if the power is greater than or equal to −(1 − α /2) and that the threshold expectation of −(1 − α /2) is true using the new propagation estimates.},

To address this issue, a method called “regularization” was introduced in the 1960s and 1970s. While there are several versions of this scheme, the one developed by Ligon and Schaaf [Rep. Math. Phys. 9 , 281–300 (1976)] is often preferred due to its global nature and lack of time reparameterization requirement. In this article, we present a new regularization method that is both global and requires no time reparameterization, while also exhibiting a higher degree of symmetry. Our method emphasizes symmetries over spaces and exhibits a duality similar to the compact-noncompact duality observed in symmetric spaces.},

It follows, for example, that for any pair D + and D − of non-empty compact metric spaces there is a flow σ = ( σ t ) t ∈ R on the CAR algebra whose set of KMS ∞ states is homeomorphic to D + while the set of KMS ∞ states for the inverted flow ( σ − t ) t ∈ R is homeomorphic to D − . Remarkably the flows that realize all such pairs D ± can be chosen to have isomorphic KMS bundles.},

To prove this result, we establish uniform energy estimates and various dissipation estimates with respect to the Debye length and the time. These estimates allow to pass to the limit to obtain the limit system by compactness arguments. In addition, the global convergence rate is obtained by use of stream function technique.},

In particular, this allows us to show that families of sectors of domains of revolution with analytic boundary, and thin cylinders satisfy Pólya’s conjecture, for instance.

The original construction was for Friedmann–Lemaître geometries and is here generalized to anisotropic Bianchi I geometries relevant to primordial cosmology. In addition to proving the Hadamard property, systematic series expansions in the infrared and ultraviolet are developed. The infrared expansion is convergent and induces in the massless case a leading spatial long distance decay that is always Minkowski-like but anisotropy modulated. The ultraviolet expansion is shown to be equivalent to the Hadamard property, and a non-recursive formula for its coefficients is presented.},

Homogeneous spacetimes (infinitesimally, Klein pairs) associated with these possible kinematics can be partitioned into four families—riemannian, lorentzian, galilean, and carrollian—based on the type of invariant metric structure they admit. In this work, we classify possible ambient kinematics—defined as extensions of kinematical algebras by a scalar ideal—as well as their associated Klein pairs. Kinematical Klein pairs arising as quotient space along the extra scalar ideal are said to admit a lift into the corresponding ambient Klein pair. While all non-galilean Klein pairs admit a unique—trivial and torsionfree—higher-dimensional lift, galilean Klein pairs are constructively shown to admit lifts into two distinct families of ambient Klein pairs. The first family includes the bargmann algebra as well as its curved/torsional avatars while the second family is novel and generically allows lifts into torsional ambient spaces. We further comment on the relation between these two families and the maximally symmetric family of leibnizian Klein pairs.},

  abstract     = {We discuss the interconnections between basic correlation measures of a bipartite quantum state and basic information characteristics of a quantum channel, focusing on the benefits of these interconnections for solving specific problems concerning the characteristics of both types. We describe properties of the (unoptimized and optimized) quantum discord in infinite-dimensional bipartite systems. In particular, using the generalized Koashi–Winter relation, a simple condition is obtained that guarantees that a state with zero quantum discord is quantum-classical. Two possible definitions of the quantum discord for states with infinite one-way classical correlation are proposed and analysed. The generalized versions of Koashi–Winter and Xi–Lu–Wang–Li relations are used to obtain advanced continuity bounds for the Holevo information at the outputs of a channel and its complementary channel (as functions of a channel for a given ensemble of input states), for the Holevo capacity and the unregularized private capacity of a quantum channel depending either on the input dimension or on the input energy bound. We also discuss the properties of quantum channels which are “doppelgangers” of the monotonicity of the quantum discord and the entropy reduction of a local measurement under quantum channels acting on an unmeasured subsystem.},

Hence, it is crucial to understand how these defects interact with external defects such as boundaries or domain walls. Motivated by this line of thought, in this work, we study the fusion events between anyons in the bulk and at the boundary in fixed-point models of 2 + 1-dimensional non-chiral topological order defined by arbitrary fusion categories. Our construction uses generalized tube algebra techniques to construct a bi-representation of bulk and boundary defects. We explicitly derive a formula to calculate the fusion multiplicities of a bulk-to-boundary fusion event for twisted quantum double models and calculate some exemplary fusion events for Abelian models and the (twisted) quantum double model of S 3 , the simplest non-Abelian group-theoretical model. Moreover, we use the folding trick to study the anyonic behavior at non-trivial domain walls between twisted S 3 and twisted Z 2 as well as Z 3 models. A recurring theme in our construction is an isomorphism relating twisted cohomology groups to untwisted ones. The results of this work can directly be applied to study logical operators in two-dimensional topological error correcting codes with boundaries described by a twisted gauge theory of a finite group.},

The proof is based on the decomposition of a general three-dimensional rotation in terms of elementary planar rotations and a transition between two embeddings of sl 2 in sl 3 . The former is related to monovariate Krawtchouk polynomials and the latter, to monovariate Racah polynomials. The appearance of Racah polynomials in this context is algebraically explained by showing that the two sl 2 Casimir elements related to the two embeddings of sl 2 in sl 3 obey the Racah algebra relations. We also show that these two elements generate the centralizer in U ( sl 3 ) of the Cartan subalgebra and its complete algebraic description is given.},

  abstract     = {Physical experiments and numerical simulations have observed a remarkable phenomenon that a background magnetic field can smooth and stabilize the electrically conducting turbulent fluids. To understand the mechanism of this phenomenon, we will focus on a special 2D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system with no viscosity and partial magnetic resistive and examine the stability near a background magnetic field. Due to the lack of dissipation for velocity field, this stability problem is not trivial. Without the presence of a magnetic field, the fluid velocity is governed by the 2D incompressible Euler equation. And it is well known that solutions to the 2D incompressible Euler equation can grow rather rapidly. Our result in this paper then shows the stabilization effect of magnetic filed for conductive fluids. By coupling a suitable magnetic filed, we can obtain the uniform upper bound of solutions. Moreover, we will derive the exponentially decay of solutions on one direction. The approach is based on delicate energy estimate together with some observations such as Poincáre’s inequality in one direction and cancellation structure.},

The problem can be reduced to proving the existence of critical points for some indefinite functional. For this, we use a constrained minimization approach to obtain the existence of critical points. Moreover, we establish some qualitative properties of the Q-ball solution, such as monotonicity, boundedness and asymptotic behavior.},

These results are proved in the very general class of weak solutions and do not require any restriction on the initial data, other than having a finite energy.

  abstract     = {The interaction between small-scale waves and a larger-scale flow can be described by a multi-scale theory that forms the basis for a new class of parameterizations of subgrid-scale gravity waves (GW) in weather and climate models. The development of this theory is reviewed here. It applies to all interesting regimes of atmospheric stratification, i.e., also to moderately strong stratification as occurring in the middle atmosphere, and thereby extends classic assumption for the derivation of quasi-geostrophic theory. At strong wave amplitudes a fully nonlinear theory arises that is complemented by a quasilinear theory for weak GW amplitude. The latter allows the extension to a spectral description that forms the basis of numerical implementations that avoid instabilities due to caustics, e.g., from GW reflection. Conservation properties are discussed, for energy and potential vorticity, as well as conditions under which a GW impact on the larger-scale flow is possible. The numerical implementation of the theory for GW parameterizations in atmospheric models is described, and the consequences of the approach are discussed, as compared to classic GW parameterizations. Although more costly than the latter, it exhibits significantly enhanced realism, while being considerably more efficient than an approach where all relevant GWs are to be resolved. The reported theory and its implementation might be of interest also for the efficient and conceptually insightful description of other wave-mean interactions, including those where the formation of caustics presents a special challenge.},

Four distinct Skyrme crystals are found. Two of these were already known–the cubic lattice of half-skyrmions and the α -particle crystal–but two are new. These new solutions have lower energy per baryon number and less symmetry, being periodic with respect to trigonal but not cubic period lattices. Minimal energy crystals are also constructed under the constraint of constant baryon density, and it is shown that the two new non-cubic crystals tend to chain and multi-wall solutions at low densities.},

Starting from spectral problem of the TOFKN, the analyticity, symmetries, asymptotic behavior of the Jost function and scattering matrix, the matrix RH problem with ZBCs and NZBCs are constructed. Then the obtained RH problem with ZBCs and NZBCs can be solved in the case of scattering coefficients with double or triple zeros, and the reconstruction formula of potential, trace formula as well as theta condition are also derived correspondingly. Specifically, the general formulas of N -double and N -triple poles solutions with ZBCs and NZBCs are derived systematically by means of determinants. The vivid plots and dynamics analyses for double and triple-pole soliton solutions with the ZBCs as well as double and triple-pole interaction solutions with the NZBCs are exhibited in details. Compared with the most classical second-order flow Kaup-Newell system, we find the third-order dispersion and quintic nonlinear term of the Kaup-Newell system change the trajectory and velocity of solutions. Furthermore, the asymptotic states of the 1-double poles soliton solution and the 1-triple poles soliton solution are analyzed when t tends to infinity.},

Also we investigate the relations among these new Darboux transformation operators.

  abstract     = {We introduce probability thermodynamics and probability quantum fields. By probability we mean that there is an unknown operator, physical or nonphysical, whose eigenvalues obey a certain statistical distribution. Eigenvalue spectra define spectral functions. Various thermodynamic quantities in thermodynamics and effective actions in quantum field theory are all spectral functions. In the scheme, eigenvalues obey a probability distribution, so a probability distribution determines a family of spectral functions in thermodynamics and quantum field theory. This leads to probability thermodynamics and probability quantum fields determined by a probability distribution. In constructing spectral functions, we encounter a problem. The conventional definition of spectral functions applies only to lower bounded spectra. In our scheme, however, there are two types of spectra: lower bounded spectra, corresponding to the probability distribution with nonnegative random variables, and the lower unbounded spectra, corresponding to probability distributions with negative random variables. To take the lower unbounded spectra into account, we generalize the definition of spectral functions by analytical continuation. In some cases, we encounter divergences. We remove the divergence by a renormalization procedure. In virtue of spectral theory in physics, we generalize some concepts in probability theory. For example, the moment-generating function in probability theory does not always exist. We redefine the moment-generating function as the generalized heat kernel introduced in this paper, which makes the concept definable when the definition in probability theory fails. We construct examples corresponding to some probability distributions. Thermodynamic quantities, vacuum amplitudes, one-loop effective actions, and vacuum energies for various probability distributions are presented.},

  abstract     = {We investigate variants of the Asakura–Oosawa (AO) model for colloid-polymer mixtures, represented by hard classical particles interacting via their excluded volume. The interaction between the polymers is neglected but the colloid-polymer and colloid-colloid interactions are present and can be condensed into an effective depletion interaction among the colloids alone. The original AO model involves hard spherical particles in three spatial dimensions with colloidal radii R and the so-called depletion radius δ of the polymers, such that the minimum possible center-to-center distance between polymers and colloids allowed by the excluded-volume constraints is R + δ . It is common knowledge among physicists that there are only pairwise effective depletion interactions between the colloids if the geometric condition δ / R &lt; 2 / 3 − 1 is fulfilled. In this case, triplet and higher-order many body interactions are vanishing and the equilibrium statistics of the binary mixture can exactly be mapped onto that of an effective one-component system with the effective depletion pair-potential. Here we rigorously prove that the criterion δ / R &lt; 2 / 3 − 1 is both sufficient and necessary to guarantee the absence of triplet and higher-order many body interactions among the colloids. For an external hard wall confining the system, we also include a criterion which guarantees that the system can be exactly mapped onto one with effective external one-body interactions. Our general formulation also accounts for polydisperse mixtures and anisotropic shapes of colloids in any spatial dimension. In those cases where the resulting condition is only sufficient, we further demonstrate how to specify improved bounds.},

A space-time description of the classical solution is given when the initial perturbation is suitable small. The result implies that all of the unknowns obey the generalized Huygens’ principle as the classical compressible Navier-Stokes equations in Liu and Wang [Commun. Math. Phys. 196 , 145–173 (1998)]. Additionally, we show that the decay of the flux q is faster than the other unknowns.},

Following this idea, we give a physically natural definition of cloning in the context of classical mechanics using symplectic geometry, building on work of A. Fenyes, J. Math. Phys. 53 , 012902 (2012). We observe, following Fenyes, any system with phase space ( R 2 N , d x i ∧ d y i ) can be cloned in our definition. However, we show that if ( M , ω ) can be cloned in our definition, then M must be contractible. For instance, this shows the simple pendulum cannot be cloned in Hamiltonian mechanics. We further formulate a robust notion of approximate cloning, and show that if ( M , ω ) can be approximately cloned, then M is contractible. We give interpretations of our results and in some special cases reconcile our no cloning theorems with the general experience that classical information is clonable. Finally we point to new directions of research, including a connection of our result with the classical measurement problem.},

On the other hand, one needs to renormalise the charges for the conformally-covariant scalar field when the cosmological constant does not vanish. In both cases well-defined renormalised charges, with well-defined fluxes, are obtained. Again surprisingly, a Hamiltonian analysis of a suitably rescaled scalar field leads to finite charges, without the need to renormalise.

  abstract     = {We study the behavior of a quantum particle trapped in a confining potential in one dimension under multiple sudden changes of velocity and/or acceleration. We develop the appropriate formalism to deal with such situation and we use it to calculate the probability of transition for simple problems such as the particle in an infinite box and the simple harmonic oscillator. For the infinite box of length L under two and three sudden changes of velocity, where the initial and final velocity vanish, we find that the system undergoes quantum revivals for Δ t = τ 0 ≡ 4 m L 2 π ℏ ⁠ , regardless of other parameters (Δ t is the time elapsed between the first and last change of velocity). For the simple harmonic oscillator we find that the states obtained by suddenly changing (one change) the velocity and/or the acceleration of the potential, for a particle initially in an eigenstate of the static potential, are coherent states. For multiple changes of acceleration or velocity we find that the quantum expectation value of the Hamiltonian is remarkably close (possibly identical) to the corresponding classical expectation values. Finally, the probability of transition for a particle in an accelerating harmonic oscillator (no sudden changes) calculated with our formalism agrees with the formula derived long time ago by Ludwig [Z. Phys. 130 (4), 468–475 (1951)], and recently modified by Dodonov [J. Russ. Laser Res. 42 (3), 243–249 (2021)], but with a different expression for the dimensionless parameter γ . Our probability agrees with the one of Dodonov for γ ≪ 1 but is not periodic in time (it decays monotonously), contrary to the result derived by Dodonov.},

  abstract     = {Cubic blocks are studied assembled from linear operators R acting in the tensor product of d linear “spin” spaces. Such operator is associated with a linear transformation A in a vector space over a field F of a finite characteristic p , like “permutation-type” operators studied by Hietarinta [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 30 , 4757–4771 (1997)]. One small difference is that we do not require A and, consequently, R to be invertible; more importantly, no relations on R are required of the type of Yang–Baxter or its higher analogues. It is shown that, in d = 3 dimensions, a p n × p n × p n block decomposes into the tensor product of operators similar to the initial R ⁠ . One generalization of this involves commutative algebras over F and allows to obtain, in particular, results about spin configurations determined by a four -dimensional R ⁠ . Another generalization deals with introducing Boltzmann weights for spin configurations; it turns out that there exists a non-trivial self-similarity involving Boltzmann weights as well.},

This case—similar to the integrable case of the complex Kirchhoff model of Skrypnyk, J. Geom. Phys. 172 , 104418 (2022)—yields a direct analog of the famous Weber–Neumann separated coordinates. The obtained separation curves and Abel-type equations for the constructed model can be viewed as trigonometric degenerations of the corresponding separation curves and Abel-type equations of the Clebsch model [F.

First, we will deduce a family of critical systems consisting of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, indexed by the exponent p ∈ (1, ∞ ) of the Lebesgue spaces concerned. These systems can be used to obtain the optimal lower or upper bounds for eigenvalue gaps of Sturm–Liouville operators and are equivalent to non-convex Hamiltonian systems of two degrees of freedom. Second, with appropriate choices of exponents p , the critical systems are polynomial systems in four dimensions. These systems will be investigated from two aspects. The first one is that by applying the canonical transformation and the Darboux polynomial, we obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for polynomial integrability of these polynomial critical systems. As a special example, we conclude that the system with p = 2 is polynomial completely integrable in the sense of Liouville. The second is that the linear stability of isolated singular points is characterized. By performing the Poincaré cross section technique, we observe that the systems have very rich dynamical behaviors, including periodic trajectories, quasi-periodic trajectories, and chaos.},

The results are presented in a new series of papers considering in turn the same three anisotropic pressure cases, as well as a perfect fluid source. Here, the perfect fluid case is considered, and different classes are identified as directly issuing from the field equations.

Once an eigenvalue of the electronic Hamiltonian is chosen, vibrational-electronic interaction is introduced through covariant differential operators acting on sections of the eigen-line bundle associated with the chosen eigenvalue. The Hamiltonian for nuclear motion coupled with electronic state is then described in terms of these covariant differential operators together with the chosen eigenvalue as a potential for nuclear motion. The eigenvalues of the nuclear Hamiltonian are evaluated for bound states. In the case that vibrational-electronic interaction is restricted to small vibrational-electronic one around a symmetric configuration of the nuclei, a remark is made on a relation to a well-known Hamiltonian describing the dynamic Jahn–Teller effect for a planar tri-atomic molecule X 3 .},

The momentum and position operators of individual particles do not exist in such representations, which explains the uncertainty principle in these cases. However, there are still one-to-one correspondences between the local Weyl operators associated with individual particles. The local observable algebras of individual particles are Type II 1 von Neumann algebras and have numerous projection operators. The states obtained by applying local projection operations to the EPR states have perfect correlations between local subalgebras. Bell’s inequality is maximally violated by these states. The lack of atomic projections of Type II 1 von Neumann algebras implies that the EPR states cannot be disentangled by local projection operations.},

We show that the hyperspherical symmetry (i.e., the multidimensional spherical symmetry) of the potential allows Cramér–Rao, Fisher–Shannon, and Lopez-Ruiz, Mancini, Calbet–Rényi complexity measures to be expressed in terms of the space dimensionality and the hyperangular quantum numbers of the electron state. Upper bounds, mutual complexity relationships, and complexity-based uncertainty relations of position–momentum type are also found by means of the electronic hyperangular quantum numbers and, at times, the Heisenberg–Kennard relation.

We first recall what is Anderson localization from both physical and mathematical points of view. From the Anderson–Bernoulli conjecture in dimension 2, we justify the introduction of quasi-one-dimensional models. Then, we present different types of these models: the Schrödinger type in the discrete and continuous cases, the unitary type, the Dirac type, and the point interaction type. We present tools coming from the study of dynamical systems in dimension one: the transfer matrix formalism, the Lyapunov exponents, and the Furstenberg group. We then prove a criterion of localization for quasi-one-dimensional models of Schrödinger type involving only geometric and algebraic properties of the Furstenberg group. Then, we review results of localization, first for Schrödinger-type models and then for unitary type models. Each time, we reduce the question of localization to the study of the Furstenberg group and show how to use more and more refined algebraic criteria to prove the needed properties of this group. All the presented results for quasi-one-dimensional models of Schrödinger type include the case of Bernoulli randomness.},

This problem is related to single-user multiple-input multiple-output systems in information theory.

  abstract     = {The Hamiltonian approach to isomonodromic deformation systems is extended to include generic rational covariant derivative operators on the Riemann sphere with irregular singularities of arbitrary Poincaré rank. The space of rational connections with given pole degrees carries a natural Poisson structure corresponding to the standard classical rational R-matrix structure on the dual space L * g l ( r ) of the loop algebra L g l ( r ) ⁠ . Nonautonomous isomonodromic counterparts of isospectral systems generated by spectral invariants are obtained by identifying deformation parameters as Casimir elements on the phase space. These are shown to coincide with higher Birkhoff invariants determining local asymptotics near to irregular singular points, together with the pole loci. Pairs consisting of Birkhoff invariants, together with the corresponding dual spectral invariant Hamiltonians, appear as “mirror images” matching, at each pole, the negative power coefficients in the principal part of the Laurent expansion of the fundamental meromorphic differential on the associated spectral curve with the corresponding positive power terms in the analytic part. Infinitesimal isomonodromic deformations are shown to be generated by the sum of the Hamiltonian vector field and an explicit derivative vector field that is transversal to the symplectic foliation. The Casimir elements serve as coordinates complementing those along the symplectic leaves, defining a local symplectomorphism between them. The explicit derivative vector fields preserve the Poisson structure and define a flat transversal connection , spanning an integrable distribution whose leaves may be identified as the orbits of a free Abelian local group action. The projection of infinitesimal isomonodromic deformation vector fields to the quotient manifold under this action gives commuting Hamiltonian vector fields corresponding to the spectral invariants dual to the Birkhoff invariants and the pole loci.},

The weight w Lag ( z ) has been widely investigated in multiple-input multi-output antenna wireless communication systems in information theory. Based on the ladder operator method, two auxiliary quantities, R n ( t ) and r n ( t ), which are related to the three-term recurrence coefficients β n ( t ), are defined, and we show that they satisfy coupled Riccati equations. This turns to be a particular Painlevé V ( P V , for short), i.e., P V λ 2 2 , − ( 1 − ( − 1 ) n α ) 2 8 , − 2 n + α + 2 λ + 1 2 , − 1 2 ⁠ .

The difference and differential equations satisfied by σ n ( t ), as well as an alternative integral representation of D n ( t ), are obtained. The asymptotics of the Hankel determinant under a suitable double scaling, i.e., n → ∞ and t → 0 such that s ≔ 4 nt is fixed, are established. Finally, by using the second order difference equation satisfied by the recurrence coefficients, we obtain the large n full asymptotic expansions of β n ( t ) with the aid of Dyson’s Coulomb fluid approach. By employing these results, the second differential equations satisfied by the orthogonal polynomials will be reduced to a confluent Heun equation.},

  abstract     = {In 1878, Hill found numerically, in his limiting case of the restricted three-body problem, the so-called Hill’s lunar problem, a planar direct periodic orbit with a period of one synodic month. By virtue of the spatial system’s invariance under a symplectic involution, whose fixed point set corresponds to the planar problem, we can assign to Hill’s orbit planar and spatial Floquet multipliers and planar and spatial Conley–Zehnder indices. We show that these have deep astronomical significance because, on the one hand, we relate the anomalistic month to the planar Floquet multipliers and the planar Conley–Zehnder index. On the other hand, we relate the draconitic month to the spatial Floquet multipliers and the spatial Conley–Zehnder index. Knowledge of this lunar month dates back to the Babylonians, who lived until around 500 BCE. In order to determine the indices, we analyze analytically the bifurcation procedure of the fundamental families of planar direct and retrograde periodic orbits (traditionally known as families g and f ) from the rotating Kepler problem for very low energies.},

Continuing from our previous results, we study various modified theories of gravity following the Palatini approach. The metric and the connection will be treated as independent variables leading to generalized theories, which may contain torsion or non-metricity or both. Due to our particular approach involving the Einstein action, our setup allows us to formulate a substantial number of new theories not previously studied. Our results can be linked back to well-known models, such as Einstein–Cartan theory and metric-affine theories, and also links to many recently studied modified gravity models. In particular, we propose an Einstein–Cartan type modified theory of gravity, which contains propagating torsion, provided our function depends non-linearly on a boundary term. We also can state precise conditions for the existence of propagating torsion. Our work concludes with a brief discussion of cosmology and the role of cosmological torsion in our model. We find solutions with early-time inflation and late-time matter dominated behavior. No matter sources are required to drive inflation, and it becomes a purely geometrical effect.},

Assuming a certain regularity condition on the initial data ensuring that the field extends analytically to critical sets, it is shown that the NP constants at future I + and past null infinity I − are independent of each other. In other words, the classical NP constants at I ± stem from different parts of the initial data given on a Cauchy hypersurface. In contrast, it is shown that, using a slight generalization of the classical NP constants, the associated quantities ( i 0 -cylinder NP constants) do not require the regularity condition being satisfied and give rise to conserved quantities at I ± that are determined by the same piece of initial data, which, in turn, correspond to the terms controlling the regularity of the field. Additionally, it is shown how the conservation laws associated with the NP constants can be exploited to construct, in flat space, heuristic asymptotic-system expansions, which are sensitive to the logarithmic terms at the critical sets.},

  abstract     = {In Schwarzschild spacetime, time-like geodesic equations, which define particle orbits, have a well-known formulation as a dynamical system in coordinates adapted to the time-like hypersurface containing the geodesic. For equatorial geodesics, the resulting dynamical system is shown to possess a conserved angular quantity and two conserved temporal quantities, whose properties and physical meaning are analogs of the conserved Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector, and its variant known as Hamilton’s vector, in Newtonian gravity. When a particle orbit is projected into the spatial equatorial plane, the angular quantity yields the coordinate angle at which the orbit has either a turning point (where the radial velocity is zero) or a centripetal point (where the radial acceleration is zero). This is the same property as the angle of the respective Laplace–Runge–Lenz and Hamilton vectors in the plane of motion in Newtonian gravity. The temporal quantities yield the coordinate time and the proper time at which those points are reached on the orbit. In general, for orbits that have a single turning point, the three quantities are globally constant, and for orbits that possess more than one turning point, the temporal quantities are just locally constant as they jump at every successive turning point, while the angular quantity similarly jumps only if an orbit is precessing. This is analogous to the properties of a generalized Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector and generalized Hamilton vector which are known to exist for precessing orbits in post-Newtonian gravity. The angular conserved quantity is used to define a direct analog of these vectors at spatial infinity.},

This effect is analogous to the well-known van der Waals interaction between neutral atoms or molecules. We prove that the interaction energy W of the system is given by W ( r , v ) = − C ( v ) r − 3 + O ( r − 4 ) ⁠ , where r is the distance between the molecule and the plate and v indicates their relative orientation. Moreover, C ( v ) is positive and continuous, thus the atom or molecule is always pulled toward the plate at sufficiently large distances, for all relative orientations v . For some specific systems, we provide sharper estimates of W ( r , v ). This asymptotic behavior is well known in the physics literature; however, we are not aware of any previous rigorous results, even on the existence of a ground state of the system. For pedagogical reasons, we often start with the case of a hydrogen atom and then we generalize the arguments to deal with a general molecule.},

First, in the context of the Landau problem, we obtain an explicit expression for the gauge transformation that connects the Landau and the symmetric gauge in noncommutative space. This lead us to conclude that the usual form of the symmetric gauge A ⃗ = − β 2 Y ̂ , β 2 X ̂ ⁠ , in which the constant β is interpreted as the magnetic field, is not true in noncommutative space. We also be able to establish a precise definition of β as a function of the magnetic field, for which the equivalence between the symmetric and Landau gauges is held in noncommutative plane. Using the symmetric gauge, we obtain results for the spectrum of the quantum Hall system, its transverse conductivity in the presence of an electric field, and other static observables. These results amend the literature on quantum Hall effect in the noncommutative plane in which the incorrect form of the symmetric gauge, in noncommutative space, is assumed. We also study the non-equilibrium dynamics of simple observables for this system. On the other hand, we study the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator in non-commutative space and show that, in general, it exhibits quasi-periodic behavior, in striking contrast with its commutative version. The study of dynamics reveals itself as a most powerful tool to characterize and understand the effects of non-commutativity.},

Localization occurs at arbitrarily weak disorder, provided it is sufficiently random. If furthermore the hopping probability measures are properly tuned so that the zero energy Lyapunov spectrum does not contain zero, then the system exhibits localization also at that energy, which is of relevance for topological insulators. The method also applies to the usual Anderson model on the strip.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns the existence of transonic shocks for steady exothermically reacting Euler flows in an almost flat nozzle with the small rate of the exothermic reaction. One of the key points is to quantitatively determine the position of the shock front in the nozzle. We focus on contributions of the perturbation of the flat nozzle and the exothermic reaction in determining the position of the shock front by comparing the orders of σ and κ , where σ represents the scale of the perturbation of the flat nozzle and κ represents the rate of the exothermic reaction. To this end, a free boundary problem for the linearized reacting Euler system is proposed to catch an approximating position of the shock front and the associated approximating shock solution, with which the existence of a shock solution close to it can be established via a nonlinear iteration scheme. One of the key steps is to solve the nonlinear equation derived from the solvability condition for the elliptic sub-problem in the domain of the subsonic flow behind the shock front, which determines the free boundary of the proposed problem. Four typical cases are analyzed, which describe possible interactions between the geometry of the nozzle boundary and the exothermic reaction. The results also manifest that the exothermic reaction has a stabilization effect on transonic shocks in the nozzles.},

Examples of smooth solutions foliated by toroidal surfaces that are not invariant under continuous Euclidean isometries are also constructed explicitly, and they are identified as equilibria of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics. The problem examined here represents a weaker version of a fundamental mathematical problem that arises in the context of magnetohydrodynamics and fluid mechanics concerning the existence of regular equilibrium magnetic fields and steady Euler flows in bounded domains without continuous Euclidean isometries. The existence of such configurations represents a key theoretical issue for the design of the confining magnetic field in nuclear fusion reactors known as stellarators.},

Since the study of time-frequency analysis is both theoretically interesting and practically useful, in this article, we investigated several subjects of time-frequency analysis for the ( k , a )-generalized wavelet transform. First, we analyze the concentration of this transform on sets of finite measure. In particular, we prove Donoho–Stark and Benedicks-type uncertainty principles. We prove several versions of Heisenberg-type uncertainty principles for this transformation. Furthermore, involving the reproducing kernel and spectral theories, we investigate the time frequency and study the scalogram for the same wavelet transform.

  abstract     = {Using a Hilbert space framework inspired by the methods of orthogonal projections and Hodge decompositions, we study a general class of problems (called Z -problems) that arise in effective media theory, especially within the theory of composites, for defining the effective operator. A new and unified approach is developed, based on block operator methods, for obtaining solutions of the Z -problem, formulas for the effective operator in terms of the Schur complement, and associated variational principles (e.g., the Dirichlet and Thomson minimization principles) that lead to upper and lower bounds on the effective operator. In the case of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, this allows for a relaxation of the standard hypotheses on positivity and invertibility for the classes of operators usually considered in such problems by replacing inverses with the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse. As we develop the theory, we show how it applies to the classical example from the theory of composites on the effective conductivity in the periodic conductivity problem in the continuum (2 d and 3 d ) under the standard hypotheses. After that, we consider the following three important and diverse examples (increasing in complexity) of discrete electrical network problems in which our theory applies under the relaxed hypotheses. First, an operator-theoretic reformulation of the discrete Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map for an electrical network on a finite linear graph is given and used to relate the DtN map to the effective operator of an associated Z -problem. Second, we show how the classical effective conductivity of an electrical network on a finite linear graph is essentially the effective operator of an associated Z -problem. Finally, we consider electrical networks on periodic linear graphs and develop a discrete analog to the classical example of the periodic conductivity equation and effective conductivity in the continuum.},

To illustrate this concept, we provide five examples of b -semitoric systems by modifying the coupled spin oscillator and the coupled angular momenta, and we also classify their singular points.

We show that even if it is satisfied, in two cases (Nariai and ultracold-II), by direct calculation, they actually cannot exist. In both cases, the Klein paradox occurs without restriction on the parameters. In the third case, the condition for their existence is shown to coincide with the condition, allowing the quantum discharge phenomenon associated with the Klein paradox. We also clarify the role of “classical potentials,” which appear in the physical literature on the subject, giving rise to the so-called level-crossing appearing in semiclassical calculations, and we comment on problems occurring in quantum field theory in the presence of complex eigenvalues.},

  abstract     = {It is a fundamental but difficult problem to characterize the set of correlations that can be obtained by performing measurements on quantum mechanical systems. The problem is particularly challenging when the preparation procedure for quantum states is assumed to comply with a given causal structure . Recently, a first completeness result for this quantum causal compatibility problem has been given based on the so-called quantum inflation technique . However, completeness was achieved by imposing additional technical constraints, such as an upper bound on the Schmidt rank of the observables. Here, we show that these complications are unnecessary in the quantum bilocal scenario , a much-studied abstract model of entanglement swapping experiments. We prove that the quantum inflation hierarchy is complete for the bilocal scenario in the commuting observable model of locality. We also give a bilocal version of an observation by Tsirelson, namely, in finite dimensions, the commuting observable model and the tensor product model of locality coincide. These results answer questions recently posed by Renou and Xu [arXiv:2210.09065v2 (2022)]. Finally, we point out that our techniques can be interpreted more generally as giving rise to a semidefinite programming hierarchy that is complete for the problem of optimizing polynomial functions in the states of operator algebras defined by generators and relations. The completeness of this polarization hierarchy follows from a quantum de Finetti theorem for states on maximal C *-tensor products.},

If the magnetic field is not taken into consideration the system is reduced to Euler-like equations with an extra Riesz transform-type term. The global well-posedness of Euler-like equations remains an open problem in the whole plane R 2 ⁠ . When coupled with the magnetic field, the global well-posedness and the stability for the MHD system in R 2 have yet to be settled too. This paper here focuses on the space domain T × R ⁠ , with T being a 1D periodic box. We establish the global well-posedness of the 2D anisotropic MHD system. In addition, the algebraic decay rate in the H 2 -setting has also been obtained. We solve this by decomposing the physical quantity into the horizontal average and its corresponding oscillation portion, establishing strong Poincaré-type inequalities and some anisotropic inequalities and combining the symmetry conditions imposed on the initial data.},

  abstract     = {The aim of the present work is to generalize the results given in Osorio Morales and Santillán [Eur. Phys. J. C 82 , 353 (2022)] to a generic situation for causal geodesics. It is argued that these results may be of interest for causality issues. Recall that the presence of superluminal signals in a generic space time ( M , g μν ) does not necessarily imply violations of the principle of causality {[G. M. Shore, Nucl. Phys. B 778 , 219 (2007)] and [T. J. Hollowood and G. M. Shore, Phys. Lett. B 655 , 67 (2007)]}. In flat spaces, global Lorenz invariance leads to the conclusion that closed time-like curves appear if these signals are present. In a curved space instead, there is only local Poincare invariance, and the presence of closed causal curves may be avoided even in the presence of a superluminal mode, especially when terms violating the strong equivalence principle appear in the action. This implies that the standard analytic properties of the spectral components of these functions are therefore modified, and in particular, the refraction index n ( ω ) is not analytic in the upper complex ω plane. The emergence of these singularities may also take place for non-superluminal signals due to the breaking of global Lorenz invariance in a generic space time. In the present work, it is argued that the homotopy properties of the Maslov index are useful for studying how the singularities of n ( ω ) vary when moving along a geodesic congruence. In addition, several conclusions obtained in Shore [Nucl. Phys. B 778 , 219 (2007)] and Hollowood and Shore [Phys. Lett. B 655 , 67 (2007)] are based on the Penrose limit along a null geodesic, and they are restricted to GR with matter satisfying strong energy conditions. The use of the Maslov index may allow a more intrinsic description of singularities, not relying on that limit, and a generalization of these results about non-analyticity to generic gravity models with general matter content.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop an asymptotic-preserving and energy-conserving (APEC) Particle-In-Cell (PIC) algorithm for the Vlasov–Maxwell system. This algorithm not only guarantees that the asymptotic limiting of the discrete scheme is a consistent and stable discretization of the quasi-neutral limit of the continuous model but also preserves Gauss’s law and energy conservation at the same time; therefore, it is promising to provide stable simulations of complex plasma systems even in the quasi-neutral regime. The key ingredients for achieving these properties include the generalization of Ohm’s law for electric fields such that asymptotic-preserving discretization can be achieved and a proper decomposition of the effects of the electromagnetic fields such that a Lagrange multiplier method can be appropriately employed for correcting the kinetic energy. We investigate the performance of the APEC method with three benchmark tests in one dimension, including the linear Landau damping, the bump-on-tail problem, and the two-stream instability. Detailed comparisons are conducted by including the results from the classical explicit leapfrog and the previously developed asymptotic-preserving PIC schemes. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed APEC scheme can give accurate and stable simulations of both kinetic and quasi-neutral regimes, demonstrating the attractive properties of the method across scales.},

  abstract     = {We develop the theory of causal radiation Green functions on hyperbolic and hyperspherical spaces using a constructive approach based on generalized Mehler–Fock transforms. This approach focuses for H R d on the kernel of the transformation expressed in terms of hyperbolic angles θ with 0 ≤ θ &lt; ∞ . The kernel provides an explicit representation for the generalized delta distribution, which acts as the source term for the radiation, and allows for an easy implementation of the causality or retardation condition and determination of the Green function. We obtain the corresponding kernel distribution on S R d by analytic continuation of the kernel distribution of an appropriate Helmholtz equation on H R d and then show that this construction leads to the proper retarded Green function for the wave equation. That result is then used to establish the validity of a new generalized Mehler–Fock transformation for 0 ≤ θ &lt; π . The present results clarify and extend those obtained recently by Cohl et al. [SIGMA 14 , 136 (2018)].},

This is achieved by explicitly computing the partition function of a zero-dimensional boson–fermion system with four interactions. The distributions are expressed by combinations of polynomial, exponential, and error functions as results of feasible complicated bosonic integrals that appear after fermionic integrations. By extrapolating the expressions and also using a previous result, we guess a large- N expression. The expressions are compared with Monte Carlo simulations, and precise agreement and good agreement are obtained with the exact and the large- N expressions, respectively. Understanding the feasibility of the integration is left for future study, which would provide a general- N analytic formula.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the possible emergence of traveling waves within an evolving interstellar gas cloud. To model this evolution, we use Euler–Poisson equations with the additional assumptions that the gas is incompressible, stratified, and self-gravitating. Within this framework, we establish that when the cloud has low density, the speed of these traveling waves is low. We suggest that the self-gravitational coalescence of embedded solid matter in the gas to form larger aggregates, such as cometary nuclei, may occur in the vicinity of wave crests where the mass density is highest. This idea is consistent with the widely agreed mechanism for planetary formation in proto-planetary disks, namely, that the accumulation of solids to form larger planetoids is initiated at the location of pressure maxima in the gas disk.},

In addition, for the results that have smaller l ’s, their amplitudes are larger when the asymptotic character of | R nl ( t , r * ⁠ )| clearly appears. Finally, the farther away an observer is set, the fewer oscillations are perceived; however, from our particular fixed set of parameters, the best spot to observe the wiggles of the emitted spacetime waves is close to r * ≃ α .},

Many of the bosonic backgrounds presented here are induced by various types of null flux forms on products of certain totally Ricci-isotropic Lorentzian Walker manifolds and Ricci-flat Riemannian manifolds. These constructions provide an analogy of the work performed by Chrysikos and Galaev [Classical Quantum Gravity 37 , 125004 (2020)], who made similar computations for decomposable (6, 5)-solutions. We also present bosonic backgrounds that are products of Lorentzian Einstein manifolds with a negative Einstein constant (in the “mostly plus” convention) and Riemannian Kähler–Einstein manifolds with a positive Einstein constant. This conclusion generalizes a result of Pope and van Nieuwenhuizen [Commun. Math.

In this setting, we construct infinitely many non-symmetric decomposable (5, 6)-supergravity backgrounds by using the infinitely many Lorentzian Einstein–Sasakian structures with a negative Einstein constant on the 5-sphere, known from the work of Boyer et al.

Lett. 114 , 010601 (2015)], they were so far not addressed in the growing literature on superintegrability. Here, we venture into this field by searching for additional first-order integrals of motion to the integrable systems of cylindrical type. We find that already known systems can be extended into this realm by admitting complex coupling constants. In addition to them, we find one new system whose integrals of motion also feature complex constants. All these systems are multiseparable. Rigorous mathematical analysis of these systems is challenging due to the non-Hermitian setting and lost gauge invariance. We proceed formally and pose the resolution of these problems as an open challenge.},

We introduce a method to “lift” such estimates, which have been obtained for many stationary models, to certain closely related non-stationary models.

We establish the time-asymptotic nonlinear stability of a planar rarefaction wave to the initial value problem of a three-dimensional full compressible Navier–Stokes–Poisson equation when the initial data are a small perturbation of the planar rarefaction wave. The proof is given by a delicate energy method, which involves highly non-trivial a priori bounds due to the effect of the self-consistent electric field. This appears as the first result on the nonlinear stability of wave patterns to the full compressible Navier–Stokes–Poisson system in multi-dimensions.},

Trans. R. Soc., A 359 , 1375–1387 (2001), Sir Michael Atiyah introduced what is known as the Atiyah problem on configurations of points, which can be briefly described as the conjecture that the n polynomials (each defined up to a phase factor) associated geometrically to a configuration of n distinct points in R 3 are always linearly independent. The first “hard” case is for n = 4 points, for which the linear independence conjecture was proved by Eastwood and Norbury- in the article entitled “A proof of Atiyah’s conjecture on configurations of four points in Euclidean three-space,” Geom. Topol. 5 (2), 885–893 (2001). We present a new proof of Atiyah’s linear independence conjecture on configurations of four points, i.e., of Eastwood and Norbury’s theorem. Our proof consists in showing that the Gram matrix of the four polynomials associated with a configuration of four points in Euclidean 3-space is always positive definite. It makes use of 2-spinor calculus and the theory of Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices.},

We study the Mayer series of the grand canonical pressure of the system p Λ ω ( β , λ ) at inverse temperature β and fugacity λ in the presence of boundary conditions ω belonging to a very large class of locally finite particle configurations. This class of allowed boundary conditions is the basis for any probability measure on the space of locally finite particle configurations satisfying the Ruelle estimates. We show that the p Λ ω ( β , λ ) can be written as the sum of two terms. The first term, which is analytic and bounded as the fugacity λ varies in a Λ-independent and ω -independent disk, coincides with the free-boundary-condition pressure in the thermodynamic limit. The second term, analytic in a ω -dependent convergence radius, goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit. As far as we know, this is the first rigorous analysis of the behavior of the Mayer series of a non-ideal gas subjected to non-free and non-periodic boundary conditions in the low-density/high-temperature regime when particles interact through a non-purely repulsive pair potential.},

Finally, for making full use of the above-mentioned abstract criteria, we consider a second order lattice system with nonstandard growth nonlinearity, and then the existence of bi-space pullback attractors and pullback exponential attractors on a time-dependent Musielak–Orlicz space is obtained. In particular, we point out that these criteria and analytical skills can be utilized to deal with other lattice systems satisfying nonstandard growth conditions.},

For the case of n = 3, by looking for the possible solutions to the fundamental identity, the condition is found to be N = K + 2, i.e., the system should have effectively one degree of freedom. Locally, it is shown that there is only one fundamental solution, up to a local change of variables, and this solution is the canonical Nambu bracket, generated by Levi–Cività tensors. These results generalize to the case of n (≥4)-linear Nambu brackets.},

  abstract     = {This article belongs to a series where the influence of anisotropic pressure on gravitational properties of rigidly rotating fluids is studied using new exact solutions of GR constructed for the purpose. For mathematical simplification, stationarity and cylindrical symmetry implying three Killing vectors are considered. Moreover, two pressure components are set to vanish in turn. In Papers I and II, the pressure is axially directed, while it is azimuthal in Paper III. In present paper (Paper IV), a radially directed pressure is considered. Since a generic differential equation, split into three parts, emerges from field equations, three different classes of solutions can be considered. Two could only be partially integrated. The other one, which is fully integrated, yields a set of solutions with a negative pressure. Physical processes where a negative pressure is encountered are depicted and give a rather solid foundation to this class of solutions. Moreover, these fully integrated solutions satisfy the axisymmetry condition, while they do not verify the so-called “regularity condition.” However, since their Kretschmann scalar does not diverge on the axis, this feature must be considered as reporting a mere coordinate singularity. Finally, the matching of these solutions to an exterior appropriate vacuum enforces other constraints on the two constant parameters defining each solution in the class. The results displayed here deserve to be interpreted in light of those depicted in the other four papers in the series.},

Essentially, such wormholes will be characterized by a central throat with anisotropic matter lining the throat that violates NEC. This, in turn, provides viable geometry for the wormhole to sustain. In 2018, Herrera [Phys. Rev. D 97, 044010 (2018)] introduced a new classification for spherically symmetric bodies called “complexity factor.” It was proposed that a spherically symmetric non-trivial geometry can be classified as complex or non-complex based on the nature of the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the stress–energy tensors with only homogeneous and isotropic matter distribution leading to null complexity. Mathematically, there was also another way of obtaining zero complexity geometry. In this context, since static traversable wormholes, by default, are characterized by anisotropic and inhomogeneous matter stress tensors, the question we answer is whether it is possible to obtain zero complexity class of wormholes supported by exotic matter.},

Such a degeneracy is known as topological degeneracy and can be usually seen under the periodic boundary condition regardless of the choice of the system sizes L 1 and L 2 in each direction. In this work, we introduce a family of extensions of the Kitaev toric code to N level spins ( N ≥ 2). The model realizes topologically ordered phases or symmetry-protected topological phases depending on the parameters in the model. The most remarkable feature of topologically ordered phases is that the ground state may be unique, depending on L 1 and L 2 , despite that the translation symmetry of the model remains unbroken. Nonetheless, the topological entanglement entropy takes the nontrivial value. We argue that this behavior originates from the nontrivial action of translations permuting anyon species.},

This comes out of the intrinsic geometry and not by assuming any quantum group in the picture. Specifically, we discover a novel “boundary effect” whereby, in order to admit a quantum Levi-Cività connection, the “metric weight” at any edge is forced to be greater pointing toward the bulk compared to toward the boundary, with the ratio given by ( i + 1) q /( i ) q at node i , where ( i ) q is a q -integer. The Christoffel symbols are also q -deformed. The limit q → 1 likewise forces the quantum Riemannian geometry of the natural numbers N to have rational metric multiples ( i + 1)/ i in the direction of increasing i . In both cases, there is a unique Ricci-scalar flat metric up to normalization. Elements of quantum field theory and quantum gravity are exhibited for n = 3 and for the continuum limit of the geometry of N ⁠ . The Laplacian for the scalar-flat metric becomes the Airy equation operator 1 x d 2 d x 2 in so far as a limit exists.

  abstract     = {The Riemann problem for the Aw-Rascle (AR) traffic flow model with a double parameter perturbation containing flux and generalized Chaplygin gas is first solved. Then, we show that the delta-shock solution of the perturbed AR model converges to that of the original AR model as the flux perturbation vanishes alone. Particularly, it is proved that as the flux perturbation and pressure decrease, the classical solution of the perturbed system involving a shock wave and a contact discontinuity will first converge to a critical delta shock wave of the perturbed system itself and only later to the delta-shock solution of the pressureless gas dynamics (PGD) model. This formation mechanism is interesting and innovative in the study of the AR model. By contrast, any solution containing a rarefaction wave and a contact discontinuity tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution of the PGD model, and the nonvacuum intermediate state in between tends to a vacuum state. Finally, some representatively numerical results consistent with the theoretical analysis are presented.},

  abstract     = {The viscous–plastic equations (VPE) of Hibler [J. Geophys. Res. 82 (27), 3932–3938 (1977)] are widely adopted and used in Earth system models to represent sea-ice drift due to surface winds, ocean currents, and internal stresses. However, it has been reported by various investigators, at least in one space dimension, that both Hibler’s original equations and their variant using a pressure replacement are ill posed in divergent flow regimes. Especially, Guba et al. [J. Phys. Oceanogr. 43 (10), 2185–2199 (2013)] shows that both variants are ill-posed when the flow divergence exceeds a minimum threshold and their results seem to extend to two dimensions when a tensile cut-off is used. In particular, Hibler uses a Heaviside function cut-off for the viscosity coefficients of the VPE’s to avoid a singularity at infinity. Lemieux et al. [J. Comput. Phys. 231 (17), 5926–5944 (2012)] regularized the Heaviside function by a hyperbolic tangent for numerical efficiency. Here, we show that, for periodic data, the linearized one-dimensional regularized VPE’s, in which the Heaviside function is replaced with a hyperbolic tangent, is well posed in the case of Hibler’s original equations. Moreover, we prove that the linearization procedure, for the regularized equations, is consistent, in the sense that the residual converges to zero that the perturbation of the solutions goes to zero, in suitable norms.},

Then, the conditions (analytic, symmetric, and asymptotic properties) needed to construct the RH problem are obtained by analyzing the spectral problem. The reflection coefficient r ( z ) with two cases appearing in the RH problem is considered, including one high-order pole and N high-order poles. In order to overcome the difficulty of establishing the residue expressions corresponding to high-order poles, we introduce the generalized residue formula. Finally, the expression of exact soliton solutions with reflectionless potential is further derived by a closed algebraic system.},

Based on this, the weak convergence of probability measures induced by mild solutions of Trotter–Kato approximation equations and the approximation error estimator are established. Finally, as an application, the classical limit theorem about the parameter dependence of this kind of equations is exhibited. To deal with the general additive diffusion term, which not only depends on the state but also depends on the probability distribution of the solution process at that time, we adopt some specific techniques of measure theory and random functional analysis.},

  abstract     = {Exploring new nonlinear wave solutions to integrable systems has always been an open issue in physics, applied mathematics, and engineering. In this paper, the Maccari system, a two-dimensional analog of nonlinear Schrödinger equation, is investigated. The system is derived from the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (KP) equation and is widely used in nonlinear optics, plasma physics, and water waves. A large family of semi-rational solutions of the Maccari system are proposed with the KP hierarchy reduction method and Hirota bilinear method. These semi-rational solutions reduce to the breathers of elastic collision and resonant collision under special parameters. In case of resonant collisions between breathers and rational waves, these semi-rational solutions describe lumps fusion into breathers, or lumps fission from breathers, or a mixture of these fusion and fission. The resonant collisions of semi-rational solutions are semi-localized in time (i.e., lumps exist only when t → +∞ or t → −∞), and we also discuss their dynamics and asymptotic behaviors.},

Similar to the well-known Kipnis–Marchioro–Presutti (KMP) model, the finite chain is coupled at its ends with two reservoirs that break the conservation of energy when working at different temperatures. At variance with KMP, the model considered here is integrable, and one can write in a closed form the n-point correlation functions of the non-equilibrium steady state. As a consequence of the exact solution one, can directly prove that the system is in “local equilibrium,” which is described at the macro-scale by a product measure. Integrability manifests itself through the description of the model via the open Heisenberg chain with non-compact spins. The algebraic formulation of the model allows us to interpret its duality relation with a purely absorbing particle system as a change of representation.},

The spin configurations of this Ising model can be mapped into the hydrogen configurations of square ice with the defined standard direction of the hydrogen bonds. Making use of the equivalence of this Ising system with the exactly solved eight-vertex model and taking the low temperature limit, we obtain the residual entropy. Two soluble cases in the zero field and one soluble case in the imaginary field are examined. In the case that the free-fermion condition holds in zero field, we find that the ground states in the low temperature limit include the configurations disobeying the ice rules. In another case in zero field where the four-spin interactions are −∞ and another case in imaginary field where the four-spin interactions are 0, the residual entropy exactly agrees with the result of square ice determined by Lieb in 1967. In the solutions to the latter two cases, we have shown alternative approaches to the residual entropy problem of square ice.},

Transmission delays are inevitable and should be incorporated into flocking modeling. In this paper, we provide sufficient frameworks for flocking to the discrete TCS model, which are formulated in terms of initial configuration, network topology, and system parameters. In our proposed frameworks, we show that the TCS model exhibits exponential flocking convergence.},

CCTWTs have numerous applications, including radar, radio navigation, space communication, television, radio repeaters, and charged particle accelerators. Microwave-generating interactions in CCTWTs take place mostly in coupled resonant cavities positioned periodically along the electron beam axis. Operational features of a CCTWT, particularly the amplification mechanism, are similar to those of a multicavity klystron. We advance here a Lagrangian field theory of CCTWTs with the space being represented by one-dimensional continuum. The theory integrates into it the space-charge effects, including the so-called debunching (electron-to-electron repulsion). The corresponding Euler–Lagrange field equations are ordinary differential equations with coefficients varying periodically in the space. Utilizing the system periodicity, we develop instrumental features of the Floquet theory, including the monodromy matrix and its Floquet multipliers. We use them to derive closed form expressions for a number of physically significant quantities. Those include, in particular, dispersion relations and the frequency dependent gain foundational to the RF signal amplification. Serpentine (folded, corrugated) traveling wave tubes are very similar to CCTWTs, and our theory applies to them also.},

Based on the occurrence of an extra degree of freedom in the equations, two general methods for constructing different classes of exact solutions to the field equations are proposed. Exemplifying such recipes, a bunch of solutions are constructed. Axisymmetry and regularity conditions on the axis are examined, and the spacetimes are properly matched to a vacuum exterior. A number of classes and subclasses are thus studied, and an analysis of their features leads to sorting out three classes whose appropriate mathematical and physical properties are discussed. This work is part of a larger study of the influence of anisotropic pressure in general relativity, using cylindrical symmetry as a simplifying assumption, and considering, in turn, each principal stress direction. It has been initiated in companion Papers I and II, where the pressure was assumed to be axially directed, and is followed by Paper IV considering radial pressure and Paper V contrasting the previous results with the corresponding dust and perfect fluid solutions.},

  abstract     = {For a given target system and apparatus described by quantum theory, the so-called quantum no-programming theorem indicates that a family of states called programs in the apparatus with a fixed unitary operation on total system programs distinct unitary dynamics to the target system only if the initial programs are orthogonal to each other. The current study aims at revealing whether a similar behavior can be observed in generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs). Generalizing the programming scheme to GPTs, we derive a similar theorem to the quantum no-programming theorem. We, furthermore, demonstrate that programming of reversible dynamics is closely related to a curious structure named a quasi-classical structure on the state space. Programming of irreversible dynamics, i.e., channels, in GPTs is also investigated.},

  abstract     = {A charged harmonic oscillator in a magnetic field, Landau problems, and an oscillator in a noncommutative space share the same mathematical structure in their Hamiltonians. We have considered a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator with arbitrarily time-dependent parameters (effective mass and frequencies), placed in an arbitrarily time-dependent magnetic field. A class of quadratic invariant operators (in the sense of Lewis and Riesenfeld) have been constructed. The invariant operators (Î) have been reduced to a simplified representative form by a linear canonical transformation [the group Sp(4,R)]. An orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space consisting of the eigenvectors of Î is obtained. In order to obtain the solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation corresponding to the system, both the geometric and dynamical phase-factors are constructed. A generalized Peres–Horodecki separability criterion (Simon’s criterion) for the ground state corresponding to our system has been demonstrated.},

We study the singular limit when the Robin parameter tends to infinity, which is equivalent to a semi-classical limit involving a small positive semi-classical parameter. The main result is a comparison between the spectrum of the Robin Laplacian with an effective operator defined on the boundary of the domain via the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. More precisely, the low-lying eigenvalue of the Robin Laplacian is approximated by those of the effective operator. When the curvature has a unique non-degenerate maximum, we estimate the spectral gap and find that the magnetic field does not contribute to the three-term expansion of the eigenvalues. In the case of the disc domains, the eigenvalue asymptotics displays the contribution of the magnetic field explicitly.},

In three-dimensional space, the free Schrödinger equation is not separable in this coordinate system. However, when we consider the equation for a particle constrained to a given surface, there are only two degrees of freedom. One has to introduce a geometrical potential to attach the particle to the surface. This well-known potential has two contributions: one from Gauss’ curvature and the other from the mean curvature. The Schrödinger equation leads to a general Heun equation. We solve it exactly and present the eigenfunctions and plots of the probability densities, and, as an application of this methodology, we study the problem of an electric charge propagating along these coordinate surfaces in the presence of a uniform magnetic field.},

In particular, we use effective field theory to study the cohomology classes of these spaces, which includes and generalizes the Berry phase. We discuss several applications for studying phase transitions. We show that a nontrivial family of gapped systems with the same topological order can protect isolated phase transitions in the phase diagram, and we argue that the phase transitions are characterized by screening of topological defects. We argue that the family of gapped systems obeys bulk-boundary correspondence. We show that a family of gapped systems in the bulk with the same topological order can rule out a family of gapped systems on the boundary with the topological order given by the topological boundary condition, constraining phase transitions on the boundary.},

At the point of tangency of the arctic curve with the domain boundary, for large-sized domains, the tiles of a certain shape form a singly interlacing set, fluctuating according to the eigenvalues of the principal minors of a Gaussian unitary ensemble-matrix. Introducing non-convexities in large domains may lead to the appearance of several interacting liquid regions: They can merely touch, leading to either a split tacnode (hard tacnode), with two distinct adjacent frozen phases descending into the tacnode, or a soft tacnode. For appropriate scaling of the non-convex domains and probing about such split tacnodes, filaments, evolving in a bricklike sea of dimers of another type, will connect the liquid patches. Nearby, the tiling fluctuations are governed by a discrete tacnode kernel—i.e., a determinantal point process on a doubly interlacing set of dots belonging to a discrete array of parallel lines. This kernel enables us to compute the joint distribution of the dots along those lines. This kernel appears in two very different models: (i) domino tilings of skew-Aztec rectangles and (ii) lozenge tilings of hexagons with cuts along opposite edges. Soft tacnodes appear when two arctic curves gently touch each other amid a bricklike sea of dimers of one type, unlike the split tacnode. We hope that this largely expository paper will provide a view on the subject and be accessible to a wider audience.},

In addition to recovering the formulas for the dust-filled flat and hyperbolic FLRW spacetimes originally derived by Klainerman and Sarnak and generalizing them to the spherical case, we obtain new formulas for the radiation-filled FLRW spacetimes and also for the de Sitter, anti-de Sitter, and Milne universes.

In teleparallel geometries, one must determine the general form of the frame and spin connection to generate a general solution admitting the desired symmetry group. Current approaches often rely on the use of the proper frame, where the spin connection is zero. However, this leads to particular theoretical and practical problems. In this paper, we introduce an entirely general approach to determining the most general Riemann–Cartan geometries that admit a given symmetry group and apply these results to teleparallel geometries. To illustrate the approach, we determine the most general geometries, with the minimal number of arbitrary functions, for particular choices of symmetry groups with dimension one, three, six, and seven. In addition, we rigorously show how the teleparallel analog of the Robertson–Walker, de Sitter, and Einstein static spacetimes can be determined.},

  abstract     = {We consider gravitational lensing of a background source by a finite system of point-masses. The problem of determining the maximum possible number of lensed images has been completely resolved in the single-plane setting (where the point masses all reside in a single lens plane), but this problem remains open in the multiplane setting. We construct examples of K -plane point-mass gravitational lens ensembles that produce ∏ i = 1 K ( 5 g i − 5 ) images of a single background source, where g i is the number of point masses in the i th plane. This gives asymptotically (for large g i with K fixed) 5 K times the minimal number of lensed images. Our construction uses Rhie’s single-plane examples and a structured parameter-rescaling algorithm to produce preliminary systems of equations with the desired number of solutions. Utilizing the stability principle from the differential topology, we then show that preliminary (nonphysical) examples can be perturbed to produce physically meaningful examples while preserving the number of solutions. We provide numerical simulations illustrating the result of our construction, including positions of lensed images and the structure of critical curves and caustics. We observe an interesting “caustic of multiplicity” phenomenon that occurs in the nonphysical case and has a noticeable effect on the caustic structure in the physically meaningful perturbative case.},

The configurations have been specialized to three different cases where the pressure is, in turn, directed alongside each principal stress. The two first articles in the series display the analysis of the axial pressure case. Indeed, the first axial class published in Paper I is merely a special case. It is recalled here and its properties are revised and supplemented. Moreover, a fully general method aiming at constructing different classes of such solutions is displayed. This method described in Paper II represents a key result of this work. It is exemplified and applied to two new classes of solutions depending on a single constant parameter. One of them, denoted Class A, is shown to verify every condition needing to be satisfied by a fully achieved set of exact solutions: axisymmetry and, when appropriate, regularity conditions; matching to an exterior vacuum; proper metric signature; and weak and strong energy conditions. Other properties and general rules are exhibited, some shedding light on rather longstanding issues. Astrophysical and physical applications are suggested.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a non-abelian generalization of the Navier–Stokes equation that exhibits a manifest duality between color and kinematics has been proposed by Cheung and Mangan. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on the double copy formulation of this equation based on the homotopy algebraic picture suggested by Borsten, Kim, Jurčo, Macrelli, Saemann, and Wolf. In the process, we describe precisely how the double copy can be realized at the level of perturbiner expansions. Specifically, we will show that the color-dressed Berends–Giele currents for the non-abelian version of the Navier–Stokes equation can be used to construct the Berends–Giele currents for the double copied equation by replacing the color factors with a second copy of kinematic numerators. We will also show a Kawai–Lewellen–Tye relation stating that the full tree-level scattering amplitudes in the latter can be written as a product of tree-level color ordered partial amplitudes in the former.},

Then, we find which of the solution spaces obtained by imposing the self-adjoint boundary conditions are invariant under the action of the isometry group of the spacetime manifold, namely, the universal covering group of S L ( 2 , R ) ⁠ . The invariant solution spaces are then identified with unitary irreducible representations of this group using the classification given by Pukánszky [Math. Ann. 156 , 96–143 (1964)]. We determine which of these correspond to invariant positive- or negative-frequency subspaces and, thus, result in a vacuum state invariant under the isometry group after canonical quantization. Additionally, we examine the invariant theories obtained from the self-adjoint boundary conditions, which result in a non-invariant vacuum state, identifying the unitary representation this state belongs to.},

Relying on this approach, in the present scenario, coherent states are generalized over the canonical or finite dimensional Fock space of the harmonic oscillator. A class of generalized coherent states is determined such that the corresponding distributions of the number of excitations depart from the Poisson statistics according to combinations of stretched exponential decays, power laws, and logarithmic forms. The analysis of the Mandel parameter shows that the generalized coherent states exhibit (non-classical) sub-Poissonian or super-Poissonian statistics of the number of excitations, based on the realization of determined constraints.

The expectation values depend on a discrete quantum number and two parameters, one of them is the angle between two angular momentum components and the other is the quotient of two standard deviations. Allowing the angle between two angular momentum components to be arbitrary, a new genuine quantum mechanical phenomenon emerges : it is shown that although standard deviations change continuously, one of the expectation values changes discontinuously on this parameter space. Since physically neither of the angular momentum components is distinguished over the other, this discontinuity suggests that the genuine parameter space must be a double cover of this classical one: it must be diffeomorphic to a Riemann surface known in connection with the complex function z ⁠ . Moreover, the angle between angular momentum components plays the role of the parameter of an interpolation between the continuous range of expectation values in the special case of orthogonal angular momentum components and the discrete point spectrum of one angular momentum component. The consequences in the simultaneous measurements of these angular momentum components are also discussed briefly.},

It is shown that while there is a 1-parameter family of such states for any two components of the angular momentum vector operator with any angle between them, such states exist for a component of the linear and angular momenta only if these components are orthogonal to each other, and hence, the problem is reduced to the two-dimensional Euclidean invariant case. We also show that analogous states exist for a component of the linear momentum and of the center-of-mass vector only if the angle between them is zero or an acute angle. No such state (represented by a square integrable and differentiable wave function) can exist for any pair of components of the center-of-mass vector operator.

I then sketch an application of the chiral anomaly in 1 + 1 dimensions to quantum wires. Subsequently, some elements of the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional (2D) gapped (“incompressible”) electron liquids are reviewed. In particular, I discuss the role of anomalous chiral edge currents and of the anomaly inflow in 2D gapped electron liquids with explicitly or spontaneously broken time reversal, i.e., in Hall and Chern insulators. The topological Chern–Simons action yielding transport equations valid in the bulk of such systems and the associated anomalous edge action are derived. The results of a general classification of “Abelian” Hall insulators are outlined. After some remarks on induced Chern–Simons actions, I sketch results on certain 2D chiral photonic wave guides. I then continue with an analysis of chiral edge spin-currents and bulk response equations in time-reversal invariant 2D topological insulators of electron gases with spin–orbit interactions. The “chiral magnetic effect” in 3D systems and axion-electrodynamics are reviewed next. This prepares the ground for an outline of a general theory of 3D topological insulators, including “axionic insulators.” Some remarks on Weyl semi-metals, which exhibit the chiral magnetic effect, and on Mott transitions in 3D systems with dynamical axion-like degrees of freedom conclude this review.},

Lett. 50, 1153–1156 (1983)] and Tasaki [Tasaki, Graduate Texts in Physics (Springer, 2020)] can be intuitively understood in terms of the valence-bond picture proposed by Affleck et al. [I. Affleck, Phys. Rev. Lett. 59, 799 (1987); Commun. Math. Phys. 115, 477–528 (1988)]. Here, we develop a similarly intuitive diagrammatic explanation of the qualitative difference between chains with odd S and even S , which is at the heart of the theory of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. (There is a 24 min video in which the essence of the present work is discussed: https://youtu.be/URsf9e_PLlc .) More precisely, we define one-parameter families of states, which we call the asymmetric valence-bond solid (VBS) states, that continuously interpolate between the Affleck–Kennedy–Lieb–Tasaki (AKLT) state and the trivial zero state in quantum spin chains with S = 1 and 2. The asymmetric VBS state is obtained by systematically modifying the AKLT state. It always has exponentially decaying truncated correlation functions and is a unique gapped ground state of a short-ranged Hamiltonian. We also observe that the asymmetric VBS state possesses the time-reversal, the Z 2 × Z 2 ⁠ , and the bond-centered inversion symmetries for S = 2 but not for S = 1. This is consistent with the known fact that the AKLT model belongs to the trivial SPT phase if S = 2 and to a nontrivial SPT phase if S = 1. Although such interpolating families of disordered states were already known, our construction is unified and is based on a simple physical picture. It also extends to spin chains with general integer S and provides us with an intuitive explanation of the essential difference between models with odd and even spins.},

The properties of gon and tet are easier to obtain, or to formulate, than those of the corresponding theta and 6 j symbols in both classical and quantum situations. Their evaluation is also simpler (this paper displays a number of explicit formulas and evaluation procedures that may speed up some computer programs). These two integer-valued functions are unusual in that their properties do not appear to be often discussed in the literature, but their features reflect those of related real-valued functions discussed in many places. Some of the properties that we shall discuss seem, however, to be new, in particular several relations between the function gon and inverse Hilbert matrices.},

The second system is the time-independent magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations. For the SEL system, we obtain a new criterion to improve the regularity of weak solutions, provided that they belong to some homogeneous Morrey space. As a bi-product, we also obtain some new regularity criterion for the stationary Navier–Stokes equations and for a nonlinear harmonic map flow. This new regularity criterion also holds true for the MHD equations. Furthermore, for this last system, we are able to use the Gevrey class to prove that all finite energy weak solutions are analytic functions, provided that the external forces belong to some Gevrey class.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a classification of elliptic (pseudo-)differential Hamiltonians describing topological insulators and superconductors in Euclidean space by means of domain walls. Augmenting a given Hamiltonian by one or several domain walls results in confinement that naturally yields a Fredholm operator, whose index is taken as the topological charge of the system. The index is computed explicitly in terms of the symbol of the Hamiltonian by a Fedosov–Hörmander formula, which implements in Euclidean spaces an Atiyah–Singer index theorem. For Hamiltonians admitting an appropriate decomposition in a Clifford algebra, the index is given by the easily computable topological degree of a naturally associated map. A practically important property of topological insulators is the asymmetric transport observed along one-dimensional lines generated by the domain walls. This asymmetry is captured by the edge conductivity, a physical observable of the system. We prove that the edge conductivity is quantized and given by the index of a second Fredholm operator of the Toeplitz type. We also prove topological charge conservation by stating that the two aforementioned indices agree. This result generalizes to higher dimensions and higher-order topological insulators, the bulk-edge correspondence of two-dimensional materials. We apply this procedure to evaluate the topological charge of several classical examples of (standard and higher-order) topological insulators and superconductors in one, two, and three spatial dimensions.},

Starting from a tight-binding model, we identify a regime where the BM model emerges as the effective dynamics for electrons modeled as wave-packets spectrally concentrated at monolayer Dirac points up to error that can be rigorously estimated.

We focus on analytical results obtained by means of certain probabilistic techniques from the ergodic theory of Markov processes. These techniques are sometimes referred to as Harris-type theorems. They provide constructive proofs for convergence results in the L 1 (or total variation) setting for a large class of initial data. The convergence rates can be made explicit (for both geometric and sub-geometric rates) by tracking the constants appearing in the hypotheses. Harris-type theorems are particularly well-adapted for equations exhibiting non-explicit and non-equilibrium steady states since they do not require prior information on the existence of stationary states. This allows for significant improvements of some already-existing results by relaxing assumptions and providing explicit convergence rates. We aim to present Harris-type theorems, providing a guideline on how to apply these techniques to kinetic equations at hand. We discuss recent quantitative results obtained for kinetic equations in gas theory and mathematical biology, giving some perspectives on potential extensions to nonlinear equations.},

  abstract     = {The elliptic Ginibre ensemble of complex non-Hermitian random matrices allows us to interpolate between the rotationally invariant Ginibre ensemble and the Gaussian unitary ensemble of Hermitian random matrices. It corresponds to a two-dimensional one-component Coulomb gas in a quadrupolar field at inverse temperature β = 2. Furthermore, it represents a determinantal point process in the complex plane with the corresponding kernel of planar Hermite polynomials. Our main tool is a saddle point analysis of a single contour integral representation of this kernel. We provide a unifying approach to rigorously derive several known and new results of local and global spectral statistics, including in higher dimensions. First, we prove the global statistics in the elliptic Ginibre ensemble first derived by Forrester and Jancovici [Int. J. Mod. Phys. A 11 , 941 (1996)]. The limiting kernel receives its main contribution from the boundary of the limiting elliptic droplet of support. In the Hermitian limit, there is a known correspondence between non-interacting fermions in a trap in d real dimensions R d and the d -dimensional harmonic oscillator. We present a rigorous proof for the local d -dimensional bulk (sine) and edge (Airy) kernel first defined by Dean et al. [Europhys. Lett. 112 , 60001 (2015)], complementing the recent results by Deleporte and Lambert [arXiv:2109.02121 (2021)]. Using the same relation to the d -dimensional harmonic oscillator in d complex dimensions C d ⁠ , we provide new local bulk and edge statistics at weak and strong non-Hermiticity, where the former interpolates between correlations in d real and d complex dimensions. For C d with d = 1, this corresponds to non-interacting fermions in a rotating trap.},

Moreover, we derive an important estimate relating the Clifford and quadratic pseudospectra.

This definition applies to classical thermodynamics, classical statistical mechanics, quantum statistical mechanics, and also generalized probabilistic theories of the sort studied in quantum foundations. It also allows us to treat a heat bath as a thermostatic system on an equal footing with any other. We construct an operad whose operations are convex relations from a product of convex spaces to a single convex space and prove that thermostatic systems are algebras of this operad. This gives a general, rigorous formalism for combining thermostatic systems, which captures the fact that such systems maximize entropy subject to whatever constraints are imposed upon them.},

  abstract     = {We prove rigorous scaling laws for measures of the vertical heat transport enhancement in two models of convection driven by uniform internal heating at infinite Prandtl number. In the first model, a layer of incompressible fluid is bounded by horizontal plates held at the same constant temperature and convection reduces the fraction of the total dimensionless heat input per unit volume and time escaping the layer through the bottom boundary. We prove that this fraction decreases no faster than O ( R −2 ), where R is a “flux” Rayleigh number quantifying the strength of the internal heating relative to diffusion. The second model, instead, has a perfectly insulating bottom boundary, so all heat must escape through the top one. In this case, we prove that the Nusselt number, defined as the ratio of the total-to-conductive vertical heat flux, grows no faster than O ( R 4 ). These power-law bounds improve on exponential results available for fluids with finite Prandtl number. The proof combines the background method with a minimum principle for the fluid’s temperature and with Hardy–Rellich inequalities to exploit the link between the vertical velocity and temperature available at infinite Prandtl number.},

We first introduce an algorithm to study geometries with an affine frame symmetry, which consists of choosing coordinates adapted to the symmetry, constructing a canonical frame, and solving the equations describing the symmetry. All of the constraints on the geometry are determined in the case of a single affine symmetry, but there are additional constraints arising from the field equations for a given theory of teleparallel gravity. In particular, we find that in f ( T ) teleparallel gravity there will be severe constraints on the geometry arising from the antisymmetric part of the field equations.},

In the present article, we use a double ansatz, which we have developed in 2021 and implemented at length into a series of recent papers displaying exact interior solutions for a stationary rotating cylindrically symmetric fluid with anisotropic pressure. This ansatz allows us to obtain here a fully integrated class of solutions to the Einstein equations, written with the use of very simple analytical functions, and to show that the equation of state of the fluid follows naturally from these field equations.},

  abstract     = {We provide an in-depth study of the recently introduced notion of completely incompatible observables and its links to the support uncertainty and to the Kirkwood–Dirac nonclassicality of pure quantum states. The latter notion has recently been proved central to a number of issues in quantum information theory and quantum metrology. In this last context, it was shown that a quantum advantage requires the use of Kirkwood–Dirac nonclassical states. We establish sharp bounds of very general validity that imply that the support uncertainty is an efficient Kirkwood–Dirac nonclassicality witness. When adapted to completely incompatible observables that are close to mutually unbiased ones, this bound allows us to fully characterize the Kirkwood–Dirac classical pure states as the eigenvectors of the two observables. We show furthermore that complete incompatibility implies several weaker notions of incompatibility, among which features a strong form of noncommutativity.},

  abstract     = {Quantum magic squares have recently been introduced as a “magical” combination of quantum measurements. In contrast to quantum measurements, they cannot be purified (i.e., dilated to a quantum permutation matrix)—only the so-called semiclassical ones can. Purifying establishes a relation to an ideal world of fundamental theoretical and practical importance; the opposite of purifying is described by the matrix convex hull. In this paper, we prove that semiclassical magic squares can be purified to quantum Latin squares, which are “magical” combinations of orthonormal bases. Conversely, we prove that the matrix convex hull of quantum Latin squares is larger compared to the semiclassical ones. This tension is resolved by our third result: we prove that the quantum Latin squares that are semiclassical are precisely those constructed from a classical Latin square. Our work sheds light on the internal structure of quantum magic squares, on how this is affected by the matrix convex hull, and, more generally, on the nature of the “magical” composition rule, both at the semiclassical and at the quantum level.},

Our main results use techniques from elliptic PDEs and integral operators, while their topological consequences are presented as corollaries of some more general identities involving magnetic derivatives of local traces of fast decaying functions of the bulk and edge operators. One of these corollaries leads to the so-called Středa formula: if the bulk operator has an isolated compact spectral island, then the integrated density of states of the corresponding bulk spectral projection varies linearly with the magnetic field as long as the gaps between the spectral island and the rest of the spectrum are not closed, and the slope of this variation is given by the Chern character of the projection. The same bulk Chern character is related to the number of edge states that appear in the gaps of the bulk operator.},

The existence of a global in time classical solution to a free boundary value problem for the scalar ZND model is obtained by using the iterative method. Furthermore, we obtain that as the reaction rate goes to infinity, the detonation wave solution of the scalar ZND combustion model converges to a detonation wave solution of the corresponding CJ combustion model. The results are keeping with the fact that, in an actual spherical detonation process, the detonation front is propagated with a speed less than that derived from the CJ hypothesis, which is stated in Sec. 163 in the book Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves .},

The possible intermediate Bose metal phase intervening between these two states is a bosonic topological insulator. We point out that the correct treatment of a bosonic topological insulator requires a normally neglected, additional dimensionless parameter, which arises because of the non-commutativity between the infinite gap limit and phase space reduction. We show that the bosonic topological insulator is a functional first Landau level. The additional parameter drives two Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless (BKT) quantum transitions to superconducting and superinsulating phases, respectively. The two BKT correlation scales account for the emergent granularity observed around the transition. Finally, we derive the ground state wave function for a system of charges and vortices in the Bose metal phase.},

This is the same data defining a one-dimensional double extension of the metric Lie algebra and, indeed, bargmannian Lie algebras coincide with such double extensions, containing carrollian Lie algebras as an ideal and projecting to galilean Lie algebras. This sets up a canonical correspondence between carrollian and galilean Lie algebras mediated by bargmannian Lie algebras. This reformulation allows us to use the structure theory of metric Lie algebras to give a list of bargmannian, carrollian, and galilean Lie algebras in the positive-semidefinite case. We also characterize Lie groups admitting a bi-invariant (ambient) leibnizian structure. Leibnizian Lie algebras extend the class of bargmannian Lie algebras and also set up a non-canonical correspondence between carrollian and galilean Lie algebras.},

Phys. 112 , 49 (2022)]; it can be considered as the master equation for reaction–diffusion processes. The CDME consists of an infinite ordered family of Fokker–Planck equations, where each level of the ordered family corresponds to a certain number of particles and each particle represents a molecule. The equations at each level describe the spatial diffusion of the corresponding set of particles, and they are coupled to each other via reaction operators—linear operators representing chemical reactions. These operators change the number of particles in the system and, thus, transport probability between different levels in the family. In this work, we present three approaches to formulate the CDME and show the relations between them. We further deduce the non-trivial combinatorial factors contained in the reaction operators, and we elucidate the relation to the original formulation of the CDME, which is based on creation and annihilation operators acting on many-particle probability density functions. Finally, we discuss applications to multiscale simulations of biochemical systems among other future prospects.},

The Cauchy problem is resolved by means of an abstract ordinary differential equation (ODE) theory in Banach spaces for the initial data with finite and strictly positive gas mass and energy, finite momentum, and additionally finite K * polynomial moment, with K * depending on the rate of the transition probability and the structure of a polyatomic molecule or its internal degrees of freedom.

To formulate thermodynamics in the language of sophisticated mathematics, thermodynamics is described by a variety of differential geometries, including contact and symplectic geometries. Meanwhile, affine geometry is a branch of differential geometry and is compatible with information geometry, where information geometry is known to be compatible with thermodynamics. By combining above, it is expected that thermodynamics is compatible with affine geometry and is expected that several affine geometric tools can be introduced in the analysis of thermodynamic systems. In this paper, affine geometric descriptions of equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics are proposed. For equilibrium systems, it is shown that several thermodynamic quantities can be identified with geometric objects in affine geometry and that several geometric objects can be introduced in thermodynamics. Examples of these include the following: specific heat is identified with the affine fundamental form and a flat connection is introduced in thermodynamic phase space. For nonequilibrium systems, two classes of relaxation processes are shown to be described in the language of an extension of affine geometry. Finally, this affine geometric description of thermodynamics for equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems is compared with a contact geometric description.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we establish and analyze a stochastic human immunodeficiency virus model with both virus-to-cell and cell-to-cell transmissions and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, in which we suppose that the virus-to-cell infection rate and the cell-to-cell infection rate satisfy the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. First, we validate that there exists a unique global solution to the stochastic model with any initial value. Then, we adopt a stochastic Lyapunov function technique to develop sufficient criteria for the existence of a stationary distribution of positive solutions to the stochastic system, which reflects the strong persistence of all CD 4 + T cells and free viruses. In particular, under the same conditions as the existence of a stationary distribution, we obtain the specific form of the probability density around the quasi-chronic infection equilibrium of the stochastic system. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to validate these analytical results. Our results suggest that the methods used in this paper can be applied to study other viral infection models in which the infected CD 4 + T cells are divided into latently infected and actively infected subgroups.},

  abstract     = {In a recent paper of Mitsopoulos and Tsamparlis [J. Geom. Phys. 170 , 104383 (2021)], a general theorem is given, which provides an algorithmic method for the computation of first integrals (FIs) of autonomous dynamical systems in terms of the symmetries of the kinetic metric defined by the dynamical equations of the system. In the present work, we apply this theorem to compute the cubic FIs of autonomous conservative Newtonian dynamical systems with two degrees of freedom. We show that the known results on this topic, which have been obtained by means of various divertive methods, and the additional ones derived in this work can be obtained by the single algorithmic method provided by this theorem. The results are collected in Tables I–IV, which can be used as an updated reference for these types of integrable and superintegrable potentials. The results we find are for special values of free parameters; therefore, using the methods developed here, other researchers by a different suitable choice of the parameters will be able to find new integrable and superintegrable potentials.},

  abstract     = {A Lorentzian manifold, N , endowed with a time function, τ , can be converted into a metric space using the null distance, d ̂ τ ⁠ , defined by Sormani and Vega [Classical Quant. Grav. 33 (8), 085001 (2016)]. We show that if the time function is a regular cosmological time function as studied by Andersson, Galloway, and Howard [Classical Quant. Grav. 15 (2), 309–322 (1998)], and also by Wald and Yip [J. Math. Phys. 22 , 2659–2665 (1981)], or if, more generally, it satisfies the anti-Lipschitz condition of Chruściel, Grant, and Minguzzi [Ann. Henri Poincare 17 (10), 2801–2824 (2016)], then the causal structure is encoded by the null distance in the following sense: for any p ∈ N , there is an open neighborhood U p such that for any q ∈ U p , we have d ̂ τ ( p , q ) = τ ( q ) − τ ( p ) if and only if q lies in the causal future of p . The local encoding of causality can be applied to prove the global encoding of causality in a variety of settings, including spacetimes N where τ is a proper function. As a consequence, in dimension n + 1, n ≥ 2, we prove that if there is a bijective map between two such spacetimes, F : M 1 → M 2 , which preserves the cosmological time function, τ 2 ( F ( p )) = τ 1 ( p ) for any p ∈ M 1 , and preserves the null distance, d ̂ τ 2 ( F ( p ) , F ( q ) ) = d ̂ τ 1 ( p , q ) for any p , q ∈ M 1 , then there is a Lorentzian isometry between them, F ∗ g 1 = g 2 . This yields a canonical procedure allowing us to convert large classes of spacetimes into unique metric spaces with causal structures and time functions. This will be applied in our upcoming work to define spacetime intrinsic flat convergence.},

The resulting Hamiltonian is mapped into a Morse oscillator by means of a point canonical transformation from the usual phase space ( x , p ) to a deformed one ( x γ , Π γ ). Similar to the Morse potential, the deformed oscillator presents bound trajectories in phase space corresponding to an anharmonic oscillatory motion in classical formalism and, therefore, bound states with a discrete spectrum in quantum formalism. On the other hand, open trajectories in phase space are associated with scattering states and continuous energy spectrum. Employing the factorization method, we investigate the properties of the coherent states, such as the time evolution and their uncertainties. A fast localization, classical and quantum, is reported for the coherent states due to the asymmetrical position-dependent mass. An oscillation of the time evolution of the uncertainty relationship is also observed, whose amplitude increases as the deformation increases.},

This is an extension of a recent study where the same idea was proposed in the photonic setup [Man et al. , Sci. Rep. 7 , 42539 (2017)] using two independent Mach–Zehnder interferometers. Now, we propose a similar scheme using the cavity-QED based setup, which comprises two independent atomic de Broglie Mach–Zehnder–Bragg interferometers, a source cavity that generates two external momenta state entangled atoms. Once the atoms pass through the source cavity initially prepared in the superposition of zero and one photon, they emerge out of the cavity in entangled momenta state such that if one atom is transmitted to the upper interferometer, then the second atom must traverse the lower interferometer, and vice versa. The final atomic de Broglie beam splitter at the top interferometer is prepared in the superposition of zero and one photon and facilitates observing the wave or particle aspect in a single setting. This entire setup functions in off-resonant Bragg diffraction and the proposed schematics are shown to be experimentally feasible under contemporary research scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In the last two decades, a vast variety of topological phases have been described, predicted, classified, proposed, and measured. While there is a certain unity in method and philosophy, the phenomenology differs wildly. This work deals with the simplest such case: fermions in one spatial dimension, in the presence of a symmetry group G , which contains anti-unitary symmetries. A complete classification of topological phases, in this case, is available. Nevertheless, these methods are to some extent lacking as they generally do not allow to determine the class of a given system easily. This paper will take up proposals for non-local order parameters defined through anti-unitary symmetries. They are shown to be homotopy invariants on a suitable set of ground states. For matrix product states, an interpretation of these invariants is provided: in particular, for a particle–hole symmetry, the invariant determines a real division super algebra D such that the bond algebra is a matrix algebra over D ⁠ .},

We perform this analysis by asking whether the spectral subspace below the gap can be spanned by smooth and periodic Bloch functions, corresponding to localized Wannier functions in position space. By constructing these Bloch functions inductively in the dimension, we show that if they are required to be orthonormal, then, in general, their existence is obstructed by the first two Chern classes of the underlying Bloch bundle, with the second Chern class characterizing, in particular, the four-dimensional situation. If the orthonormality constraint is relaxed, we show how m occupied energy bands can be spanned by a Parseval frame comprising at most m + 2 Bloch functions.},

To the authors’ knowledge, the technique used in order to prove the existence of an energy local solution to the above-mentioned problem in the sub-critical regime s &lt; s c , which consists of dividing the integrals on the unit ball of R N and its complementary, is no more applicable for s = s c . In order to overcome this difficulty, one uses two different methods. The first one consists of using Lorentz spaces with the fact that | x | − γ ∈ L N γ , ∞ ⁠ , which allows us to handle the inhomogeneous term. In the second method, one uses some weighted Lebesgue spaces, which seem to be suitable to deal with the inhomogeneous term | x | − γ . In order to avoid a singularity of the source term, one considers the case p ≥ 2, which restricts the space dimensions to N ≤ 3.},

By utilizing the measure estimation of small divisors, there exists a symplectic change of coordinate transformation of the Hamiltonian of the equation into a nice Birkhoff normal form.

Exact Riemann solutions for the perturbed system can be constructed explicitly for four different possible structures. Asymptotically, the perturbed Riemann solution involving two shocks will collapse to a single delta shock, and the perturbed Riemann solution involving two rarefaction waves will degenerate into a solution containing two contact discontinuities along with the vacuum state between them when the perturbed parameter goes to zero. It should be stressed here that the internal state in each of the two rarefaction wave-fans turns out to be the vacuum state gradually in such a limiting case, which differs obviously from the previous result that each of the two rarefaction wave-fans is compressed globally to be a single contact discontinuity. Additionally, some typical numerical results exhibiting the formation process of delta shock and vacuum state are presented to verify our theoretic results.},

In the nonlinear noise case, the global existence holds true with probability 1 if a Lyapunov-type condition is satisfied. In the linear noise case, we provide a lower bound for the probability that the solution exists globally. Furthermore, in the linear noise and the periodic case, we formulate a precise condition on initial data that leads to blow-up of strong solutions with a positive probability, and the lower bound for this probability is also estimated.},
