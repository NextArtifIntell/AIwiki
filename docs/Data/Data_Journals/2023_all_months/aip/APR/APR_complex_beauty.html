Using extended resonant soft x-ray scattering supported with theoretical calculations, we observe concomitantly a Wigner-like crystal in a stripe-like Q HKL = (001) superlattice with surprisingly long coherence lengths and new soft x-ray correlated plasmons in WS 2 . A new electronic transition is found at 125 K upon cooling, which is a transition from two-dimensional ordering to three-dimensional ordering, a result of p–d hybridization anisotropy and electronic correlations. Our result shows the importance of the interplay of long-range electron–electron correlation and short-range electronic screening in determining electronics and optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectric HfO 2 films are usually polycrystalline and contain a mixture of polar and nonpolar phases. This challenges the understanding and control of polar phase stabilization and ferroelectric properties. Several factors, such as dopants, oxygen vacancies, or stress, among others, have been investigated and shown to have a crucial role on optimizing the ferroelectric response. Stress generated during deposition or annealing of thin films is a main factor determining the formed crystal phases and influences the lattice strain of the polar orthorhombic phase. It is difficult to discriminate between stress and strain effects on polycrystalline ferroelectric HfO 2 films, and the direct impact of orthorhombic lattice strain on ferroelectric polarization has yet to be determined experimentally. Here, we analyze the crystalline phases and lattice strain of several series of doped HfO 2 epitaxial films. We conclude that stress has a critical influence on metastable orthorhombic phase stabilization and ferroelectric polarization. On the contrary, the lattice deformation effects are much smaller than those caused by variations in the orthorhombic phase content. The experimental results are confirmed by density functional theory calculations on HfO 2 and Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 ferroelectric phases.},

However, the precise spatial resolution of THz spin currents, which is crucial for increasing storage density, is still unknown. In this study, we employ spintronic THz emission nanoscopy (STEN) to achieve efficient injection and accurate detection of femtosecond THz spin currents with nanoscale lateral spatial resolution (∼60 nm). The occurrence of emission signals at the fifth harmonic order indicates a substantial signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, STEN proves to be an effective method for characterizing and etching nanoscale spintronic heterostructures. The integration of nanophotonics, nanospintronics, and THz-nanotechnology into a unified platform is poised to enable the characterization of spin states at micro-to-nanoscale densities, accelerate the development of high-frequency spintronic optoelectronic nanodevices, and catalyze other revolutionary technical applications.},

Although remarkable progress has been witnessed in unlocking the potential of new adsorbents in the laboratory, the productivity of freshwater is still limited by the slow adsorption kinetic, the large latent heat of water evaporation, and the efficiency of condensation. In this work, superhygroscopic porous gels consisting of titanium nitride, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and LiCl (THL) were developed and demonstrated to have a unique high water uptake of 1.18–6.43 g water g sorbent −1 at 25 °C and 15\%–90\% relative humidity. To validate the feasibility of THL for moisture extraction, reasonable energy management of the water harvester was carried out, and the potential daytime outdoor water collection in summer and winter reached 3.82 and 2.98 l water kg sorbent −1 day −1 , respectively, at relative humidity of ∼60\% and ∼30\%. The implementation strategy proposed in this paper provides a reliable path for solar-driven AWH, confirming the adaptability and possibility of achieving high yield freshwater production in real scenarios of practical significance.},

Despite their immense potential, achieving highly transparent contacts for efficient charge transport—which requires proper contact selection and a deep understanding of the complex one-dimensional GNR channel-three-dimensional metal contact interface—remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated the impact of different electron-beam deposited contact metals—the commonly used palladium (Pd) and softer metal indium (In)—on the structural properties and field-effect transistor performance of semiconducting nine-atom wide armchair GNRs. The performance and integrity of the GNR channel material were studied by means of a comprehensive Raman spectroscopy analysis, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging, optical absorption calculations, and transport measurements. We found that, compared to Pd, In contacts facilitate favorable Ohmic-like transport because of the reduction of interface defects, while the edge structure quality of GNR channel plays a more dominant role in determining the overall device performance. Our study provides a blueprint for improving device performance through contact engineering and material quality enhancements in emerging GNR-based technology.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites hold great potential for novel optoelectronic applications. However, their unconventional optoelectronic properties are often compromised by a vulnerability to light irradiation, which leads to the formation of metallic Pb (Pb 0 ) defects. This study investigates the passivation mechanism of these Pb 0 defects in phenylethylammonium lead iodide (PEA 2 PbI 4 ) using a strong molecular acceptor, 2,2′‐(perfluoronaphthalene‐2, 6‐diylidene) dimalononitrile (F6-TCNNQ). In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results demonstrate that F6-TCNNQ effectively removes the light-induced Pb 0 states, leading to the recovery of photoluminescence intensity in photodegraded PEA 2 PbI 4 samples and significantly improving the photostability of pristine PEA 2 PbI 4 . F6-TCNNQ protects the terrace edge of PEA 2 PbI 4 , which is the site of initial degradation, as evidenced by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses. In situ ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements confirm substantial electron transfer from Pb 0 to F6-TCNNQ, causing the oxidation of Pb 0 to Pb 2+ . Furthermore, the staggered energy level alignment prevents electron transfer from the valence band maximum of PEA 2 PbI 4 to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of F6-TCNNQ, thereby preserving the pristine electronic structure of PEA 2 PbI 4 . These findings provide new insights into defect passivation in 2D RP perovskites and offer a design strategy for highly stable optoelectronic devices.},

The control of SOC strength has been an increasingly prevalent topic for the manipulation of the spin degree in spintronic devices. Here, we fabricate MAPbI 3 films possessing cubic crystal phase and tetragonal crystal phase with Pb vacancies. Circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) measurements indicate that C N , representing the difference between right and left circularly polarized photocurrents, of the tetragonal structure with Pb vacancies ( C N = 0.6316) is almost three orders of magnitude larger than that of the cubic structure ( C N = 0.0009). Combining with the density functional theory calculations, we confirm that the strength of SOC generating the CPGE could be tuned by crystal phases of MAPbI 3 , and the existence of Pb vacancies could remarkably enhance the spin splitting of the band structure. Our finding provides a possible way for clarifying various puzzling SOC performances in MHPs and paves the way for spintronic device applications and circularly polarized photoelectric detectors by controlling the crystal phases and defects.},

  abstract     = {Growing atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology is expected to provide a new solution to global water scarcity. However, the operating strategy of most existing devices is based on solar energy to adsorb at night and desorb during the day. The failure to operate multiple cycles results in the waste of fast sorption kinetics properties and increases both the required weight of adsorbents and the operating costs for the water production. Hence, by virtue of the fast sorption kinetics characteristics of Ni 2 Cl 2 (BTDD) with high water harvest performance, we developed a novel rotating operational strategy, in which one module works in the desorption, while the others work in the adsorption simultaneously and the adsorption/desorption states will alternate to keep the device harvesting water continuously. Notably, a continuous thermal-driven optimized device with three adsorbent modules was built, which can condense water vapor by simple natural convection without any auxiliary refrigeration system, generating 2.11 L water kg MOF −1 day −1 by 12 continuous harvest processes during the outdoor experiments, much higher than those of active AWH device with refrigeration system (0.7–1.3 L water kg MOF −1 d −1 ). Moreover, the proposed device can efficiently use electric heating or low-grade energy (e.g., waste heat) with natural cooling to achieve continuous operation, which can collect considerable water (1.41/0.70 L water kg MOF −1 ) at night/daytime.},

Furthermore, we have studied the influence of the region of the body at which the measurements were made under different body positions across varying external stimuli. We have studied the influence of surface area, perimeter and resistance offered by the electrodes on the ECG signal acquisition, its effects on device performance and found the hexagonal labyrinth configuration to be the most suitable candidate. A prototype of a wearable ECG patch was made by combining this electrode configuration and interfacing with wireless communication capabilities, and the results were compared with a commercially available portable ECG monitor. Such a device could find potential application in remote healthcare and ambulatory care settings, and as a PoC and a preventive medical device.},

  abstract     = {The widespread use of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries is hindered by slow cathode kinetics, the shuttle effect, and dendrite growth on the anode. We show that these challenges can be overcome by replacing a linear ether (i.e., 1,2-dimethoxyethane) in commonly used electrolytes with a macrocyclic amine, 1,4,7,10-tetramethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (TMTAC). Theoretical studies and experimental data indicate that the cavity of TMTAC matches a Li ion to form a robust solvation structure. Such a solvation structure not only leads to 3D deposition of Li 2 S on the cathode, which is responsible to the reduced overpotentials of Li 2 S nucleation and decomposition, but also suppresses Li dendrite growth on the anode. Moreover, the shuttle effect of polysulfides is effectively suppressed as the quantity of free TMTAC in the TMTAC-based electrolyte is substantially reduced. As a result, coin-type cells prepared with TMTAC-based electrolytes exhibit outstanding performance metrics for all key device parameters. Furthermore, pouch-type cells can be prepared with high sulfur loadings (e.g., 3.43 mg cm −2 ) and a low electrolyte to sulfur ratio (e.g., 6.16 μ l mg −1 ) while maintaining a high areal specific capacity (3.38 mA h cm −2 ). This work demonstrates that the effective solvation of critical ions in energy storage devices is paramount to achieving peak performance.},

We show that this is a consequence both of the specific measurement setup and of the mathematical approach followed to retrieve the dark-field images. We show agreement with theoretical models for datasets acquired both with synchrotron and laboratory x-ray sources. We also introduce a new contrast mechanism, the variance of refraction, which is extracted from the same dataset and provides a direct link with the size of the scattering centers. We show that this can also be described by the same theoretical models. We study the behavior of both signals vs key parameters such as x-ray energy and scatterer radius.

  abstract     = {Moiré superlattices and their interlayer interactions in van der Waals heterostructures have received surging attention for manipulating the properties of quantum materials. In this work, based on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we find that the in-plane thermal conductivity of graphene/hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN) moiré superlattices decreases monotonically with the increase in the interlayer rotation angle within the small twisting range. The atomic stress amplitude exhibits the periodic distribution corresponding to a structural moiré pattern. Through the in-depth analysis at the atomic level, a competing mechanism between the magnitude and the directional change of the in-plane heat flow has been revealed, and the dominant role of directional change in determining the in-plane thermal conductivity of graphene/ h -BN moiré superlattices at small rotation angle has also been confirmed. Finally, the monotonic decreasing trend of in-plane thermal conductivity at a small rotation angle is further explained by the reduced low-frequency phonon transmission and the blue shift of the transmission peak as the interlayer rotation angle increases. Our work provides the physical understanding of the moiré superlattice effect and a new approach for regulating the thermal conductivity of two-dimensional materials.},

  abstract     = {The current fabrication methods of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) chips used for biological detection mostly require antibodies conjugated on nanostructured metals or additionally connected to a reporter, which leads to complicated fabrication processes and increases the cost of these chips. More importantly, only a single-layer (2D) signal source is generated on the substrate of the chip, resulting in poor sensitivity. Herein, we constructed a single-component, multiscale, three-dimensional SERS (M3D-SERS) substrate from silver nanowires (AgNWs) packing. According to our results, the Raman enhancement effect of the M3D-SERS substrate was related to the degree of AgNWs stacking along the z axis. In addition, the light source-dependent plasmonic partition and hotspot formation of the M3D-SERS substrate were evaluated by the finite integration technique to prove that M3D-SERS offers advantages, with isotropic localized surface plasmon resonance as well as homogeneous hotspot distribution, for SERS over its 1D and 2D counterparts. Experimentally, the optimal construction of the M3D-SERS chip was explored and established based on the Raman signal enhancement of bovine serum albumin, and consequently, the efficiency of the M3D-SERS chip in detecting SARS-CoV-2-related biomolecules was investigated based on the detection superiority to biomolecules. This study demonstrates a simple, label-free, pre-treatment-free potential biosensor technology that can be used in healthcare units. Furthermore, in combination with a suitable laser light source, this technology can be applied for efficient detection in point-of-care tests with a handheld spectrometer.},

  abstract     = {Long-term remission in cancer patients treated with ex vivo bona fide M1-induced macrophages has been poor, and the reasons behind this are not understood. Injected M1 macrophages must physically migrate to tumors to execute their role that leads to a therapeutic benefit. However, the trafficking of macrophages to tumors has not been rigorously studied. We hypothesized that trafficking capabilities of macrophages are impacted when naïve M0 macrophages are converted into an M1 phenotype for macrophage therapy. To test this, we developed a three-dimensional assay comprising a tumor spheroid and macrophages to quantify macrophage tumor transport. Cell migration, permeability, and kinetics of tumor entry were quantitatively defined and compared between macrophage phenotypes. Our results demonstrate that compared to M0 macrophages, M1 macrophages migrate less efficiently toward the tumor spheroid and exhibit a fivefold lower tumor permeability. Live imaging data combined with unsupervised machine learning algorithms reveal that macrophage migration correlates with their shape transitions. Our studies highlight the importance of transport considerations in determining the efficacy of cell therapies. This study quantitatively demonstrates that the transport properties of macrophages in tumors depend on their phenotype.},

The current fluctuations, determined from the derivative current–voltage characteristics of two-terminal 1 T -TaS 2 devices, appear prominently at the electric fields that correspond to the transitions between various charge-density-wave macroscopic quantum condensate phases and at the onset of the depinning of the charge density wave domains. The depinning threshold field, E D , monotonically increases with decreasing temperature within the nearly commensurate charge-density-wave phase. The E D value increases with the decreasing 1 T -TaS 2 film thickness, revealing the surface pinning of the charge density waves. Our analysis suggests that the domain depinning is pronounced in the nearly commensurate phase. It is induced by the electric field but facilitated by local heating. The measured trends for E D of the domain depinning are important for understanding the physics of charge density waves in quasi-two-dimensional crystals and for developing electronic devices based on this type of quantum materials.},

  abstract     = {Nitric oxide (NO) signaling plays many pivotal roles impacting almost every organ function in mammalian physiology, most notably in cardiovascular homeostasis, inflammation, and neurological regulation. Consequently, the ability to make real-time and continuous measurements of NO is a prerequisite research tool to understand fundamental biology in health and disease. Despite considerable success in the electrochemical sensing of NO, challenges remain to optimize rapid and highly sensitive detection, without interference from other species, in both cultured cells and in vivo . Achieving these goals depends on the choice of electrode material and the electrode surface modification, with graphene nanostructures recently reported to enhance the electrocatalytic detection of NO. Due to its single-atom thickness, high specific surface area, and highest electron mobility, graphene holds promise for electrochemical sensing of NO with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity even at sub-nanomolar concentrations. The non-covalent functionalization of graphene through supermolecular interactions, including π–π stacking and electrostatic interaction, facilitates the successful immobilization of other high electrolytic materials and heme biomolecules on graphene while maintaining the structural integrity and morphology of graphene sheets. Such nanocomposites have been optimized for the highly sensitive and specific detection of NO under physiologically relevant conditions. In this review, we examine the building blocks of these graphene-based electrochemical sensors, including the conjugation of different electrolytic materials and biomolecules on graphene, and sensing mechanisms, by reflecting on the recent developments in materials and engineering for real-time detection of NO in biological systems.},

Thus, therapeutic outcomes for many disease states could be improved through the implementation of continuous monitoring systems. The most well-represented example of in vivo continuous monitoring of a small-molecule metabolite is the continuous glucose monitors used extensively in diabetes management. Unfortunately, to date, there is yet to be a marketed product that meets the engineering challenges or regulatory requirements for continuous sensing of peptides or proteins. A critical limitation of realizing this type of sensing is the limited availability of affinity-type biosensing elements, such as aptamers or antibodies. These molecules, while highly specific, have dissociation constants in the nano–picomolar range, which prevents reversibility between the biosensing element and analyte. In this review, several key challenges regarding the use of affinity-type biosensing elements to measure the concentration of peptides/proteins continuously in vivo are discussed. We discuss several examples of research groups working to overcome these limitations through specific engineering of biosensing elements, or by modulating the binding interaction itself using external energy. We then turn the discussion to insulin, a crucial therapeutic peptide for diabetes with the potential to enhance patient outcomes via continuous monitoring in vivo . This serves as a case study to explain why protein/peptide sensors currently suffer from translation. Finally, we summarize the current literature for insulin detection and discuss general translation toward in vivo continuous sensing of peptide/protein analytes.},

As a result, there is a pressing need for powerful advanced technique to characterize magnetic vdW surface and interface. Circularly polarized X-rays from synchrotron radiation light sources are key to this endeavor, as they can probe the microscopic magnetism of a specific element, for their atomic sensitivity, element-specificity, core-level excitation as well as capability of separation for the spin and orbit moments.

MA 2 Z 4 monolayers exhibit interesting electronic, magnetic, optical, spintronic, valleytronic, and topological properties, making them a compelling material platform for next-generation device technologies. Furthermore, heterostructure engineering enormously expands the opportunities of MA 2 Z 4 ⁠ . In this review, we summarize the recent rapid progress in the computational design of MA 2 Z 4 -based heterostructures based on first-principle density functional theory (DFT) simulations—a central work horse widely used to understand the physics, chemistry, and general design rules for specific targeted functions. We systematically classify the MA 2 Z 4 -based heterostructures based on their contact types, and review their physical properties, with a focus on their performances in electronics, optoelectronics, and energy conversion applications. We review the performance and promises of MA 2 Z 4 -based heterostructures for device applications that include electrical contacts, transistors, spintronic devices, photodetectors, solar cells, and photocatalytic water splitting. We present several prospects for the computational design of MA 2 Z 4 -based heterostructures, which hold the potential to guide the next phase of exploration, moving beyond the initial “gold rush” of MA 2 Z 4 research.

  abstract     = {The growth of artificial intelligence applications demands ever larger and more complex deep learning models, dominating today&#39;s—and tomorrow&#39;s—data center and high-performance computing systems. While traditional electronics are failing to keep pace with application demands, silicon photonic (SiPh) interconnects have emerged as a necessary technology to support these systems. SiPh-driven wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) offers a particularly promising path toward supporting incredibly high-aggregate link bandwidth in a compact and efficient form factor. One of the basic building blocks of these integrated WDM interconnects is the SiPh resonator. Their inherent wavelength selectivity and compact footprint allow for efficient data transmission multiplexed across dozens of carrier wavelengths. Used as add-drop (AD) filters, SiPh resonators are critical to constructing integrated tunable wavelength-selective optical circuit switches as well as for demultiplexing the different carrier wavelengths toward independent wavelength-insensitive photodiodes in a dense wavelength-division multiplexing receiver. Resonators in the all-pass (AP) configuration are widespread as well, allowing for wavelength-selective modulation to drive aggregate link bandwidths far beyond the individual channel data rate. Unlike SiPh Mach–Zehnder modulators (MZM), resonant modulators can be driven using low, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor drive voltages, allowing for tight co-integration between photonic integrated circuits, fabricated with larger process node technologies, and electronic integrated circuits, designed to exploit the advantages of the latest node. To push toward practical peta-scale interconnects, a comprehensive review of SiPh resonators is required, addressing bottlenecks and design constraints at both the architecture and device levels. We first describe the predominant integrated link architectures and identify their limits. We then discuss the device-level design considerations that can be made for both AD and AP configuration resonators to overcome the system level limits with novel resonator device designs. Analytical models and numerical simulation of resonators are validated by experimental measurement of devices fabricated in a commercial 300-mm foundry, showing a clear path toward volume manufacturing. The demonstrated resonant modulators and filters support the feasibility of increasing the aggregate bandwidth of resonator-driven SiPh interconnects into the peta-scale regime.},

Recently, MMFs have been introduced into mode-locked lasers for new cavity structures with better laser performance. Among these lasers, there are two remarkable cases in which MMFs are the key components for mode-locking: One is using a short segment of the MMF as a saturable absorber (SA), which has the advantages of high damage threshold, wide operating bandwidth, and low cost. The other is the construction of multimode cavities with MMFs. Spatiotemporal mode-locking (STML), a general form of mode-locking, can be achieved in such cavities. Herein, we review these two types of mode-locked lasers with MMFs. The principles of MMF-based SA and STML are described based on the common theory of multimode nonlinear fiber optics. Subsequently, we present a detailed overview of the recent progress regarding these lasers, including lasers mode-locked by MMF-based SAs at the 1-, 1.5-, and 2- μ m bands, as well as spatiotemporal mode-locked MMF lasers. A perspective for the development of mode-locked lasers with MMFs is also provided.},

The following perspective explores the literature of emerging PVs and highlights the maximum reported PPW values of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) 29.4 W/g, organic solar cells (OSCs) 32.07 W/g, and quantum dot solar cells 15.02 W/g, respectively. The record PPW values of OSCs and PSCs are approximately one order of magnitude higher compared to their inorganic ultrathin solar cells counterparts (approximately 3.2 W/g for CIGS and a-Si). This consists emerging PVs, very attractive for a variety of applications where the PPW is the key parameter. In particular, both OSCs and PSCs can be implemented in different scenarios of applications (indoor and biocompatible applications for OSCs and outdoor and high-energy radiation conversion conditions for the PSCs) due to their unique optoelectronic and physiochemical properties. Finally, our theoretical optical and electrical simulation and optimization study for the most promising and well-suited PV technologies showed an impressive maximum realistic theoretical PPW limit of 74.3 and 93.7 W/g for PSCs and OSCs, respectively. Our finding in the theoretical section shows that the experimental results achieved in the literature of PSCs and OSCs toward high PPW outputs is not quite close to the theoretical maximum (35\% and 40\% of the theoretical maximum for OSCs and PSCs, respectively), and thus, more work needs to be done to further increase the experimental PPW output of these promising PV technologies.},

  abstract     = {The joint automated repository for various integrated simulations (JARVIS) infrastructure at the National Institute of Standards and Technology is a large-scale collection of curated datasets and tools with more than 80 000 materials and millions of properties. JARVIS uses a combination of electronic structure, artificial intelligence, advanced computation, and experimental methods to accelerate materials design. Here, we report some of the new features that were recently included in the infrastructure, such as (1) doubling the number of materials in the database since its first release, (2) including more accurate electronic structure methods such as quantum Monte Carlo, (3) including graph neural network-based materials design, (4) development of unified force-field, (5) development of a universal tight-binding model, (6) addition of computer-vision tools for advanced microscopy applications, (7) development of a natural language processing tool for text-generation and analysis, (8) debuting a large-scale benchmarking endeavor, (9) including quantum computing algorithms for solids, (10) integrating several experimental datasets, and (11) staging several community engagement and outreach events. New classes of materials, properties, and workflows added to the database include superconductors, two-dimensional (2D) magnets, magnetic topological materials, metal-organic frameworks, defects, and interface systems. The rich and reliable datasets, tools, documentation, and tutorials make JARVIS a unique platform for modern materials design. JARVIS ensures the openness of data and tools to enhance reproducibility and transparency and to promote a healthy and collaborative scientific environment.},

  abstract     = {Spin, the intrinsic angular momentum of an electron, is increasingly being recognized as a versatile tool in the development of next-generation technologies, including quantum computing, sensing, and communication, which exploit quantum phenomena. The burgeoning theoretical understanding coupled with technological advancements have catalyzed research efforts aimed at controlling and manipulating the optical, electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties of materials through the modulation of spin states. Among the myriad of techniques available for investigating these spin-dependent properties, Electron Spin Resonance (ESR), sometimes referred to as electron paramagnetic resonance, stands out as one of the most direct and potent methods to probe electron spin dynamics irrespective of the material environment. ESR furnishes insightful data on the states of individual spins and clusters, spin coherence via relaxation time measurements, and inter-spin distances from spin–spin interaction measurements. Additionally, ESR facilitates the manipulation of spin systems by tailoring the Zeeman energy through the modulation of the external magnetic field, and critically, by the remote manipulation of spins via the application of microwave pulses at resonance frequencies. Modern ESR experimental setups are versatile and can be employed across a wide temperature spectrum—from a few Kelvin, where quantum effects are pronounced, to room temperature and beyond. This adaptability enhances the utility of ESR in investigating the spin-dependent properties in condensed matter systems. Notwithstanding the tremendous potential and advantages that ESR offers, it remains underutilized, especially when compared to inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and nuclear magnetic resonance, despite the latter being more expensive and INS being less accessible. In this review, we elucidate the fundamental principles of ESR, with an emphasis on magnetic and spin interactions in solids, and explore the potential of ESR in advancing the understanding of spin properties across a diverse array of materials science disciplines. We commence with a concise introduction to spin-related physics, followed by the application of ESR in characterizing spin systems. As such, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for a broad audience, ranging from novices to experts, who are keen on unraveling spin phenomena and dynamics in materials science and condensed matter physics.},

Herein, a general and novel method of low-energy-recoil ion implantation and subsequent annealing is successfully developed to synthesize high-entropy oxide nanoparticles catalysts. By controlling the fluence of irradiation Ar + ions, the size and the load of HEO nanoparticles can be accurately controlled. The obtained (FeCoNiCrAl)O HEO nanoparticles exhibit an overpotential of 295 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec −1 and good stability in 1 M KOH, which is much better than the properties of binary and medium entropy oxide counterparts prepared by the same method, showing the good application prospect of low-energy-recoil ion implantation in the preparation of complicated multi-element-metal oxide nanoparticles.},

  abstract     = {Phase control in Hf 1- x Zr x O 2 (HZO) is crucial for optimizing its electrical properties, such as ferroelectricity and high dielectricity. However, phase optimization in HZO has remained challenging due to limited theoretical understanding. This work devised an atomistic methodology based on density functional theory calculations to predict the phase fractions in HZO. The detailed phase evolution and phase fractions during the sequential processes of crystallization, annealing, and cooling were predicted by calculating the nucleation barrier from amorphous, the transition barrier between polymorphs, and Boltzmann fractions, considering the combined effects of composition ( x ), grain size (d T ), and annealing temperature ( T annealing ). The findings revealed that the polar orthorhombic (PO) phase exhibited the highest fraction at T annealing = 770 K in Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 , resulting in maximum ferroelectricity. Meanwhile, the fractions of PO and tetragonal phases are similar at d T = 7 nm in Hf 0.4 Zr 0.6 O 2 and d T = 11 nm in Hf 0.3 Zr 0.7 O 2 , both at T annealing = 770 K, leading to the highest dielectricity. These results are highly consistent with the experimental results. This work demonstrates that the comprehensive interpretations of both thermodynamic and kinetic effects are essential for quantitatively predicting the phase fraction and their corresponding electrical functionality.},

Considering that the field of the OAM wave is naturally of the form of exp ( i l φ ) in the far-field region, the matrix pencil method is used to extract the magnitude terms and the exponential terms according to the real and imaginary parts of the fields sampled on a small portion of the whole circumference, and further, the mode purities corresponding to the desirable OAM modes can be easily solved. The proposed demodulation method only uses four sampling electric fields with the sampling angle ranges of 3.3 ° and 9° to well demodulate the mode purities of the OAM waves with the single mode and the mixed dual-mode, respectively. The prototype of a dual uniform circular array with the equal divergent angle for the OAM waves of the modes l = 1 and l = 2 is fabricated and measured. Good agreement between the simulation and the measurement is observed to verify the proposed demodulation method.},

  abstract     = {Doped HfO 2 thin films exhibit robust ferroelectric properties even for nanometric thicknesses, are compatible with current Si technology, and thus have great potential for the revival of integrated ferroelectrics. Phase control and reliability are core issues for their applications. Here, we show that, in (111)-oriented 5\%La:HfO 2 (HLO) epitaxial thin films deposited on (La 0.3 Sr 0.7 )(Al 0.65 Ta 0.35 )O 3 substrates, the flexoelectric effect, arising from the strain gradient along the film&#39;s normal, induces a rhombohedral distortion in the otherwise Pca 2 1 orthorhombic structure. Density functional calculations reveal that the distorted structure is indeed more stable than the pure Pca 2 1 structure, when applying an electric field mimicking the flexoelectric field. This rhombohedral distortion greatly improves the fatigue endurance of HLO thin films by further stabilizing the metastable ferroelectric phase against the transition to the thermodynamically stable non-polar monoclinic phase during repetitive cycling. Our results demonstrate that the flexoelectric effect, though negligibly weak in bulk, is crucial to optimize the structure and properties of doped HfO 2 thin films with nanometric thicknesses for integrated ferroelectric applications.},

  abstract     = {The conceptual framework of topological states has recently been extended to bosonic systems, particularly phononic systems. In this work, we chose the recently experimentally prepared two-dimensional (2D) Kekulé-order graphene as a target to propose the coexistence of gapless and gapped topological phonon states in its phonon curves. This is the first work to investigate rich gapped and gapless topological phonon states in experimentally feasible 2D materials. For the gapped topological phonons, 2D Kekulé-order graphene hosts phononic real Chern insulator states, i.e., second-order topological states, and corner vibrational modes inside frequency gaps at 27.96 and 37.065 THz. For the gapless topological phonons, 2D Kekulé-order graphene hosts a phononic Weyl pair [comprising two linear Weyl points (LWPs)] and a phononic Weyl complex [comprising one quadratic nodal point (QNP) and two LWPs] around 7.54 and 47.3 THz (39.2 THz), respectively. Moreover, the difference between the phononic Weyl pair and the phononic Weyl complex was investigated in detail. Our study not only promotes 2D Kekulé-order graphene as a concrete material platform for exploring the intriguing physics of phononic second-order topology but also proposes the coexistence of different categories of Weyl phonons, i.e., a Weyl complex that comprises two LWPs and one QNP, in two dimensions.

The Ti 3 C 2 T x /ZnO (3:1) sensor has an excellent response to 50 ppm ammonia at a low operating temperature (∼28 °C), and the value of response is 196\%, which is the highest response in this work. Furthermore, it was found that Ti 3 C 2 T x /ZnO (3:1) detects ammonia selectively against other volatile organic compounds at a low operating temperature (∼28 °C). The actual lowest detection ability was measured at 1 ppm, and the corresponding response is 14\%.

Induced photothermal responses create anisotropic permittivity modulations, different for left or right circularly polarized light, leading to temporal-dependent chiral imprinting of hot-spots, namely, “imprinting of chirality.” The above effect has not been observed yet, but it is within reach of modern experimental approaches. The proposed nonlinear chiroptical effect is general and should appear in any anisotropic material; however, we need to design a particular geometry for this effect to be strong. These new chiral time-dependent metastructures may lead to a plethora of applications.},

  abstract     = {Electrocaloric cooling, with the advantages of zero global warming potential, high efficiency, smart size, etc., is regarded as a promising next-generation technology for green refrigeration. The exotic negative electrocaloric effect (ECE) in antiferroelectric materials forms the basis to improve the caloric cooling power density, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. By using a fully first-principles method, we successfully simulate the electric field-triggered structural phase transition from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric in a prototypical antiferroelectric material PbZrO 3 (PZO). Through tracking the phonon entropy evolution and measuring the temperature-dependent polarization along the transition path, we disclose that the negative ECE in PZO originates from the latent heat associated with phonon entropy rather than the previously recognized dipolar entropy. Accordingly, a new concept of phonon entropy engineering is proposed that engineering the density of states especially for low-frequency phonons can modulate the phonon entropy, which provides an effective route to enhance the cooling power density.},

  abstract     = {The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) plays a critical role in muscle contraction, and its dysfunction can result in various neuromuscular disorders. In vitro models for studying NMJ are essential for understanding their functions and pathology. However, the engineering of muscle tissue presents challenges for the organization of myofiber-like oriented muscle bundles as well as the induction of vessel formation and innervation. To address these challenges, we fabricated a hybrid muscle construct comprising uniaxially aligned muscle struts and endothelial cell spheroids using a combination of in situ electric field-assisted bioprinting (E-printing) and microdroplet-based spheroid-forming bioprinting (MDS-printing) techniques. This resulted in self-aggregation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) into spheroids without attachment to the structures. We tested various fabrication parameters, such as electric field and cross-linking conditions, for E-printing and the deposited cell density of MDS-printing, to stabilize the alignment of the human muscle progenitor cells (hMPCs) and HUVEC spheroids, respectively. The stimulated hMPCs efficiently formed fully aligned myofibers, and the incorporation of HUVEC spheroids induced highly upregulated crosstalk between different cell types compared to a simple E-printed hMPC/HUVEC mixture-loaded construct. This improved myogenesis and vessel formation in vitro . In addition, when co-cultured with a motor neuron-like cell (NSC-34) spheroid separated by a channel, we observed considerably improved neuromuscular junction formation compared to those formed with the normally mixed cell-bearing structures. Our findings suggest that this hybrid muscle construct has the potential to enhance muscle tissue engineering by improving biological activities through the incorporation of HUVEC-spheroids and facilitating neuromuscular junction formation through co-culture with NSC-34 spheroids.},

Most clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based detection methods require long assay time because of the pre-amplification to target nucleic acids. Herein, we designed a new prototypal mpox biosensor that allows amplification-free nucleic acid detection by combining CRISPR/Cas12b system and ultrasensitive graphene field-effect transistor (gFET). The CRISPR/Cas12b–gFET enabled the detection of the mpox virus (MPXV) DNA targets at a sensitivity of ∼1 aM within about 20 min. We designed several sgRNAs to recognize the target genes of MPXV and then Cas12b protein cleaved the target genes to form a double-strand break. The specificity of sgRNAs of MPXV designed was verified among other homologous Orthopoxviruses , and the sgRNA could distinguish between recent 2022 MPXV and West African MPXV with the mutation site, showing its potential application in MPXV detection. Thus, the demonstrated CRISPR–gFET detection technology could serve as a sensitive and rapid diagnostic tool for MPXV and other DNA viruses in the future.},

  abstract     = {Alloys with a first-order magnetic transition are central to solid-state refrigeration technology, sensors and actuators, or spintronic devices. The discontinuous nature of the transition in these materials is a consequence of the coupling between the magnetic, electronic, and structural subsystems, and such transition can, in principle, cross several metastable states, where at one point, the transition takes place within the magnetic subsystem, while at another, the changes occur in the structural or electronic subsystems. To address this issue, we conducted simultaneous measurements of the macroscopic properties—magnetization, temperature change of the sample, longitudinal, and transversal magnetostrictions—to reveal the rich details of the magneto-structural, first-order transition occurring in the prototypical alloy LaFe 11.8 Si 1.2 . We found that the transition does not complete in one but in two distinct stages. The presence of the intermediate state changes the potential-energy landscape, which then impacts strongly on the width of the hysteresis associated with the first-order transition. We complement these findings with experiments on the atomistic scale, i.e., x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and Mössbauer spectroscopy, and then combine them with first-principles calculations to reveal the full complexity and two-stage nature of the transition. This new approach can be successfully extended to a large class of advanced magnetic materials that exhibit analogous transformations.},

  abstract     = {High entropy oxides (HEOs), which contain multiple elements in the same crystallographic site, are a promising platform for electrocatalysis in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Investigating these materials in epitaxial thin film form expands the possibility of tuning OER activity by several means, which are not realizable in polycrystalline samples. To date, very few such studies have been reported. In this work, the OER activity of single-crystalline thin films of (La 0.2 Pr 0.2 Nd 0.2 Sm 0.2 Eu 0.2 )NiO 3 , grown on NdGaO 3 substrates have been investigated in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte as a function of film thickness. The OER activity increases with the thickness of the film. X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements find an increase in Ni d -O p covalency and a decrease in charge transfer energy with the increase in film thickness. These facilitate higher charge transfer between Ni and surface adsorbates, increasing OER activity. However, the OER process leads to excessive leaching of thicker films and the OER activity of a 75 unit cell thick film is found to be optimal in the present study. This work demonstrates that the thickness of perovskite oxides can be used as a parameter to enhance OER activity.},

Thus, a technique to detect this quasiparticle phenomenon at the buried interface is highly coveted. Here, we report the observation of 2D small-polarons at the LaAlO 3 / SrTiO 3 conducting interface using high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry. First-principles investigations show that interfacial electron–lattice coupling mediated by the longitudinal phonon mode facilitates the formation of these polarons. This study resolves the long-standing question by attributing the formation of interfacial 2D small polarons to the significant mismatch between experimentally measured interfacial carrier density and theoretical values. Our study sheds light on the complexity of broken periodic lattice-induced quasi-particle effects and its relationship with exotic phenomena at complex oxide interfaces. Meanwhile, this work establishes spectroscopic ellipsometry as a useful technique to detect and locate optical evidence of polaronic states and other emerging quantum properties at the buried interface.},

A synthesized cubic and light-weight 8-electron half-Heusler compound, namely, MgCuSb, exhibits glass-like thermal conductivity in both magnitude and temperature dependence that seems to contradict common understanding while common 18-electron counterparts are known for high κ L . Our studies reveal that both the native strong anharmonicity induced by the tension effect of atomic filling and a low-energy shearing vibration mode triggered by weak Mg–Cu bonding are responsible for the unusual suppressed phonon conduction in MgCuSb. Finally, an analytic model is constructed by machine learning method to predict phonon conduction of both 8- and 18-electron half-Heusler compounds in a unified way, which demonstrates that the interaction between cations and anions is universal by means of adjusting the thermal conductivity of this material family.},

Unlike topological edge states that can propagate to deliver information in acoustic waveguides, the 0D topological interface states generally cannot serve as information carriers to deliver information from one location to another due to their intrinsic localization. Here, we design and demonstrate a 1D ATI with a movable interface, enabling the 0D topological acoustic interface states to deliver information from one location to another. The ATI design is based on two types of elemental building blocks—denoted as “1” and “0”—which are programmable. These elements of 1 and 0, when periodically arranged, can form topologically distinct crystals, whose interface hosts acoustic topological interface states in two bandgaps simultaneously. Since these two types of elements can switch from each other with external control, a programmable 1D dual-band ATI can be constructed. By programming coding sequences of 1 and 0 elements, we can observe dynamically movable 0D topological interface states riding on a moving interface along the 1D ATI in both bandgaps. Our work opens an avenue to develop topological acoustic devices with programmable and dynamic functions, which may have a variety of potential applications in the fields of energy trapping, topological pumping, information processing, and sound communication.},

The effective preparation of high-quality flexible YBCO films therefore plays a key role in this development. We present a novel approach for transferring water-sensitive YBCO films onto flexible substrates without any buffer layer. Freestanding YBCO film on a polydimethylsiloxane substrate is extracted by etching the Sr 3 Al 2 O 6 sacrificial layer from the LaAlO 3 substrate. In addition to the obtained freestanding YBCO thin film having a T c of 89.1 K, the freestanding YBCO thin films under inward and outward bending conditions have T c of 89.6 and 88.9 K, respectively. A comprehensive characterization involving multiple experimental techniques, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy, is conducted to investigate the morphology, structural, and electronic properties of the YBCO film before and after the extraction process where it shows the preservation of the structural and superconductive properties of the freestanding YBCO virtually in its pristine state. Further investigation reveals the formation of a YBCO passivated layer serves as a protective layer that effectively preserves the inner section of the freestanding YBCO during the etching process.

Printing is one of the most appealing technologies for fabricating f -TFTs owing to its low cost, suitability for large-scale fabrication, and possibility to be customized under non-vacuum conditions.

  abstract     = {The electronic age demands the development of high-performing thin-film semiconductors that are low-cost and scalable. Lead (Pb)-based halide perovskites (LHPs) have proven to be successful in this regard, but their use is limited by environmental and health concerns related to lead toxicity. Lead-free halide compounds offer a promising alternative, with vast compositional space for fine-tuning properties to meet specific application requirements. These materials also offer opportunities for the deliberate introduction of functional properties, providing unparalleled control over their targeted applications. While the call for lead-free halide materials as alternatives to LHPs is echoed several times, the performance of these compounds remains modest as compared to the exponential growth of LHPs. Nevertheless, the compositional space of lead-free halide materials is huge, even bigger than LHPs as they are not restricted by the structural constrains of perovskite structure. This brings their huge potential in future technologies, which are remains untapped as of now. As a meta-analysis, we compare and combine the findings of previously published studies, to assess the optoelectronic properties of ternary and quaternary halide materials and their applications in devices. It details the structures of the various lead-free halide materials including perovskites, perovskite-derivative, and non-perovskites structures and describes the role of dimensionality and composition on their optoelectronic properties. To end, the challenges and perspectives of lead-free materials and devices are given. We hope this review will provide new insights for designing metal halide materials from the viewpoint of the modulation of the basic building blocks metal halide coordination. The future of electronics lies in the hands of lead-free halide materials, and we hope this review will inspire further research in this field.},

  abstract     = {Antibody fragments without the Fc region are attracting attention in the pharmaceutical industry due to their high ability to penetrate solid tissues, cost-effective expression using microbial expression systems, and distinctive modes of action compared to those of full-size antibodies. Based on these characteristics, several antibody fragment agents have been approved. However, developing platform engineering methodologies to accelerate their development is important. In this review, we summarize and discuss protein engineering strategies for preparing therapeutic antibody fragments composed of antibody variable domains. Three (introduction of high-solubility tag systems, complementarity-determining region grafting, and domain arrangements) and two (introduction of purification tag systems and mutagenesis studies for protein L- or protein A-binding) protein engineering strategies have been reported for the cultivation and purification processes, respectively. Fusion tags might negatively impact molecular folding, function, immunogenicity, and final yield. If the production behavior of antibody fragments is not improved through complementarity-determining region grafting, domain arrangements, or human sequence-based mutagenesis, using additional fusion tag systems should be considered, with careful attention to the points described above. This summarized knowledge regarding protein engineering strategies for effectively producing antibody fragments will further accelerate therapeutic antibody fragment development.},

Polymer dielectrics have become a kind of ideal dielectric materials in electrostatic capacitors for energy storage due to their advantages of light weight, easy fabrication, low cost, and high breakdown strength. It has a wide application prospect in smart power grids, new energy vehicles, pulse power weapons, electromagnetic guns, and lasers. However, existing polymer dielectrics cannot simultaneously possess the characteristics of high energy density, high breakdown field intensity, high charge and discharge efficiency, and low dielectric loss, thus limiting the development of compact, efficient, and reliable electronic power technology. In addition, the inherent thermal/field charge injection, excitation, and transport phenomena of polymer dielectrics make the resistivity and dielectric energy storage properties of polymer dielectrics decrease sharply under the combined action of high temperature and high electric field. In order to optimize the energy storage performance of polymer dielectrics (including room temperature and high temperature dielectrics), it has been obtained excellent dielectric breakdown strength, energy storage density, energy storage charge, and discharge efficiency from polymer nanocomposites, polymer/small molecule composites, polymer/polymer blends, new synthetic polymers, multilayer polymers, and other material systems.

  abstract     = {The research community has witnessed an exceptional increase in exploring graphene related two-dimensional materials (GR2Ms) in many innovative applications and emerging technologies. However, simple, low-cost, sustainable, and eco-friendly methods to manufacture large quantities and high-quality GR2Ms still remain an unsolved challenge. To address limitations of conventional wet chemical-based exfoliation methods using graphite resources, the top-down irradiation approach has proven to be an ultrafast, effective, and environmentally friendly technology for scalable exfoliation, production, and processing of GR2Ms providing new properties for emerging applications. Significant advancements have been made for preparation of broad range of GR2Ms from graphite, such as graphene, graphene oxide, and reduced graphene oxide, and their doped, functionalized and modified forms over the past two decades, thanks to the availability of photon and ion irradiation techniques, such as microwave, infrared, ultraviolet, solar, x-ray, gamma, laser, and plasma. This review presents recent advances on the application of these various irradiation techniques and highlights their mechanism, differences in properties of prepared GR2Ms, and their advantages and disadvantages in comparison with other conventional methods. The review provides an insight into the irradiation strategies and their prospective applications to produce, at a large scale, low-cost, high-quality GR2Ms for practical applications in transparent electrodes, optoelectronic devices, sensors, supercapacitors, protective coatings, conductive inks, and composites.},

  abstract     = {The global production of fecal wastes is envisioned to reach a very high tonnage by 2030. Perilous handling and consequential exposition of human and animal fecal matter are inextricably linked with stunted growth, enteric diseases, inadequate cognitive skills, and zoonoses. Sludge treatment from sewage and water treatment processes accounts for a very high proportion of overall operational expenditure. Straightforward carbonization of sludges to generate biochar adsorbents or catalysts fosters a circular economy, curtailing sludge processing outlay. Biochars, carbonaceous substances synthesized via the thermochemical transformation of biomass, possess very high porosity, cation exchange capacity, specific surface area, and active functional sorption sites making them very effective as multifaceted adsorbents, promoting a negative carbon emission technology. By customizing the processing parameters and biomass feedstock, engineered biochars possess discrete physicochemical characteristics that engender greater efficaciousness for adsorbing various contaminants. This review provides explicit insight into the characteristics, environmental impact considerations, and SWOT analysis of different sludges (drinking water, fecal, and raw sewage sludge) and the contemporary biochar production, modification, characterization techniques, and physicochemical characteristics, factors influencing the properties of biochars derived from the aforestated sludges, along with the designing of chemical reactors involved in biochar production. This paper also manifests a state-of-the-art discussion of the utilization of sludge-derived biochars for the eviction of toxic metal ions, organic compounds, microplastics, toxic gases, vermicomposting approaches, and soil amelioration with an emphasis on biochar recyclability, reutilization, and toxicity. The practicability of scaling up biochar generation with multifaceted, application-accustomed functionalities should be explored to aggrandize socio-economic merits.},

For example, human breath contains endogenous volatiles that could be potential biomarkers. The demand for the cost-effective, noninvasive, and sensitive detection of VOCs has increased significantly following the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Typically, VOCs are detected using the gold-standard technology of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, but this equipment can be bulky and expensive outside of laboratory settings. In this context, biophotonics (or optical) technologies play a crucial role as they can provide highly sensitive detection of VOCs in a cost-effective manner and are suitable for developing point-of-care devices. This review critically and comprehensively analyzes the recent advancements (over the last decade) in biophotonics technologies for the detection of VOCs, such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, laser absorption spectroscopy, photoacoustic spectroscopy, and surface plasmon resonance, with a special focus on healthcare applications. Relative merits and demerits of these techniques are provided by comparing their sensitivity, limit of detection, and methodology in operation.

  abstract     = {Oxide heterostructures have shown rich physics phenomena, particularly in the conjunction of exotic insulator–metal transition (IMT) at the interface between polar insulator LaAlO 3 and non-polar insulator SrTiO 3 (LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 ). The polarization catastrophe model has suggested an electronic reconstruction, yielding to metallicity at both the interface and surface. Another scenario is the occurrence of surface oxygen vacancy at LaAlO 3 (surface-O v ), which has predicted surface-to-interface charge transfer, yielding metallic interface but insulating surface. To clarify the origin of IMT, one should probe surface-O v and the associated electronic structures at both the surface and the buried interface simultaneously. Here, using grazing-angle resonant soft x-ray scattering (GA-RSXS) supported with first-principles calculations, we reveal the co-existence of the surface-O v state and the interface conducting state only in conducting LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 (001) films. Interestingly, both the surface-O v state and the interface conducting state are absent for the insulating film. As a function of O v density, while the surface-O v state is responsible for the IMT, the spatial charge distribution is found responsible for a transition from two-dimensional-like to three-dimensional-like conductivity accompanied by spectral weight transfer, revealing the importance of electronic correlation. Our results show the importance of surface-O v in determining interface properties and provide a new strategy in utilizing GA-RSXS to directly probe the surface and buried interface electronic properties in complex oxide heterostructures.},

This study shows the effect of active layer thickness and different interfacial layers in the suppression of leakage current.

These PPDs have a broadband response from near-ultraviolet to near-infrared region (300–840 nm). The overall performance of the PPDs enhanced for the optimal thickness of active layer of d PVSK = 600 nm and ETL PC 60 BM layer thickness of d ETL = 50 nm. The total noise current of the PPD is further suppressed by replacing the ETL PC 60 BM (i n = 63.11 fA Hz −½ ) layer by a PC 70 BM (i n = 33.41 fA Hz −½ ) layer. This further improved other figures of merit for these PPDs. Comparison with published reports on PPDs is included to compare with the state-of-the-art detectors.},

Here, we report on the results of a systematic investigation on the THz emission generated by pumping Ni 80 Fe 20 monolayers on Al 2 O 3 substrates with a femtosecond laser. We found solid evidence that the THz emission is dominated by the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), in which a transient spin-polarized charge current can be induced by an ultrafast electron temperature gradient on the picosecond timescale, outputting THz emission. We found a polarity reversal of the THz waveform after the introduction of a SiO 2 buffer layer to the sample and found that, based on ultrafast temperature simulation, it was a consequence of direction reversal of temperature gradient. Comparing the THz emission of different FM monolayers further confirms that the THz polarity also strongly depends on the sign of the ANE coefficient. These phenomena unambiguously indicate that the ANE plays a decisive role in the process of THz emission. The present work shows the importance of ultrafast spin caloritronics for a spintronic THz emitter. The principle demonstrated here can be applied to other FM metallic materials.},

  abstract     = {Controlling the manner of band alignment of heterostructures increases design freedom with novel physical properties, enables the design of new functional devices, and improves device performance, but the lattice matching limits the diversity of traditional heterostructures. Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) fabricated by rationally mechanical restacking different two-dimensional (2D) layered materials or sequential synthesis can overcome this limitation. However, it is difficult to achieve full control over the band alignment for a specific vdWHs by means of an applied vertical electric field. Here, we take advantage of the band structure alignment properties of narrow-bandgap black-arsenic (b-As) and large-bandgap WSe 2 to realize b-As/WSe 2 vdWHs with type-I band alignment. The band alignment can be tuned from type I to type II by gate electric field, which greatly improves the photoresponsivity over 10 3 . An ultra-fast photoresponse of about 570 ns is obtained, which is much better than that of vdWHs with the same structure. The b-As/WSe 2 vdWHs also can achieve high-performance rectifier phototransistor with an ultra-high rectification ratio exceeding 10 6 , a small conductance slope of about 86 mV/dec, and a low curvature coefficient of about 46 V −1 .

Here, we report a nitrogen coordination-induced strong metal–support interaction that can tune the surface atoms of ORR-inactive PGM clusters into efficient and durable active sites. Taking Rh as an example, the carbonization of Rh-overdoped zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 results in a large number of Rh clusters (with a little atomic Rh) in porous nitrogen-doped carbon. The cluster surface atoms coordinate with the nitrogen of the carbon support, forming much stronger metal–support interactions than that of common N-doped carbon-supported metal nanoparticles. The activity of surface-activated Rh clusters is close to that of Pt/C. The regulation rules for the surface active sites inherit most of the characteristics of the corresponding single-atom catalysts, but without their severe instability problem. This surface activation strategy has also shown applicable to other PGMs, thereby it is a promising way to alleviate the reliance of PEMFCs on platinum.},

  abstract     = {The most prominent form of nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion is second harmonic generation (SHG), where incident light interacts with a nonlinear medium producing photons at double the input frequency, which has vast applications in material and biomedical science. Emerging two-dimensional nonlinear optical materials led by transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have fascinating optical and mechanical properties and are highly anticipated to overcome the technical limitations imposed by traditional bulky NLO materials. However, the atomic scale interaction length and low conversion efficiency in TMD materials prevent their further implementation in NLO applications. While some uniaxial strain-engineering studies intensively investigated the anisotropic SHG response in TMDs, they did not realize giant SHG enhancement by exploiting the opto-mechanical characteristics. Herein, we employ proton (H + ) irradiation to successfully fabricate large pressurized monolayer TMD domes ( d ≥ 10 μ m) and conduct a comprehensive investigation and characterization of their SHG performance enhancement. We show that the intensity of SHG is effectively enhanced by around two orders of magnitude at room temperature. Such giant enhancement arises from the distinct separation distance induced by capped pressurized gas and the hemi-spherical morphology, enabling constructive optical interference. Moreover, the unique divergent strain field in TMD domes promotes the first experimental study on the anisotropic nonlinear optical behavior based on biaxial strain conditions in terms of varying strain orientation and relative weights. Our work demonstrates a promising system with enhanced NLO performance and well-preserved biocompatibility, paving a way toward the future nano-scaled quantum optics design and biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, heterogeneous machine learning accelerators have become of significant interest to science, engineering, and industry. At the same time, the looming post-quantum encryption era instigates the demand for increased data security. From a hardware processing point of view, electronic computing hardware is challenged by electronic capacitive interconnect delay and associated energy consumption. In heterogeneous systems, such as electronic–photonic accelerators, parasitic domain crossings limit throughput and speed. With analog optical accelerators exhibiting a strong potential for high throughput (up to petaoperations per second) and operation efficiency, their ability to perform machine learning classification tasks on encrypted data has not been broadly recognized. This work is a significant step in that direction. Here, we present an optical hashing and compression scheme that is inspired by SWIFFT, a post-quantum hashing family of algorithms. High degree optical hardware-to-algorithm homomorphism allows one to optimally harvest the potential of free-space data processing: innate parallelism, low latency tensor by-element multiplication, and zero-energy Fourier transformation operations. The algorithm can provide several orders of magnitude increase in processing speed as compared to optical machine learning accelerators with non-compressed input. This is achieved by replacing slow, high-resolution CMOS cameras with ultra-fast and signal-triggered CMOS detector arrays. Additionally, information acquired in this way will require much lower transmission throughput, less in silico processing power, storage, and will be pre-hashed, facilitating optical information security. This concept has the potential to allow heterogeneous convolutional Fourier classifiers to approach the performance of their fully electronic counterparts and enables data classification on hashed data.},

However, a large number of individually designed elements with unique amplitude and phase modulation capabilities are often required to obtain a high-quality holographic image, which is a non-trivial task. In this paper, the deep-learning-aided inverse design of an acoustic metasurface-based hologram with millions of elements to reconstruct megapixel pictures is reported. To improve the imaging quality, an iterative compensation algorithm is proposed to remove the interference fringes and unclear details of the images. A megapixel image of Mona Lisa&#39;s portrait is reconstructed by a 2000 × 2000 metasurface-based hologram. Finally, the design is experimentally validated by a metasurface consisting 30 × 30 three-dimensional printed elements that can reproduce the eye part of Mona Lisa&#39;s portrait. It is shown that the sparse arrangement of the elements can produce high-quality images even when the metasurface has fewer elements than the targeted image pixels.},

Moreover, the new predominant strain, Omicron variant, manifests more similar clinical features to those of other common respiratory infections. The concurrent detection of multiple potential pathogens helps distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other diseases with overlapping symptoms, which is significant for providing tailored treatment to patients and containing the outbreak. Here, we report a lab-on-a-chip biosensing platform for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on the subwavelength grating micro-ring resonator. The sensing surface is functionalized by specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which could produce redshifts of resonant peaks by antigen–antibody combination, thus achieving quantitative detection. Additionally, the sensor chip is integrated with a microfluidic chip featuring an anti-backflow Y-shaped structure that enables the concurrent detection of two analytes. In this study, we realized the detection and differentiation of COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1. Experimental results indicate that the limit of detection of our device reaches 100 fg/ml (1.31 fM) within 15 min detecting time, and cross-reactivity tests manifest the specificity of the optical diagnostic assay. Furthermore, the integrated packaging and streamlined workflow facilitate its use for clinical applications. Thus, the biosensing platform presents a promising approach for attaining highly sensitive, selective, multiplexed, and quantitative point-of-care diagnosis and distinction between COVID-19 and influenza.},

Our experimental results over four crystal materials datasets (including formation energy, adsorption energy, total energy, and bandgap properties) show that the popular ensemble methods for uncertainty estimation are NOT always the best choice for UQ in materials property prediction. For the convenience of the community, all the source code and datasets can be accessed freely at https://github.com/usccolumbia/materialsUQ .},

The critical point of electronic nose to achieve good recognition ability, the fundament for applications, is the generation of high-quality signal characteristics that are transduced from each sensor unit, and aided with algorithm. However, chamber without uniform fluidic state introduce sensors&#39; locations caused artificial characteristics to make the recognition difficult, even incredible. Inspired by the structure of the nasal cavity, a small volume chamber with well-controlled fluidic behavior is designed and fabricated according to theoretical simulation. All the expected fluidic features, including uniform flow field and concentration field, are achieved, which are experimentally demonstrated by humidity and 2-hexanone detection using sensors arrays. The well controlled fluidic behaviors of volatile analytes help achieving the ultra-sensitive volatile organic compounds detection, which might shed a new light for e-nose technology to go over the gap between academics and industry.},

  abstract     = {To accurately reflect the movement of humans or robots, multi-sensor integration strategy is necessary to decouple complex deformations caused by motion in the wearable artificial kinesthetic perception system. The multi-sensor integration strategy could collect multi-dimension information, making up for the deficiency of robustness and accuracy of single sensor in complex motion scenes and extending the sensing capability of the system. However, the inevitable inconsistency between multiple sensors causes difficulties in fabrication, integration, and perception, limiting the development of artificial kinesthetic perception systems toward the direction of compact integration, large-area sensing, and high-resolution decoupling. Here, we propose a strategy to build an artificial kinesthetic perception system based on the differential design of homogeneous sensors. The strategy aims at guiding system design to avoid the inconsistency in multi-sensor integration by revealing the explicit relationship among structure, signal, and movements from the perspective of the physics model. According to the strategy, we presented a simple fabrication method of the kinesthetic perception prototype. The prototype with two homogenous sensors (0.019 56 residual on average) shows three differential signal modes to three deformations. With the help of machine learning, it realized the decoupling task to 25 kinds of complex deformations. The accuracy remains at 95\% even though the decoupling resolution is up to 0.2 mm. With more than one prototype arrayed, complex deformation composed with more kinds of basic deformation (shear and twist) could be further decoupled. We believe that the strategy described in this paper will contribute to the development of a compact and programmable kinesthetic perception system.},

  abstract     = {Olfaction is an evolutionary old sensory system, which provides sophisticated access to information about our surroundings. In particular, detecting the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during natural and artificial processes can be used as characteristic fingerprints and help to identify their source. Inspired by the biological example, artificial olfaction aims at achieving similar performance and thus digitizing the sense of smell. Here, we present the development of machine learning-enabled graphene-based electronic olfaction sensors and propose an approach to assess their olfactory performance toward VOCs. Eleven transient kinetic features extracted from the sensing response profile are utilized as their fingerprint information. By mimicking the Sniffin&#39; Sticks test, electronic olfaction sensors exhibit high olfactory performance toward four VOC odors (clove, eucalyptus, lemon, and rose scent) in terms of odor detection threshold, odor discrimination, and identification performance. Upon exposure to binary odor mixtures, response features of electronic olfaction sensors behave more similarly to that of an individual odor, with a tendency that correlates with their ratio, resembling the overshadowing effect in human olfactory perception. Molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations results reveal competing adsorption mechanisms between odorant molecules and sensing materials. This may facilitate electronic olfaction sensor applications in some emerging fields, such as environmental monitoring or public security.},

  abstract     = {The archetypical antiferroelectric, PbZrO 3 , is currently attracting a lot of interest, but no consensus can be clearly established on the nature of its ground state as well as on the influence of external stimuli over its physical properties. Here, the antiferroelectric state of 45-nm-thick epitaxial thin films of PbZrO 3 is established by observing the characteristic structural periodicity of antiparallel dipoles at the atomic scale, combined with clear double hysteresis of the polarization-electric field response related to antiferroelectric–to–ferroelectric phase transitions. Surprisingly, while the antiferroelectric state is identified as the ground state, temperature-dependent measurements show that a transition to a ferroelectric-like state appears in a large temperature window (100 K). Atomistic simulations further confirm the existence, and provides the origin, of such ferroelectric state in the films. Electric-field-induced ferroelectric transitions are also detected by the divergence of the piezoresponse force microscopy response. Using this technique, we further reveal the signature of a ferroelectric ground state for 4-nm-thick PbZrO 3 films. Compared with bulk crystals, these results suggest a more complex competition between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases in epitaxial thin films of PbZrO 3 .},

Here, an additional Ti contact layer is developed to minimize the electrical contact resistance to ∼4.8 Ω in an as-assembled thin-film device with 50 pairs of p–n junctions. A detailed interface characterization demonstrates that the low electrical contact resistance should be mainly attributed to the partial epitaxial growth of Bi2Te3-based thin-film materials. Correspondingly, the superlow electrical contact resistance facilitates the applicability of the out-of-plane thin-film device and results in an ultrahigh surface output power density of ∼81 μW cm−2 at a low temperature difference of 5 K. This study illustrates the Ti contact layer that strengthens the contact between Cu electrodes and Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric thin films mainly through partial epitaxial growth and contributes to high-performance thin-film thermoelectric devices.},

In this work, we focus on data bias arising from uneven coverage of materials families in existing knowledge. Observing different diversities among crystal systems in common materials databases, we propose an information entropy-based metric for measuring this bias. To mitigate the bias, we develop an entropy-targeted active learning (ET-AL) framework, which guides the acquisition of new data to improve the diversity of underrepresented crystal systems. We demonstrate the capability of ET-AL for bias mitigation and the resulting improvement in downstream machine learning models. This approach is broadly applicable to data-driven materials discovery, including autonomous data acquisition and dataset trimming to reduce bias, as well as data-driven informatics in other scientific domains.},

However, despite extensive efforts, the design of Ti3C2Tx MXene based semiconductor materials often depends on the availability of traditional semiconductors to form heterojunctions, where Ti3C2Tx MXene is still in metallic characters and is not in dominant status in the heterojunctions. Here, we demonstrate semiconducting Ti3C2Tx MXene modified with dodecyl (−C12H26) groups, as functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene possesses opened and typical layer-dependent bandgap. The new arising characteristics, red-shift of characteristic peaks, and intensity ratio of the A1g(C)/A1g(Ti, C, Tx) in Raman spectroscopy suggested the successful grafting of the −C12H26 groups on the Ti3C2Tx MXenes. In addition, the theoretical calculations by density functional theory, photoluminescence spectrum, together with photoelectric measurements of Ti3C2Tx-C12H26 MXene on different layers, show a tunable bandgap of 0.49–2.15 eV and superior photoresponse properties in fabricating near infrared photodetectors.},

  abstract     = {With the increased demand for hand-held and ambient gas sensors, it is imperative to develop sensors that can offer both selective and sensitive detection. Gas preconcentration is a widely tried and tested method to increase the sensitivity of gas detectors. While it effectively lowers the limit of detection, it does not impact the selectivity of the detector. Therefore, preconcentrator materials have mostly been used in conjunction with selective detectors. In this work, we use the preconcentration method with a nonselective small and portable photoionization detector to introduce selectivity. For this purpose, we use a relatively slow heating rate, that allows for gradual desorption and analytes from the preconcentrator material–nanoporous silica. The characteristic desorption temperature of the volatile organic compounds (VOC) from the preconcentrator allows selective detection of the VOC. In this work, we study the effect of surface functionalization, to make it hydrophobic, and observe the adsorption–desorption behavior of polar (isopropyl alcohol) and non-polar (octane) gas molecules. The hydrophobic silica surface was found to improve the adsorption of non-polar octane, while it reduced the adsorption of polar isopropyl alcohol. The desorption temperature for isopropanol remained unchanged for both functionalized and non-functionalized preconcentrators; however, the desorption temperature for octane increased by 10 °C when the functionalized hydrophobic pSiO2 was used. We also observed the presence of humidity, a known interferent, did not heavily impact the sensing performance. These results are promising evidence that functionalized porous silica integrated with a photoionization detector can be used for selective gas detection in the ambient atmosphere.},

Therefore, the magnetic field can switch magnetization reversibly. In contrast, the electric field is a time-even polar vector that cannot directly switch magnetization. For magnetic recording, an electrical coil-generated local magnetic field is used to switch the magnetic bit. However, in order to integrate the magnetic functionality, e.g., nonvolatile magnetic memory with high speed and low energy consumption, into the chip, it is essential to implement the magnetization switching by an electrical current, where the current induces other axial vectors through spin-transfer torque or spin–orbit torque (SOT). As an energy-efficient tool of magnetization switching, current-induced SOT has been intensively studied for the past decade, which holds great promise in the next generation of magnetic memories and magnetic logic devices [A.

The temporal dynamics of the excited states are instead quite challenging to explore, and, at the same time, crucial to study for understanding the origin of fundamental physical and chemical processes. In this review, we examine the current state and prospects of ultrafast phenomena driven by plasmons both from a fundamental and applied point of view. This research area is referred to as ultrafast plasmonics and represents an outstanding playground to tailor and control fast optical and electronic processes at the nanoscale, such as ultrafast optical switching, single photon emission, and strong coupling interactions to tailor photochemical reactions. Here, we provide an overview of the field and describe the methodologies to monitor and control nanoscale phenomena with plasmons at ultrafast timescales in terms of both modeling and experimental characterization. Various directions are showcased, among others recent advances in ultrafast plasmon-driven chemistry and multi-functional plasmonics, in which charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom are exploited to provide active control of the optical and electronic properties of nanoscale materials. As the focus shifts to the development of practical devices, such as all-optical transistors, we also emphasize new materials and applications in ultrafast plasmonics and highlight recent development in the relativistic realm.

  abstract     = {Double perovskite ferroelectric thin films are completely new material systems derived from single perovskite. Their diversity of composition and structure and the tendency for spontaneous atomic ordering broaden the path for the development of ferroelectric thin films. The ordered double perovskite ferroelectric thin films lead to excellent ferroelectric, dielectric, magnetic, and optical properties, promising further applications in photovoltaic cells, information memory, and spintronic and photoelectric devices, where the intrinsic coupling and tuning of multiple properties could also push it into multifunctional intersecting devices. However, complex internal physical mechanisms and difficult preparation conditions have prevented its further development. Based on ordered/disordered ferroelectric thin films of double perovskites, this paper first discusses ordered characterization methods such as superstructure reflection/diffraction peaks, especially for epitaxial thin films, saturation magnetization (macroscopic), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (microscopic). In response to the generally poor ordering of present systems, the paper also reviews the internal structure of the material and the external synthesis conditions that affect the ordering, including the valence and radii of the cations, preparation methods, element substitution and strain engineering, in the hope of triggering further research into ordered double perovskite ferroelectrics. Combined with the current state of research on existing double perovskite ferroelectricity thin film systems, advances in the fields of ferroelectric photovoltaics, magnetoelectric coupling, dielectric tunability, resistive switching, and photoelectric coupling have been presented. Finally, the challenges facing the material system are discussed and an outlook is provided for the development of the field.},

  abstract     = {In the last few years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have attracted immense research and industry attention for their application as light absorbers in solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Characterizing OIHP materials and optoelectronic devices using transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-based techniques has played a large role in understanding their structural, compositional, and electronic properties. However, the highly energetic and electrically charged electron beam radiation used in TEM can result in damage to the pristine structure, as OIHPs are unstable and highly sensitive to electron beams. This damage potentially obscures intrinsic information and leads to a serious misunderstanding of the microscopic structure–property–performance relationship for OIHP optoelectronic devices. To address this issue, we first review the electron and ion beam-induced degradation mechanism of OIHPs, followed by a review of the development of ultra-low-dose TEM techniques that can able to minimize this damage, thus can able to obtain reliable, intrinsic structural information about OIHPs from the atomic to micrometer length scales. Finally, we suggest a protocol for appropriate TEM specimen preparation and characterization techniques. This protocol can help ensure that future TEM studies of OIHPs give reliable information, thereby enabling a deeper understanding and optimization of the performance and long-term stability of OIHP optoelectronic devices.},

Therefore, realizing multicolor RTP in organic materials is still a huge challenge. In this review, we summarize recent advances in multicolor organic RTP materials, including the underlying luminescence mechanisms, design principles of multicolor phosphorescence, detailed photophysical behaviors, and their potential applications.

  abstract     = {There are a wide range of applications with ionizing radiation and a common theme throughout these is that accurate dosimetry is usually required, although many newer demands are provided by improved features in higher range, multi-spectral and particle type detected. Today, the array of dosimeters includes both offline and online tools, such as gel dosimeters, thermoluminescence (TL), scintillators, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), radiochromic polymeric films, gels, ionization chambers, colorimetry, and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement systems. Several future nanocomposite features and interpretation of their substantial behaviors are discussed that can lead to improvements in specific features, such as (1) lower sensitivity range, (2) less saturation at high range, (3) overall increased dynamic range, (4) superior linearity, (5) linear energy transfer and energy independence, (6) lower cost, (7) higher ease of use, and (8) improved tissue equivalence. Nanophase versions of TL and ESR dosimeters and scintillators each have potential for higher range of linearity, sometimes due to superior charge transfer to the trapping center. Both OSL and ESR detection of nanomaterials can have increased dose sensitivity because of their higher readout sensitivity with nanoscale sensing. New nanocrystalline scintillators, such as perovskite, have fundamentally important advantages in sensitivity and purposeful design for key new applications. Nanoparticle plasmon coupled sensors doped within a lower Z eff material have been an effective way to achieve enhanced sensitivity of many dosimetry systems while still achieving tissue equivalency. These nanomaterial processing techniques and unique combinations of them are key steps that lead to the advanced features. Each must be realized through industrial production and quality control with packaging into dosimetry systems that maximize stability and reproducibility. Ultimately, recommendations for future work in this field of radiation dosimetry were summarized throughout the review.},

  abstract     = {Disordered hyperuniform (DHU) states are recently discovered exotic states of condensed matter. DHU systems are similar to liquids or glasses in that they are statistically isotropic and lack conventional long-range translational and orientational order. On the other hand, they completely suppress normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations like crystals and, in this sense, possess a hidden long-range correlation. Very recently, there have been several exciting discoveries of disordered hyperuniformity in solid-state materials, including amorphous carbon nanotubes, amorphous 2D silica, amorphous graphene, defected transition metal dichalcogenides, defected pentagonal 2D materials, and medium/high-entropy alloys. It has been found that the DHU states of these materials often possess a significantly lower energy than other disorder models and can lead to unique electronic and thermal transport properties, which results from mechanisms distinct from those identified for their crystalline counterparts. For example, DHU states can enhance electronic transport in 2D amorphous silica; DHU medium/high-entropy alloys realize the Vegard&#39;s law and possess enhanced electronic bandgaps and thermal transport at low temperatures. These unique properties open up many promising potential device applications in optoelectronics and thermoelectrics. Here, we provide a focused review on these important new developments of hyperuniformity in solid-state materials, taking an applied and “materials” perspective, which complements the existing reviews on hyperuniformity in physical systems and photonic materials. Future directions and outlook are also provided, with a focus on the design and discovery of DHU quantum materials for quantum information science and engineering.},

Thus, the application of three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs), in which multiple chips are stacked vertically, provides the most achievable approach for the advancement of post-Moore electronics. In the recent decade, various key techniques have been developed for stacking chips vertically such as through-silicon vias, micro-bumps, low melting point tin–bismuth solders, redistribution layers, and copper-to-copper direct bonding. However, the need for high current densities in these structures results in severe Joule heating, making electromigration (EM) an increasingly challenging problem.

As it continues to evolve, demands on flexible conductive materials are becoming increasingly prominent. Liquid metals (LMs), which combine the compliance of fluids with the electrical conductivity of metals, are excellent candidates among various material options for fabricating flexible electronics. Following more than a decade of development, LM flexible electronics has become a rather promising research field. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary and interpretation of the typical progress in LM flexible electronics so as to promote further advancement in the area. First, modification strategies of LMs, such as oxidation and composite approaches (doped particles or mixed polymers), are systematically digested to improve their performances and increase the formability involved. Furthermore, we divide the LM flexible electronics into three major architectures (LM flexible electronics with channels, LM printed electronics, and LM/polymer flexible electronics) and introduce the core patterning methods for each type. In addition, we provide an overview of the representative applications of LM flexible electronics in the categories of soft sensors, biomedicine, flexible energy, electronic fabrics, etc. Finally, the current challenges and potential directions of LM flexible electronics are discussed. Overall, the past progress, current situation, and future outlook as outlined in full view in the present article is expected to inspire tremendous new opportunities for further fundamental research or practical explorations of LM flexible electronics in the coming time.},

  abstract     = {Pseudocapacitive (PC) materials are under investigation for energy storage in supercapacitors, which exhibit exceptionally high capacitance, good cyclic stability, and high power density. The ability to combine high electrical capacitance with advanced ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic properties in a single material at room temperature opens an avenue for the development of advanced magnetically ordered pseudocapacitive (MOPC) materials. This review covers materials science aspects, charge storage mechanisms, magnetocapacitance, and magnetoelectric (ME) phenomena in MOPC materials. Recent studies demonstrate high PC properties of advanced ferrimagnetic materials, such as spinel ferrites and hexagonal ferrites. Of particular importance is the discovery of PC properties of perovskite-type manganites, which exhibit room temperature ferromagnetism and giant negative magnetoresistance. The coupling of high capacitance and magnetization in MOPC provides a platform for strong ME interactions. Various strategies are used for manipulation of electrical capacitance/magnetization of MOPC by a magnetic field/electrode potential. Magnetocapacitance studies show significant increase in capacitance of MOPC under the influence of a magnetic field. Moreover, the application of a magnetic field results in enhanced energy density and power density, reduction of resistance, and improvement of cyclic stability. Such findings offer a potential of a breakthrough in the development of advanced supercapacitors. High magnetocapacitance and ME phenomena are linked to the influence of magnetic fields on electrolyte diffusion, structure of electrical double layer, charge transfer resistance, and variation of conductivity and magnetization of MOPC materials, which facilitate charge/discharge behavior. Various applications of ME effect in MOPC are discussed. Moreover, advantages of magnetocapacitive MOPC are described for applications in electronic and spintronic devices, supercapacitors, and devices for magnetically enhanced capacitive deionization of water.},

  abstract     = {Many important phenomena in quantum devices are dynamic, meaning that they cannot be studied using time-averaged measurements alone. Experiments that measure such transient effects are collectively known as fast readout. One of the most useful techniques in fast electrical readout is radio-frequency reflectometry, which can measure changes in impedance (both resistive and reactive) even when their duration is extremely short, down to a microsecond or less. Examples of reflectometry experiments, some of which have been realized and others so far only proposed, include projective measurements of qubits and Majorana devices for quantum computing, real-time measurements of mechanical motion, and detection of non-equilibrium temperature fluctuations. However, all of these experiments must overcome the central challenge of fast readout: the large mismatch between the typical impedance of quantum devices (set by the resistance quantum) and of transmission lines (set by the impedance of free space). Here, we review the physical principles of radio-frequency reflectometry and its close cousins, measurements of radio-frequency transmission and emission. We explain how to optimize the speed and sensitivity of a radio-frequency measurement and how to incorporate new tools, such as superconducting circuit elements and quantum-limited amplifiers into advanced radio-frequency experiments. Our aim is threefold: to introduce the readers to the technique, to review the advances to date, and to motivate new experiments in fast quantum device dynamics. Our intended audience includes experimentalists in the field of quantum electronics who want to implement radio-frequency experiments or improve them, together with physicists in related fields who want to understand how the most important radio-frequency measurements work.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous alkali and multivalent metal-ion batteries are practically advantageous for large-scale energy storage because of intrinsic safety and environmental friendliness. Drawbacks, however, include low energy density and short life because of limited electrochemical stability windows (ESWs) of aqueous electrolytes and rapid degradation of electrode materials with high water activity. Despite significant research, including water-in-salt and electrolyte additive(s), directed to the electrolyte to extend ESWs and to boost electrode stability, the practical application remains limited because of the present high cost and generally unsatisfactory performance. Although alkali and multivalent metal ions can have different coordinating structures with solvents and anions, electrolyte design strategies share fundamental mechanisms in either extending ESWs or achieving a passivation layer on the electrode material(s). Future development of aqueous batteries, therefore, is dependent on a systematic understanding and analysis of electrolyte research. Here, we report for the first time a systematic review of the design and engineering of emerging water-based electrolytes for boosted aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs) performance. We present a comparative summary of electrochemical stability windows and electrode/electrolyte interphases for five (5) electrolyte types; appraise strategies and the resulting impact of electrolyte properties on electrode interfacial stability; analyze in situ generated electrode/electrolyte interphases; classify advantages and drawbacks of selected strategies; and provide a perspective on future developments in aqueous alkali and multivalent metal-ion batteries, together with methods for the study of both electrolyte and derived interphase(s). We conclude that (1) the design of electrolytes of high concentration and hybrid and eutectic solvents are practically promising for high energy density ARBs; (2) there is a need to improve design for longer cycling life of ARBs; (3) research addresses boosting ESW of the electrolyte; and (4) it increased the understanding of the electrode/electrolyte interface stability via new electrode/electrolyte interphase structures. This review will be of benefit in the practical design of electrolyte(s) for aqueous batteries for high performance and, therefore, of interest to researchers and manufacturers.},

  abstract     = {X-ray computed microtomography (μCT) is an innovative and nondestructive versatile technique that has been used extensively to investigate bio-based systems in multiple application areas. Emerging progress in this field has brought countless studies using μCT characterization, revealing three-dimensional (3D) material structures and quantifying features such as defects, pores, secondary phases, filler dispersions, and internal interfaces. Recently, x-ray computed tomography (CT) beamlines coupled to synchrotron light sources have also enabled computed nanotomography (nCT) and four-dimensional (4D) characterization, allowing in situ, in vivo, and in operando characterization from the micro- to nanostructure. This increase in temporal and spatial resolutions produces a deluge of data to be processed, including real-time processing, to provide feedback during experiments. To overcome this issue, deep learning techniques have risen as a powerful tool that permits the automation of large amounts of data processing, availing the maximum beamline capabilities. In this context, this review outlines applications, synchrotron capabilities, and data-driven processing, focusing on the urgency of combining computational tools with experimental data. We bring a recent overview on this topic to researchers and professionals working not only in this and related areas but also to readers starting their contact with x-ray CT techniques and deep learning.},

  abstract     = {Surface biofunctionalization aims to create cell-instructive surfaces that control the behavior of cells and modulate cellular interactions by incorporating cell signaling moieties at the materials–biosystem interface. Despite advances in developing bioinert and biocompatible materials, blood clotting, inflammation, and cell death continue to be observed upon the contact of foreign materials with living tissues leading to the materials&#39; rejection. Specific examples include the application of foreign materials in implantable devices (e.g., bone implants, antimicrobial surfaces, and cardiovascular stents), biosensors, drug delivery, and 3D-bioprinting. Biofunctionalization of materials to date has been predominantly realized using wet chemical approaches. However, the complexity of wet chemistry, toxicity of reactants, waste disposal issues, reaction time, poor reproducibility, and scalability drive a need for a paradigm shift from wet chemical approaches to dry methods of surface biofunctionalization. Plasma-based technologies that enable covalent surface immobilization of biomolecules have emerged as dry, reagent-free, and single-step alternatives for surface biofunctionalization. This review commences by highlighting the need for bioinstructive surfaces and coatings for various biomedical applications such as bone implants, antimicrobial surfaces, biosensors, and 3D-bioprinted structures, followed by a brief review of wet chemical approaches for developing biofunctionalized surfaces and biomimetic devices. We then provide a comprehensive review of the development of plasma-based technologies for biofunctionalization, highlighting the plasma–surface interactions and underpinning mechanisms of biomolecule immobilization.},

  abstract     = {Photonic crystals enable modulation of light waves in space, time, and frequency domains; in particular, chiral photonic crystals are uniquely suitable for polarization rotation and switching of complex vector fields. Current development of chiral photonic crystals, nevertheless, are still confronted with limitations of one form or the other such as large optical losses, limited or absence of tunability, narrow operation bandwidth, and/or insufficient optical thickness for practical implementation. In this work, we show that cholesteric liquid crystals as 1D tunable chiral photonic crystals are promising alternatives to not only address all these issues and deficiencies but also enable new photonic applications in wider temporal and spectral realms. Our work entails a detailed study of the dynamical evolution of cholesteric helical self-assembly and defect formation in the bulk of thick cholesteric liquid crystals under various applied electric field conditions and a thorough exploration of how applying fields of vastly different frequencies can eliminate and/or prevent the formation of unremovable defects and to control the alignment of cholesteric helices in the entire bulk. We have developed a dual-frequency field assembly technique that enables robust room-temperature fabrication of stable well-aligned cholesteric liquid crystals to unprecedented thickness (containing thousands of grating periods) demanded by many photonic applications. The resulting chiral photonic crystals exhibit useful much-sought-after capabilities impossible with other existing or developing chiral photonic crystals —compactness (single, flat, millimeter-thick optical element), high transmission, dynamic tunability, large polarization rotation, and various switching/modulation possibilities for ultrafast and continuous-wave lasers in the visible, near- and mid-infrared regimes.},

Here, we demonstrate a direct single-source measurement of the absolute nonlinearity of single-photon detectors with unprecedented accuracy. We discover a surprising supralinear behavior of single-photon avalanche diodes and show that it cannot be explained using known theoretical models. We also fully characterize sub- and supra-linear operation regimes of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and uncover the supralinearity under faint continuous illumination. The results identify new detector anomalies that supersede existing knowledge of nonlinear effects at the single-photon level.},

Here, we report for the first time the confinement of chiral liquid crystal formulations by an interface formed by ionic liquid molecules. The resultant self-assembled ionic liquid/liquid crystal droplets are simultaneously immobilized on a gelatin matrix. The droplets feature a rich variety of unique topological states. We explored, by means of polarizing optical microscopy, the various droplet optical textures and categorized them with regard to their relative chirality parameter. We further investigated their optical response in the presence of gas analytes and discussed their potential utilization as dynamic liquid crystal-based optical VOC sensors.

  abstract     = {Osteocalcin (OC), an abundant non-collagenous protein in bone extracellular matrix, plays a vital role in both its biological and mechanical function. OC undergoes post-translational modification, such as glycation; however, it remains unknown whether glycation of OC affects bone&#39;s resistance to fracture. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the formation of pentosidine, an advanced glycation end-product (AGE) cross-link on mouse OC analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Next, we establish that the presence of OC in mouse bone matrix is associated with lower interlamellar separation (distance) and thicker bridges spanning the lamellae, both of which are critical for maintaining bone&#39;s structural integrity. Furthermore, to determine the impact of modification of OC by glycation on bone toughness, we glycated bone samples in vitro from wild-type (WT) and osteocalcin deficient (Oc −/− ) mice, and compared the differences in total fluorescent AGEs and fracture toughness between the Oc −/− glycated and control mouse bones and the WT glycated and control mouse bones. We determined that glycation resulted in significantly higher AGEs in WT compared to Oc −/− mouse bones (delta-WT &gt; delta-OC, p = 0.025). This observed change corresponded to a significant decrease in fracture toughness between WT and Oc −/− mice (delta-WT vs delta-OC, p = 0.018). Thus, we propose a molecular deformation and fracture mechanics model that corroborates our experimental findings and provides evidence to support a 37\%–90\% loss in energy dissipation of OC due to formation of pentosidine cross-link by glycation. We anticipate that our study will aid in elucidating the effects of a major non-collagenous bone matrix protein, osteocalcin, and its modifications on bone fragility and help identify potential therapeutic targets for maintaining skeletal health.},

However, the path to manufacturing scalability remains challenging because of the difficulties in controlling etch morphology (e.g., porosity and aggregation) and etch rate uniformity over a large area. Here, we report the first programmable vapor-phase MacEtch (VP-MacEtch) approach, with independent control of the etchant flow rates, injection and pulse time, and chamber pressure. In addition, another degree of freedom, light irradiation is integrated to allow photo-enhanced VP-MacEtch. Various silicon nanostructures are demonstrated with each of these parameters systematically varied synchronously or asynchronously, positioning MacEtch as a manufacturing technique for versatile arrays of three-dimensional silicon nanostructures.

Therefore, developing a reconfigurable device including synaptic and neuronal functions in a single chip with same homotypic materials and structures is highly desired. Based on the room-temperature out-of-plane and in-plane intercorrelated polarization effect of 2D α-In 2 Se 3 , we designed a reconfigurable hardware platform, which can switch from continuously modulated conductance for emulating synapse to spiking behavior for mimicking neuron. More crucially, we demonstrate the application of such proof-of-concept reconfigurable 2D ferroelectric devices on a spiking neural network with an accuracy of 95.8\% and self-adaptive grow-when required network with an accuracy of 85\% by dynamically shrinking its nodes by 72\%, which exhibits more powerful learning ability and efficiency than the static neural network.},

  abstract     = {Li + electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs) have attracted significant attention as artificial synapses because of the fast response of Li + ion, low operating voltage, and applicability to flexible electronics. Due to the inherent nature of Li + ion, Li + EGTs show, however, limitations, such as poor long-term synaptic plasticity and nonlinear/nonsymmetric conductance update, which hinder the practical applications of artificial synapses. Herein, Li + EGTs integrated with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) ferroelectric polymer as a channel–electrolyte interlayer are presented. Owing to the polarized domains of PVDF-TrFE, the transport of Li + ions at the channel–electrolyte interface is accelerated, and Li + ions effectively penetrate the channel. Moreover, the self-diffusion of Li + ions from the channel to the electrolyte is suppressed by the downward polarized domains. Li + EGTs, therefore, successfully demonstrate synaptic characteristics, including excitatory postsynaptic current, short-/long-term synaptic plasticity, and paired-pulse facilitation. Also, conductance update in Li + EGTs shows a dynamic range ( G max / G min ) of 92.42, high linearity, and distinct stability over 100 cycles. Based on their synaptic characteristics, inference simulations using a convolution neural network for the CIFAR-10 dataset imply that Li + EGTs are suitable as artificial synapses with an inference accuracy of 89.13\%. The new methodological approach addressing modulation of ion dynamics at the interface is introduced for developing practical synaptic devices.},

However, the present understanding of their recombination processes and trap states within the devices are still limited, which is also inevitable in the state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells with multiple passivation strategies and various additives involved. Recent works have also demonstrated that metal cations incorporated perovskites could potentially reduce the non-radiative losses and improve the device performance to some extent. However, the underlying “doping” mechanism is not clear. In this work, we systematically investigated the trap-induced ultra-long carrier lifetime of the metal cation incorporated perovskites and found that some specific cations could extend the carrier lifetime up to ∼100 μ s, which could be correlated with the formation of shallow trap states. In addition, such shallow trap-mediated charge dynamics could be effectively probed with light-biased time-resolved microwave conductivity technique, which provides additional information to conventional time-resolved photoluminescence.},

However, TMDs-based field-effect transistors are still far from delivering the expected performance, which is mainly attributed to their high contact resistance and low saturation velocity ( v sat ). In this work, we report high-performance short-channel WS 2 transistors based on bandgap engineering. The bilayer WS 2 channel not only shows a higher average field-effect mobility ( μ FE ) than the monolayer channel but also exhibits excellent metal-Ohmic contact using a regular physical vapor deposition deposited Ni/Au contact, reducing the R c value to a record low value of 0.38 kΩ · μ m without any intentional doping. The bilayer WS 2 device of the 80 nm channel exhibits a high on-state current of 346 μ A/ μ m at V ds = 1 V, near-zero drain-induced barrier lowering, and a record high I on / I off ratio over 10 9 . Furthermore, a record high on-state current of 635 μ A/ μ m at V ds = 1 V and a record high v sat of 3.8 × 10 6 cm/s have been achieved for a shorter 18 nm channel device, much higher than previous WS 2 transistors. This work reveals the intrinsically robust nature of bilayer WS 2 crystals with promising potential for integration with conventional fabrication processes.},

  abstract     = {Tin halide perovskites are among the candidates for replacing lead-based ones for less toxicity and comparable optical properties. However, stability remains a challenge due to the easier oxidation of Sn 2+ than Pb 2+ . Here, for the first time, we applied the ligand-assisted reprecipitation method to synthesize CH(NH 2 ) 2 SnI 3 (FASnI 3 ) orthorhombic perovskite nanocrystals with an average diameter of 7.7 nm and a photoluminescence emission at 825 ± 2 nm (1.5 eV). The influence of synthesis parameters, including precursor solvent, precipitation media, temperature, and time on optical properties of nanocrystals, was studied. By incorporating SnF 2 , the stability of the nanocrystals was improved, and the oxidation from FASnI 3 to FA 2 SnI 6 was significantly delayed, which was quantitively demonstrated and confirmed by observing the characteristic diffraction peaks of the perovskite phase using x-ray diffraction at various exposure time to air. The addition of SnF 2 is optimized to be 6\%. The FASnI 3 nanocrystals stayed stable for at least 265 days under N 2 storage at room temperature and relative humidity of 20\%.},

To achieve enhanced energy storage density, maximum polarization (P max ) and breakdown strength (E b ) need to be improved simultaneously. However, these two key parameters are inversely correlated. In this study, order–disorder transition induced polar nanoregions have been achieved in PbZrO 3 thin films by making use of the low-energy ion implantation, enabling us to overcome the trade-off between high polarizability and breakdown strength, which leads to the tripling of the energy storage density from 20.5 to 62.3 J/cm 3 as well as the great enhancement of breakdown strength. This approach could be extended to other dielectric oxides to improve the energy storage performance, providing a new pathway for tailoring the oxide functionalities.},

  abstract     = {As a promising third-generation semiconductor, gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ) is currently facing bottleneck for its p-type doping. The doping process of conventional semiconductors usually introduces trace impurities, which is a major technical problem in the electronics industry. In this article, we conceived that the process complexity could be significantly alleviated, and a high degree of control over the results could be attained using the selective enrichment of liquid metal interfaces and harvesting the doped metal oxide semiconductor layers. An appropriate mechanism is thus proposed to prepare the doped semiconducting based on multicomponent liquid metal alloys. Liquid metal alloys with the certain Cu weight ratios in bulk are utilized to harvest Cu-doped Ga 2 O 3 films, which result in p-type conductivity. Then, field-effect transistors were integrated using the printed p and n-type Ga 2 O 3 films and demonstrated to own excellent electrical properties and stability. Au electrodes fabricated on the printed Ga 2 O 3 and Cu-doped Ga 2 O 3 layers showed good Ohmic behavior. Furthermore, high-power diodes are realized using printed p and n-type Ga 2 O 3 homojunction through combining van der Waals stacking with transfer printing. The fabricated Ga 2 O 3 homojunction diode exhibited good efficiency at room temperature, involving a rectification ratio of 10 3 and forward current density at 10 V (J@10 V) of 1.3 mA. This opens the opportunity for the cost-effective creation of semiconductor films with controlled metal dopants.

Taking advantage of the unique properties of the nanoprinting technology, such as flexibly varying the width, height, and gap distance of each individual element, we realize different polymeric axial-symmetric structures, such as double-pitch gratings and aperiodic arrays, placed on the facet of commercial step-index fibers. Of particular note is the aperiodic geometry, enabling an unprecedentedly high average coupling efficiency across the entire angular range up to 80°, outperforming regular gratings and especially bare fibers by orders of magnitude. The excellent agreement between simulation and experiment clearly demonstrates the quality of the fabricated structures and the high accuracy of the nanoprinting process. Our approach enables realizing highly integrated and ready-to-use fiber devices, defining a new class of compact, flexible, and practically relevant all-fiber devices beyond the state-of-art. Applications can be found in a variety of cutting-edge fields that require highly efficient light collection over selected angular intervals, such as endoscopy or quantum technologies. Furthermore, fiber functionalization through nanoprinting represents a promising approach for interfacing highly complex functional photonic structures with optical fibers.},

However, autonomous approaches developed in these contexts are difficult to apply to high-dimensional mapping technologies, such as scanning hyperspectral imaging of biological systems, due to sample complexity and heterogeneity. We briefly cover the history of adaptive sampling algorithms and surrogate modeling in order to define autonomous adaptive data acquisition as an objective-based, flexible building block for future biological imaging experimentation driven by intelligent infrastructure. We subsequently summarize the recent implementations of autonomous adaptive data acquisition (AADA) for scanning hyperspectral imaging, assess how these address the difficulties of autonomous approaches in hyperspectral imaging, and highlight the AADA design variation from a goal-oriented perspective. Finally, we present a modular AADA architecture that embeds AADA-driven flexible building blocks to address the challenge of time resolution for high-dimensional scanning hyperspectral imaging of nonequilibrium dynamical systems. In our example research-driven experimental design case, we propose an AADA infrastructure for time-resolved, noninvasive, and label-free scanning hyperspectral imaging of living biological systems. This AADA infrastructure can accurately target the correct state of the system for experimental workflows that utilize subsequent expensive, high-information-content analytical techniques.},

  abstract     = {Quantum mechanical band-to-band tunneling is a type of carrier injection mechanism that is responsible for the electronic transport in devices like tunnel field effect transistors (TFETs), which hold great promise in reducing the subthreshold swing below the Boltzmann limit. This allows scaling down the operating voltage and the off-state leakage current at the same time, and thus reducing the power consumption of metal oxide semiconductor transistors. Conventional group IV or compound semiconductor materials suffer from interface and bulk traps, which hinder the device performance because of the increased trap-induced parasitics. Alternatives like two-dimensional materials (2DMs) are beneficial for realizing such devices due to their ultra-thin body and atomically sharp interfaces with van der Waals interactions, which significantly reduce the trap density, compared to their bulk counterparts, and hold the promise to finally achieve the desired low-voltage operation. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on such devices, with a major focus on heterojunctions made of different 2DMs. We review different types of emerging device concepts, architectures, and the tunneling mechanisms involved by analytically studying various simulations and experimental devices. We present our detailed perspective on the current developments, major roadblocks, and key strategies for further improvements of the TFET technology based on 2D heterojunctions to match industry requirements. The main goal of this paper is to introduce the reader to the concept of tunneling especially in van der Waals devices and provide an overview of the recent progress and challenges in the field.},

  abstract     = {We present SuperConga, an open-source framework for simulating equilibrium properties of unconventional and ballistic singlet superconductors, confined to two-dimensional (2D) mesoscopic grains in a perpendicular external magnetic field, at arbitrary low temperatures. It aims at being both fast and easy to use, enabling research without access to a computer cluster, and visualization in real-time with OpenGL. The core is written in C++ and CUDA, exploiting the embarrassingly parallel nature of the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity by utilizing the parallel computational power of modern graphics processing units. The framework self-consistently computes both the superconducting order-parameter and the induced vector potential and finds the current density, free energy, induced flux density, local density of states (LDOS), and the magnetic moment. A user-friendly Python frontend is provided, enabling simulation parameters to be defined via intuitive configuration files, or via the command-line interface, without requiring a deep understanding of implementation details. For example, complicated geometries can be created with relative ease. The framework ships with simple tools for analyzing and visualizing the results, including an interactive plotter for spectroscopy. An overview of the theory is presented, as well as examples showcasing the framework&#39;s capabilities and ease of use. The framework is free to download from https://gitlab.com/superconga/superconga , which also links to the extensive user manual, containing even more examples, tutorials, and guides. To demonstrate and benchmark SuperConga, we study the magnetostatics, thermodynamics, and spectroscopy of various phenomena. In particular, we study flux quantization in solenoids, vortex physics, surface Andreev bound-states, and a “phase crystal.” We compare our numeric results with analytics and present experimental observables, e.g., the magnetic moment and LDOS, measurable with, for example, scanning probes, STM, and magnetometry.},

This paper aims to describe acoustic streaming-based acoustofluidics and provide readers with an unbiased perspective to determine which IDT structural designs and techniques are most suitable for their research. This review, first, qualitatively and quantitatively introduces underlying physics of acoustic streaming.

Acoustic streaming-related methodologies and the corresponding biomedical applications are highlighted and discussed, according to either standing surface acoustic waves or traveling surface acoustic waves generated, and also sessile droplets or continuous fluids used. Traveling SAW-based acoustofluidics generate various physical phenomena including mixing, concentration, rotation, pumping, jetting, nebulization/atomization, and droplet generation, as well as mixing and concentration of liquid in a channel/chamber. Standing SAWs induce streaming for digital and continuous acoustofluidics, which can be used for mixing, sorting, and trapping in a channel/chamber.

Next-generation BMIs require long-term stable recording and modulation of electrical signals from statistically significant neuron populations with millisecond single-cell spatiotemporal resolution. However, there are challenges to achieving this stability due to the mechanical and geometrical mismatches between electronics and the brain tissue. In addition, the requirement to achieve cell-type-specific neuromodulation and transmit and process the ever-increasing volume of data on-the-fly necessitates the implementation of smart electronics. In this review, we first summarize the requirements, challenges, and current limitations of BMIs. We then highlight three major approaches to the fabrication of flexible electronics as implantable electronics, aimed at enabling long-term stable and gliosis-free BMIs. The progress of multifunctional electronics for multimodal recording and modulation of cell-type-specific components in the brain is also discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of wireless and closed-loop modulation, and on-chip processing as smart electronic components for BMIs.

The electrochemical processes `that cause these changes are also difficult to probe because of their metastability and lifetimes, which can be of nanosecond to sub-nanosecond time domains.

Recent progress is very promising, where optical spectroscopies, synchrotron radiation techniques, and energy-specific atom probe tomography and microscopy methods are just some of the approaches that are unraveling the true internal behavior of battery cells in real-time. In this review, we overview many of the most promising nondestructive methods developed in recent years to assess battery material properties, interfaces, processes, and reactions under operando conditions similar in electrodes and full cells.},

  abstract     = {Graphene oxide (GO), a mostly known oxidized derivative of graphene, which possesses two-dimensional (2D) topological nature and good dispersity in multiple common solvents as a single layer, has shown unique molecular science and fluid physics. Assembling 2D GO macromolecules into a variety of carbonaceous architectures is recognized as an important nanotechnology to address the challenge of translating the unprecedented mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of graphene into a macroscopic level. To realize real-world applications of graphene-based materials, sophisticated architecture manipulation spanning from the nanoscale, mesoscale to macroscale is essential to make sure every atom is at the right place. It takes comprehensive understanding of the compositional chemistry, fluid physics, and solid-state physics of 2D GO and graphene. Much effort in studying the graphene solid-state materials has helped people build perspectives on their structure-property relations. Nevertheless, the molecular science and fluid physics of GO that governs the single molecular behavior and collective effects of sheets still lack exploration. Single GO sheet exhibits both colloid behaviors and molecule conformations, which can be viewed as a 2D colloidal macromolecule with special dynamic aggregate and transition behaviors in solvents. Focusing on this topic, we have summarized recent progress in the science, technology, and engineering of 2D GO colloidal macromolecules with particular focus on intriguing features of molecular conformation, lyotropic liquid crystal, slow relaxation behavior, reversible fusion and fission, etc. Novel solvation-triggered hydroplastic processing for graphene-based macroscopic materials will be introduced, followed by the structural principles for high-performance graphene macroscopic materials. Finally, we will wrap up the topic with some perspectives on future research directions and give our opinions on the roadmap toward graphene industrialization.},

  abstract     = {As a fundamental optical approach to interferometry, Sagnac interference has been widely used for reflection manipulation, precision measurements, and spectral engineering in optical systems. Compared to other interferometry configurations, it offers attractive advantages by yielding a reduced system complexity without the need for phase control between different pathways, thus offering a high degree of stability against external disturbance and a low wavelength dependence. The advance of integration fabrication techniques has enabled chip-scale Sagnac interferometers with greatly reduced footprint and improved scalability compared to more conventional approaches implemented by spatial light or optical fiber devices. This facilitates a variety of integrated photonic devices with bidirectional light propagation, showing new features and capabilities compared to unidirectional-light-propagation devices, such as Mach–Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) and ring resonators (RRs). This paper reviews functional integrated photonic devices based on Sagnac interference. First, the basic theory of integrated Sagnac interference devices is introduced, together with comparisons to other integrated photonic building blocks, such as MZIs, RRs, photonic crystal cavities, and Bragg gratings. Next, the applications of Sagnac interference in integrated photonics, including reflection mirrors, optical gyroscopes, basic filters, wavelength (de)interleavers, optical analogues of quantum physics, and others, are systematically reviewed. Finally, the open challenges and future perspectives are discussed.},

A PCE of 9.7\% in 2012 was swiftly improved to 25.7\% in 2022 via perovskite composition engineering and grain size control. The excellent photovoltaic performance originates from the defect-tolerant property of organic lead halide perovskite associated with the antibonding nature of the valence band. Nevertheless, the reduction of defect-induced trap density of the state is still required to improve further photovoltaic performance and stability. Among the methods reported to reduce defects, additive engineering is one of the promising strategies for controlling crystallographic defects because it can regulate crystallization kinetics and grain boundaries. In this review, we describe materials and methods for additive engineering applied to lead-based perovskite. In addition, the effects of additive engineering on photovoltaic performance and stability are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Compact interferometers based on waveguiding structures have found countless applications in refractive index measurements, chemical sensing, as well as temperature and pressure measurements. The most common fiber devices are based on Mach–Zehnder interferometry and Michelson interferometry—two design concepts that can readily be implemented using simple fiber optic components, such as mode splitters and combiners, fiber optic gratings, and fiber tapers, among others. Fiber interferometry can also be conducted based on the Sagnac effect and the Young (double-slit) interferometer. In this review, we examine and compare over 400 fiber optic interferometers as well as more than 60 fiber optic refractive sensors based on fiber optic cavities. Even though many of the devices show temperature-, strain-, and pressure-sensitivity, we focus our review on refractive index measurements, as these are the most common applications. Many devices were characterized by their inventors using their sensitivity to refractive index changes. While the sensitivity is an important characteristic of the device, it does not easily relate to the smallest resolvable refractive index change or the limit of detection when applied to chemical measurements. Instead, we propose here that one should use the figure of merit, which is defined through the refractive index sensitivity and the width of an interferometer fringe. Using simple assumptions, we were able to mathematically relate the sensitivity and the figure of merit to common design parameters, such as the length of the interferometer arms, the operating wavelength, refractive indices of the fiber and the sample, as well as an overlap parameter, which describes the fraction of the guided wave in the sensing arm that interacts with the sample. We determined this overlap parameter for each reviewed device from the reported interferograms. Our meta-analysis provides for the first time simple and easily applicable guidance to increase the figure of merit of fiber optic interferometers and fiber optic cavities with regard to their ability to detect small refractive index changes. A high figure of merit allows measuring very small refractive index changes such as those of gases at different pressures or of very dilute solutions.},

As the NANs become more architecturally and functionally diverse to accommodate introduction into living systems, there is a need to understand how critical design features can be controlled to impart desired performance in vivo . In this review, we survey the range of nucleic acid materials utilized as structural building blocks (DNA, RNA, and xenonucleic acids), the diversity of geometries for nanofabrication, and the strategies to functionalize these complexes.

  abstract     = {When impinging on optical structures or passing in their vicinity, free electrons can spontaneously emit electromagnetic radiation, a phenomenon generally known as cathodoluminescence. Free-electron radiation comes in many guises: Cherenkov, transition, and Smith–Purcell radiation, but also electron scintillation, commonly referred to as incoherent cathodoluminescence. While those effects have been at the heart of many fundamental discoveries and technological developments in high-energy physics in the past century, their recent demonstration in photonic and nanophotonic systems has attracted a great deal of attention. Those developments arose from predictions that exploit nanophotonics for novel radiation regimes, now becoming accessible thanks to advances in nanofabrication. In general, the proper design of nanophotonic structures can enable shaping, control, and enhancement of free-electron radiation, for any of the above-mentioned effects. Free-electron radiation in nanophotonics opens the way to promising applications, such as widely tunable integrated light sources from x-ray to THz frequencies, miniaturized particle accelerators, and highly sensitive high-energy particle detectors. Here, we review the emerging field of free-electron radiation in nanophotonics. We first present a general, unified framework to describe free-electron light–matter interaction in arbitrary nanophotonic systems. We then show how this framework sheds light on the physical underpinnings of many methods in the field used to control and enhance free-electron radiation. Namely, the framework points to the central role played by the photonic eigenmodes in controlling the output properties of free-electron radiation (e.g., frequency, directionality, and polarization). We then review experimental techniques to characterize free-electron radiation in scanning and transmission electron microscopes, which have emerged as the central platforms for experimental realization of the phenomena described in this review. We further discuss various experimental methods to control and extract spectral, angular, and polarization-resolved information on free-electron radiation. We conclude this review by outlining novel directions for this field, including ultrafast and quantum effects in free-electron radiation, tunable short-wavelength emitters in the ultraviolet and soft x-ray regimes, and free-electron radiation from topological states in photonic crystals.},

In past decades, the main motivation in spintronics has been to discover new mechanisms and novel material systems to improve both device performance and the application prospects of spintronics. Recently, researchers have found that ferrimagnetic materials—in which sublattices are coupled antiferromagnetically—offer an emerging platform for realizing high-density, high-speed, and low-power-consumption memory and logic functions. Within such a ferrimagnetic class, vanishing magnetization and ultrafast magnetic dynamics can be achieved by adjusting chemical composition and temperature, among other parameters. Meanwhile, unlike for antiferromagnets, conventional electrical read–write methods remain suitable for ferrimagnets, which is beneficial for applications. In this review, an abundant class of ferrimagnets including oxides and alloys is surveyed, and unique magnetic dynamics and effective methods for manipulating the magnetic states of ferrimagnets are discussed.
