  abstract = {Mixing Gibbs energy and phase equilibria of aqueous solutions of polyglycine were studied theoretically by means of polymer reference interaction site model integral equation theory combined with the Gibbs–Duhem method. In addition to the ordinary liquid–liquid phase separation between dilute and concentrated solutions, the theoretical calculation predicted the coexistence of two coacervate phases, namely, the lower- and higher-density coacervates. The relative thermodynamic stabilities of these two phases change with the polymerization degree of polyglycine. The higher-density coacervate phase was rapidly stabilized by increasing the polymer length, and the lower-density phase became metastable at large polymers. The hydrogen bonds between the peptide chains were strengthened, and water was thermodynamically destabilized in the higher-density coacervate. A possible relation with the formation of amyloid fibril within a liquid droplet is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Polymer blends are critical in many commercial products and industrial processes and their phase behavior is therefore of paramount importance. In most circumstances, such blends are formulated with samples of high dispersity, which have generally only been studied at the mean-field level. Here, we extend the renormalized one-loop theory of concentration fluctuations to account for blends of disperse polymers. Analyzing the short and long length-scale fluctuations in a consistent manner, various measures of polymer molecular weight and dispersity arise naturally in the free energy. Thermodynamic analysis in terms of moments of the molecular weight distribution(s) provides exact results for the inverse susceptibility and demonstrates that the theory is not formally renormalizable. However, physically motivated approximations allow for an “effective” renormalization, yielding (1) an effective interaction parameter, χ e , which depends directly on the sample dispersities (i.e., M w / M n ) and leaves the form of the mean-field spinodal unchanged, and (2) an apparent interaction parameter χ a that depends on higher-order dispersity indices, for instance M z / M w , and characterizes the true limits of blend stability accounting for long-range off-critical fluctuations. We demonstrate the importance of dispersity on several example systems, including both “toy” models that may be realized in computer simulation and more realistic industrially relevant blends. We find that the effects of long-range fluctuations are particularly prominent in blends where the component dispersities are mismatched, especially when there is a small quantity of the high-dispersity species. This can be understood as a consequence of the shift in the critical concentration(s) from the monodisperse value(s).},

  abstract = {The electrostatic double layer force is key to determining the stability and self-assembly of charged colloids and many other soft matter systems. Fully understanding the attractive force between two like-charged surfaces remains a great challenge. Here, we apply the modified Gaussian renormalized fluctuation theory to study ion correlation-driven like-charge attraction in multivalent salt solutions. The effects of spatially varying ion correlations on the structure of overlapping double layers and their free energy are self-consistently accounted for. In the presence of multivalent salts, increasing surface charge or counterion valency leads to a short-range attraction. We demonstrate that although both overcharging and like-charge attraction are outcomes of ion correlation, there is no causal relationship between them. Our theory also captures the non-monotonic dependence of like-charge attraction on multivalent salt concentration. The reduction of attraction at high salt concentrations could be a contributing factor toward the reentrant stability of charged colloidal suspensions. Our theoretical predictions are consistent with the observations reported in experiments and simulations.},

Our simulation approach combines the relative entropy coarse-graining of small-scale atomistic simulations with large-scale field-theoretic simulations, allowing us to efficiently compute the free energy of micelle formation necessary for the CMC calculation while preserving chemistry-specific information about the underlying surfactant building blocks. We apply this methodology to a unique intrinsically disordered protein platform capable of a wide variety of tailored sequences that enable tunable micelle self-assembly. The computational predictions of the CMC closely match experimental measurements, demonstrating the potential of molecularly informed field theories as a valuable tool to investigate self-assembly in bio-based macromolecules systematically.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of a soft particle suspended in a viscous fluid can be changed by the presence of an elastic boundary. Understanding the mechanisms and dynamics of soft–soft surface interactions can provide valuable insights into many important research fields, including biomedical engineering, soft robotics development, and materials science. This work investigates the anomalous transport properties of a soft nanoparticle near a visco-elastic interface, where the particle consists of a polymer assembly in the form of a micelle and the interface is represented by a lipid bilayer membrane. Mesoscopic simulations using a dissipative particle dynamics model are performed to examine the impact of micelle’s proximity to the membrane on its Brownian motion. Two different sizes are considered, which correspond to ≈ 10 − 20 n m in physical units. The wavelengths typically seen by the largest micelle fall within the range of wavenumbers where the Helfrich model captures fairly well the bilayer mechanical properties. Several independent simulations allowed us to compute the micelle trajectories during an observation time smaller than the diffusive time scale (whose order of magnitude is similar to the membrane relaxation time of the largest wavelengths), this time scale being hardly accessible by experiments. From the probability density function of the micelle normal position with respect to the membrane, it is observed that the position remains close to the starting position during ≈ 0.05 τ d (where τ d corresponds to the diffusion time), which allowed us to compare the negative excess of mean-square displacement (MSD) to existing theories. In that time range, the MSD exhibits different behaviors along parallel and perpendicular directions. When the micelle is sufficiently close to the bilayer (its initial distance from the bilayer equals approximately twice its gyration radius), the micelle motion becomes quickly subdiffusive in the normal direction. Moreover, the temporal evolution of the micelle MSD excess in the perpendicular direction follows that of a nanoparticle near an elastic membrane. However, in the parallel direction, the MSD excess is rather similar to that of a nanoparticle near a liquid interface.},

  abstract = {Polymer chains at a buried interface with an inorganic solid play a critical role in the performance of polymer nanocomposites and adhesives. Sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy with a sub-nanometer depth resolution provides valuable information regarding the orientation angle of functional groups at interfaces. However, in the case of conventional SFG, since the signal intensity is proportional to the square of the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility and thereby loses phase information, it cannot be unambiguously determined whether the functional groups face upward or downward. This problem can be solved by phase-sensitive SFG (ps-SFG). We here applied ps-SFG to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) chains in direct contact with a quartz surface, shedding light on the local conformation of chains adsorbed onto the solid surface. The measurements made it possible to determine the absolute orientation of the ester methyl groups of PMMA, which were oriented toward the quartz interface. Combining ps-SFG with all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulation, the distribution of the local conformation and the driving force are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Polyrotaxanes, which consist of mechanically interlocked bonds with rings threaded onto soft polymer chains, exhibit unique mechanical properties and find applications in diverse fields. In this study, we investigate the anomalous segmental dynamics of supercooled polyrotaxane melts using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations reveal that the presence of rings effectively reduces the packing efficiency, resulting in well-contained local motion even below the glass transition temperature. We also observe variations in dynamical free volume, characterized by the Debye–Waller factor, which shows a minimum at a ring coverage of 0.1 on threading chains. Such a non-monotonic dependence on coverage shows great consistency in structural relaxation time and dynamic heterogeneity. Specifically, the high segmental mobility of threading linear chains at large coverage can be attributed to the increased dynamical free volume due to supported rigid rings. However, such anomalous segmental dynamics is limited to length scales smaller than one ring size. Beyond this characteristic length scale, the diffusion is dominated by topological constraints, which significantly reduce the mobility of polyrotaxanes and enhance the dynamic heterogeneity. These findings offer microscopic insights into the unique packing structures and anomalous segmental dynamics of supercooled polyrotaxane melts, facilitating the design of advanced materials based on mechanical interlocking polymers for various applications.},

Here, we explore photoluminescence (PL) from ZnO nanorods (ZNRs) embedded with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). A progressive increase in Au NP concentration introduces significant structural disorder and defects in ZNRs, which paradoxically quenches defect related visible PL while intensifying the near band edge (NBE) emission. Under UV excitation, the simulated semi-classical model realizes PL from ZnO with sub-bandgap defect states, eliciting visible emissions that are absorbed by Au NPs to generate a non-equilibrium hot carrier distribution. The photo-stimulated hot carriers, transferred to ZnO, substantially modify its steady-state luminescence, reducing NBE emission lifetime and altering the abundance of ionized defect states, finally reducing visible emission. The simulations show that the change in the interfacial band bending at the Au–ZnO interface under optical illumination facilitates charge transfer between the components. This work provides a general foundation to observe and model the hot carrier dynamics and strong light–matter interactions in hybrid plasmonic systems.},

These entities can be effectively utilized to finely tune optical properties or as preferential sites for functionalization. Bibenzyl, being isostructural with other members of this class, represents the ideal system for building co-crystals from which we can synthesize double-core nanothreads wherein bridging chromophores, such as the azo or ethylene moieties, are embedded in the desired concentration within a fully saturated environment. To achieve this, a critical step is the preliminary characterization of the high-pressure behavior of crystalline bibenzyl. We report here an accurate investigation performed through state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques, Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction up to 40 GPa. Our findings reveal a strongly anisotropic compression of the crystal, which determines, at pressures between 1 and 2 GPa, consistent modifications of the vibrational spectrum, possibly related to a torsional distortion of the molecules. A phase transition is detected between 9 and 10 GPa, leading to a high pressure phase where, above 24 GPa, the nanothread formation is observed. However, the observed reaction was limited in extent and required significantly higher pressures in comparison to other members of the pseudo-stilbene family. This comprehensive study is imperative in laying the foundation for future endeavors, aiming to synthesize double-core nanothreads from pseudo-stilbene crystals, and provides crucial insights into the high-pressure behavior and phase transitions of crystalline bibenzyl.},

The exploitation technology of natural gas hydrates is one of the main focuses of hydrate-related studies. In this study, a large-size liquid aqueous solution wrapping a methane hydrate system was established and molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the phase equilibrium conditions of methane hydrate at different methane concentrations and interfacial geometries. It is found that the methane concentration of a solution significantly affects the phase equilibrium of methane hydrates. Different methane concentrations at the same temperature and pressure can lead to hydrate formation or decomposition. At the same temperature and pressure, in a system reaching equilibrium, the size of spherical hydrate clusters is coupled to the solution concentration, which is proportional to the Laplace pressure at the solid–liquid interface. Lower solution concentrations reduce the phase equilibrium temperature of methane hydrates at the same pressure; as the concentration increases, the phase equilibrium temperature gradually approaches the actual phase equilibrium temperature. In addition, the interfacial geometry of hydrates affects the thermodynamic stability of hydrates. The spherical hydrate particles have the highest stability for the same volume. Through this study, we provide a stronger foundation to understand the principles driving hydrate formation/dissociation relevant to the exploitation of methane hydrates.},

Structural properties of the studied DIL, i.e., radial distribution functions (RDFs), structure factor, and hydrogen-bond network, showed that compared to 0.8*OPLS-2009IL FF, there is a much better agreement between the results of both OPLS-2009IL and OPLS-VSIL FFs with the AIMD simulation. On the other hand, the results of dynamical properties, such as mean square displacements, van Hove correlation functions as well as hydrogen bond, ion pair, and ion cage dynamics, depicted that in both 0.8*OPLS-2009IL and OPLS-VSIL FFs, the dynamics of the system is almost similar, and compared to OPLS-2009IL FF, they have better agreements with experimental results where they exist. So, it can be seen that although reducing the total charge of studied DIL by 20\% leads to an increase in the dynamics of the system, the type distribution of partial charges on each atom does not significantly affect the system’s dynamics. The calculated infrared (IR) and power spectra showed that the vibrational features of studied DIL in three OPLS-based FFs are mostly the same and reducing total charge and different type distribution of partial charges have no significant effect on the studied system. Furthermore, in volumetric properties, OPLS-VSIL FF shows somehow better agreement with experimental results. Overall, the evaluation of different structural, dynamical, vibrational, and volumetric properties of [C 3 (mim) 2 ][NTF 2 ] 2 DIL shows that the OPLS-VSIL FF may be the best choice among the different studied OPLS FFs.},

  abstract = {Homogeneous solar fuels photocatalytic systems often require several additives in solution with the catalyst to operate, such as a photosensitizer (PS), Brønsted acid/base, and a sacrificial electron donor (SED). Tertiary amines, in particular triethylamine (TEA) and triethanolamine (TEOA), are ubiquitously deployed in photocatalysis applications as SEDs and are capable of reductively quenching the PS’s excited state. Upon oxidation, TEA and TEOA form TEA •+ and TEOA •+ radical cations, respectively, which decay by proton transfer to generate redox non-innocent transient radicals, TEA • and TEOA • , respectively, with redox potentials that allow them to participate in an additional electron transfer step, thus resulting in net one-photon/two-electron donation. However, the properties of the TEA • and TEOA • radicals are not well understood, including their reducing powers and kinetics of electron transfer to catalysts. Herein, we have used both pulse radiolysis and laser flash photolysis to generate TEA • and TEOA • radicals in CH 3 CN, and combined with UV/Vis transient absorption and time-resolved mid-infrared spectroscopies, we have probed the kinetics of reduction of the well-established CO 2 reduction photocatalyst, fac -ReCl(bpy)(CO) 3 (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine), by these radicals [ k TEA• = (4.4 ± 0.3) × 10 9 M −1 s −1 and k TEOA• = (9.3 ± 0.6) × 10 7 M −1 s −1 ]. The ∼50× smaller rate constant for TEOA • indicates, that in contrast to a previous assumption, TEA • is a more potent reductant than TEOA • (by ∼0.2 V, as estimated using the Marcus cross relation). This knowledge will aid in the design of photocatalytic systems involving SEDs. We also show that TEA can be a useful radiolytic solvent radical scavenger for pulse radiolysis experiments in CH 3 CN, effectively converting unwanted oxidizing radicals into useful reducing equivalents in the form of TEA • radicals.},

  abstract = {Previously, the multisolute osmotic virial equation with the combining rules of Elliott et al. has been shown to make accurate predictions for multisolute solutions with only single-solute osmotic virial coefficients as inputs. The original combining rules take the form of an arithmetic average for the second-order mixed coefficients and a geometric average for the third-order mixed coefficients. Recently, we derived generalized combining rules from a first principles solution theory, where all mixed coefficients could be expressed as arithmetic averages of suitable binary coefficients. In this work, we empirically extended the new model to account for electrolyte effects, including solute dissociation, and demonstrated its usefulness for calculating the properties of multielectrolyte solutions. First, the osmotic virial coefficients of 31 common salts in water were tabulated based on the available freezing point depression (FPD) data. This was achieved by polynomial fitting, where the degree of the polynomial was determined using a special criterion that accounts for the confidence intervals of the coefficients. Then, the multisolute model was used to predict the FPD of 11 ternary electrolyte solutions. Furthermore, models with the new combining rules and the original combining rules of Elliott et al. were compared using both mole fraction and molality as concentration units. We find that the mole-fraction-based model with the new combining rules performs the best and that the results agree well with independent experimental measurements with an all-system root-mean-square error of 0.24 osmoles/kg (0.45 °C) and close to zero mean bias for the entire dataset (371 data points).},

  abstract = {The first-order molecular hyperpolarizability ( β ) dispersion was measured in seven chalcone-based molecules utilizing the tunable femtosecond hyper-Rayleigh scattering (tHRS) technique. Additionally, a theoretical model based on photophysical parameters was employed to better understand β dispersion. Due to the distinct substitution patterns of the aryl/heteroaryl rings within the chalcone structure, varying profiles of one- and two-photon absorption spectra and β dispersion were observed. The applied model highlighted two important factors contributing to achieving high β values: (i) the presence of red-shifted one-photon and two-photon absorption bands; and (ii) the number of discernible absorption bands. To contextualize these results with other molecular structures, we employed the HRS figure of merit (FOM). Remarkably, it was revealed that chemically engineered small chalcone molecules exhibit a FOM comparable to larger quadrupolar and octupolar ones. This underscores the significance of tHRS scattering measurements and their correlation with absorptive parameters in the design and characterization of nonlinear optical materials.},

Although Au-nanoalloys have promising applications, our atomistic understanding of the descriptors that drive their stability is far from satisfactory. To address this problem, we considered 55-atom model nanoalloys that have been synthesized by experimental techniques. Here, we combined data mining techniques for creating a large sample of representative configurations, density functional theory for performing total energy optimizations, and Spearman correlation analyses to identify the most important descriptors. Among our results, we have identified trends in core–shell formation in the AuCu and AuPd systems and an onion-like design in the AuAg system, characterized by the aggregation of gold atoms on nanocluster surfaces. These features are explained by Au’s surface energy, packing efficiency, and charge transfer mechanisms, which are enhanced by the alloys’ preference for adopting the structure of the alloying metal rather than the low-symmetry one presented by Au 55 . These generalizations provide insights into the interplay between electronic and structural properties in gold nanoalloys, contributing to the understanding of their stabilization mechanisms and potential applications in various fields.},

Two sets of TCPS spectra for 1\% NO, diluted in different buffer gases at 295 K and 1 atm, were obtained with the pump beam tuned to the R 11 (11.5) and O P 12 (1.5) transitions. The buffer gases were He, Ar, and N 2 . The probe was scanned while the pump beam was tuned to the line center. Theoretical TCPS spectra, calculated by solving the density matrix formulation of the time-dependent Schrödinger wave equation, were compared with the experimental spectra. A collision model based on the modified exponential-gap law was used to model the rotational level-to-rotational level collision dynamics. A model for collisional transfer from an initial to a final Zeeman state was developed based on the difference in cosine of the rotational quantum number J projection angle with the z-axis for the two Zeeman states. Rotational energy transfer rates and Zeeman state collisional dynamics were varied to obtain good agreement between theory and experiment for the two different TCPS pump transitions and for the three different buffer gases. One key finding, in agreement with quasi-classical trajectory calculations, is that the spin-rotation changing transition rate in the A 2 Σ + level of NO is almost zero for rotational quantum numbers ≥8. It was necessary to set this rate to near zero to obtain agreement with the TCPS spectra.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitors (EDLCs) with ionic liquid electrolytes outperform conventional ones using aqueous and organic electrolytes in energy density and safety. However, understanding the electrochemical behaviors of ionic liquid electrolytes under compressive/tensile strain is essential for the design of flexible EDLCs as well as normal EDLCs, which are subject to external forces during assembly. Despite many experimental studies, the compression/stretching effects on the performance of ionic liquid EDLCs remain inconclusive and controversial. In addition, there is hardly any evidence of prior theoretical work done in this area, which makes the literature on this topic scarce. Herein, for the first time, we developed an atomistic model to study the processes underlying the electrochemical behaviors of ionic liquids in an EDLC under strain. Constant potential non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are conducted for EMIM BF 4 placed between two graphene walls as electrodes. Compared to zero strain, low compression of the EDLC resulted in compromised performance as the electrode charge density dropped by 29\%, and the performance reduction deteriorated significantly with a further increase in compression. In contrast, stretching is found to enhance the performance by increasing the charge storage in the electrodes by 7\%. The performance changes with compression and stretching are due to changes in the double-layer structure. In addition, an increase in the value of the applied potential during the application of strain leads to capacity retention with compression revealed by the newly performed simulations.},

Their high-pressure phase diagrams are very complicated and controversial, and even some parts have not been characterized yet. In this study, we investigate the sequence of pressure driven structural phase transitions up to 100 GPa in these tungstate and molybdate families via first-principles structure predictions. Based on our structural predictions, it is possible for isostructural tungstates and molybdates to exhibit a phase transition sequence that is either similar or identical. Examples of these compounds are CaWO 4 , CaMoO 4 , and CdMoO 4 , in addition to EuWO 4 and EuMoO 4 . However, the phase transition sequences of some tungstates and molybdates, especially those with different divalent cations, display noteworthy variations, revealing the intricate influence of ionic radii and electronic properties on crystal configurations. To obtain a deeper understanding of the high-pressure phase transition behavior of tungstates and molybdates, we analyze the high-pressure phase diagrams of MgWO 4 , SrWO 4 , and CaMoO 4 , representative examples of wolframite-type tungstate, scheelite-type tungstate, and scheelite-type molybdate, respectively, using x-ray powder diffraction. Our x-ray diffraction experiments and structure predictions consistently verify that the orthorhombic Cmca phase is a high-pressure phase of SrWO 4 . Structural configurations and mechanical properties of these predicted structures are discussed, and electronic properties are given.

  abstract = {Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT) typically works well for describing dynamic correlation. Two other types of correlation, arising in the cases of degenerate (static) or quasidegenerate (nondynamic) zero-order states, represent a difficult problem for DFT. When symmetry is present, multiplet sum method (MSM) DFT [Ziegler et al. , Theor. Chim. Acta 4 , 877 (1977)] provides one of the earliest and simplest ways to include static correlation in DFT. MSM-DFT assumes that DFT provides a good description of single-determinant energies and uses symmetry and simple ansätze to include the effects of static correlation. This is equivalent to determining the off-diagonal matrix elements in a small configuration interaction (CI) eigenvalue problem. Our ultimate goal, however, is nondynamic correlation in cases where symmetry is inadequate for fixing the dynamic-correlation limitation of DFT. To this end, we have developed a diagrammatic approach to MSM-DFT, which does not, by itself, solve the nondynamic correlation problem in DFT but which facilitates comparison with wave function CI and so allows educated guesses of off-diagonal CI matrix elements even in the absence of symmetry. In every case, an additional exchange-only ansatz (EXAN) allows the MSM-DFT formulas to be transformed into wave function formulas. This EXAN also works for transforming time-dependent DFT into time-dependent Hartree–Fock. Although not enough to uniquely guess DFT formulas from wave function formulas, the diagrammatic approach and the EXAN provide important constraints on any guesses that might be used. We illustrate how diagrammatic MSM-DFT may be used to guess a nondynamic correlation correction for the dissociation of H 2 and how diagrammatic MSM-DFT may be used to guess a nonsymmetry-based coupling element in the O 2 multiplet problem, which is reasonably close to a previous symmetry-derived result.},

Reaction cross sections as a function of kinetic energy over about a three order of magnitude range were studied for all systems. The reaction of U + + CO 2 proceeds to form UO + + CO with an efficiency of 118\% ± 24\% as well as generating UO 2 + + C and UCO + + O. The reaction of UO + + O 2 forms UO 2 + in an exothermic, barrierless process and also results in the collision-induced dissociation of UO + to yield U + . In the UO + + CO reaction, the formation of UO 2 + in an endothermic process is the dominant reaction, but minor products of UCO + + O and U + + (O + CO) are also observed. Analysis of the kinetic energy dependences observed provides the bond energies, D 0 (U + –O) = 7.98 ± 0.22 and 8.05 ± 0.14 eV, D 0 (U + –CO) = 0.73 ± 0.13 eV, and D 0 (OU + –O) = 7.56 ± 0.12 eV. The values obtained for D 0 (U + –O) and D 0 (OU + –O) agree well with the previously reported literature values. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental measurement of D 0 (U + –CO).

  abstract = {New six-dimensional ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the N 2 –CO 2 complex, which involve the stretching vibration of N 2 and the Q 3 normal mode for the ν 3 asymmetric stretching vibration of CO 2 , were constructed using the CCSD(T)-F12/AVTZ method with midpoint bond functions. Two vibrational averaged 4D interaction potentials were obtained by integrating over the two intramolecular coordinates. It was found that both PESs possess two equivalent T-shaped global minima as well as two in-plane and one out-of-plane saddle points. Based on these PESs, rovibrational bound states and energy levels were calculated applying the radial discrete variable representation/angular finite basis representation method and the Lanczos algorithm. The splitting of the energy levels between o N 2 –CO 2 and p N 2 –CO 2 for the intermolecular vibrational ground state is determined to be only 0.000 09 cm −1 due to the higher barriers. The obtained band origin shift is about +0.471 74 cm −1 in the N 2 –CO 2 infrared spectra with CO 2 at the ν 3 zone, which coincides with the experimental data of +0.483 74 cm −1 . The frequencies of the in-plane geared-bending for N 2 –CO 2 at the ν 3 = 0 and 1 states of CO 2 turn out to be 21.6152 and 21.4522 cm −1 , the latter reproduces the available experimental 21.3793 cm −1 value with CO 2 at the ν 3 zone. The spectral parameters fitted from the rovibrational energy levels show that this dimer is a near prolate asymmetric rotor. The computed microwave transitions as well as the infrared fundamental and combination bands for the complex agree well with the observed data.},

  abstract = {Although it plays a critical role in the photophysics and catalysis of lanthanides, spin–orbit coupling of electrons on individual lanthanide atoms in small clusters is not well understood. The major objective of this work is to probe such coupling of the praseodymium (Pr) 4f and 6s electrons in Pr 2 O 2 and Pr 2 O 2 + . The approach combines mass-analyzed threshold ionization spectroscopy and spin–orbit multiconfiguration second-order quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. The energies of six ionization transitions are precisely measured; the adiabatic ionization energy of the neutral cluster is 38 045 (5) cm −1 . Most of the electronic states involved in these transitions are identified as spin–orbit coupled states consisting of two or more electron spins. The electron configurations of these states are 4f 4 6s 2 for the neutral cluster and 4f 4 6s for the singly charged cation, both in planar rhombus-type structures. The spin–orbit splitting due to the coupling of the electrons on the separate Pr atoms is on the order of hundreds of wavenumbers.},

  abstract = {Endohedral metal–metal-bonding fullerenes have recently emerged, in which encapsulated metals form a metal–metal bond. However, the physical reasons why some metal elements prefer to form metal–metal bonds inside fullerene are still unclear. Herein, we reported first-principles calculations on electronic structures, bonding properties, dynamics, and thermodynamic stabilities of endohedral metallofullerenes M 2 @C 82 (M = Sc, Y, La, Lu). Multiple bonding analysis approaches unambiguously reveal the existence of one two-center two-electron σ covalent metal–metal bond in M 2 @C 82 (M = Sc, Y, Lu); however, the La–La bonding interaction in La 2 @C 82 is weaker and could not be categorized as one metal–metal covalent bond. The energy decomposition analysis on bonding interactions between an encapsulated metal dimer and fullerene cages suggested that there exist two electron-sharing bonds between a metal dimer and fullerene cages. The reasons why La 2 prefers to donate electrons to fullerene cages rather than form a standard σ covalent metal–metal bond are mainly attributed to two following facts: La 2 has a lower ionization potential, while the hybridization of n s , (n − 1) d , and n p atomic orbitals in La 2 is higher. Ab initio molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the M–M bond length at room temperature follows the trend of Sc &lt; Lu &lt; Y. The statistical thermodynamics calculations at different temperatures reveal that the experimentally observed endohedral metal–metal-bonding fullerenes M 2 @C 82 have high concentrations in the endohedral fullerene formation temperature range.},

  abstract = {The reactions of Cl, Br, and I with Na n=2,3 produced in a supersonic expansion form Na 2 * and Na* excited states extending across the visible and ultraviolet regions. Emission in the region extending from 410 to 600 nm indicates selectively formed excited state Na 2 emission features. Experimental evidence suggests that this emission is associated with Na 3 + X reactions. Broadband (0.5 cm −1 ) laser measurements demonstrate gain (population inversion) for select features at∼524–528(1\%), ∼492(0.3\%), and ∼458.7–461(0.8\%) nm. Single mode (0.007 cm −1 ) measurements extending from 528.03 to 527.63 nm demonstrate amplification involving five to six individual rovibronic levels with a maximum gain close to 3\% recorded at 527.9 nm. The observed gain is associated with select transitions from levels of the Na 2 1 1 Π u state populated, via identified curve crossings, through collision induced transfer from long-lived Na 2 2 1 Σ g + and 1 1 Π g reservoir states. Collision induced population buildup in the lowest vibrational levels of these reservoir states and collision induced transfer to the Na 2 1 1 Π u state create a population inversion in transitions to the X 1 Σ g + state of Na 2 . The observed amplification is aided by rapid vibrational and rotational relaxation in both the Na 2 ground and excited reservoir states producing amplifiers in the visible region like the HF amplifier in the infrared. This study suggests the importance of reaction populated and energy storing long-lived reservoir states in small sodium molecule combustion processes and indicates the potential for providing new short wavelength visible and ultraviolet amplifiers for future laser-based chemical propulsion concepts.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate an approach to two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) that combines the benefits of shot-to-shot detection at high-repetition rates with the simplicity of a broadband white light continuum input and conventional optical elements to generate phase-locked pump pulse pairs. We demonstrate this through mutual synchronization between the laser repetition rate, the acousto-optical deflector, the pump delay stage, and the CCD line camera, which allows for rapid scanning of pump optical delay synchronously with the laser repetition rate, while the delay stage is moved at a constant velocity. The resulting shot-to-shot detection scheme is repetition rate scalable and only limited by the CCD line rate and the maximum stage velocity. Using this approach, we demonstrate the measurement of an averaged 2DES absorptive spectrum in as much as 1.2 s of continuous sample exposure per 2D spectrum. We achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 6.8 for optical densities down to 0.05 with 11.6 s of averaging at 100 kHz laser repetition rate. Combining rapid scanning of mechanical delay lines with shot-to-shot detection as demonstrated here provides a viable alternative to acousto-optic pulse shaping approaches that is repetition-rate scalable, has comparable throughput and sensitivity, and minimizes sample exposure per 2D spectrum with promising micro-spectroscopy applications.},

The design, experimental protocol, and performance of a multimodal and versatile flow reactor for the characterization of powdered and immobilized photocatalysts are herein presented. Ultimately, this instrument enables rigorous evaluation of photocatalysis performance metrics. The apparatus quantifies transient gas-phase reaction products via online real-time gas analyzer mass spectrometry (RTGA-MS). For H 2 , the most challenging gas, the photocatalytic system’s RTGA-MS gas detection sensitivity spans over three orders of magnitude and can detect down to tens of parts per million under atmospheric conditions. Using Pt nanoparticles supported on anatase TiO 2 photocatalyst via wet impregnation, the instrument’s capability for the characterization of photocatalytic H 2 evolution is demonstrated, resulting in an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 48.1\% ± 0.9\% at 320 nm, 45.7\% ± 0.3\% at 340 nm and 31\% ± 1\% at 360 nm. The photodeposition of Pt on anatase TiO 2 was employed to demonstrate the instrument’s capability to track the transient behavior of photocatalysts, resulting in an improved 55\% ± 2\% AQY for H 2 evolution at 340 nm from aqueous methanol. This photocatalytic instrument enables systematic study of a wide variety of photocatalytic reactions such as water splitting and CO 2 reduction to valuable C2+ fuels and chemicals.},

  abstract = {The scattering of H by I is a prototypical model system for light-heavy scattering in which relativistic coupling effects must be taken into account. Scattering calculations depend strongly on the accuracy of the potential energy surface (PES) model. The methodology to obtain such an accurate PES model suitable for scattering calculations is presented, which includes spin–orbit (SO) coupling within the Effective Relativistic Coupling by Asymptotic Representation (ERCAR) approach. In this approach, the SO coupling is determined only for the atomic states of the heavy atom, and the geometry dependence of the SO effect is accounted for by a diabatization with respect to asymptotic states. The accuracy of the full model, composed of a Coulomb part and the SO model, is achieved in the following ways. For the SO model, the extended ERCAR approach is applied, which accounts for both intra -state and inter -state SO coupling, and an extended number of diabatic states are included. The corresponding coupling constants for the SO operator are obtained from experiments, which are more accurate than computed values. In the Coulomb Hamiltonian model, special attention is paid to the long range behavior and accurate c 6 dispersion coefficients. The flexibility and accuracy of this Coulomb model are achieved by combining partial models for three different regions. These are merged via artificial neural networks, which also refine the model further. In this way, an extremely accurate PES model for hydrogen iodide is obtained, suitable for accurate scattering calculations.},

Meta-generalized gradient approximations (mGGAs), which include the kinetic energy density in the functional form, have been shown to significantly alleviate this deficiency. In this study, we explore the mechanisms responsible for this improvement from the angle of the underlying local densities. We find that the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied states are distinct in the space of the underlying descriptors. The gap opening is compared to a simple scaling of the local density approximation, and two mechanisms responsible for opening the mGGA gaps are identified. First of all, the relatively large negative derivative of the functional form with respect to reduced kinetic energy tends to elevate the lowest unoccupied state. Second, the curvature of functional, which ensures that it is bounded, tends to lower the highest occupied state. Remarkably, these two mechanisms are found to be transferable over a large and diverse database of compounds.},

A fully automatic framework has been implemented for this purpose, capable of generating well-polished computational grids, performing the necessary ab initio calculations, conducting machine learning (ML) assisted force field (FF) parametrization, and extending existing FF parameters by incorporating new atom types. For the ML-assisted parametrization of NICE-FF, interaction energies of ∼18 000 dimer geometries (with IE &lt; 0) were used, and the best fit gave a mean square deviation of about 0.46 kcal/mol. During this parametrization, atom types apparent in four deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) bases have been first trained using the generated DNA base datasets. Both uracil and hypoxanthine, which contain the same atom types found in DNA bases, have been considered as test molecules. Three new atom types have been added to the DNA atom types by using IE datasets of both pyrazinamide and 9-methylhypoxanthine. Finally, the last test molecule, theophylline, has been selected, which contains already-fitted atom-type parameters. The performance of NICE-FF has been investigated on the S22 dataset, and it has been found that NICE-FF outperforms the well-known FFs by generating the most consistent IEs with the high-level ab initio ones. Moreover, NICE-FF has been integrated into our in-house developed crystal structure prediction (CSP) tool [called FFCASP (Fast and Flexible CrystAl Structure Predictor)], aiming to find the experimental crystal structures of all considered molecules. CSPs, which were performed up to 4 formula units ( Z ), resulted in NICE-FF being able to locate almost all the known experimental crystal structures with sufficiently low RMSD 20 values to provide good starting points for density functional theory optimizations.},

While exploring the numerical validity of the theoretical framework, we construct diabatic Hamiltonians for the five low-lying electronic states ( ⁠ X ̃ 2 E 1 g ⁠ , B ̃ 2 E 2 g ⁠ , and C ̃ 2 A 2 u ⁠ ) of benzene radical cation ( C 6 H 6 + ) along three different approaches of contour integration over two dimensional nuclear planes constituted by seven non-adiabatically active normal modes. Three different diabatic surface matrices are further employed to generate the photoelectron spectra of the benzene molecule (C 6 H 6 ). It is interesting to note that the spectral peak positions and intensity patterns for all three cases are almost close to each other and also exhibit very good agreement with the experimental results.},

In this paper, within the framework of milestoning, exact expressions for committor functions at two levels of coarse graining are given, including committor functions of phase space point to point (CFPP) and milestone to milestone (CFMM). When combined with transition kernels obtained from trajectory analysis, these expressions can be utilized to accurately and efficiently compute the committor functions. Furthermore, based on the calculated committor functions, an adaptive algorithm is developed to gradually refine the transition state region.

  abstract = {While dark transitions made bright by molecular motions determine the optoelectronic properties of many materials, simulating such non-Condon effects in condensed phase spectroscopy remains a fundamental challenge. We derive a Gaussian theory to predict and analyze condensed phase optical spectra beyond the Condon limit. Our theory introduces novel quantities that encode how nuclear motions modulate the energy gap and transition dipole of electronic transitions in the form of spectral densities. By formulating the theory through a statistical framework of thermal averages and fluctuations, we circumvent the limitations of widely used microscopically harmonic theories, allowing us to tackle systems with generally anharmonic atomistic interactions and non-Condon fluctuations of arbitrary strength. We show how to calculate these spectral densities using first-principles simulations, capturing realistic molecular interactions and incorporating finite-temperature, disorder, and dynamical effects. Our theory accurately predicts the spectra of systems known to exhibit strong non-Condon effects (phenolate in various solvents) and reveals distinct mechanisms for electronic peak splitting: timescale separation of modes that tune non-Condon effects and spectral interference from correlated energy gap and transition dipole fluctuations. We further introduce analysis tools to identify how intramolecular vibrations, solute–solvent interactions, and environmental polarization effects impact dark transitions. Moreover, we prove an upper bound on the strength of cross correlated energy gap and transition dipole fluctuations, thereby elucidating a simple condition that a system must follow for our theory to accurately predict its spectrum.},

  abstract = {This study looked for a way to evaluate the validity of previously suggested models for describing the spin-selective recombination of radical pairs. As an example, for analysis, we used the conventional model, the model by Jones and Hore [Chem. Phys. Lett. 488 , 90 (2010)], and the model by Salikhov [Am. J. Phys. Chem. 11, 67 (2022)]. To do this, analytical solutions to the evolution of the radical pair density matrix due to a radical pair’s spin-selective recombination and singlet–triplet transitions in a strong magnetic field were obtained for the conventional model and the Jones and Hore model. Spin interactions included in the Hamiltonian were time-independent exchange interactions as well as Zeeman and hyperfine interactions. The most striking difference between the models’ predictions appeared when considering the fraction of singlet pairs among all currently existing ones. In the Jones and Hore model, this ratio has the form of damped oscillations for any values of the spin-hamiltonian parameters. The conventional model and the Salikhov model both predicted that this ratio had the form of undamped oscillations in the absence of exchange interaction and at a sufficiently low recombination rate. Besides, the conventional model predicts the possibility of a resonance-like behavior of this ratio when singlet–triplet transitions in a part of the radical pair ensemble are completely suppressed by tuning the magnetic field strength. Possible experimental conditions in which distinguishing between the models seems to be most straightforward were suggested.},

  abstract = {The adiabatic connection interaction strength interpolation (ISI)-like method provides a high-level expression for the correlation energy, being, in principle, exact not only in the weak-interaction limit, where it recovers the second-order Görling–Levy perturbation term, but also in the strong-interaction limit that is described by the strictly correlated electron approach. In this work, we construct a genISI functional made accurate for the uniform electron gas, a solid-state physics paradigm that is a very difficult test for ISI-like correlation functionals. We assess the genISI functional for various jellium spheres with the number of electrons Z ≤ 912 and for the non-relativistic noble atoms with Z ≤ 290. For the jellium clusters, the genISI is remarkably accurate, while for the noble atoms, it shows a good performance, similar to other ISI-like methods. Then, the genISI functional can open the path using the ISI-like method in solid-state calculations.},

We use umbrella sampling to compute the free-energy cost of a critical nucleus and use forward flux sampling for the direct estimation of nucleation rates. For moderate to strong disorder, our results indicate that the size of the nucleating cluster is not a good reaction coordinate, contrary to the pure Ising model. We rectify this problem by introducing a coordinate that also accounts for the location of the nucleus. Using the free energy barrier to predict the nucleation rate, we find reasonable agreement, although deviations become stronger as disorder increases. We attribute this effect to cluster shape fluctuations. We also discuss finite-size effects on the nucleation rate.},

The KS formalism can be symmetrized in a rigorous way only in real space, only in spin space, or both in real and spin space. Within such symmetrized KS frameworks, we present exact-exchange-only optimized-effective-potential (OEP) methods that are free of spin contamination and/or spatial symmetry breaking.

A popular approach for studying excited state molecular crystals is to use cluster models embedded in point charges. In this paper, we compare the performance of several embedding models in predicting excited states and S 1 –S 0 optical gaps for a set of crystals from the X23 molecular crystal database. The performance of atomic charges based on ground or excited states was examined for cluster models, Ewald embedding, and self-consistent approaches. We investigated the impact of various factors, such as the level of theory, basis sets, embedding models, and the level of localization of the excitation. We consider different levels of theory, including time-dependent density functional theory and Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA) (DFT functionals: ω B97X-D and PBE0), CC2, complete active space self-consistent field, and CASPT2. We also explore the impact of selection of the QM region, charge leakage, and level of theory for the description of different kinds of excited states. We implemented three schemes based on distance thresholds to overcome overpolarization and charge leakage in molecular crystals. Our findings are compared against experimental data, G 0 W 0 -BSE, periodic TDA, and optimally tuned screened range-separated functionals.},

  abstract = {Pseudopotentials (PP) are extensively used in electronic structure calculations, particularly for molecules containing heavy elements. Parameters in PPs are mainly determined from ab initio results, and errors of such PPs in density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been studied previously. However, PP errors on results with spin–orbit coupling and those in time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations have not been reported previously. In this work, we investigate the error of the small-core energy-consistent Stuttgart/Koln pseudopotentials in DFT and TDDFT calculations with and without spin–orbit coupling. Ground state bond lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, and vertical excitation energies for a series of closed-shell diatomic heavy and superheavy p-block molecules are calculated using several popular exchange-correlation functionals. PP errors are estimated by comparing with results using the all-electron Dirac–Coulomb (-Gaunt) Hamiltonian. Our results show that the difference between ground state properties and most excitation energies in scalar-relativistic calculations with the PP and those of all-electron calculations is quite small. This difference becomes somewhat larger when spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is present, especially for properties that are affected by SOC to some extent. In addition, the errors of the PPs are insensitive to the employed exchange-correlation functionals in most cases. Our results indicate that reasonable DFT and TDDFT results can be obtained using the small-core energy-consistent Stuttgart/Koln pseudopotentials for heavy and super-heavy p-block molecules.},

We implement this model in the context of on-the-fly molecular dynamics simulations and study its accuracy, performance, and sensitivity to parameters for representative systems. We find that the formalism not only improves the accuracy of Thomas–Fermi–von Weizsäcker orbital-free energies and forces by more than two orders of magnitude but is also more accurate than MLFFs based solely on Kohn–Sham DFT while being more efficient and less sensitive to model parameters. We apply the framework to study the structure of molten Al 0.88 Si 0.12 , the results suggesting no aggregation of Si atoms, in agreement with a previous Kohn–Sham study performed at an order of magnitude smaller length and time scales.},

We identify the modes of vibrations along which the energy gap between two excited-state potential energy surfaces within the Q band manifold may vanish and find that the excess energy to reach this “touching” region is significantly reduced in the case of FP (0.16 eV) as compared to the one calculated for BP (0.92 eV).

Insight into this observation is provided by considering their work from the perspective of the effective homogeneity of the overall exchange–correlation functional. By considering a general form that combines the Fermi–Amaldi functional with a functional that is homogeneous of degree k , it is shown that for these atoms, the functional of Parr and Ghosh ( k = 1) exhibits essentially optimal effective homogeneities on the electron-deficient side of the integer.

The enhancement of charge modulations concentrated at the edges due to the evanescent states is induced, although the spin density is absent because of the TRS. A Zeeman field at an edge of the atomic chain, which breaks the TRS, yields a finite spin polarization, whose direction depends on the chirality of the molecule. The chirality change induces a reasonable amount of the energy difference, which may provide an insight into the enantioselective adsorption of chiral molecules on the ferromagnetic surface.},

It has been demonstrated that CdS nanocrystals can replace the Fe protein to deliver photoexcited electrons to the MoFe protein. Herein, light-activated electron delivery within the CdS:MoFe protein complex was achieved in the frozen state, revealing that all the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) active E-state intermediates in the catalytic cycle can be trapped and characterized by EPR spectroscopy. Prior to illumination, the CdS:MoFe protein complex EPR spectrum was composed of a S = 3/2 rhombic signal ( g = 4.33, 3.63, and 2.01) consistent with the FeMo-cofactor in the resting state, E 0 . Illumination for sequential 1-h periods at 233 K under 1 atm of N 2 led to a cumulative attenuation of E 0 by 75\%. This coincided with the appearance of S = 3/2 and S = 1/2 signals assigned to two-electron (E 2 ) and four-electron (E 4 ) reduced states of the FeMo-cofactor, together with additional S = 1/2 signals consistent with the formation of E 6 and E 8 states. Simulations of EPR spectra allowed quantification of the different E-state populations, along with mapping of these populations onto the Lowe–Thorneley kinetic scheme. The outcome of this work demonstrates that the photochemical delivery of electrons to the MoFe protein can be used to populate all of the EPR active E-state intermediates of the nitrogenase MoFe protein cycle.},

Herein, we studied the stability of a small protein (ubiquitin) in water and a betaine-glycerol-water (B:G:W) (1:2:ζ; ζ = 0, 1, 2, 5, 10) DES, through molecular dynamics. An AMBER-based model that accurately describes the density and shear viscosity of the DES is proposed. We find that water molecules are largely trapped in the solvent, precluding the formation of a full hydration layer, seemingly opposite to osmolytes’ preferential exclusion/preferential hydration mechanism. Although the protein is stable in the DES, structural fluctuations are largely suppressed and only recovered upon sufficient hydration. This is explained by a solvent-slaving mechanism where β-fluctuations are key, with the non-monotonic hydration of some amino acids with the water content providing an explanation to the non-monotonic folding of some proteins in aqueous DESs. A major thermal stability enhancement in the DES is also observed, caused by a similar slowdown of the backbone torsional dynamics. Our results support a kinetic stabilization of the protein in the DES, whereas a possible thermodynamic stabilization does not follow a preferential hydration or water entrapment mechanism.},

  abstract = {Low-crosslinked polymer networks have recently been found to behave auxetically when subjected to small tensions, that is, their Poisson’s ratio ν becomes negative. In addition, for specific state points, numerical simulations revealed that diamond-like networks reach the limit of mechanical stability, exhibiting values of ν = −1, a condition that we define as hyper-auxeticity. This behavior is interesting per se for its consequences in materials science but is also appealing for fundamental physics because the mechanical instability is accompanied by evidence of criticality. In this work, we deepen our understanding of this phenomenon by performing a large set of equilibrium and stress–strain simulations in combination with phenomenological elasticity theory. The two approaches are found to be in good agreement, confirming the above results. We also extend our investigations to disordered polymer networks and find that the hyper-auxetic behavior also holds in this case, still manifesting a similar critical-like behavior as in the diamond one. Finally, we highlight the role of the number density, which is found to be a relevant control parameter determining the elastic properties of the system. The validity of the results under disordered conditions paves the way for an experimental investigation of this phenomenon in real systems, such as hydrogels.},

  abstract = {For photosensitive polyurethane systems, reactive diluents are indispensable components whose main role is to reduce the viscosity of the polyurethane prepolymer to meet the requirements of the photocurable 3D printing technology for high fluidity of the precursor solution. Generally, the reactive diluent would be involved in the photocuring reaction, which in turn has a remarkable impact on the mechanical, reaction kinetics, and thermodynamic characteristics of the photosensitive polyurethane system. However, this feature is usually neglected in the study of photosensitive urethane acrylate (PUA) systems, so there is a considerable necessity to investigate the mechanism of active diluents in the photocured reaction of PUA systems. In this work, the effects of α-methyl groups along the chains of diluent molecules on the photoreaction kinetics, photocurable 3D printing, mechanical and mechanical properties, and thermodynamic characteristics of PUAs were investigated employing hydroxyethyl methacrylate and hydroxyethyl acrylate as active diluents, respectively. The relationship between chemical structure and kinetics of PUA systems was also elucidated by using dynamic mechanical analysis tests. The results demonstrated that the α-methyl group blocks the migration of reactive radicals, reduces the efficiency of the photoreaction, and causes an increase in the rigidity and strength of the molecular chain. This study not only revealed the effect of α-methyl on the kinetic mechanical and thermal performance of PUA systems but also paves the way for the development of a new class of photosensitive PUA materials used for the photocurable 3D printing technology.},

While tetragonal metal borides LiB 4 and NaB 4 with BaAl 4 -type structure and striking clathrate boron motif have been induced under compression, there is still a lack of deep understanding of their potential properties at ambient pressure. We herein conduct a comprehensive study on I 4/ mmm -structured LiB 4 and NaB 4 under ambient pressure via first-principles calculations. Remarkably, both LiB 4 and NaB 4 are found to possess high Vickers hardness of 39 GPa, which is ascribed to the robust boron framework with strong covalency. Furthermore, their high hardness values together with distinguished stability make them highly potential superhard materials. Meanwhile, electron–phonon coupling analysis reveals that both LiB 4 and NaB 4 are conventional phonon-mediated superconductors, with critical temperatures of 6 and 8 K at 1 atmosphere pressure (atm), respectively, mainly arising from the coupling of B 2 p electronic states and the low-frequency phonon modes associated with Li-, Na-, and B-derived vibrations. This work provides valuable insights into the mechanical and superconducting behaviors of metal borides and will boost further studies of emergent borides with multiple functionalities.},

  abstract = {Circular dichroism (CD) spectra for pseudo-two-dimensional chiral nanomaterials were systematically investigated and analyzed in relation to the rotational symmetry of the nanomaterials. Theoretically, an ideal two-dimensional chiral matter is CD inactive for light incident normal to the plane if it possesses threefold or higher rotational symmetry. If the matter has two- or onefold rotational symmetry, it should exhibit CD activity, and the CD signal measured from the back side of the matter is expected to be inverted from that measured from the front side. For pseudo-two-dimensional chiral gold nanostructures fabricated on glass substrates using electron beam lithography, matter with fourfold rotational symmetry is found to be CD active, even when special care is taken to ensure that the optical environments for the front and back sides of the sample are equivalent. In this case, the CD signal measured from the back side is found to be almost exactly the same as that measured from the front side. It is revealed that the observed chiro-optical behavior arises from three-dimensional chiral characteristics due to differences in the surface shape between the front and back sides of the structures. For matter that is two- or onefold rotationally symmetric, the CD signal measured from the back side is not coincident with that from the front side. For certain wavelength regions, the CD signals measured from the front side and back side are observed to be similar, while at other wavelengths, the inverted component of the CD signals is found to dominate. The observed CD spectral behavior for reciprocal optical measurement configurations is considered to be determined by a balance between the in-plane isotropic and anisotropic components of the chiral permittivity.},

Our investigation spotlights an unexpected chemical pathway by which NO 2 (i) can be adsorbed as HONO by deprotonation of interfacial silanols (i.e., –Si–OH group) on silica, (ii) can be barrierless converted to nitric acid, and (iii) can finally dissociated to surface bounded NO and hydroxyl gas phase radicals. This chemical pathway does not invoke any previously experimentally postulated NO 2 dimerization, dimerization that is less likely to occur at low NO 2 concentrations. Moreover, water significantly catalyzes the HONO formation and the dissociation of nitric acid into surface-bounded NO and OH radicals, while visible light adsorption can further promote these chemical transformations. This work highlights how water-restricted solvation regimes on common mineral substrates are likely to be a source of reactive oxygen species, and it offers a theoretical framework for further and desirable experimental efforts, aiming to better constrain trace gases/mineral interactions at different relative humidity conditions.},

Here, we synthesized plasmonic core–shell nanoconstructs consisting of triangular gold nanoprism (AuTNP) core with mixed manganese oxide (MnOx) shell for photoelectrocatalytic WOR. These constructs show electrocatalytic WOR with a low onset overpotential requirement of 270 mV at pH 10. Photoexcitation showed further enhancement of their catalytic activity resulting in ∼15\% decrease of the onset overpotential requirement along with the generation of photocurrent density of up to 300 μ A/cm 2 . We showed that such light-driven enhancement of AuTNP@MnOx dyad’s catalytic activity toward the WOR process includes contributions from both photocatalytic (hot carriers driven) and photothermal effects with photothermal effect playing the major role for wavelength between 532 and 808 nm. The contribution from the photocatalytic effect is appreciable only for high-energy excitations near the interband region, while the photothermal effect largely dominates for lower energy excitations near the LSPR wavelengths of the dyad.},

However, the origin of AIE in MNCs is still not fully understood, which is pivotal for the design of AIE luminogens (AIEgens). Here, water soluble silver nanoclusters (Ag NCs) with AIE properties were synthesized. These as-synthesized non-luminescent Ag NCs will become photoluminescent when transferred from water to ethanol, and the emission peak was redshifted from ∼560 to ∼600 nm and largely intensified with the addition of Cu 2+ . The addition of Cu 2+ makes a big difference in the PL properties of Ag NCs. That is, the PL will be enhanced if Cu 2+ is added with the sequence “Ag NCs + Cu 2+ +EtOH.” In contrast, the PL will be quenched if Cu 2+ is added with the sequence “Ag NCs + EtOH + Cu 2+ .” The PL was from the supramolecular clusters formed by the assembly of capping ligands on the confined surface of individual silver clusters through weak interactions. The addition of Cu 2+ could regulate the assembly structure and further affect the energy lever (p-band) through space electron interactions. These results provide new insights into the AIE process in metal nanoclusters.},

  abstract = {The dynamical properties of nuclei, carried by the concept of phonon quasiparticles , are central to the field of condensed matter. While the harmonic approximation can reproduce a number of properties observed in real crystals, the inclusion of anharmonicity in lattice dynamics is essential to accurately predict properties such as heat transport or thermal expansion. For highly anharmonic systems, non-perturbative approaches are needed, which result in renormalized theories of lattice dynamics. In this article, we apply the Mori–Zwanzig projector formalism to derive an exact generalized Langevin equation describing the quantum dynamics of nuclei in a crystal. By projecting this equation on quasiparticles in reciprocal space, and with results from linear response theory, we obtain a formulation of vibrational spectra that fully accounts for the anharmonicity. Using a mode-coupling approach, we construct a systematic perturbative expansion in which each new order is built to minimize the following ones. With a truncation to the lowest order, we show how to obtain a set of self-consistent equations that can describe the lineshapes of quasiparticles. The only inputs needed for the resulting set of equations are the static Kubo correlation functions, which can be computed using (fully quantum) path-integral molecular dynamics or approximated with (classical or ab initio ) molecular dynamics. We illustrate the theory with an application on fcc 4 He, an archetypal quantum crystal with very strong anharmonicity.},

  abstract = {Strong coupling of a confined optical field to the excitonic or vibronic transitions of a molecular material results in the formation of new hybrid states called polaritons. Such effects have been extensively studied in Fabry–Pèrot microcavity structures where an organic material is placed between two highly reflective mirrors. Recently, theoretical and experimental evidence has suggested that strong coupling can be used to modify chemical reactivity as well as molecular photophysical functionalities. However, the geometry of conventional microcavity structures limits the ability of molecules “encapsulated” in a cavity to interact with their local environment. Here, we fabricate mirrorless organic membranes that utilize the refractive index contrast between the organic active material and its surrounding medium to confine an optical field with Q-factor values up to 33. Using angle-resolved white light reflectivity measurements, we confirm that our structures operate in the strong coupling regime, with Rabi-splitting energies between 60 and 80 meV in the different structures studied. The experimental results are matched by transfer matrix and coupled oscillator models that simulate the various polariton states of the free standing membranes. Our work demonstrates that mechanically flexible and easy-to-fabricate free standing membranes can support strong light–matter coupling, making such simple and versatile structures highly promising for a range of polariton applications.},

Three interference-free transition lines in the fundamental vibrational band of CO were applied to the fast, in situ , and state-specific measurements. Vibrational relaxation times of CO were summarized over a temperature range of 1110–2820 K behind reflected shocks. The measured rotational temperature instantaneously reached an equilibrium state behind shock waves. The measured vibrational temperature experienced a relaxation process before reaching the equilibrium state. The measured vibrational temperature time histories were compared with predictions based on the Landau–Teller model and the state-to-state approach. The state-to-state approach treats the vibrational energy levels of CO as pseudo-species and accurately describes the detailed thermal nonequilibrium processes behind shock waves. The datasets of state-specific inelastic rate coefficients of CO–Ar, CO–He, CO–CO, and CO–H 2 collisions were calculated in this study using the mixed quantum-classical method and the semiclassical forced harmonic oscillator model. The predictions based on the state-to-state approach agreed well with the measured data and nonequilibrium (non-Boltzmann) vibrational distributions were found in the post-shock regions, while the Landau–Teller model predicted slower vibrational temperature time histories than the measured data. Modifications were applied to the Millikan–White vibrational relaxation data of the CO–Ar and CO–H 2 systems to improve the performance of the Landau–Teller model. In addition, the thermal nonequilibrium processes behind incident shocks, the acceleration effects of H 2 O on the relaxation process of CO, and the characterization of vibrational temperature were highlighted.},

[J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 10 (17), 4914–4919 (2019)]. Polarization effects induce a significant broadening of the electron binding energy distribution, as predicted by EPT. This broadening can result in a substantial increase in electron affinity, impacting the chemical reactivity of SO 2 at the air–water interface, a topic of significant and recent research interest. We discuss the relationship between electron binding energies (EBEs) and the specific connections of SO 2 to water. The results indicate that configurations involving an O S ⋯H bond tend to yield higher electron affinities compared to complex formation through S⋯O W bonds. Surprisingly, SO 2 molecules not bound to water molecules according to a specific criterion may also exhibit higher electron affinities. This feature can be explained by the role played by the polarization field from water molecules. Our best estimate for the HOMO–LUMO (H–L) gap of SO 2 at the surface of a water cluster is 11.6 eV. Very similar H–L gaps are predicted for isolated and micro-solvated SO 2 . Fukui functions for the gas phase, and the micro-solvated SO 2 –H 2 O complex supports the view that the LUMO is predominantly localized on the SO 2 moiety.},

  abstract = {We investigate two limits in open-shell diradical systems: O 3 , in which the interesting orbitals are in close proximity to one another, and (C 21 H 13 ) 2 , where there is a significant spatial separation between the two orbitals. In accord with earlier calculations, we find that standard density-functional approximations do not predict the open-shell character for the former case but uniformly predict the open-shell character for the latter case. We trace the qualitatively incorrect behavior in O 3 predicted by these standard density functional approximations to self-interaction error and use the Fermi–Löwdin-orbital-self-interaction-corrected formalism to determine accurate triplet, closed-shell singlet, and open-shell broken-spin-symmetry electronic configurations. Analysis of the resulting many-electron overlap matrices allows us to unambiguously show that the broken-spin-symmetry configurations do not participate in the representation of the M s = 0 triplet states and allows us to reliably extract the singlet–triplet splitting in O 3 by analyzing the energy as a function of Fermi-orbital-descriptor permutations. The results of these analyses predict the percentage of open-shell character in O 3 , which agrees well with conventional wavefunction-based methods. While these techniques are expected to be required in cases near the Coulson–Fischer point, we find that they will be less necessary in diradical systems with well-separated electrons, such as (C 21 H 13 ) 2 . Results based on energies from self-interaction-corrected generalized gradient, local density, and Hartree–Fock approximations and experimental results are in generally good agreement for O 3 . These results help form the basis for deriving extended Heisenberg-like Hamiltonians that are needed for descriptions of molecular magnets when there are competing low-energy electronic configurations.},

The Ehrenfest stress-tensor is introduced as any stress-tensor whose negative divergence will yield the corresponding Ehrenfest force for the same system when the exact wave-function is utilized. Stress-tensors within the literature are examined to show those that are Ehrenfest stress-tensors. Those that differ are demonstrated by how they differ within an exact formulation.

One of the models that successfully reproduces the rheology and morphology of blood has been proposed by Fedosov et al. [Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 199 , 1937–1948 (2010)]. The proposed RBC model contains several parameters whose values are determined by either various experiments or physical requirements. In this study, we developed a new method of determining parameter values precisely from the fluctuations of the RBC membrane. Specifically, we studied the relationship between the spectra of the fluctuations and model parameters. Characteristic peaks were observed in the spectra, whose peak frequencies were dependent on the parameter values. In addition, we investigated the spectra of the radius of gyration. We identified the peaks originating from the spring potential and the volume-conserving potential appearing in the spectra. These results lead to the precise experimental determination of the parameters used in the RBC model.},

  abstract = {Coupled trajectory mixed quantum–classical (CTMQC) dynamics is a rigorous approach to trajectory-based non-adiabatic dynamics, which has recently seen an improvement to energy conservation via the introduction of the CTMQC-E algorithm. Despite this, the method’s two key quantities distinguishing it from Ehrenfest dynamics, the modified Born–Oppenheimer momentum and the quantum momentum, require regularization procedures in certain circumstances. Such procedures in the latter can cause instabilities, leading to undesirable effects, such as energy drift and spurious population transfer, which is expected to become increasingly prevalent when the system gets larger as such events would happen more frequently. We propose a further modification to CTMQC-E, which includes a redefinition of the quantum momentum, CTMQC-EDI (double intercept), such that it has no formal divergences. We then show for Tully models I–III and the double arch model that the algorithm has greatly improved total energy conservation and negligible spurious population transfer at all times, in particular in regions of strong non-adiabatic coupling. CTMQC-EDI, therefore, shows promise as a numerically robust non-adiabatic dynamics technique that accounts for decoherence from first principles and that is scalable to large molecular systems and materials.},

The nonlinear + nonlocal model is able to reproduce the characteristic “double hump” shape observed experimentally for the differential capacitance of an electrified metal interface while preventing “leakage” of the electrolyte into regions of space too small to contain a single water molecule or solvated ion. The model also gives a reasonable prediction of molecular solvation free energies as well as the self-ionization free energy of water and the absolute electron chemical potential of the standard hydrogen electrode.

This approach allows an accurate energy approximation for each particle, enabling a straightforward error analysis. The resulting particle-dependent pair potential captures the charge distribution information, making it suitable for heterogeneous systems and ensuring an enhanced accuracy through distant information inclusion.

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) of kinetic energy functionals (KEFs), in particular kinetic energy density (KED) functionals, is a promising way to construct KEFs for orbital-free density functional theory (DFT). Neural networks and kernel methods including Gaussian process regression (GPR) have been used to learn Kohn–Sham (KS) KED from density-based descriptors derived from KS DFT calculations. The descriptors are typically expressed as functions of different powers and derivatives of the electron density. This can generate large and extremely unevenly distributed datasets, which complicates effective application of ML techniques. Very uneven data distributions require many training datapoints, can cause overfitting, and can ultimately lower the quality of an ML KED model. We show that one can produce more accurate ML models from fewer data by working with smoothed density-dependent variables and KED. Smoothing palliates the issue of very uneven data distributions and associated difficulties of sampling while retaining enough spatial structure necessary for working within the paradigm of KEDF. We use GPR as a function of smoothed terms of the fourth order gradient expansion and KS effective potential and obtain accurate and stable (with respect to different random choices of training points) kinetic energy models for Al, Mg, and Si simultaneously from as few as 2000 samples (about 0.3\% of the total KS DFT data). In particular, accuracies on the order of 1\% in a measure of the quality of energy–volume dependence B ′ = E V 0 − Δ V − 2 E V 0 + E ( V 0 + Δ V ) Δ V / V 0 2 (where V 0 is the equilibrium volume and Δ V is a deviation from it) are obtained simultaneously for all three materials.},

This is the first application of the ETGA in the calculation of internal conversion and emission rates for real molecular systems, namely, formaldehyde, fluorobenzene, azulene, and a dicyano-squaraine dye. The viability of the models as black-box tools for prediction of spontaneous emission and internal conversion rates is assessed. All calculations were done using a consistent protocol in order to investigate how different methods perform without previous experimental knowledge using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) with B3LYP, PBE0, ω B97XD, and CAM-B3LYP functionals. Contrasting the results with experimental data shows that there are further improvements required before theoretical predictions of emission and internal conversion rates can be used as reliable indicators for the photo-luminescence properties of molecules. We find that the ETGA performs rather similar to the vertical harmonical model. Including anharmonicities in the calculation of internal conversion rates has a moderate effect on the quantitative results in the studied systems. The emission rates are fairly stable with respect to computational parameters, but the internal conversion rate reveals itself to be highly dependent on the choice of the spectral line shape function, particularly the width of the Lorentzian function, associated with homogeneous broadening.},

All these bases feature the diagonal approximation for the electron–electron interactions so that the Hamiltonian is completely defined by two N b × N b matrices, where N b ≈ 10 4 is small enough to permit fast calculations at the Hartree–Fock level. In constructing these bases, we have gained new mathematical insight into the construction of one-dimensional diagonal bases.

In this report, it is shown that the solution for these quantities is supported by the DM expansion into three states of different numbers of particles: the neutral and two (edge) ionic states. The states and the average number of particles in the domains (fractional occupation population) are determined by the coefficients of the expansion in terms of the fundamental transference magnitudes, revealing the donor/acceptor character of the domains by which the quantum accessible states are discussed.},

  abstract = {The topology of the Ehrenfest force field (EhF) is investigated as a tool for describing local interactions in molecules and intermolecular complexes. The EhF is obtained by integrating the electronic force operator over the coordinates of all but one electron, which requires knowledge of both the electron density and the reduced pair density. For stationary states, the EhF can also be obtained as minus the divergence of the kinetic stress tensor, although this approach leads to well-documented erroneous asymptotic behavior at large distances from the nuclei. It is shown that these pathologies disappear using the electron density functions and that the EhF thus obtained displays the correct behavior in real space, with no spurious critical points or attractors. Therefore, its critical points can be unambiguously obtained and classified. Test cases, including strained molecules, isomerization reactions, and intermolecular interactions, were analyzed. Various chemically relevant facts are highlighted: for example, non-nuclear attractors are generally absent, potential hydrogen–hydrogen interactions are detected in crowded systems, and a bifurcation mechanism is observed in the isomerization of HCN. Moreover, the EhF atomic basins are less charged than those of the electron density. Although integration of the EhF over regions of real space can also be performed to yield the corresponding atomic forces, several numerical drawbacks still need to be solved if electron density functions are to be used for that purpose. Overall, the results obtained support the Ehrenfest force field as a reliable descriptor for the definition of atomic basins and molecular structure.},

We present an adaptive general-purpose framework to automatically tune such parameters based on a local loss function that promotes the fast exploration of phase space. We show that a good correspondence between loss and autocorrelation time can be established, allowing for gradient-based optimization using a fully differentiable set-up. The loss is constructed in such a way that it also allows for gradient-driven learning of a distribution over the number of integration steps. Our approach is demonstrated for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator and alanine dipeptide, a small protein commonly used as a test case for simulation methods. Through the application to the harmonic oscillator, we highlight the importance of not using a fixed timestep to avoid a rugged loss surface with many local minima, otherwise trapping the optimization. In the case of alanine dipeptide, by tuning the only free parameter of our loss definition, we find a good correspondence between it and the autocorrelation times, resulting in a &gt; 100 fold speedup in the optimization of simulation parameters compared to a grid search. For this system, we also extend the integrator to allow for atom-dependent timesteps, providing a further reduction of 25\% in autocorrelation times.},

Oblique coordinates are obtained by making non-orthogonal rotations of the original coordinates that convert the matrix representation of the quadratic Hamiltonian operator into a block-diagonal matrix where the blocks are distinguished by the total quanta of vibrational excitation. Using techniques for the polar decomposition of matrices, we present a scheme for finding these coordinates for systems of arbitrary dimensions. Several molecular examples are presented that highlight the advantages of these coordinates.},

We present the construction of a new meta-generalized gradient approximation for exchange that captures the ultranonlocal response to a static electric field in very close correspondence to exact exchange, yet at a fraction of its computational cost. This functional, in particular, also captures the dependence of the response on the system size. The static electric polarizabilities of hydrogen chains and oligo-acetylene molecules calculated with this meta-GGA are quantitatively close to the ones obtained with exact exchange.

The adsorption performance of nanomaterials depends on their adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics. Here, the thermodynamic and kinetic equations of adsorption for spherical nanoparticles are first derived in theory. The mechanisms and regularities of influences of nano-effect on thermodynamics and kinetics, using nano-CdS adsorption of methylene blue as a probe, were investigated. The results show that there are significant influences of nano-effect (i.e., interface area effect and interface tension effect) on the thermodynamics and kinetics of nanoparticle adsorption. When the particle radius is larger and beyond the nanometer scale (∼100 nm), the nano-effect can be neglected. When the radius of the nanoparticle is within 10–50 nm, the nano-effect of adsorption is mainly the interface area effect. When the radius is less than 10 nm, the influences of both the interface area effect and the interface tension effect on adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics become more significant. The theoretic equations and experimental insights in the present work could provide a significant basis and reference for improving and perfecting the adsorption theory involving nanomaterials and provide guidelines for the explanations of adsorption mechanisms as well as the selection of adsorbents.},

The contributions of the two second-order exchange terms are almost zero for intermolecular charge transfer excitations and ∼0.75 eV for intramolecular charge transfer excitations according to our exciton analysis method with exciton wave functions. For TADF molecules, we found that the second-order exchange terms are more significant than the first-order exchange terms, and the contributions—even for local-type and delocalized-type excitations—are not negligibly small. We revealed that the two second-order exchange terms are proportional to the molecular size, the exciton binding energy, and the electron–hole overlap strength for intramolecular charge-transfer excitations. We believe that our findings are indispensable for further considerations of the GW method in the future.},

As part of the latter family, this density functional is well-adapted to treat molecular systems that are particularly prone to self-interaction errors in their ground and excited states. In particular, we show that the SOS1-RSX-QIDH model is a good compromise to treat ground-state problems dealing with kinetics and has a real added value when applied to the evaluation of the excited-state properties of equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium molecular complexes. Even if spin-biased double hybrids are recognized to strongly underestimate noncovalent interactions, we notice and recommend coupling SOS1-RSX-QIDH with a nonlocal van der Waals potential, a combination that is here proved to compete with the best density-functional approximations currently in use.},

However, a recent study [Song et al. , J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 12 , 800–807 (2021)] has highlighted the limitation of xDH methods in calculating the dissociation of NaCl molecules. This issue has been related to the density and orbitals used for evaluating the energy in xDH methods, which are obtained from lower-rung hybrid density functional approximations (DFAs) and display substantial density errors in the dissociation limit. In this work, we systematically investigate the influence of density on several challenging datasets and find that xDH methods are less sensitive to density errors compared to semi-local and hybrid DFAs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the self-interaction corrected SCAN density approach offers superior accuracy compared to the self-consistent SCAN density and Hartree–Fock density approaches, as evidenced by performing charge analysis on the dissociation of heterodimers, such as NaCl and LiF. Building on these insights, we propose a five-parameter xDH method using the SCAN density and orbitals corrected by the PZ-SIC scheme. This new xDH@SCAN(SIC) method provides a balanced and accurate description across a wide range of challenging systems.},

Instead of relying on a distinct CG solvent model, AdSoS is based on CG models defined by a dimensional scaling of the FG solvent by a factor s , accompanied by the s -dependent modulation of its mass and interaction parameters. The latter changes are designed to achieve an isomorphism between the dynamics of the FG and CG models, and to preserve the dispersive and dielectric solvation properties of the solvent with respect to a solute at FG resolution. As a result, the AdSoS scheme minimizes the thermodynamic mismatch between different regions of the adaptive-resolution system. The present article generalizes the scheme initially introduced for a pure atomic liquid in slab geometry to more practically relevant situations involving (i) a molecular dipolar solvent (e.g., water); (ii) a radial geometry (i.e., spherical rather than planar layers); and (iii) the inclusion of a solute (e.g., water molecule, dipeptide, ion, or ion pair).},

  abstract = {Nuclear quantum effects play critical roles in a variety of molecular processes, especially in systems that contain hydrogen and other light nuclei, such as water. For water under ambient conditions, nuclear quantum effects are often interpreted as local effects resulting from a smearing of the hydrogen atom distribution. However, the orientational structure of water at interfaces determines long-range effects, such as electrostatics, through the O–H bond ordering that is impacted by nuclear quantum effects. In this work, I examine nuclear quantum effects on long-range electrostatics of water confined between hydrophobic walls using path integral simulations. To do so, I combine concepts from local molecular field theory with path integral methods at varying levels of approximation to develop efficient and physically intuitive approaches for describing long-range electrostatics in nonuniform quantum systems. Using these approaches, I show that quantum water requires larger electrostatic forces to achieve interfacial screening than the corresponding classical system. This work highlights the subtleties of electrostatics in nonuniform classical and quantum molecular systems, and the methods presented here are expected to be of use to efficiently model nuclear quantum effects in large systems.},

In this study, we present our findings on porous colloids settled at a solid wall in an aqueous solution comprising a photo-sensitive azobenzene-containing cationic surfactant and a cyanine-based dye, capable of ionically binding to each other. The surfactant acts as an activation agent for diffusioosmotic flow. When exposed to modulated light, it undergoes photo-isomerization from a hydrophobic trans -state to a more hydrophilic cis- state, creating a concentration gradient near the irradiated area of the wall. The resulting osmotic pressure gradient sets the flow in motion. Porous colloids actively participate in flow generation by readily incorporating the surfactant molecules in the trans- state and releasing them in the cis -state, creating a constant source of diffusioosmotic flow. Under UV illumination, an excess of cis- isomers near the porous colloids elicits long-range repulsive interactions, tenfold the diameter of a particle. The dye acts as a sensor for the surfactant filling or emptying the pores of the colloids. It forms a complex with the trans- isomer and diffuses into the pores, where photoisomerization to cis- state destroys the complex and causes both the dye and the surfactant to leave the pores, altering the luminescence brightness within the colloids. We demonstrated that the presence of the dye affects cis-trans isomer ratios of the surfactant at photo-stationary states, thereby influencing the process of diffusioosmosis. This process enables the manipulation of colloidal particles and remote control of the interaction potential between them, facilitating the formation of well-ordered surface aggregates.},

In nanoscale films, polymer glasses with higher fragility experience larger reductions in their T g compared to those with lower fragility. We investigated whether this is due to the free surface of the polymers, which can cause the surface T g ( T g surf ) to decrease relative to the bulk T g . By measuring T g surf of various polymers, we found that the shift in T g surf relative to the bulk T g increased with fragility. This suggests that more fragile polymers are more susceptible to the free surface effect. We explain this using the concept of energy landscape, as it is used to explain the different slowdown rates between strong and fragile glass formers at T g .},

  abstract = {One key question about transport of active polymers within crowded environments is how spatial order of obstacles influences their conformation and dynamics when compared to disordered media. To this end, we computationally investigate the active transport of tangentially driven polymers with varying degrees of flexibility and activity in two-dimensional square lattices of obstacles. Tight periodic confinement induces notable conformational changes and distinct modes of transport for flexible and stiff active filaments. It leads to caging of low activity flexible polymers inside the inter-obstacle pores while promoting more elongated conformations and enhanced diffusion for stiff polymers at low to moderate activity levels. The migration of flexible active polymers occurs via hopping events, where they unfold to move from one cage to another, similar to their transport in disordered media. However, in ordered media, polymers are more compact and their long-time dynamics is significantly slower. In contrast, stiff chains travel mainly in straight paths within periodic inter-obstacle channels while occasionally changing their direction of motion. This mode of transport is unique to periodic environment and leads to more extended conformation and substantially enhanced long-time dynamics of stiff filaments with low to moderate activity levels compared to disordered media. At high active forces, polymers overcome confinement effects and move through inter-obstacle pores just as swiftly as in open spaces, regardless of the spatial arrangement of obstacles. We explain the center of mass dynamics of semiflexible polymers in terms of active force and obstacle packing fraction by developing an approximate analytical theory.},

  abstract = {We performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations on monodisperse polymer melts to investigate the formation of shear banding. Under high shear rates, shear banding occurs, which is intimately accompanied by the entanglement heterogeneity. Interestingly, the same linear relationship between the end-to-end distance R ee and entanglement density Z is observed at homogeneous flow before the onset of shear banding and at the shear banding state, where R ee ∼ ln ( W i 0.87 ) − ξ 0 Z is proposed as the criterion to describe the dynamic force balance of the molecular chain in flow with a high rate. Deviating from this relation leads to a force imbalance and results in the emergence of shear banding. We establish a scaling relation between the disentanglement rate V d and the Weissenberg number W i as V d ∼ W i 0.87 for stable flow in homogeneous shear and shear banding states. The formation of shear banding prevents chains from further stretching and disentanglement. The transition from homogeneous shear to shear banding partially dissipates the increased free energy from shear and reduces the free energy of the system.},

The failure stress and strain were found to be linear with the temperature and logarithmic strain rate. Moreover, based on the kinetic theory of fracture and the comprehensive simulation results, we formulated a model that describes the failure stress of the aforementioned crystals under varying strain rates and temperatures. Through the analysis of the failure process, we found that in PPTA, PBIA, and PBIA–PPTA crystals, the bond failure probability is correlated with the strain rate and temperature. The examination of bond lengths and angles unveiled that bonds with larger initial aligning angles are more susceptible to failure during the strain process. Intriguingly, the stretching process induced a conformational change in the PBO molecular chain, leading to a deviation from the linear relation in its stress–strain curve.},

J. Phys. Chem. 152 , 204121 (2020)]. This paper provides an overview of the TurboGenius package and showcases several results obtained in a high-throughput mode. For the purpose of performing high-throughput calculations with TurboGenius , we implemented another open-source Python package, TurboWorkflows , that enables one to construct simple workflows using TurboGenius . We demonstrate its effectiveness by performing (1) validations of density functional theory (DFT) and QMC drivers as implemented in the TurboRVB package and (2) benchmarks of Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations for several datasets. For (1), we checked inter-package consistencies between TurboRVB and other established quantum chemistry packages. By doing so, we confirmed that DFT energies obtained by PySCF are consistent with those obtained by TurboRVB within the local density approximation (LDA) and that Hartree–Fock (HF) energies obtained by PySCF and Quantum Package are consistent with variational Monte Carlo energies obtained by TurboRVB with the HF wavefunctions. These validation tests constitute a further reliability check of the TurboRVB package. For (2), we benchmarked the atomization energies of the Gaussian-2 set, the binding energies of the S22, A24, and SCAI sets, and the equilibrium lattice parameters of 12 cubic crystals using DMC calculations. We found that, for all compounds analyzed here, the DMC calculations with the LDA nodal surface give satisfactory results, i.e., consistent either with high-level computational or with experimental reference values.},

The molecule–surface interaction is described through an atomistic neural network approach based on Density Functional Theory calculations using a nonlocal exchange–correlation (XC) functional that includes the effect of long-range dispersion forces: vdW-DF2 [Lee et al. Phys. Rev. B, 82 , 081101 (2010)]. With this approach, we significantly improve the agreement with experiments with respect to a similar previous study based on a semi-local XC functional. In particular, we obtain excellent agreement with molecular beam experimental data concerning the dependence of the initial sticking probability on surface temperature and impact energy at normal incidence. For off-normal incidence, our results also reproduce two trends observed experimentally: (i) the preferential sticking for molecules impinging parallel to the [ 1 ̄ 10] direction compared to [001] and (ii) the change from positive to negative scaling as the impact energy increases. Nevertheless, understanding the origin of some remaining quantitative discrepancies with experiments requires further investigations.},

  abstract = {Sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is an interface-selective spectroscopic technique that enables us to selectively observe the vibrational or electronic resonances of molecules within a very thin interface layer. The interfacial properties probed by SFG are contained in a complex quantity called the second-order nonlinear susceptibility ( ⁠ χ 2 ⁠ ). It is usually believed that the imaginary part of χ 2 (Im χ 2 ⁠ ) exhibits the resonant responses of the system, whereas the nonresonant responses appear solely in the real part of χ 2 (Re χ 2 ⁠ ). However, it was recently theoretically pointed out that a portion of the nonresonant responses actually contributes to the observed Im χ 2 spectra when the finite thickness of the interface layer is taken into account. In this study, by considering a simple air/liquid interface without any solutes as a model system, we theoretically evaluate the nonresonant contribution to experimentally accessible Im χ 2 as well as to Re χ 2 ⁠ , from which the complex phase of the nonresonant background is estimated. It is shown that the deviation of the complex phase from 0° or 180° is less than 1° even if the thickness of the interface layer is taken into account. This means that the nonresonant contribution to Im χ 2 is practically negligible, and it is a very good approximation to think that the nonresonant background appears solely in Re χ 2 in the case of air/liquid interfaces. This result implies that Im χ 2 practically contains only the resonant responses of the system, and molecular resonances at the interface can be conveniently studied using Im χ 2 spectra at such interfaces.},

  abstract = {In this work, we determine the dissociation line of the nitrogen (N 2 ) hydrate by computer simulation using the TIP4P/Ice model for water and the TraPPE force field for N 2 . We use the solubility method proposed recently by some of us to evaluate the dissociation temperature of the hydrate at different pressures, from 500 to 1500 bar. Particularly, we calculate the solubility of N 2 in the aqueous solution when it is in contact with a N 2 -rich liquid phase and when in contact with the hydrate phase via planar interfaces as functions of temperature. Since the solubility of N 2 decreases with temperature in the first case and increases with temperature in the second case, both curves intersect at a certain temperature that determines the dissociation temperature at a given pressure. We find a good agreement between the predictions obtained in this work and the experimental data taken from the literature in the range of pressures considered in this work. From our knowledge of the solubility curves of N 2 in the aqueous solution, we also determine the driving force for nucleation of the hydrate, as a function of temperature, at different pressures. In particular, we use two different thermodynamic routes to evaluate the change in chemical potential for hydrate formation. Although the driving force for nucleation slightly decreases (in absolute value) when the pressure is increased, our results indicate that the effect of pressure can be considered negligible in the range of pressures studied in this work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the driving force for nucleation of a hydrate that exhibits crystallographic structure sII, along its dissociation line, is studied from computer simulation.},

Here, we investigate the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the structure of CuInP 2 S 6 single crystals through a detailed Raman spectroscopy study. Analysis of the peak frequencies, intensities, and widths reveals four high pressure regimes. At 5 GPa, the material undergoes a monoclinic-trigonal phase transition. At higher pressures (5–12 GPa), we see Raman peak sharpening, indicative of a change in the electronic structure, followed by an incommensurate phase between 12 and 17 GPa. Above 17 GPa, we see evidence for bandgap reduction in material. The original state of the material is fully recovered upon decompression, showing that hydrostatic pressure could be used to tune the electronic and ferrielectric properties of CuInP 2 S 6 .},

Here, we examine the IES formed by sub-monolayer RbI growth on Ag(111), which exhibits spatial variations in electronic structure in surprising contrast to the results previously obtained for other alkali halides. We find that this spatially dependent behavior can be qualitatively modeled by using a two-dimensional cosine potential commensurate with the moiré superstructure, where the IES is constructed from the well-known analytical solutions to the Mathieu equation. Our results indicate this potential is more corrugated than for similar potentials reported for other alkali halides, a result of substrate–adlayer charge transfer interactions that are stronger for RbI. This two-dimensional effective potential leads to anisotropy in the effective electron mass, in surprising contrast to previous results for other alkali halides, which report a single isotropic mass.},

  abstract = {Theoretical prediction of interfacial capacitance in graphene-based supercapacitors is crucial to accelerating materials’ design and development cycles. However, there is currently a significant gap between ab initio predictions and experimental reports, particularly in the case of nitrogen-doped graphene. Analyses based on changes to the density of states of freestanding graphene upon doping do not account for the electronic interactions between the electrode, dopants, and substrates. The result is an overestimation of the doping-induced capacitance increase by up to two orders of magnitude. Moreover, it is unclear whether electrolyte and solvent interactions can further complicate matters by inducing changes to the band structure and, therefore, the capacitive properties of the electrode. A third complication lies in the fixed-band approximation, where materials are simulated without accounting for the influence of an external electrical field. In this work, we present an interfacial modeling and characterization procedure that leverages the combined strengths of ab-initio molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and microscopic polarization theory to produce reliable predictions of interfacial capacitance. The procedure is applied to two case studies of interest in supercapacitor design: (1) nitrogen-doped graphene on a Cu(111) substrate and (2) an interface between bulk water and Cu(111)-supported graphene at room temperature. Results show that water alters graphene’s band structure from a semi-metallic to an n-doped-semiconducting character and that metallic substrates dominate the band structure of the electrode interface even in the presence of dopants. The water interface also shows an asymmetric capacitive response relative to the polarity of the applied field.},

  abstract = {We analyze from a theoretical perspective recent experiments where chiral discrimination in biological systems was established using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Even though intermolecular forces involved in AFM measurements have different origins, i.e., electrostatic, bonding, exchange, and multipole interactions, the key molecular forces involved in enantiospecific biorecognition are electronic spin exchange and van der Waals (vdW) dispersion forces, which are sensitive to spin–orbit interaction (SOI) and space-inversion symmetry breaking in chiral molecules. The vdW contribution to chiral discrimination emerges from the inclusion of SOI and spin fluctuations due to the chiral-induced selectivity effect, a result we have recently demonstrated theoretically. Considering these two enantiospecific contributions, we show that the AFM results regarding chiral recognition can be understood in terms of a simple physical model that describes the different adhesion forces associated with different electron spin polarization generated in the (DD), (LL), and (DL) enantiomeric pairs, as arising from the spin part of the exchange and vdW contributions. The model can successfully produce physically reasonable parameters accounting for the vdW and exchange interaction strength, accounting for the chiral discrimination effect. This fact has profound implications in biorecognition where the relevant intermolecular interactions in the intermediate-distance regime are clearly connected to vdW forces.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations in the microcanonical ensemble are performed to study the collapse of a bubble in liquid water using the single-site mW and the four-site TIP4P/2005 water models. To study system size effects, simulations for pure water systems are performed using periodically replicated simulation boxes with linear dimensions, L , ranging from 32 to 512 nm with the largest systems containing 8.7 × 10 6 and 4.5 × 10 9 molecules for the TIP4P/2005 and mW water models, respectively. The computationally more efficient mW water model allows us to reach converging behavior when the bubble dynamics results are plotted in reduced units, and the limiting behavior can be obtained through linear extrapolation in L −1 . Qualitative differences are observed between simulations with the mW and TIP4P/2005 water models, but they can be explained by the models’ differences in predicted viscosity and surface tension. Although bubble collapse occurs on time scales of only hundreds of picoseconds, the system sizes used here are sufficiently large to obtain bubble dynamics consistent with the Rayleigh–Plesset equation when using the models’ thermophysical properties as input. For the conditions explored here, extreme heating of the interfacial water molecules near the time of collapse is observed for the larger mW water systems (but the model underpredicts the viscosity), whereas heating is less pronounced for the TIP4P/2005 water systems because its larger viscosity contribution slows the collapse dynamics. The presence of nitrogen within the bubble only starts to affect bubble dynamics near the very end of the initial collapse, leading to an incomplete collapse and strong rebound for the mW water model. Although nitrogen is non-condensable at 300 K, it becomes highly compressed and reaches a liquid-like density near the collapse point. We find that the dissolution of nitrogen is much slower than the movement of the collapsing water front, and the re-expansion of the dense nitrogen droplet gives rise to bubble rebound. The incompatibility of the collapse and dissolution time scales should be considered for continuum-scale modeling of bubble dynamics. We also confirm that the diffusion coefficient for dissolved nitrogen is insensitive to pressure as the liquid transitions from a compressed to a stretched state.},

  abstract = {Henchman’s approximate harmonic model of liquids is extended to predict the thermodynamic behavior along lines of constant excess entropy (“isomorphs”) in the liquid and supercritical fluid regimes of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential phase diagram. Simple analytic expressions based on harmonic cell models of fluids are derived for the isomorph lines, one accurate version of which only requires as input parameters the average repulsive and attractive parts of the potential energy per particle at a single reference state point on the isomorph. The new harmonic cell routes for generating the isomorph lines are compared with those predicted by the literature molecular dynamics (MD) methods, the small step MD method giving typically the best agreement over a wide density and temperature range. Four routes to calculate the excess entropy in the MD simulations are compared, which includes employing Henchman’s formulation, Widom’s particle insertion method, thermodynamic integration, and parameterized LJ equations of state. The thermodynamic integration method proves to be the most computationally efficient. The excess entropy is resolved into contributions from the repulsive and attractive parts of the potential. The repulsive and attractive components of the potential energy, excess Helmholtz free energy, and excess entropy along a fluid isomorph are predicted to vary as ∼ T −1/2 in the high temperature limit by an extension of classical inverse power potential perturbation theory statistical mechanics, trends that are confirmed by the MD simulations.},

  abstract = {The present study explores the hydrogen-bond network in an equimolar mixture of acetic acid and water (AA–W). The investigation was conducted using a combination of neutron scattering and Density Functional Theory (DFT). New neutron scattering data at large scattering wave vectors were analyzed to determine the total structure factor S M ( q ) and the molecular form factor F 1 (q) of the system. DFT calculations using the 6-311++G(d, p) basis set were performed to optimize the monomers and various AA–W H-bonded clusters, including one acetic acid (AA) molecule connected to one, two, and three water molecules. Consequently, three dimers, three trimers, and one tetramer have been considered in order to describe the local order in the mixture. In addition, this study focused on the H-bond interactions in the most probable clusters in the solution, using the natural bond orbital and the atoms in molecules analyses. Our analysis particularly shows that stronger H-bond interactions occur in the ring structures.},

Differences in the hydrogen bond propensities effectuate that in reline and glyceline, the choline ions move faster than the hydrogen bond donors, glycerol and urea; in ethaline, the ethylene glycol molecules are reorienting faster. For glyceline and reline, the increase in the corresponding time scale ratio indicates a pronounced strengthening of the glycerol and urea networks upon cooling, while in ethaline, the time scale ratio remains essentially constant. For the three deep eutectic solvents, a comparison of the present component-selective results with the dielectric time constants shows that the latter are primarily sensitive to the dynamics of the respective hydrogen bond donors. In a Walden-type plot, the reorientation rates, selectively determined for the hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, are compared with their conductivity and fluidity, revealing that the dynamics of the choline ions relate most directly to the charge transport.},

In this work, using the TIP4P/2005 water model, aqueous solutions of nitrate and ammonium electrolytes are parametrized using scaled charges while keeping a rigid structure and nonpolarizable charge distributions. The models are optimized by systematically testing a set of properties for twelve electrolytes—eight nitrate and four ammonium salts—thus, enlarging the number of potential chemical species encompassed within the Madrid-2019 force field for ions. The capacity of the force field for predicting densities, ion–ion and ion–solvent structures, and transport properties of the solutions comprised by the trial batch of salts was tested and discussed. Both the dependence of the densities with the salt concentration and the solution structure were nicely reproduced by the models in the whole concentration range without any trace of precipitating events and with improved accuracy in comparison with recently reported models, while the agreement of the simulated transport properties with experimental data ranges from good to reasonable, depending on the ion/counterion pair. These scaled charge models might be considered as force fields embodying a reasonable compromise between exactness and general applicability and also as an important step in the development of accurate models for polyatomic ions.},

  abstract = {Techniques for enhancing the signals arising from low-γ, insensitive (I) nuclei are central to solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. One of the leading and best-established methods to sensitize these unreceptive species is Hartmann–Hahn cross polarization (HH-CP), a polarization transfer mechanism often executed under MAS. Herein, we explore the possibility of utilizing the 1 H dipolar order created via adiabatic demagnetization in the rotating frame (ADRF), to enhance the unreceptive spins under MAS. It is found that an efficient polarization transfer via ADRF-CPMAS is not only possible but can exceed, at least in some instances involving plastic crystals, the efficiency of an optimized HH-CPMAS transfer. The experiment requires low radiofrequency nutation fields on both the 1 H- and the I-spin channels, and displays unusual matching conditions that are reminiscent of the zero- and double-quantum matching conditions arising under CPMAS, albeit centered at zero frequency and demanding the simultaneous involvement of several spins. The origin of these multi-spin transfer processes is analytically derived and numerically simulated in predictions that compare well with experimental 13 C and 15 N results collected on model compounds at different spinning speeds. These derivations start from descriptions that depart from traditional thermodynamic arguments, and treat instead the ADRF processes in static and spinning solids on the basis of coherent evolutions. The predictions of these analytical derivations are corroborated by numerical simulations. The effects of additional factors, including chemical shift anisotropies, J-couplings, and radiofrequency inhomogeneities, are also theoretically and experimentally explored.},

  abstract = {Nanoscale magnesium clusters are important potential hydrogen storage materials, and density functional theory (DFT) is mainly used for their theoretical investigation. The results of the coupled-cluster theory at the singles and doubles level with a perturbative treatment of triples [CCSD(T)] were employed previously to choose proper exchange–correlation (XC) functionals in DFT calculations for magnesium clusters, but it is too expensive to be applied to Mg n with n &gt; 7. The diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method is employed in this work to study magnesium clusters up to nanosize. The error of atomization energies with DMC using single-determinant-Jastrow (SDJ) trial wavefunctions has been shown to be somewhat larger than that of CCSD(T) for many molecules. However, cohesive energies with DMC using SDJ for Mg n with n ≤ 7 are in excellent agreement with those of CCSD(T) using the aug-cc-pVQZ basis set, with a difference of less than 1 kcal/mol. DMC results are employed to investigate the performance of different XC functionals on magnesium clusters. Our results indicate that the PBE0 functional is the best XC functional for determining the lowest-energy isomer when compared with DMC results, while the RPBE functional is the best XC functional for calculating cohesive energies per atom of these magnesium clusters with a mean absolute error of 0.5 kcal/mol. These XC functionals are expected to provide reasonable results for even larger magnesium clusters.},

In this work, we try to give a rather detailed theoretical investigation of the SF process in the stacked polyacene dimer by combining the high-level quantum chemistry calculations and the quantum dynamics simulations based on the tensor network method. Starting with the construction of the linear vibronic coupling model, we explore the pure electronic dynamics and the vibronic dynamics in the SF processes. The role of vibrational modes in nonadiabatic dynamics is addressed. The results show that the super-exchange mechanism mediated by the charge-transfer state is found in both pure electronic dynamics and the nonadiabatic dynamics. Particularly the vibrational modes with the frequencies resonance with the adiabatic energy gap play very import roles in the SF dynamics. This work not only provides a deep and detailed understanding of the SF process but also verifies the efficiency of the tensor network method with the train structure that can serve as the reference dynamics method to explore the dynamics behaviors of complex systems.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, the quantum chemical version of the density matrix renormalization group method has established itself as the method of choice for strongly correlated molecular systems. However, despite its favorable scaling, in practice, it is not suitable for computations of dynamic correlation. Several approaches to include that in post-DMRG methods exist; in our group, we focused on the tailored coupled cluster (TCC) approach. This method works well in many situations; however, in exactly degenerate cases (with two or more determinants of equal weight), it exhibits a bias toward the reference determinant representing the Fermi vacuum. Although sometimes it is possible to use a compensation scheme to avoid this bias for energy differences, it is certainly a drawback. In order to overcome this bias of the TCC method, we have developed a Hilbert-space multireference version of tailored CC, which can treat several determinants on an equal footing. We have implemented and compared the performance of three Hilbert-space multireference coupled cluster (MRCC) variants—the state universal one and the Brillouin–Wigner and Mukherjee’s state specific ones. We have assessed these approaches on the cyclobutadiene and tetramethyleneethane molecules, which are both diradicals with exactly degenerate determinants at a certain geometry. We have also investigated the sensitivity of the results on the orbital rotation of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) pair, as it is well known that Hilbert-space MRCC methods are not invariant to such transformations.},

In our previous work, we showed that in many cases, potential interactions for such a scheme adopted a generalized quadratic form, whose parameters depend on means, variances, and correlation coefficients among the coarse-grain variables. In this work, we use statistical mechanics to derive analytic expressions for these parameters, using properties of the fluid, including pair distribution functions. These expressions are compared against simulation-derived values and shown to be in good agreement. This approach can be used to calculate a priori the potential for any homogeneous, simple fluid, without the need for fitting procedures or matching, thus increasing the ease of use of this coarse-grain scheme and creating a foundation for large-scale bottom-up simulations. Furthermore, these expressions provide a quantitative way of studying the boundary between discrete (atomic) and continuum models of fluids.},

The accuracy of the theory, however, largely depends on the approximations for the exchange–correlation (xc) kernels. Away from the long-wavelength (or q = 0 short wave-vector) and zero-frequency ( ω = 0) limit, the correlation contribution to the kernel becomes more relevant and dominant over exchange. The dielectric function, in principle, can encompass xc effects relevant to describe low-density physics. Furthermore, besides collective plasmon excitations, the dielectric function can reveal collective electron–hole excitations, often dubbed “ghost excitons.” Besides collective excitons, the physics of the low-density regime is rich, as exemplified by a static charge-density wave that was recently found for r s &gt; 69, and was shown to be associated with softening of the plasmon mode. These excitations are seen to be present in much higher density 2D homogeneous electron gases of r s ≳ 4. In this work, we perform a thorough analysis with xc model kernels for excitations of various nature. The uniform electron gas, as a useful model of real metallic systems, is used as a platform for our analysis. We highlight the relevance of exact constraints as we display and explain screening and excitations in the low-density region.},

  abstract = {Standard approximations for the exchange–correlation functional in Kohn–Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) typically lead to unacceptably large errors when applied to strongly correlated electronic systems. Partition-DFT (PDFT) is a formally exact reformulation of KS-DFT in which the ground-state density and energy of a system are obtained through self-consistent calculations on isolated fragments, with a partition energy representing inter -fragment interactions. Here, we show how typical errors of the local density approximation (LDA) in KS-DFT can be largely suppressed through a simple approximation, the multi-fragment overlap approximation (MFOA), for the partition energy in PDFT. Our method is illustrated on simple models of one-dimensional strongly correlated linear hydrogen chains. The MFOA, when used in combination with the LDA for the fragments, improves LDA dissociation curves of hydrogen chains and produces results that are comparable to those of spin-unrestricted LDA, but without breaking the spin symmetry. MFOA also induces a correction to the LDA electron density that partially captures the correct density dimerization in strongly correlated hydrogen chains. Moreover, with an additional correction to the partition energy that is specific to the one-dimensional LDA, the approximation is shown to produce dissociation energies in quantitative agreement with calculations based on the density matrix renormalization group method.},

Yet, it diverges at the so-called “crossover temperature.” Using the uniform semiclassical transmission probability of Kemble [Phys. Rev. 48 , 549 (1935)], we showed recently that in one dimension, one might derive a uniform semiclassical instanton rate theory, which has no divergence. In this paper, we generalize this uniform theory to many-dimensional systems. The resulting theory uses the same input as in the previous instanton theory, yet does not suffer from the divergence. The application of the uniform theory to dissipative systems is considered and used to revise Wolynes’ well-known analytical expression for the rate [P. G. Wolynes, Phys. Rev.

  abstract = {In this paper, we explore the molecular basis of combining photodynamic therapy (PDT), a light-triggered targeted anticancer therapy, with the traditional chemotherapeutic properties of the well-known cytotoxic agent gemcitabine. A photosensitizer prerequisite is significant absorption of biocompatible light in the visible/near IR range, ideally between 600 and 1000 nm. We use highly accurate multiconfigurational CASSCF/MS-CASPT2/MM and TD-DFT methodologies to determine the absorption properties of a series of gemcitabine derivatives with the goal of red-shifting the UV absorption band toward the visible region and facilitating triplet state population. The choice of the substitutions and, thus, the rational design is based on important biochemical criteria and on derivatives whose synthesis is reported in the literature. The modifications tackled in this paper consist of: (i) substitution of the oxygen atom at O 2 position with heavier atoms (O → S and O → Se) to red shift the absorption band and increase the spin–orbit coupling, (ii) addition of a lipophilic chain at the N7 position to enhance transport into cancer cells and slow down gemcitabine metabolism, and (iii) attachment of aromatic systems at C5 position to enhance red shift further. Results indicate that the combination of these three chemical modifications markedly shifts the absorption spectrum toward the 500 nm region and beyond and drastically increases spin–orbit coupling values, two key PDT requirements. The obtained theoretical predictions encourage biological studies to further develop this anticancer approach.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics can be a powerful method for probing complex processes. However, most CG force fields use pairwise nonbonded interaction potentials sets, which can limit their ability to capture complex multi-body phenomena such as the hydrophobic effect. As the hydrophobic effect primarily manifests itself due to the nonpolar solute affecting the nearby hydrogen bonding network in water, capturing such effects using a simple one CG site or “bead” water model is a challenge. In this work, we systematically test the ability of CG one site water models for capturing critical features of the solvent environment around a hydrophobe as well as the potential of mean force (PMF) of neopentane association. We study two bottom-up models: a simple pairwise (SP) force-matched water model constructed using the multiscale coarse-graining method and the Bottom-Up Many-Body Projected Water (BUMPer) model, which has implicit three-body correlations. We also test the top-down monatomic (mW) and the Machine Learned mW (ML-mW) water models. The mW models perform well in capturing structural correlations but not the energetics of the PMF. BUMPer outperforms SP in capturing structural correlations and also gives an accurate PMF in contrast to the two mW models. Our study highlights the importance of including three-body interactions in CG water models, either explicitly or implicitly, while in general highlighting the applicability of bottom-up CG water models for studying hydrophobic effects in a quantitative fashion. This assertion comes with a caveat, however, regarding the accuracy of the enthalpy–entropy decomposition of the PMF of hydrophobe association.},

  abstract = {Time-resolved pump–probe and two-dimensional spectroscopy are widely used to study ultrafast chemical and biological processes in solutions. However, the corresponding signals at long times can be contaminated by molecular photothermal effects, which are caused by the nonradiative heat dissipation of photoexcited molecules to the surroundings. Additionally, molecular diffusion affects the transient spectroscopic signals because photoexcited molecules can diffuse away from the pump and probe beam focuses. Recently, a theoretical description of molecular photothermal effects on time-resolved IR spectroscopy was reported. In this work, I consider the molecular photothermal process, molecular diffusion, and sample flow to develop a generalized theoretical description of time-resolved spectroscopy. The present work can be used to interpret time-resolved spectroscopic signals of electronic or vibrational chromophores and understand the rate and mechanisms of the conversion of high-frequency molecular electronic and vibrational energy to solvent kinetic energy in condensed phases.},

The 0-DH, CIDH, QIDH, and 0–2 type double-hybrid functionals are assessed as a starting point for further modification. Variants with 50\% and 69\% Hartree–Fock exchange (HFX) are empirically optimized (Pr 2 SCAN50 and Pr 2 SCAN69), and the effect of MP2-regularization ( κ Pr 2 SCAN50) and range-separated HFX ( ω Pr 2 SCAN50) is evaluated. All optimized functionals are combined with the state-of-the-art London dispersion corrections D4 and NL. The resulting functionals are assessed comprehensively for their performance on main-group and metal-organic thermochemistry on 90 different benchmark sets containing 25 800 data points. These include the extensive GMTKN55 database, additional sets for main-group chemistry, and multiple sets for transition-metal complexes, including the ROST61, the MOR41, and the MOBH35 sets. As the main target of this study is the development of a broadly applicable, robust functional with low empiricism, special focus is put on variants with moderate amounts of HFX (50\%), which are compared to the so far successful PWPB95-D4 (50\% HFX, 20\% MP2 correlation) functional. The overall best variant, ω Pr 2 SCAN50-D4, performs well on main-group and metal-organic thermochemistry, followed by Pr 2 SCAN69-D4 that offers a slight edge for metal-organic thermochemistry and by the low HFX global double-hybrid Pr 2 SCAN50-D4 that performs robustly across all tested sets.

Here we modify this model to explicitly include cell-cycle dynamics and then derive an exact solution for the time-dependent joint distribution of mRNA and protein numbers. We show large differences between this model and the classical model which captures cell-cycle effects implicitly via effective first-order dilution reactions. In particular we find that the Fano factor of protein numbers calculated from a population snapshot measurement are underestimated by the classical model whereas the correlation between mRNA and protein can be either over- or underestimated, depending on the timescales of mRNA degradation and promoter switching relative to the mean cell-cycle duration time.},

The short-range part can be efficiently computed using the analytical algorithm due to the locality in both the Gaussian-type orbital basis and the short-range Coulomb potentials. The integrals for the long-range Coulomb potential can be approximated with the density fitting method. A very small auxiliary basis is sufficient for the density fitting method to accurately approximate the long-range integrals. This feature significantly reduces the computational efforts associated with the N 4 scaling in density fitting algorithms. For large molecules, the range separation and long-range density fitting method outperforms the conventional analytical integral evaluation scheme employed in Hartree–Fock calculations and provides more than twice the overall performance. In addition, this method offers a higher accuracy compared to conventional density fitting methods. The error in the Hartree–Fock energy can be easily reduced to 0.1 μE h per atom or smaller.},

Here, we generalize DC-MF dynamics for an arbitrary number of (nondegenerate) atomic levels and show that it resolves an unphysical lack of emission from a three-level atom predicted by conventional mean-field dynamics.

By the combination of high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy imaging and density functional theory calculations, the hydration of 9mA molecules was realized on Au(111) in real space, forming 9mA–H 2 O–9mA structures. In comparison with the hydration of adenine molecules, methyl derivatization is experimentally found to remotely regulate the hydration sites from the imidazole ring to the pyrimidine ring and is further theoretically revealed to allow intramolecular electron redistribution and, therefore, steer the priority of the hydration sites.

  abstract = {Using phase-field simulations, we investigate the bulk coarsening dynamics of ternary polymer solutions undergoing a glass transition for two models of phase separation: diffusion only and with hydrodynamics. The glass transition is incorporated in both models by imposing mobility and viscosity contrasts between the polymer-rich and polymer-poor phases of the evolving microstructure. For microstructures composed of polymer-poor clusters in a polymer-rich matrix, the mobility and viscosity contrasts significantly hinder coarsening, effectively leading to structural arrest. For microstructures composed of polymer-rich clusters in a polymer-poor matrix, the mobility and viscosity contrasts do not impede domain growth; rather, they change the transient concentration of the polymer-rich phase, altering the shape of the discrete domains. This effect introduces several complexities to the coarsening process, including percolation inversion of the polymer-rich and polymer-poor phases—a phenomenon normally attributed to viscoelastic phase separation.},

  abstract = {The demand for applications, such as coatings, separation filters, and electronic packaging, has greatly driven the research of polymer films. At nanometer scale, mechanical properties of thin polymer films can significantly deviate from bulk. Despite outstanding progresses, there still lack deep discussions on nonlinear viscoelastic–viscoplastic response and their interactions under nanoconfinement. In this work, by conducting measurements via the bubble inflation method and modelling using Schapery and Perzyna equations, we demonstrate nonlinear viscoelastic–viscoplastic properties of freely standing thin polystyrene (PS) films. The results show the unchanged glassy compliance and the rubbery stiffening phenomenon for thin PS films, where the lower rubbery plateau in rubbery stiffening may originate from the induced molecular orientation by plastic deformation. With decreasing film thickness, viscosity and yield stress in viscoplasticity increase in an exponential and a linear trend, respectively, indicating the significant role of nanoconfinement effect on viscoplastic properties. These findings may reveal that there are many properties from linear viscoelasticity to nonlinear viscoelasticity–viscoplasticity that need to be explored and unveiled for sufficient understanding of the nanoconfinement effect on altering mechanical behavior of polymers.},

To bridge this gap, we implement the Ising density functional theory (iDFT) for ionizable polymer systems using the single-chain-in-mean-field algorithm. The single-chain-in-iDFT (sc-iDFT) shows significant improvements over conventional mean-field methods in describing segment-level dissociation equilibrium, specific ion effects, and long-range intrachain correlations. With an explicit consideration of the fluctuations of polymer configurations and the position-dependent ionization of individual polymer segments, sc-iDFT provides a faithful description of the structure and thermodynamic properties of inhomogeneous weak polyelectrolyte systems across multiple length scales.},

  abstract = {The study of granular avalanches in rotating drums is not only essential to understanding various complex behaviors of interest in granular media from a scientific perspective; it also has valuable applications in regard to industrial processes and geological catastrophes. Despite decades of research studies on avalanches, a proper understanding of their dynamic properties still remains a great challenge to scientists due to a lack of state-of-the-art techniques. In this study, we accurately predict the avalanche dynamic features of three-dimensional granular materials in rotating drums, by using graph neural networks on the basis of their initial static microstructures alone. We find that our method is robust to changes in various model parameters, such as the interaction potential, size polydispersity, and noise in particle coordinates. In addition, with the grain-scale velocities obtained either from our network or from numerical simulations, we find an approximately equal and strong correlation between the global velocity and global velocity fluctuation in our 3D granular avalanche systems, which further demonstrates the predictive power of our trained graph neural networks to uncover the fundamental physics of granular avalanches. We expect our method to provide more insight into the avalanche dynamics of granular materials and other amorphous systems in the future.},

The breath of a person affected by lung cancer presents a concentration of 1-propanol higher than usual. In this context, the development of specific sensors to detect 1-propanol from breath is of high interest. The amount of propanol usually detected on the breath is of few ppb; this small quantity is a handicap for a reliable diagnostic. This limitation can be overcome if the sensor is equipped with a pre-concentrator. Our studies aim to provide an efficient material playing this role. This will contribute to the development of reliable and easy to use lung cancer detectors. For this, we investigate the properties of a few hydrophobic porous materials (chabazite, silicalite-1, and dealuminated faujasite). Hydrophobic structures are used to avoid saturation of materials by the water present in the exhaled breath. Our experimental and simulation results suggest that silicalite −1 (MFI) is the most suitable structure to be used as a pre-concentrator.},

Moreover, our memristor showcases synaptic behaviors encompassing potentiation, depression, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and excitatory postsynaptic currents. This synaptic emulation holds tremendous promise for applications in neuromorphic computing, offering the opportunity to replicate the adaptive learning principles observed in biological synapses.

In this research, a facile hydrothermal method was used to prepare MnFe 2 O 4 , and the grain size of MnFe 2 O 4 decreased with increasing hydrothermal temperature. When the size of MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles is less than 10 nm, its quantum size effect and surface effect make its electromagnetic microwave absorption performance greatly optimized. When the thickness of MnFe 2 O 4 -110 °C is 2.57 mm, the minimum reflection loss (RL min ) is −35.28 dB. Based on this, light porous diatomite and a three-dimensional polyaniline network are introduced. Diatomite is used as the base material to effectively reduce the agglomeration of MnFe 2 O 4 quantum dots. The relatively high surface area introduced by a three-dimensional network of polyaniline promotes the orientation, interfacial polarization, multiple relaxation, and impedance matching, thereby generating further dielectric loss. Additionally, the magnetic properties of manganese ferrite and the strong electrical conductivity of polyaniline play an appropriate complementary role in electromagnetic wave absorption. The RL min of MnFe 2 O 4 /PANI/diatomite is −56.70 dB at 11.12 GHz with an absorber layer thickness of 2.57 mm. The effective frequency bandwidth (RL &lt; −10 dB) ranges from 9.21 to 18.00 GHz. The absorption mechanism indicates that the high absorption intensity is the result of the synergistic effect of impedance matching, conduction losses, polarization losses, and magnetic losses.},

Herein, we propose a new scenario of ligand engineering featuring Pb 2+ /Br − site-selective capping on the surface of CsPbBr 3 QDs. Through joint observations of temperature-dependent photoluminescence, ultrafast transient absorption, and Raman spectroscopy of the two contrasting model systems of CsPbBr 3 QDs (i.e., capping with organic ligand only vs hybrid organic/inorganic ligands), we reveal that the phononic regulation of Pb–Br stretching at the Br-site (relative to Pb-site) leads to a larger suppression of charge–phonon coupling due to a stronger polaronic screening effect, thereby more effectively retarding the hot-carrier cooling process. This work opens a new route for the manipulation of hot-carrier cooling dynamics in perovskite systems via site-selective ligand engineering.},

  abstract = {Photocatalytic water splitting for green hydrogen production is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Loading a co-catalyst is essential for accelerating the kinetics, but the detailed reaction mechanism and role of the co-catalyst are still obscure. Here, we focus on cobalt oxide (CoO x ) loaded on bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) to investigate the impact of CoO x on the OER mechanism. We employ photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy and simultaneous measurements of photoinduced absorption and photocurrent. The reduction of V 5+ in BiVO 4 promotes the formation of a surface state on CoO x that plays a crucial role in the OER. The third-order reaction rate with respect to photohole charge density indicates that reaction intermediate species accumulate in the surface state through a three-electron oxidation process prior to the rate-determining step. Increasing the excitation light intensity onto the CoO x -loaded anode improves the photoconversion efficiency significantly, suggesting that the OER reaction at dual sites in an amorphous CoO x (OH) y layer dominates over single sites. Therefore, CoO x is directly involved in the OER by providing effective reaction sites, stabilizing reaction intermediates, and improving the charge transfer rate. These insights help advance our understanding of co-catalyst-assisted OER to achieve efficient water splitting.},

In addition, we show that the concentration-gradient-driven solution flux in this regime is quantified far more efficiently by explicitly applying a transmembrane concentration difference using our algorithm than by applying Onsager reciprocity to pressure-driven flow. The simulated fluid fluxes are captured with reasonable quantitative accuracy by our previously derived continuum theory of concentration-gradient-driven fluid transport through a 2D membrane [D. J.

With increasing sulfuration time, the degradation rate increases first and then decreases. The best degradation rate is observed for the heterojunction sulfurated for 90 min. The strong broad luminescence band is extremely beneficial to the absorption of visible light by multiphoton process.

  abstract = {The high catalytic activity and specificity of enzymes can be used to pretreat biomass. Herein, the resourceful, reproducible, cheap, and crude protein-rich cottonseed meal (CM) is selected as a precursor and the protease in the K 2 CO 3 –KHCO 3 buffer solution is used as the enzyme degradation substance to pretreat CM. The crude protein content is significantly reduced by the protease degradation, and, meanwhile, it results in a looser and porous structure of CM. What is more, it significantly reduces the amount of activator. In the subsequent carbonization process, the K 2 CO 3 –KHCO 3 in the buffer solution is also used as an activating agent (the mass ratio of CM to activator is 2:1), and after carbonization, the O, S, and N doped porous carbon is obtained. The optimized PCM-800-4 exhibits high heteroatom contents and a hierarchical porous structure. The specific capacitance of the prepared porous carbon reaches up to 233 F g −1 in 6M KOH even when 10 mg of active material is loaded. In addition, a K 2 CO 3 –KHCO 3 /EG based gel electrolyte is prepared and the fabricated flexible capacitor exhibits an energy density of 15.6 Wh kg −1 and a wide temperature range (−25 to 100 °C). This study presents a simple enzymatic degradation and reduced activator dosage strategy to prepare a cottonseed meal derived carbon material and looks forward to preparing porous carbon using other biomass.},

  abstract = {The interaction of the PBr 3 molecule with Si dangling bonds (DBs) on a chlorinated Si(100) surface was studied. The DBs were charged in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and then exposed to PBr 3 directly in the STM chamber. Uncharged DBs rarely react with molecules. On the contrary, almost all positively charged DBs were filled with molecule fragments. As a result of the PBr 3 interaction with the positively charged DB, the molecule dissociated into PBr 2 and Br with the formation of a Si–Br bond and PBr 2 desorption. These findings show that charged DBs significantly modify the reactivity of the surface toward PBr 3 . Additionally, we calculated PH 3 adsorption on a Si(100)–2 × 1–H surface with DBs and found that the DB charge also has a significant impact. As a result, we demonstrated that the positively charged DB with a doubly unoccupied state enhances the adsorption of molecules with a lone pair of electrons.},

  abstract = {Concentrated ionic aqueous electrolytes possess a diverse array of applications across various fields, particularly in the field of energy storage. Despite extensive examination, the intricate relationships and numerous physical mechanisms underpinning diverse phenomena remain incompletely understood. Molecular dynamics simulations are employed to probe the attributes of aqueous solutions containing LiCl, NaCl, KCl, MgCl 2 , and CaCl 2 , spanning various solute fractions. The primary emphasis of the simulations is on unraveling the intricate interplay between these attributes and the underlying physical mechanisms. The configurations of cation-Cl − and Cl − –Cl − pairs within these solutions are disclosed. As the solute fraction increases, consistent trends manifest regardless of solute type: (i) the number of hydrogen bonds formed by the hydration water surrounding ions decreases, primarily attributed to the growing presence of counter ions in proximity to the hydration water; (ii) the hydration number of ions exhibits varying trends influenced by multiple factor; and (iii) the diffusion of ions slows down, attributed to the enhanced confinement and rebound of cations and Cl − ions from the surrounding atoms, concurrently coupled with the changes in ion vibration modes. In our analysis, we have, for the first time, clarified the reasons behind the slowing down of the diffusion of the ions with increasing solute fraction. Our research contributes to a better understanding and manipulation of the attributes of ionic aqueous solutions and may help designing high-performance electrolytes.},

The physical deformation of the surface was analyzed using atomic force microscopy. The size of the groove increased as the GO dopant concentration increased, but the direction of the groove along the brush direction was maintained. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed that the number of C–C and O–Sn bonds increased as the GO concentration increased. Since the van der Waals force on the surface increases as the number of O–metal bonds increases, we were able to determine why the anchoring energy of the LC alignment layer increased. This was confirmed by residual DC voltage and anchoring energy measurements that were later performed. As the GO concentration increased, the width of the hysteresis curve decreased, indicating that the residual DC voltage decreased. Additionally, the 15\% GO-doped sample exhibited a significant increase in its anchoring energy up to 1.34 × 10 −3 J/m 2 , which is similar to that of rubbed polyimide. It also secured a high level of electro-optical properties and demonstrated potential as a next-generation thin-film display despite being produced via a simple brush-coating process.},

  abstract = {We employ the molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamics of acetanilide (ACN) molecules placed on a flat surface of planar multilayer hexagonal boron nitride. We demonstrate that the ACN molecules, known to be achiral in the three-dimensional space, become chiral after being placed on the substrate. Homochirality of the ACN molecules leads to stable secondary structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds between peptide groups of the molecules. By employing molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that the structure of the resulting hydrogen-bond chains depends on the isomeric composition of the molecules. If all molecules are homochiral (i.e., with only one isomer being present), they form secondary structures (chains of hydrogen bonds in the shapes of arcs, circles, and spirals). If the molecules at the substrate form a racemic mixture, then no regular secondary structures appear, and only curvilinear chains of hydrogen bonds of random shapes emerge. A hydrogen-bond chain can form a zigzag array only if it has an alternation of isomers. Such chains can create two-dimensional (2D) regular lattices or 2D crystals. The melting scenarios of such 2D crystals depend on density of its coverage of the substrate. At 25\% coverage, melting occurs continuously in the temperature interval 295–365 K. For a complete coverage, melting occurs at 415–470 K due to a shift of 11\% of all molecules into the second layer of the substrate.},

Elementary photostimulated reactions initiated in CUR molecules under UV irradiation are studied using the chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization method in an acetonitrile solvent. Density functional theory is applied to elucidate the energetics of fragmentation of CUR by low-energy (0–15 eV) resonance electron attachment and to characterize various CUR radical forms. The adiabatic electron affinity of CUR molecule is experimentally estimated to be about 1 eV. An extra electron attachment to the π 1 * LUMO and π 2 * molecular orbitals is responsible for the most intense DEA signals observed at thermal electron energy. The most abundant long-lived (hundreds of micro- to milliseconds) molecular negative ions CUR – are detected not only at the thermal energy of incident electrons but also at 0.6 eV, which is due to the formation of the π 3 * and π 4 * temporary negative ion states predicted to lie around 1 eV. Proton-assisted electron transfer between CUR molecules is registered under UV irradiation. The formation of both radical-anions and radical-cations of CUR is found to be more favorable in its enol form. The present findings shed some light on the elementary processes triggered in CUR by electrons and photons and, therefore, can be useful to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for a variety of biological effects produced by CUR.},

  abstract = {Photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) produced from the photoionization of chiral molecules using elliptically polarized light exhibit a forward/backward asymmetry with respect to the optical propagation direction. By recording these distributions using the velocity-map imaging (VMI) technique, the resulting photoelectron elliptical dichroism (PEELD) has previously been demonstrated as a promising spectroscopic tool for studying chiral molecules in the gas phase. The use of elliptically polarized laser pulses, however, produces PADs (and consequently, PEELD distributions) that do not exhibit cylindrical symmetry about the propagation axis. This leads to significant limitations and challenges when employing conventional VMI acquisition and data processing strategies. Using novel photoelectron image analysis methods based around Hankel transform reconstruction tomography and machine learning, however, we have quantified—for the first time—significant symmetry-breaking contributions to PEELD signals that are of a comparable magnitude to the symmetric terms in the multiphoton ionization of (1 R ,4 R )-(+)- and (1 S ,4 S )-(−)-camphor. This contradicts any assumptions that symmetry-breaking can be ignored when reconstructing VMI data. Furthermore, these same symmetry-breaking terms are expected to appear in any experiment where circular and linear laser fields are used together. This ionization scheme is particularly relevant for investigating dynamics in chiral molecules, but it is not limited to them. Developing a full understanding of these terms and the role they play in the photoionization of chiral molecules is of clear importance if the potential of PEELD and related effects for future practical applications is to be fully realized.},

  abstract = {Chirped-Pulse Fourier-Transform millimeter wave (CP-FTmmW) spectroscopy is a powerful method that enables detection of quantum state specific reactants and products in mixtures. We have successfully coupled this technique with a pulsed uniform Laval flow system to study photodissociation and reactions at low temperature, which we refer to as CPUF (“Chirped-Pulse/Uniform flow”). Detection by CPUF requires monitoring the free induction decay (FID) of the rotational coherence. However, the high collision frequency in high-density uniform supersonic flows can interfere with the FID and attenuate the signal. One way to overcome this is to sample the flow, but this can cause interference from shocks in the sampling region. This led us to develop an extended Laval nozzle that creates a uniform flow within the nozzle itself, after which the gas undergoes a shock-free secondary expansion to cold, low pressure conditions ideal for CP-FTmmW detection. Impact pressure measurements, commonly used to characterize Laval flows, cannot be used to monitor the flow within the nozzle. Therefore, we implemented a REMPI (resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization) detection scheme that allows the interrogation of the conditions of the flow directly inside the extended nozzle, confirming the fluid dynamics simulations of the flow environment. We describe the development of the new 20 K extended flow, along with its characterization using REMPI and computational fluid dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate its application to the first low temperature measurement of the reaction kinetics of HCO with O 2 and obtain a rate coefficient at 20 K of 6.66 ± 0.47 × 10 −11 cm 3 molec −1 s −1 .},

  abstract = {Conical intersections constitute the conceptual bedrock of our working understanding of ultrafast, nonadiabatic processes within photochemistry (and photophysics). Accurate calculation of potential energy surfaces within the vicinity of conical intersections, however, still poses a serious challenge to many popular electronic structure methods. Multiple works have reported on the deficiency of methods like linear-response time-dependent density functional theory within the adiabatic approximation (AA LR-TDDFT) or algebraic diagrammatic construction to second-order [ADC(2)]—approaches often used in excited-state molecular dynamics simulations—to describe conical intersections between the ground and excited electronic states. In the present study, we focus our attention on conical intersections between excited electronic states and probe the ability of AA LR-TDDFT and ADC(2) to describe their topology and topography, using protonated formaldimine and pyrazine as two exemplar molecules. We also take the opportunity to revisit the performance of these methods in describing conical intersections involving the ground electronic state in protonated formaldimine—highlighting in particular how the intersection ring exhibited by AA LR-TDDFT can be perceived either as a (near-to-linear) seam of intersection or two interpenetrating cones, depending on the magnitude of molecular distortions within the branching space.},

  abstract = {The violation of detailed balance poses a serious problem for the majority of current quasiclassical methods for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics. In order to analyze the severity of the problem, we predict the long-time limits of the electronic populations according to various quasiclassical mapping approaches by applying arguments from classical ergodic theory. Our analysis confirms that regions of the mapping space that correspond to negative populations, which most mapping approaches introduce in order to go beyond the Ehrenfest approximation, pose the most serious issue for reproducing the correct thermalization behavior. This is because inverted potentials, which arise from negative electronic populations entering the nuclear force, can result in trajectories unphysically accelerating off to infinity. The recently developed mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) provides a simple way of avoiding inverted potentials while retaining an accurate description of the dynamics. We prove that MASH, unlike any other quasiclassical approach, is guaranteed to describe the exact thermalization behavior of all quantum–classical systems, confirming it as one of the most promising methods for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics in real condensed-phase systems.},

Simple search algorithms find that many empirical approximations satisfy many exact conditions for realistic densities and non-empirical approximations satisfy even more conditions than those enforced in their construction.

In particular, we focus on intermolecular interactions in representative dimer complexes. The CBOA potential energy surfaces are compared with those obtained using a polaritonic approach, where the photonic and electronic degrees of freedom are treated at the same level.

  abstract = {We present a novel approach for systematically exploring the conformational space of small molecules with multiple internal torsions. Identifying unique conformers through a systematic conformational search is important for obtaining accurate thermodynamic functions (e.g., free energy), encompassing contributions from the ensemble of all local minima. Traditional geometry optimizers focus on one structure at a time, lacking transferability from the local potential-energy surface (PES) around a specific minimum to optimize other conformers. In this work, we introduce a physics-driven meta-Gaussian processes (meta-GPs) method that not only enables efficient exploration of target PES for locating local minima but, critically, incorporates physical surrogates that can be applied universally across the optimization of all conformers of the same molecule. Meta-GPs construct surrogate PESs based on the optimization history of prior conformers, dynamically selecting the most suitable prior mean function (representing prior knowledge in Bayesian learning) as a function of the optimization progress. We systematically benchmarked the performance of multiple GP variants for brute-force conformational search of amino acids. Our findings highlight the superior performance of meta-GPs in terms of efficiency, comprehensiveness of conformer discovery, and the distribution of conformers compared to conventional non-surrogate optimizers and other non-meta-GPs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by concurrently optimizing, training GPs on the fly, and learning PESs, meta-GPs exhibit the capacity to generate high-quality PESs in the torsional space without extensive training data. This represents a promising avenue for physics-based transfer learning via meta-GPs with adaptive priors in exploring torsional conformer space.},

Recently, it has been shown that a variety of these networks can be leveraged to make real time non-equilibrium simulations of dynamics involving the Feynman–Vernon influence functional more efficient. In this work, a tensor network is developed for non-perturbatively calculating the equilibrium correlation function for open quantum systems using the path integral methodology. These correlation functions are of fundamental importance in calculations of rates of reactions, simulations of response functions and susceptibilities, spectra of systems, etc. The influence of the solvent on the quantum system is incorporated through an influence functional, whose unconventional structure motivates the design of a new optimal matrix product-like operator that can be applied to the so-called path amplitude matrix product state. This complex-time tensor network path integral approach provides an exceptionally efficient representation of the path integral, enabling simulations for larger systems strongly interacting with baths and at lower temperatures out to longer time. The derivation, design, and implementation of this method are discussed along with a wide range of illustrations ranging from rate theory and symmetrized spin correlation functions to simulation of response of the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex to light.},

Remarkably good agreement with experimental estimates of the excitation energy is obtained using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) when Perdew–Zunger self-interaction correction is applied in combination with complex-valued orbitals. Even without the correction, the PBE functional gives quite good results despite the fact that corresponding Rydberg virtual orbitals have positive energy in the ground state calculation. Results obtained using the Tao, Perdew, Staroverov, and Scuseria (TPSS) and r2SCAN meta-GGA functionals are also presented, but they do not provide a systematic improvement over the results from the uncorrected PBE functional. The grid representation combined with the projector augmented-wave approach gives a simpler and better representation of diffuse Rydberg orbitals than a linear combination of atomic orbitals with commonly used basis sets, the latter leading to an overestimation of the excitation energy due to confinement of the excited states.},

Despite its popularity, a rigorous formal derivation of the algorithm has yet to be achieved. In this paper, we derive the energy-conserving momentum jumps employed by FSSH from the perspective of quantum trajectory surface hopping (QTSH) [Martens, J. Phys. Chem. A 123 , 1110 (2019)]. In the limit of localized nonadiabatic transitions, simple mathematical and physical arguments allow the FSSH algorithm to be derived from first principles. For general processes, the quantum forces characterizing the QTSH method provide accurate results for nonadiabatic dynamics with rigorous energy conservation, at the ensemble level, within the consistency of the underlying stochastic surface hopping without resorting to the artificial momentum rescaling of FSSH.},

In this study, we assess the validity of different Taylor expansion-based approximations of kinetic energy operators in a (curvilinear) polyspherical parametrization. To this end, we investigate the accuracy as well as the numerical performance of the approximations in time-independent vibrational coupled cluster and full vibrational interaction calculations for several test cases ranging from tri- to penta-atomic molecules. We find that several of the proposed schemes reproduce the vibrational ground state and excitation energies to a decent accuracy, justifying their application in future investigations. Furthermore, due to the restricted mode coupling and their inherent sum-of-products form, the new approximations open up the possibility of treating large molecular systems with efficient vibrational coupled cluster schemes in general coordinates.},

  abstract = {Systems with many stable configurations abound in nature, both in living and inanimate matter, encoding a rich variety of behaviors. In equilibrium, a multistable system is more likely to be found in configurations with lower energy, but the presence of an external drive can alter the relative stability of different configurations in unexpected ways. Living systems are examples par excellence of metastable nonequilibrium attractors whose structure and stability are highly dependent on the specific form and pattern of the energy flow sustaining them. Taking this distinctively lifelike behavior as inspiration, we sought to investigate the more general physical phenomenon of drive-specific selection in nonequilibrium dynamics. To do so, we numerically studied driven disordered mechanical networks of bistable springs possessing a vast number of stable configurations arising from the two stable rest lengths of each spring, thereby capturing the essential physical properties of a broad class of multistable systems. We found that there exists a range of forcing amplitudes for which the attractor states of driven disordered multistable mechanical networks are fine-tuned with respect to the pattern of external forcing to have low energy absorption from it. Additionally, we found that these drive-specific attractor states are further stabilized by precise matching between the multidimensional shape of their orbit and that of the potential energy well they inhabit. Lastly, we showed evidence of drive-specific selection in an experimental system and proposed a general method to estimate the range of drive amplitudes for drive-specific selection.},

The approach is based on the effect of an external electric field on the migration rate and, consequently, the kinetics of the reaction. As a first step, this problem is considered a stochastic one-step process with absorbing and reflecting boundaries, and an analytical solution is obtained in the case that the second reactant is immobile. With the use of computer simulations of stochastic migration, the effect of the mobility of both reactants and the influence of the Coulomb interaction between them are considered. It is found that the ratio of the pair reaction rates with and without an external field is relatively little dependent on these factors and that the analytical expressions derived can be applied to estimate the relative mobility of recombining particles with accuracy better than a factor of two in many realistic situations.},

  abstract = {We introduce a generalization of the σ -SCF method to approximate noncollinear spin ground and excited single-reference electronic states by minimizing the Hamiltonian variance. The new method is based on the σ -SCF method, originally proposed by Ye et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 147 , 214104 (2017)], and provides a prescription to determine ground and excited noncollinear spin states on an equal footing. Our implementation was carried out utilizing an initial simulated annealing stage followed by a mean-field iterative self-consistent approach to simplify the cumbersome search introduced by generalizing the spin degrees of freedom. The simulated annealing stage ensures a broad exploration of the Hilbert space spanned by the generalized spin single-reference states with random complex element-wise rotations of the generalized density matrix elements in the simulated annealing stage. The mean-field iterative self-consistent stage employs an effective Fockian derived from the variance, which is utilized to converge tightly to the solutions. This process helps us to easily find complex spin structures, avoiding manipulating the initial guess. As proof-of-concept tests, we present results for H n (n = 3–7) planar rings and polyhedral clusters with geometrical spin frustration. We show that most of these systems have noncollinear spin excited states that can be interpreted in terms of geometric spin frustration. These states are not directly targeted by energy minimization methods, which are meant to converge to the ground state. This stresses the capability of the σ -SCF methodology to find approximate noncollinear spin structures as mean-field excited states.},

The resulting simplified, regularized ( sreg TM) functional delivers performance on standard molecular and solid state test sets equal to that of the earlier revised, regularized Tao–Mo functional. Here, we address de-orbitalization of that new sreg TM into a pure density functional. We summarize the failures of the Mejía-Rodríguez and Trickey de-orbitalization strategy [Phys. Rev. A 96 , 052512 (2017)] when used with both versions. We discuss how those failures apparently arise in the so-called z ′ indicator function and in substitutes for the reduced density Laplacian in the parent functionals. Then, we show that the sreg TM functional can be de-orbitalized somewhat well with a rather peculiarly parameterized version of the previously used deorbitalizer. We discuss, briefly, a de-orbitalization that works in the sense of reproducing error patterns but that apparently succeeds by cancelation of major qualitative errors associated with the de-orbitalized indicator functions α and z , hence, is not recommended. We suggest that the same issue underlies the earlier finding of comparatively mediocre performance of the de-orbitalized Tao–Perdew–Staroverov–Scuseri functional. Our work demonstrates that the intricacy of such two-indicator functionals magnifies the errors introduced by the Mejía-Rodríguez and Trickey de-orbitalization approach in ways that are extremely difficult to analyze and correct.},

Those include performance on standard thermochemistry and solid data sets that is competitive with that of the most widely explored meta-generalized-gradient-approximation DFAs (SCAN and r 2 SCAN) while also providing superior performance on elemental solid magnetization.

We report investigation that leads to diagnosis of how the regularization in rreg TM of the z indicator functions ( z = the ratio of the von-Weizsäcker and Kohn–Sham kinetic energy densities) leads to non-physical behavior. We propose a simpler regularization that eliminates those oddities and that can be calibrated to reproduce the good error patterns of rreg TM. We denote this version as simplified, regularized Tao–Mo, sreg TM.

The method relies on shape based coarse-graining combined with scaling of mobility matrix components by factors derived based on energy dissipation arguments for Stokes flows. Tests performed for a capsule shaped molecule and its coarse-grained model, a dumbbell, for three different types of boundaries (a sphere, an open cylinder, and two parallel planes) are described. An almost perfect agreement between mobility functions of the detailed and coarse-grained models, even close to boundary surfaces, is obtained. The proposed method can be used to simplify hydrodynamic calculations and reduce errors introduced due to coarse-graining of molecular shapes.},

  abstract = {Symmetry, in particular permutational symmetry, of a potential energy surface (PES) is a useful property in quantum chemical calculations. It facilitates, in particular, state labelling and identification of degenerate states. In many practically important applications, however, these issues are unimportant. The imposition of exact symmetry and the perception that it is necessary create additional methodological requirements narrowing or complicating algorithmic choices that are thereby biased against methods and codes that by default do not incorporate symmetry, including most off-the-shelf machine learning methods that cannot be directly used if exact symmetry is demanded. By introducing symmetric and unsymmetric errors into the PES of H 2 CO in a controlled way and computing the vibrational spectrum with collocation using symmetric and nonsymmetric collocation point sets, we show that when the deviations from an ideal PES are random, imposition of exact symmetry does not bring any practical advantages. Moreover, a calculation ignoring symmetry may be more accurate. We also compare machine-learned PESs with and without symmetrization and demonstrate that there is no advantage of imposing exact symmetry for the accuracy of the vibrational spectrum.},

Using the infinite-separation-limit technique, this Communication proves the convexity condition for any formulation of DFT that is (1) exact for all v -representable densities, (2) size-consistent, and (3) translationally invariant. An analogous result is also proven for one-body reduced density matrix functional theory. While there are known DFT formulations in which the ground state is not always accessible, indicating that convexity does not hold in such cases, this proof, nonetheless, confirms a stringent constraint on the exact exchange–correlation functional. We also provide sufficient conditions for convexity in approximate DFT, which could aid in the development of density-functional approximations. This result lifts a standing assumption in the proof of the piecewise linearity condition with respect to electron count, which has proven central to understanding the Kohn–Sham bandgap and the exchange–correlation derivative discontinuity of DFT.},

In the nanoscale vicinity of an interface, glass-formers also exhibit the emergence of massive interfacial gradients in glass transition temperature T g and relaxation time τ . Both of these forms of heterogeneity have a major impact on material properties. Nevertheless, their interplay has remained poorly understood. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations of polymer thin films in the isoconfigurational ensemble in order to probe how bulk dynamic heterogeneity alters and is altered by the large gradient in dynamics at the surface of a glass-forming liquid. Results indicate that the τ spectrum at the surface is broader than in the bulk despite being shifted to shorter times, and yet it is less spatially correlated. This is distinct from the bulk, where the τ distribution becomes broader and more spatially organized as the mean τ increases. We also find that surface gradients in slow dynamics extend further into the film than those in fast dynamics—a result with implications for how distinct properties are perturbed near an interface. None of these features track locally with changes in the heterogeneity of caging scale, emphasizing the local disconnect between these quantities near interfaces. These results are at odds with conceptions of the surface as reflecting simply a higher “rheological temperature” than the bulk, instead pointing to a complex interplay between bulk dynamic heterogeneity and spatially organized dynamical gradients at interfaces in glass-forming liquids.},

The large size asymmetry between molecular-scale microions and colloidal macroions allows the microion degrees of freedom to be integrated out, leading to an effective one-component model of microion-dressed colloidal quasi-particles. For highly charged colloids with strong macroion–microion correlations, nonlinear effects can be incorporated into effective interactions by means of charge renormalization methods. Here, we compare and partially extend several practical mean-field methods of calculating renormalized colloidal interaction parameters, including effective charges and screening constants, as functions of concentration and ionic strength. Within the one-component description, we compute structural and thermodynamic properties from the effective interactions and assess the accuracy of the different methods by comparing predictions with elaborate primitive-model simulations [P. Linse, J. Chem. Phys. 113 , 4359 (2000)]. We also compare various prescriptions for the osmotic pressure of suspensions in Donnan equilibrium with a salt ion reservoir and analyze instances where the macroion effective charge becomes larger than the bare one. The methods assessed include single-center cell, jellium, and multi-center mean-field theories. The strengths and weaknesses of the various methods are critically assessed, with the aim of guiding optimal and accurate implementations.},

We have recently introduced [Munaò et al. , Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 25 , 16227 (2023)] a model that possibly provides the simplest binary mixture endowed with stripe order. The model consists of two species of identical hard spheres with equal concentration, which mutually interact through a square-well potential. In that paper, we have numerically shown that stripes are present in both liquid and solid phases when the attraction range is rather long. Here, we study the phase behavior of the model in terms of a density functional theory capable to account for the existence of stripes in the dense mixture. Our theory is accurate in reproducing the phases of the model, at least insofar as the composition inhomogeneities occur on length scales quite larger than the particle size. Then, using Monte Carlo simulations, we prove the existence of solid stripes even when the square well is much thinner than the particle diameter, making our model more similar to a real colloidal mixture. Finally, when the width of the attractive well is equal to the particle diameter, we observe a different and more complex form of compositional order in the solid, where each species of particle forms a regular porous matrix holding in its holes the other species, witnessing a surprising variety of emergent behaviors for a very basic model of interaction.},

We study the effect of different AP topologies, including block copolymers, ring block copolymers (RCP), and miktoarm star polymers, on the evolution morphologies, dynamic scaling functions, and length scale of the AB mixture. Our results demonstrate that the presence of APs leads to significantly different evolution morphologies in SF. However, the deviation from dynamical scaling is prominent, mainly for RCP. Typically, the characteristic length scale for SF follows the power law R ( t ) ∼ t ϕ , where ϕ is the growth exponent. In the presence of high AP, we observe diffusive growth ( ϕ → 1/3) at early times, followed by saturation in length scale ( ϕ → 0) at late times. The extent of saturation varies with constraints imposed on the APs, such as topology, composition ratio, chain length, and stiffness. At lower composition ratios, the system exhibits inertial hydrodynamic growth ( ϕ → 2/3) at asymptotic times without clearly exhibiting the viscous hydrodynamic regime ( ϕ → 1) at earlier times in our simulations. Our results firmly establish the existence of hydrodynamic growth regimes in low surfactant-influenced phase separation kinetics of binary fluids and settle the related ambiguity in d = 3 systems.},

  abstract = {Experimental observations unambiguously reveal quasi-frictionless water flow through nanometer-scale carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Classical fluid mechanics is deemed unfit to describe this enhanced flow, and recent investigations indicated that quantum mechanics is required to interpret the extremely weak water–CNT friction. In fact, by quantum scattering, water can only release discrete energy upon excitation of electronic and phononic modes in the CNT. Here, we analyze in detail how a traveling water molecule couples to both plasmon and phonon excitations within a sub-nanometer, periodic CNT. We find that the water molecule needs to exceed a minimum speed threshold of ∼50 m/s in order to scatter against CNT electronic and vibrational modes. Below this threshold, scattering is suppressed, as in standard superfluidity mechanisms. The scattering rates, relevant for faster water molecules, are also estimated.},

  abstract = {Molecular hydrogen has the potential to significantly reduce the use of carbon dioxide emitting energy processes. However, hydrogen gas storage is a major bottleneck for its large-scale use as current storage methods are energy intensive. Among different storage methods, physisorbing molecular hydrogen at ambient pressure and temperatures is a promising alternative—particularly in light of the advancements in tunable lightweight nanomaterials and high throughput screening methods. Nonetheless, understanding hydrogen adsorption in well-defined nanomaterials remains experimentally challenging and reference information is scarce despite the proliferation of works predicting hydrogen adsorption. We focus on Li, Na, Ca, and K, decorated graphene sheets as substrates for molecular hydrogen adsorption, and compute the most accurate adsorption energies available to date using quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). Building on our previous insights at the density functional theory (DFT) level, we find that a weak covalent chemisorption of molecular hydrogen, known as Kubas interaction, is feasible on Ca decorated graphene according to DMC, in agreement with DFT. This finding is in contrast to previous DMC predictions of the 4H 2 /Ca + gas cluster (without graphene) where chemisorption is not favored. However, we find that the adsorption energy of hydrogen on metal decorated graphene according to a widely used DFT method is not fully consistent with DMC. The reference adsorption energies reported herein can be used to find better work-horse methods for application in large-scale modeling of hydrogen adsorption. Furthermore, the implications of this work affect strategies for finding suitable hydrogen storage materials and high-throughput methods.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear optical methods, such as vibrational sum frequency generation (vSFG) and second harmonic generation (SHG), are powerful techniques to study elusive structures at charged buried interfaces. However, for the separation and determination of the Stern and diffuse layer spectra at these charged interfaces, complex vSFG spectra and, hence, the absolute phase need to be retrieved. The maximum entropy method is a useful tool for the retrieval of complex spectra from the intensity spectra; however, one caveat is that an understanding of the error phase is required. Here, for the first time, we provide a physically motivated understanding of the error phase. Determining the error phase from simulated spectra of oscillators with a spectral overlap, we show that for broadband vSFG spectra, such as for the silica/water interface, the diffuse and Stern layers’ spectral overlap within the O–H stretching window results in a correlation between the error phase and the phase shift between the responses of these layers. This correlation makes the error phase sensitive to changes in Debye length from varying the ionic strength among other variations at the interface. Furthermore, the change in the magnitude of the error phase can be related to the absolute SHG phase, permitting the use of an error phase model that can utilize the SHG phase to predict the error phase and, hence, the complex vSFG spectra. Finally, we highlight limitations of this model for vSFG spectra with a poor overlap between the diffuse and Stern layer spectra (silica/HOD in D 2 O system).},

  abstract = {Semiconductor-based photocatalysts have become increasingly used in the removal of pollutants from wastewater, especially antibiotics. A series of composite-based cuprous oxide and bismuth vanadate (Cu 2 O/BiVO 4 ) composite-based photocatalysts were synthesized by using the chemical method. The structure of the Cu 2 O/BiVO 4 composite was verified by using x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, photoluminescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and UV–visible spectra. The degradation of methylene blue (MB) and tetracycline (TC) was investigated to check the photocatalytic activity of the Cu 2 O/BiVO 4 composite series. The quantity of Cu 2 O was varied from 1\% to 7\% by weight to prepare the series of Cu 2 O/BiVO 4 composites. The analysis of results verified that 5\% Cu 2 O/BiVO 4 exhibits an outstanding photocatalytic activity as compared to 1\%, 3\%, and 7\% Cu 2 O/BiVO 4 , pure Cu 2 O, and pure BiVO 4 under visible light irradiation. The optimum value of photocatalytic degradation achieved with 5\% Cu 2 O/BiVO 4 was 97\% for MB dye and 95\% for TC in 120 min, which is greater than the photocatalytic degradation of pure BiVO 4 (MB 45\% and TC 72\%), pure Cu 2 O (MB 57\% and TC 80\%), 1\% Cu 2 O/BiVO 4 (MB 72\% and TC 85\%), 3\% Cu 2 O/BiVO 4 (MB 83\% and TC 88\%), and 7\% Cu 2 O/BiVO 4 (MB 87\% and TC 91\%). The stability and reusability of Cu 2 O/BiVO 4 were also investigated. To check the major role of trapping in degradation, a trapping experiment was also performed by using three trapping agents: BQ, EDTA, and tBuOH. The results showed that Cu 2 O/BiVO 4 exhibits an improved photocatalytic activity in the degradation of antibiotics in polluted water because the recombination rate of the electron–hole pair decreased and the surface area increased, which increased the active sites for redox reactions. Such a photocatalytic composite with high efficiency has various applications, such as energy production, environmental remediation, and water remediation.},

  abstract = {The cooperative emission of interacting nanocrystals is an exciting topic fueled by recent reports of superfluorescence and superradiance in assemblies of perovskite nanocubes. Several studies estimated that coherent coupling is localized to a small fraction of nanocrystals (10 −7 –10 −3 ) within the assembly, raising questions about the origins of localization and ways to overcome it. In this work, we examine single-excitation superradiance by calculating radiative decays and the distribution of superradiant wave function in two-dimensional CsPbBr 3 nanocube superlattices. The calculations reveal that the energy disorder caused by size distribution and large interparticle separations reduces radiative coupling and leads to the excitation localization, with the energy disorder being the dominant factor. The single-excitation model clearly predicts that, in the pursuit of cooperative effects, having identical nanocubes in the superlattice is more important than achieving a perfect spatial order. The monolayers of large CsPbBr 3 nanocubes (L NC = 10–20 nm) are proposed as model systems for experimental tests of superradiance under conditions of non-negligible size dispersion, while small nanocubes (L NC = 5–10 nm) are preferred for realizing the Dicke state under ideal conditions.},

However, the mechanism of such coating failure remains obscure due to the complicated interaction between atomic structure, temperature, and stress. This dynamic evolution nature demands both large system sizes and accurate description on the atomic scale, raising challenges for existing atomic scale calculation methods. Here, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) potential for Ti–N binary systems based on first-principles study datasets to achieve quantum-accurate large-scale atomic simulation. Compared with empirical interatomic potential based on the embedded-atom-method, the developed DNN-potential can accurately predict lattice constants, phonon properties, and mechanical properties under various thermodynamic conditions. Moreover, for the first time, we present the atomic evolution of the fracture behavior of large-scale rocksalt-structure (B1) TiN systems coupled with temperature and stress conditions. Our study validates that interatomic brittle fractures occur when TiN stretches beyond its tensile yield point. Such simulation of coating fracture and cutting behavior based on large-scale atoms can shed new light on understanding the microstructure and mechanical properties of coating tools under extreme operating conditions.},

Compared with ZnO materials prepared by other methods, MoS 2 /ZnO prepared in this paper exhibits superior photocatalytic performance. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the MoS 2 /ZnO composite can be attributed to the formation of heterojunctions and strong interaction between them, which greatly facilitate the separation of electrons and holes at the contact interface. In addition, due to the wide absorption region of the visible spectrum, MoS 2 can greatly broaden the light absorption range of the material after the formation of the composite material, increase the utilization rate of visible light, and reduce the combination of electrons and holes.

Micro-alloying via inclusions is often used as a means to increase the fracture toughness of amorphous solids. Modeling such inclusions as randomly pinned particles that only move affinely and do not participate in plastic relaxations, we study how the pinning influences the process of cavitation-driven fracture in an amorphous solid. Using extensive numerical simulations and probing in the athermal quasistatic limit, we show that just by pinning a very small fraction of particles, the tensile strength is increased, and also the cavitation is delayed. Furthermore, the cavitation that is expected to be spatially heterogeneous becomes spatially homogeneous by forming a large number of small cavities instead of a dominant cavity. The observed behavior is rationalized in terms of screening of plastic activity via the pinning centers, characterized by a screening length extracted from the plastic-eigenmodes.},

In DMF, the [Rh 2 (fhp) 4 ] underwent a one-electron reduction (assigned to Rh 2 4+/3+ ) at −1.31 V vs SCE in the cathodic region. Adding trifluoroacetic acid as a proton source to the electrochemical cell containing [Rh 2 (fhp) 4 ], the significant catalytic current, i.e., electrochemical H 2 evolution, was observed; the turnover frequency and overpotential of electrochemical H 2 evolution were 18 244 s −1 and 732 mV, respectively. The reaction mechanism of electrochemical H 2 evolution catalyzed by [Rh 2 (fhp) 4 ] in DMF was examined in detail by theoretically predicting the redox potentials and p K a values of the reaction intermediates using density functional theory calculations. The calculations revealed that (i) the formation of a one-electron reduced species, [Rh 2 (fhp) 4 ] − , triggered for H 2 evolution and (ii) the protonation and reduction processes of [Rh 2 (fhp) 4 ] − to further reduced hydride intermediates proceeded directly via a concerted proton–electron transfer mechanism. Moreover, [Rh 2 (fhp) 4 ] was shown to be a highly efficient H 2 evolution catalyst (HEC) for photochemical proton reduction reactions when combined with an artificial photosynthetic (AP) system containing [Ir(ppy) 2 (dtbbpy)]PF 6 and triethylamine, which served as a photosensitizer and a sacrificial electron donor, respectively.

Polar molecules have rich internal energy structure and long coherence time and thus are considered as a promising candidate for quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme for implementing discrete-time quantum walks on a circle with dipole–dipole coupled SrO molecules. The states of the walker and the coin are encoded in the pendular states of polar molecules induced by an external electric field. We design the optimal microwave pulses for implementing quantum walks on a four-node circle and a three-node circle by multi-target optimal control theory. To reduce the accumulation of decoherence and improve the fidelity, we successfully realize a step of quantum walk with only one optimal pulse. Moreover, we also encode the walker into a three-level molecular qutrit and a four-level molecular ququart and design the corresponding optimal pulses for quantum walks, which can reduce the number of molecules used. It is found that all the quantum walks on a circle in our scheme can be achieved via optimal control fields with high fidelities. Our results could shed some light on the implementation of discrete-time quantum walks and high-dimensional quantum information processing with polar molecules.},

For C 60 + , new absorption features have been found just above the discrete vibrational spectrum of the ion. The absorption profile, which is broad and contains little structure, is assigned to one or more electronic absorption transitions and is in good agreement with predictions from time-dependent density functional theory. It seems likely that the transitions observed correspond to excitation from the 2 A 1u electronic ground state to one or both of the low-lying 2 E 1u and 2 E 2u electronic states previously identified as dark states of C 60 + . These states presumably become optically bright through vibronic coupling and specifically the Jahn–Teller effect. In the case of C 120 + , the simplest positively charged oligomer of C 60 , we present the first vibrational spectrum of this ion. Through a comparison with theory, vibrational features are best explained by a peanut-shaped structure for C 120 + , maintained by covalent bonding between the two C 60 units.

  abstract = {The optical spectra of the palladium monosulfide (PdS) molecule in gas phase have been investigated for the first time through laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and single-vibronic-level (SVL) emission spectroscopies. The I 3 Σ − − X 3 Σ − transition system containing 16 vibronic bands was identified in the LIF spectra, covering the energy range of 22 030–23 400 cm −1 . The spectra with rotational resolution allowed for the determination of the molecular constants in both the ground X and excited I electronic states, involving the spin–orbit splitting, rotational constant, vibrational frequency, and isotope shift. Isotopically resolved SVL emission spectra permitted the observation of the spin–orbit splitting, vibrational frequency, and vibrational isotope shift of the X 3 Σ − 0+,1 and A 3 Π 2,1,0−,0+ states as they transitioned from the excited I state to the vibrational levels of the X and A states. Ab initio calculations presented plenty of the Λ-S and Ω states of PdS below 28 000 cm −1 and provided strong support for the assignments of the experimental observation.},

In contrast to this preceding contribution where the classification of the emerging structures was carried out “by hand,” we have used for the present contribution machine learning concepts, notably based on a principal component analysis and a k -means clustering approach: using a 30-dimensional feature vector for each emerging structure (containing relevant information, such as the composition of the configuration as well as the most relevant order parameters), we were able to reanalyze these ground state configurations in a considerably more systematic and comprehensive manner than we could possibly do in the previously published classification scheme. Indeed, we were now able to identify new structures in previously unclassified regions of the parameter space and could considerably refine the previous classification scheme, thereby identifying a rich wealth of new emerging ground state configurations. Thorough consistency checks confirm the validity of the newly defined diagram of states.},

Modern approximations can yield energy differences that are precise enough to be predictive in many instances, as validated by large- and small-scale benchmarking efforts. However, assessing the quality of densities has been the subject of far less attention, in part because reliable error measures are difficult to define. To this end, this work introduces the mean-field error, which directly assesses the quality of densities from approximations. The mean-field error is contextualized within existing frameworks of density functional error analysis and understanding and shown to be part of the density-driven error. It is demonstrated in several illustrative examples. Its potential use in future benchmarking protocols is discussed, and some conclusions are drawn.},

  abstract = {Non-fullerene electron acceptors have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional electron-acceptors in the active layers of organic photovoltaics. This is due to their tunable energy levels, optical response in the visible light spectrum, high electron mobility, and photochemical stability. In this study, the electronic properties of two representative non-fullerene acceptors, ITIC and Y5, have been calculated within the framework of density functional theory using a range of hybrid and non-hybrid density functionals. Screened range-separated hybrid (SRSH) approaches were also tested. The results are analyzed in light of the previously reported experimental outcomes. Specifically, we have calculated the oxidation and reduction potentials, fundamental and optical gaps, the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies, and exciton binding energies. Additionally, we have investigated the effects of the medium dielectric constant on these properties employing a universal implicit solvent model. It was found that hybrid functionals generally perform poorly in predicting oxidation potentials, while non-hybrid functionals tend to overestimate reduction potentials. The inclusion of a large Hartree–Fock contribution to the global or long range was identified as the source of inaccuracy for many hybrid functionals in predicting both redox potentials and the fundamental and optical gaps. Corroborating with the available literature, ∼50\% of all tested functionals predicted very small exciton binding energies, within the range of ±0.1 eV, that become even smaller by increasing the dielectric constant of the material. Finally, the OHSE2PBE and tHCTHhyb functionals and the optimal tuning SRSH approach emerged as the best-performing methods, with good accuracy in the description of the electronic properties of interest.},

Results obtained from time-dependent coupled-cluster and time-dependent current density-functional theory are presented for the closed-shell molecules H 2 , HF, and CO in magnetic fields up to 55 kT at standard temperature and pressure conditions. We find that Verdet’s linearity remains valid up to roughly 10–20 kT, above which significant deviations from linearity are observed. Among the three current density-functional approximations tested in this work, the current-dependent Tao–Perdew–Staroverov–Scuseria hybrid functional performs the best in comparison with time-dependent coupled-cluster singles and doubles results for the magnetic optical rotation.},

  abstract = {Real-time (RT) electronic structure methods provide a natural framework for describing light–matter interactions in arbitrary time-dependent electromagnetic fields (EMF). Optically induced excited state transitions are of particular interest, which require tuned EMF to drive population transfer to and from the specific state(s) of interest. Intersystem crossing, or spin-flip, may be driven through shaped EMF or laser pulses. These transitions can result in long-lived “spin-trapped” excited states, which are especially useful for materials requiring charge separation or protracted excited state lifetimes. Time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI) is unique among RT methods in that it may be implemented in a basis of eigenstates, allowing for rapid propagation of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The recent spin–orbit TDCI (TD-SOCI) enables a real-time description of spin-flip dynamics in an arbitrary EMF and, therefore, provides an ideal framework for rational pulse design. The present study explores the mechanism of multiple spin-flip pathways for a model transition metal complex, FeCO, using shaped pulses designed to drive controlled intersystem crossing and charge transfer. These results show that extremely tunable excited state dynamics can be achieved by considering the dipole transition matrix elements between the states of interest.},

  abstract = {We construct and analyze monomeric and multimeric models of the stochastic disassembly of a single nucleosome. Our monomeric model predicts the time needed for a number of histone–DNA contacts to spontaneously break, leading to dissociation of a non-fragmented histone from DNA. The dissociation process can be facilitated by DNA binding proteins or processing molecular motors that compete with histones for histone–DNA contact sites. Eigenvalue analysis of the corresponding master equation allows us to evaluate histone detachment times under both spontaneous detachment and protein-facilitated processes. We find that competitive DNA binding of remodeling proteins can significantly reduce the typical detachment time but only if these remodelers have DNA-binding affinities comparable to those of histone–DNA contact sites. In the presence of processive motors, the histone detachment rate is shown to be proportional to the product of the histone single-bond dissociation constant and the speed of motor protein procession. Our simple intact-histone model is then extended to allow for multimeric nucleosome kinetics that reveal additional pathways of disassembly. In addition to a dependence of complete disassembly times on subunit–DNA contact energies, we show how histone subunit concentrations in bulk solutions can mediate the disassembly process by rescuing partially disassembled nucleosomes. Moreover, our kinetic model predicts that remodeler binding can also bias certain pathways of nucleosome disassembly, with higher remodeler binding rates favoring intact-histone detachment.},

  abstract = {The computation of the nuclear quantum dynamics of molecules is challenging, requiring both accuracy and efficiency to be applicable to systems of interest. Recently, theories have been developed for employing time-dependent basis functions (denoted modals) with vibrational coupled cluster theory (TDMVCC). The TDMVCC method was introduced along with a pilot implementation, which illustrated good accuracy in benchmark computations. In this paper, we report an efficient implementation of TDMVCC, covering the case where the wave function and Hamiltonian contain up to two-mode couplings. After a careful regrouping of terms, the wave function can be propagated with a cubic computational scaling with respect to the number of degrees of freedom. We discuss the use of a restricted set of active one-mode basis functions for each mode, as well as two interesting limits: (i) the use of a full active basis where the variational modal determination amounts essentially to the variational determination of a time-dependent reference state for the cluster expansion; and (ii) the use of a single function as an active basis for some degrees of freedom. The latter case defines a hybrid TDMVCC/TDH (time-dependent Hartree) approach that can obtain even lower computational scaling. The resulting computational scaling for hybrid and full TDMVCC[2] is illustrated for polyaromatic hydrocarbons with up to 264 modes. Finally, computations on the internal vibrational redistribution of benzoic acid (39 modes) are used to show the faster convergence of TDMVCC/TDH hybrid computations towards TDMVCC compared to simple neglect of some degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {Transition state calculation is a critical technique to understand and predict versatile dynamical phenomena in solids. However, the transition state results obtained at 0 K are often utilized for the prediction or interpretation of dynamical processes at high temperatures, and the error bars of such an approximation are largely unknown. In this benchmark study, all the major temperature effects, including lattice expansion, lattice vibration, electron excitation, and band-edge shift, are evaluated with first-principles calculations for defect diffusion in solids. With the inclusion of these temperature effects, the notable discrepancies between theoretical predictions at 0 K and the experimental diffusivities at high temperatures are dramatically reduced. In particular, we find that lattice expansion and lattice vibration are the dominant factors lowering the defect formation energies and hopping barriers at high temperatures, but the electron excitation exhibits minor effects. In sharp contrast to typical assumptions, the attempt frequency with lattice expansion and vibration varies significantly with materials: several THz for aluminum bulk but surprisingly over 500 THz for 4H-SiC. For defects in semiconductors, the band-edge shift is also significant at high temperatures and plays a vital role in defect diffusion. We expect that this study would help accurately predict the dynamical processes at high temperatures.},

  abstract = {Simulations of anharmonic vibrational motion rely on computationally expedient representations of the governing potential energy surface. The n -mode representation ( n -MR)—effectively a many-body expansion in the space of molecular vibrations—is a general and efficient approach that is often used for this purpose in vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) calculations and correlated analogues thereof. In the present analysis, a lack of convergence in many VSCF calculations is shown to originate from negative and unbound potentials at truncated orders of the n -MR expansion. For cases of strong anharmonic coupling between modes, the n -MR can both dip below the true global minimum of the potential surface and lead to effective single-mode potentials in VSCF that do not correspond to bound vibrational problems, even for bound total potentials. The present analysis serves mainly as a pathology report of this issue. Furthermore, this insight into the origin of VSCF non-convergence provides a simple, albeit ad hoc , route to correct the problem by “painting in” the full representation of groups of modes that exhibit these negative potentials at little additional computational cost. Somewhat surprisingly, this approach also reasonably approximates the results of the next-higher n -MR order and identifies groups of modes with particularly strong coupling. The method is shown to identify and correct problematic triples of modes—and restore SCF convergence—in two-mode representations of challenging test systems, including the water dimer and trimer, as well as protonated tropine.},

For harmonic potentials, the problem is analytically soluble for both a fully quantum mechanical description and a semiclassical description. We highlight the serious deficiencies of the semiclassical treatment of coherence for general systems and illustrate how even qualitative accuracy requires higher order terms in the Moyal expansion to be included. The model provides an experimentally relevant example of a molecular Schrödinger’s cat state. The alive and dead cats of the exact two-state quantum evolution collapse into a “zombie” cat in the semiclassical limit—an averaged behavior, neither alive nor dead, leading to significant errors. The inclusion of the Moyal correction restores a faithful simultaneously alive and dead representation of the cat that is experimentally observable.},

  abstract = {In truncated coupled-cluster (CC) theories, non-variational and/or generally complex ground-state energies can occur. This is due to the non-Hermitian nature of the similarity transformed Hamiltonian matrix in combination with CC truncation. For chemical problems that deal with real-valued Hamiltonian matrices, complex CC energies rarely occur. However, for complex-valued Hamiltonian matrices, such as those that arise in the presence of strong magnetic fields, complex CC energies can be regularly observed unless certain symmetry conditions are fulfilled. Therefore, in the presence of magnetic fields, it is desirable to pursue CC methods that are guaranteed to give upper-bound, real-valued energies. In this work, we present the first application of unitary CC to chemical systems in a strong magnetic field. This is achieved utilizing the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm applied to the unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) method. We benchmark the method on the H 2 molecule in a strong magnetic field and then calculate UCCSD energies for the H 4 molecule as a function of both geometry and field angle. We show that while standard CCSD can yield generally complex energies that are not an upper-bound to the true energy, UCCSD always results in variational and real-valued energies. We also show that the imaginary components of the CCSD energy are largest in the strongly correlated region. Last, the UCCSD calculations capture a large percentage of the correlation energy.},

Using molecular dynamics simulations of Kremer–Grest polymer chains, we have investigated how the number of blocks and block degree of polymerization in a linear multiblock copolymer impacts the interface thermodynamics of strongly segregated homopolymer blends, which is key to effective compatibilization. The second virial coefficient reveals that interface thermodynamics are more sensitive to block degree of polymerization than to the number of blocks. Moreover, we identify a strong correlation between surface pressure (reduction of interfacial tension) and the spatial uniformity of block junctions on the interface, yielding a morphological framework for interpreting the role of compatibilizer architecture (number of blocks) and block degree of polymerization. These results imply that, especially at high interfacial loading, the choice of architecture of a linear multiblock copolymer compatibilizing surfactant does not greatly affect the modification of interfacial tension.},

  abstract = {Ionizable copolymers assembly in solutions is driven by the formation of ionic clusters. Fast clustering of the ionizable blocks often leads to the formation of far-from equilibrium assemblies that ultimately impact the structure of polymer membranes and affect their many applications. Using large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we probe the effects of electrostatics on the formation of ionizable copolymer micelles that dominate their solution structure, with the overarching goal of defining the factors that control the assembly of structured ionizable copolymers. A symmetric pentablock ionizable copolymer, with a randomly sulfonated polystyrene center tethered to polyethylene- r -propylene block, terminated by poly( t -butyl styrene), in solvents of varying dielectric constants from 2 to 20, serves as the model system. We find that independent of the solvents, this polymer forms a core–shell micelle with the ionizable segment segregating to the center of the assembly. The specific block conformation, however, strongly depends on the sulfonation levels and the dielectric constant and the polarity of the solvents.},

  abstract = {We propose a method to build full-atomistic (FA) amorphous polymer structures using reverse-mapping from coarse-grained (CG) models. In this method, three models with different resolutions are utilized, namely the CG1, CG2, and FA models. It is assumed that the CG1 model is more abstract than the CG2 model. The CG1 is utilized to equilibrate the system, and then sequential reverse-mapping procedures from the CG1 to the CG2 models and from the CG2 to the FA models are conducted. A mapping relation between the CG1 and the FA models is necessary to generate a polymer structure with a given density and radius of chains. Actually, we have used the Kremer–Grest (KG) model as the CG1 and the monomer-level CG model as the CG2 model. Utilizing the mapping relation, we have developed a scheme that constructs an FA polymer model from the KG model. In the scheme, the KG model, the monomer level CG model, and the FA model are successively constructed. The scheme is applied to polyethylene (PE), cis 1,4-polybutadiene (PB), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). As a validation, the structures of PE and PB constructed by the scheme were carefully checked through comparison with those obtained using long-time FA molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We found that both short- and long-range chain structures constructed by the scheme reproduced those obtained by the FA MD simulations. Then, as an interesting application, the scheme is applied to generate an entangled PMMA structure. The results showed that the scheme provides an efficient and easy way to construct amorphous structures of FA polymers.},

We model the CNCs as hard chiral bundles of microfibrils and examine the effect of the shape of these chiral bundles, characterized by aspect ratio and chirality, on the cholesteric pitch. Additionally, we explore the impact of length polydispersity and surface charge on the cholesteric phase of CNCs. Furthermore, we consider binary mixtures of twisted bundles and achiral primary crystallites to provide a more realistic representation of CNC suspensions. Our findings reveal that the degree of bundle twisting significantly affects the helical twisting of the cholesteric phase. We also observe that the average particle length and length polydispersity have substantial effects on strongly twisted bundles but minimal effects on weakly twisted ones. Finally, our study indicates that as the range of electrostatic interactions increases, the transfer of chirality from the microscopic to macroscopic length scales becomes masked, resulting in an increase in the cholesteric pitch. In the case of binary mixtures, the bundles act as chiral dopants, and an increasing fraction of bundles progressively enhances the helical twisting of the cholesteric phase.},

We first show that increasing friction between the particles results in a more disordered and less efficient packing of the local structure on the nearest neighbor scale. It is also found that standard two-point correlation functions, i.e., radial distribution function and static structure factor, show basically no detectable changes beyond short-range distances upon varying inter-particle friction. Further analysis of the structure using a four-point correlation method reveals that these systems have on the intermediate-range scale a three-dimensional structure with an icosahedral/dodecahedral symmetry that exhibits a pronounced dependence on friction: small friction gives rise to an orientational order that extends to larger distances. Our results also demonstrate that composition plays a role in that the degree of structural order and the structural correlation length are mainly affected by the friction coefficients associated with the more abundant species.},

  abstract = {Control over the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures is crucial for their practical applications in current semiconducting devices. However, the oxide surface structures inducing 2DEG are still ambiguous because oxide-stoichiometry (OS) matching structures possess occupied surface donor states at 1.0–1.8 eV below the conduction band minimum of bulk but are usually not available in energy than electron counting (EC) rule structures. In this work, a global optimization algorithm was introduced to explore the possible oxidation structures on GaN (0001) and AlN (0001) surfaces; the method was demonstrated to be available due to the fact that the reported oxidized structures were reproduced at each stoichiometry. Interestingly, the two similar oxide structures with close energy were found in each oxide-bilayer, which can be used to clarify the experimental observations of disordered surface oxide layers below 550 °C. Additionally, new stable oxidation structures with low surface energy were proposed. Interestingly, the new OS matching structures are proposed with remarkably lower energy than EC rule structures under cation-rich and oxygen-poor conditions, which is caused by the large formation enthalpy of Al 2 O 3 and Ga 2 O 3 . Further electronic structure calculations demonstrate that the new OS structures possess highest occupied states above the half of the gap and are the origin of 2DEG in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures.},

A detailed understanding of the factors governing cavity formation in bulk solutions has inter alia enabled the formulation of models that account for this contribution in coarse-grained implicit solvation methods. Here, we employ classical molecular dynamics simulations and multistate Bennett acceptance ratio free energy sampling to systematically study cavity formation at a wide range of metal–water interfaces. We demonstrate that the obtained size- and position-dependence of cavitation energies can be fully rationalized by a geometric Gibbs model, which considers that the creation of the metal–cavity interface necessarily involves the removal of interfacial solvent. This so-called competitive adsorption effect introduces a substrate dependence to the interfacial cavity formation energy that is missed in existing bulk cavitation models. Using expressions from scaled particle theory, this substrate dependence is quantitatively reproduced by the Gibbs model through simple linear relations with the adsorption energy of a single water molecule. Besides providing a better general understanding of interfacial solvation, this paves the way for the derivation and efficient parametrization of more accurate interface-aware implicit solvation models needed for reliable high-throughput calculations toward improved electrocatalysts.},

The performance of a number of dispersion-corrected density functionals—both self-consistent and a posteriori ones—are assessed, and we give special attention to the D3 correction and its effects. The D3 correction to the lattice energies is large: for H 2 O 2 (s) the D3 correction constitutes about 25\% of the lattice energy using PBE, much more for RPBE, much less for SCAN, and it primarily arises from non-H-bonded interactions out to about 5 Å.The large D3 corrections to the lattice energies are likely a consequence of several effects: correction for missing dispersion interaction, the ability of D3 to capture and correct various other kinds of limitations built into the underlying DFT functionals, and finally some degree of cell-contraction-induced polarization enhancement. We find that the overall best-performing functionals of the twelve examined are optPBEvdW and RPBE-D3. Comparisons with DFT assessments for ices in the literature show that where the same methods have been used, the assessments largely agree.},

  abstract = {Many experimental and theoretical studies on CH 4 –CO 2 hydrates have been performed aiming at the extraction of CH 4 as a relatively clean energy resource and concurrent sequestration of CO 2 . However, vague or insufficient characterization of the environmental conditions prevents us from a comprehensive understanding of even equilibrium properties of CH 4 –CO 2 hydrates for this substitution. We propose possible reaction schemes for the substitution, paying special attention to the coexisting phases, the aqueous and/or the fluid, where CO 2 is supplied from and CH 4 is transferred to. We address the two schemes for the substitution operating in three-phase and two-phase coexistence. Advantages and efficiencies of extracting CH 4 in the individual scheme are estimated from the chemical potentials of all the components in all the phases involved in the substitution on the basis of a statistical mechanical theory developed recently. It is found that although substitution is feasible in the three-phase coexistence, its working window in temperature–pressure space is much narrower compared to the two-phase coexistence condition. Despite that the substitution normally generates only a small amount of heat, a large endothermic substitution is suggested in the medium pressure range, caused by the vaporization of liquid CO 2 due to mixing with a small amount of the released CH 4 . This study provides the first theoretical framework toward the practical use of hydrates replacing CH 4 with CO 2 and serves as a basis for quantitative planning.},

However, if the droplets also contain nanoparticles or any other non-volatile solute, then the droplets can become thermodynamically stable. We show that the equilibrium droplet size depends strongly on the amount and solubility of the nanoparticles within, i.e., on the nature of the particle interactions with the liquid and, of course, also on the vapor temperature and chemical potential. We develop a simple thermodynamic model for such droplets and compare predictions with results from a lattice density functional theory that takes as input the same particle interaction properties, finding very good agreement. We also use dynamical density functional theory to study the evaporation/condensation dynamics of liquid from/to droplets as they equilibrate with the vapor, thereby demonstrating droplet stability.},

Pheophytin and chlorophyll are both observed intensely in the protonated mode, and their main fragmentation route is the loss of their phytyl chain. Pheophytin is observed intact in the negative mode, while under collisions, it is primarily cleaved beyond the phytyl chain and loses the attaching propionate group. Chlorophyll is not detected in normal conditions in the negative mode, but addition of methanol solvent molecule is detected. Fragmentation of this adduct primarily forms a product (−30 amu) that dissociates into dephytyllated deprotonated chlorophyll. Semi-empirical molecular dynamics calculations show that the phytyl chain is unfolded from the chlorin cycle in pheophytin a and folded in chlorophyll a . Density functional theory calculations have been conducted to locate the charges on protonated and deprotonated pheophytin a and chlorophyll a and have found the major location sites that are notably more stable in energy by more than 0.5 eV than the others. The deprotonation site is found identical for pheophytin a and the chlorophyll a -methanol adduct.

  abstract = {The ability to synthetically tune the ligand frameworks of redox-active molecules is of critical importance to the economy of solar fuels because manipulating their redox properties can afford control over the operating potentials of sustained electrocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic processes. The electronic and steric properties of 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine ( Terpy ) ligand frameworks can be tuned by functional group substitution on ligand backbones, and these correlate strongly to their Hammett parameters. The synthesis of a new series of tridentate meridional ligands of 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridines that engineers the ability to finely tune the redox potentials of cobalt complexes to more positive potentials than that of their Terpy analogs is achieved by aryl-functionalizing at the four-position and by including isoquinoline at the two- and six-positions of pyridine ( Aryl-DiQ ). Their cobalt complex syntheses, their electronic properties, and their catalytic activity for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction are reported and compared to their Terpy analogs. The cobalt derivatives generally experience a positive shift in their redox features relative to the Terpy -based analogs, covering a complementary potential range. Although those evaluated fail to produce any quantifiable products for the reduction of CO 2 and suffer from long-term instability, these results suggest possible alternate strategies for stabilizing these compounds during catalysis. We speculate that lower equilibrium association constants to the cobalt center are intrinsic to these ligands, which originate from a steric interaction between protons on the pyridine and isoquinoline moieties. Nevertheless, the new Aryl-DiQ ligand framework has been engineered to selectively tune homoleptic cobalt complexes’ redox potentials.},

  abstract = {Borneol is a natural monoterpene with significant applications in various industries, including medicine and perfumery. It presents several diastereomers with different physical and chemical properties, influenced by their unique structures and interactions with molecular receptors. However, a complete description of its inherent structure and solvent interactions remains elusive. Here, we report a detailed investigation of the gas-phase experimental structures of borneol and isoborneol, along with the description of their microsolvation complexes with the common solvents water and dimethyl sulfoxide. The molecules and complexes were studied using chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy coupled to a supersonic expansion source. Although three rotamers are potentially populated under the conditions of the supersonic expansion, only one of them was observed for each monomer. The examination of the monohydrated complexes revealed structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds and non-covalent C–H⋯O interactions, with water as the hydrogen bond donor. Interestingly, in the clusters with dimethyl sulfoxide, borneol and isoborneol change their roles acting as donors. We further identified a higher-energy rotamer of the borneol monomer in one of the complexes with dimethyl sulfoxide, while that rotamer was missing in the experiment for the monomer. This observation is not common and highlights a specific position in borneol especially favorable for forming stable complexes, which could have implications in the understanding of the unique physical and chemical properties of the diastereomers.},

Here, we highlight the importance of the β -methylthionation effect, the position of the sulfur atoms of the thiacycle group and their size, and the number of central benzene rings in the chemical modification strategy. Our results show that the introduction of the methylthio groups at the β -positions of the thiophene and the additional benzene ring at the center of the BDT crystal structure are a promising strategy to improve the performance of organic semiconductors, as observed experimentally. We found that β -MT-ADT exhibits large charge carrier mobility, which is in good agreement with the experimental results and comparable to that of rubrene. In addition, the electronic and optical properties of these ambipolar materials suggest promising performances with β -MT-ADT &gt; ADT &gt; β -MT-NDT &gt; NDT &gt; BEDT-BDT &gt; β -MT-BDT &gt; BDT. Moreover, functionalization with thiacycle-fused sulfur atoms of different sizes and numbers improve the properties of BDT but is still less efficient than the methylthionation effect.

In this study, we report on the conformational landscape of monosaccharide glyceraldehyde, the simplest aldose sugar, in the presence of a single water molecule in the gas phase. This investigation was performed using a combination of Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Out of the nine calculated conformers, only the lowest energy conformer was experimentally observed and characterized. Interestingly, the presence of water was found to induce structural features in the lowest energy conformer of the glyceraldehyde monomer, with water positioned between the alcohol groups. To analyze this interaction further, non-covalent interaction plots were employed to map the intermolecular interactions in the observed species. Additionally, natural bond orbital analysis was conducted to study the effects of charge transfer in the monohydrate system. Furthermore, topological analysis based on Bader’s Atoms in Molecules theory was performed to gain insights into the observed complex. The results of all three analyses consistently showed the formation of relatively strong hydrogen bonds between water and glyceraldehyde, leading to the formation of a seven-member ring network.},

For intermediate scattering angles, the calculations reveal that the most intense band (V) emerges from surprisingly similar contributions from all its underlying states (despite some preference for the dipole-allowed transitions). They further shed light on intricate multichannel couplings between the states of bands I to V and higher-lying Rydberg states. In turn, the measurements support a vibronic coupling mechanism for excitation of bands II and IV and also show an unexpected forward peak in the spin-forbidden transition accounting for band III. Overall, there is decent agreement between theory and experiment at intermediate angles and at lower energies and in terms of the relative DCSs of the five bands. Discrepancies between the present and previous experiment regarding bands IV and V draw attention to the need of additional experimental investigations.

In Paper I [L. Whaley-Mayda, A. Guha, and A. Tokmakoff, J. Chem. Phys. 159 , 194201 (2023)] we introduced a nonlinear response function theory to describe vibrational dynamics, vibronic coupling, and transition dipole orientation in FEIR experiments with ultrashort pulses. In this second paper, we apply the theory to investigate the role of intermode vibrational coherence, the orientation of vibrational and electronic transition dipoles, and the effects of finite pulse durations in experimental measurements. We focus on measurements at early encoding delays—where signal sizes are largest and therefore of most value for single-molecule experiments, but where many of these phenomena are most pronounced and can complicate the appearance of data. We compare experiments on coumarin dyes with finite-pulse response function simulations to explain the time-dependent behavior of FEIR spectra. The role of the orientational response is explored by analyzing polarization-dependent experiments and their ability to resolve relative dipole angles in the molecular frame. This work serves to demonstrate the molecular information content of FEIR experiments, and develop insight and guidelines for their interpretation.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence-encoded infrared (FEIR) spectroscopy is an emerging technique for performing vibrational spectroscopy in solution with detection sensitivity down to single molecules. FEIR experiments use ultrashort pulses to excite a fluorescent molecule’s vibrational and electronic transitions in a sequential, time-resolved manner, and are therefore sensitive to intervening vibrational dynamics on the ground state, vibronic coupling, and the relative orientation of vibrational and electronic transition dipole moments. This series of papers presents a theoretical treatment of FEIR spectroscopy that describes these phenomena and examines their manifestation in experimental data. This first paper develops a nonlinear response function description of Fourier-transform FEIR experiments for a two-level electronic system coupled to multiple vibrations, which is then applied to interpret experimental measurements in the second paper [L. Whaley-Mayda et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 159 , 194202 (2023)]. Vibrational coherence between pairs of modes produce oscillatory features that interfere with the vibrations’ population response in a manner dependent on the relative signs of their respective Franck–Condon wavefunction overlaps, leading to time-dependent distortions in FEIR spectra. The orientational response of population and coherence contributions are analyzed and the ability of polarization-dependent experiments to extract relative transition dipole angles is discussed. Overall, this work presents a framework for understanding the full spectroscopic information content of FEIR measurements to aid data interpretation and inform optimal experimental design.},

First, it is extended to meta-generalized gradient approximations and local hybrid functionals. For these functional classes, the response of the paramagnetic current density is considered in the coupled-perturbed Kohn–Sham equations for the spin–orbit perturbation term. Second, the spin–orbit perturbation is formulated within relativistic exact two-component theory and the screened nuclear spin–orbit (SNSO) approximation. The accuracy of the implementation is demonstrated for transition-metal and diatomic main-group compounds. The efficiency is assessed for Mn and Mo complexes. Here, it is found that coarse integration grids for the seminumerical schemes lead to drastic speedups while introducing clearly negligible errors. In addition, the SNSO approximation substantially reduces the computational demands and leads to very similar results as the spin–orbit mean field Ansatz .},

  abstract = {In quantum chemistry, Wick’s theorem is an important tool to reduce products of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. It is especially useful in computations employing reference states. The original theorem has been generalized to tackle multiconfigurational wave functions or nonorthogonal orbitals. One particular issue of the resulting structure is that the metric and density matrices are intertwined despite their different origin. Here, an alternative, rather general tensorial formulation of Wick’s theorem is proposed. The main difference is the separation of the metric—the coefficients at normal-ordered operators become products of an n -electron density matrix element and the Pfaffian of a matrix formed by orbital overlaps. Different properties of the formalism are discussed, including the use of density cumulants, the particle–hole symmetry, and applications to transition density matrices, i.e., the case of different bra and ket reference states. The metric-separated version of Wick’s theorem provides a platform for the derivation of various quantum chemical methods, especially those complicated by non-trivial reference states and nonorthogonality issues.},

The model is trained on a subset of the QM7 dataset but is shown to be applicable to larger molecules picked from the QM9 dataset. From the predicted Hessian, it is also possible to obtain reasonable estimates of the vibrational frequencies, normal modes, and zero point energies of the molecules.},

  abstract = {A model system of identical particles interacting via a hard-sphere potential is essential in condensed matter physics; it helps to understand in and out of equilibrium phenomena in complex fluids, such as colloidal dispersions. Yet, most of the fixed time-step algorithms to study the transport properties of those systems have drawbacks due to the mathematical nature of the interparticle potential. Because of this, mapping a hard-sphere potential onto a soft potential has been recently proposed [Báez et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 149 , 164907 (2018)]. More specifically, using the second virial coefficient criterion, one can set a route to estimate the parameters of the soft potential that accurately reproduces the thermodynamic properties of a monocomponent hard-sphere system. However, real colloidal dispersions are multicomponent or polydisperse, making it important to find an efficient way to extend the potential model for dealing with such kind of many-body systems. In this paper, we report on the extension and applicability of the second virial coefficient criterion to build a description that correctly captures the phenomenology of both multicomponent and polydisperse hard-sphere dispersions. To assess the accuracy of the continuous potentials, we compare the structure of soft polydisperse systems with their hard-core counterpart. We also contrast the structural and thermodynamic properties of soft binary mixtures with those obtained through mean-field approximations and the Ornstein–Zernike equation for the two-component hard-sphere dispersion.},

  abstract = {There is an ever increasing use of local density dependent potentials in the mesoscale modeling of complex fluids. Questions remain, though, about the dependence of the thermodynamic and structural properties of such systems on the cutoff distance used to calculate these local densities. These questions are particularly acute when it comes to the stability and structure of the vapor/liquid interface. In this article, we consider local density dependent potentials derived from an underlying van der Waals equation of state. We use simulation and density functional theory to examine how the bulk thermodynamic and interfacial properties vary with the cutoff distance, r c , used to calculate the local densities. We show quantitatively how the simulation results for bulk thermodynamic properties and vapor–liquid equilibrium approach the van der Waals limit as r c increases and demonstrate a scaling law for the radial distribution function in the large r c limit. We show that the vapor–liquid interface is stable with a well-defined surface tension and that the interfacial density profile is oscillatory, except for temperatures close to critical. Finally, we show that in the large r c limit, the interfacial tension is proportional to r c and, therefore, unlike the bulk thermodynamic properties, does not approach a constant value as r c increases. We believe that these results give new insights into the properties of local density dependent potentials, in particular their unusual interfacial behavior, which is relevant for modeling complex fluids in soft matter.},

  abstract = {The random phase approximation (RPA) as a means of treating electron correlation recently has been shown to outperform standard density functional theory (DFT) approximations in a variety of cases. However, the computational cost of the RPA is substantially more than DFT, especially when aiming to study extended surfaces. Properly accounting for sufficient surface ensemble size, Brillouin zone sampling, and vacuum separation of periodic images in standard periodic-planewave-based DFT code raises the cost to achieve converged results. Here, we show that sub-system embedding schemes enable use of the RPA for modeling heterogeneous reactions at reduced computational cost. We explore two different embedded RPA (emb-RPA) approaches, periodic emb-RPA and cluster emb-RPA. We use the (experimentally and theoretically) well-studied H 2 dissociative adsorption on Cu(111) as our exemplar, and first perform full periodic RPA calculations as a benchmark. The full RPA results match well the semi-empirical barrier fit to experimental observables and others derived from high-level computations, e.g., from recent embedded n-electron valence second order perturbation theory [Zhao et al. , J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16 (11), 7078–7088 (2020)] and quantum Monte Carlo [Doblhoff-Dier et al. , J. Chem. Theory Comput. 13 (7), 3208–3219 (2017)] simulations. Among the two emb-RPA approaches tested, the cluster emb-RPA accurately reproduces the energy profile (maximum error of 50 meV along the reaction pathway) while reducing the computational cost by approximately two orders of magnitude. We therefore expect that the embedded cluster approach will enable wider RPA implementation in heterogeneous catalysis.},

  abstract = {Practical density functional theory (DFT) owes its success to the groundbreaking work of Kohn and Sham that introduced the exact calculation of the non-interacting kinetic energy of the electrons using an auxiliary mean-field system. However, the full power of DFT will not be unleashed until the exact relationship between the electron density and the non-interacting kinetic energy is found. Various attempts have been made to approximate this functional, similar to the exchange–correlation functional, with much less success due to the larger contribution of kinetic energy and its more non-local nature. In this work, we propose a new and efficient regularization method to train density functionals based on deep neural networks, with particular interest in the kinetic-energy functional. The method is tested on (effectively) one-dimensional systems, including the hydrogen chain, non-interacting electrons, and atoms of the first two periods, with excellent results. For atomic systems, the generalizability of the regularization method is demonstrated by training also an exchange–correlation functional, and the contrasting nature of the two functionals is discussed from a machine-learning perspective.},

  abstract = {With the emergence of big data initiatives and the wealth of available chemical data, data-driven approaches are becoming a vital component of materials discovery pipelines or workflows. The screening of materials using machine-learning models, in particular, is increasingly gaining momentum to accelerate the discovery of new materials. However, the black-box treatment of machine-learning methods suffers from a lack of model interpretability, as feature relevance and interactions can be overlooked or disregarded. In addition, naive approaches to model training often lead to irrelevant features being used which necessitates the need for various regularization techniques to achieve model generalization; this incurs a high computational cost. We present a feature-selection workflow that overcomes this problem by leveraging a gradient boosting framework and statistical feature analyses to identify a subset of features, in a recursive manner, which maximizes their relevance to the target variable or classes. We subsequently obtain minimal feature redundancy through multicollinearity reduction by performing feature correlation and hierarchical cluster analyses. The features are further refined using a wrapper method, which follows a greedy search approach by evaluating all possible feature combinations against the evaluation criterion. A case study on elastic material-property prediction and a case study on the classification of materials by their metallicity are used to illustrate the use of our proposed workflow; although it is highly general, as demonstrated through our wider subsequent prediction of various material properties. Our Bayesian-optimized machine-learning models generated results, without the use of regularization techniques , which are comparable to the state-of-the-art that are reported in the scientific literature.},

We here assess the ability of the direct random phase approximation (dRPA), dRPA plus two different screened second-order exchange (SOX) corrections, and σ -functionals to predict adiabatic singlet-triplet gaps. With mean absolute deviations of below 0.1 eV to experimental reference values, independent of the Kohn–Sham starting point, dRPA and σ -functionals accurately predict singlet-triplet gaps of 18 organic chromophores. The addition of SOX corrections to dRPA considerably worsens agreement with experiment, adding to the mounting evidence that dRPA+SOX methods are not generally applicable beyond-RPA methods. Also for a series of linear acene chains with up to ten fused rings, dRPA, and σ -functionals are in excellent agreement with coupled-cluster single double triple reference data. In agreement with advanced multi-reference methods, dRPA@PBE and σ -functional@PBE predict a singlet ground state for all chain lengths, while dRPA@PBE0 and σ -functional@PBE0 predict a triplet ground state for longer acenes. Our work shows dRPA and σ -functionals to be reliable methods for calculating singlet-triplet gaps in aromatic molecules.},

  abstract = {σ -Functionals are promising new developments for the Kohn–Sham correlation energy based upon the direct Random Phase Approximation (dRPA) within the adiabatic connection formalism, providing impressive improvements over dRPA for a broad range of benchmarks. However, σ -functionals exhibit a high amount of self-interaction inherited from the approximations made within dRPA. Inclusion of an exchange kernel in deriving the coupling-strength-dependent density–density response function leads to so-called τ -functionals, which – apart from a fourth-order Taylor series expansion – have only been realized in an approximate fashion so far to the best of our knowledge, most notably in the form of scaled σ -functionals. In this work, we derive, optimize, and benchmark three types of σ - and τ -functionals including approximate exchange effects in the form of an antisymmetrized Hartree kernel. These functionals, based on a second-order screened exchange type contribution in the adiabatic connection formalism, the electron–hole time-dependent Hartree–Fock kernel (eh-TDHF) otherwise known as RPA with exchange (RPAx), and an approximation thereof known as approximate exchange kernel (AXK), are optimized on the ASCDB database using two new parametrizations named A1 and A2. In addition, we report a first full evaluation of σ - and τ -functionals on the GMTKN55 database, revealing our exchange-including functionals to considerably outperform existing σ -functionals while being highly competitive with some of the best double-hybrid functionals of the original GMTKN55 publication. In particular, the σ -functionals based on AXK and τ -functionals based on RPAx with PBE0 reference stand out as highly accurate approaches for a wide variety of chemically relevant problems.},

  abstract = {Since it was first predicted 100 years ago, Raman scattering has been a cornerstone of molecular spectroscopy with a widespread impact on science and technology. Nearly all theoretical frameworks have employed Raman cross sections (σ Raman ) to characterize and quantify molecular Raman response. The recently introduced absolute stimulated Raman scattering cross section (σ SRS ), on the other hand, provides an alternative way of interpreting molecular responses under two coherent laser sources. However, the theoretical connection between σ Raman and σ SRS remains unclear. Herein, we are inspired by Einstein’s A and B coefficients for spontaneous and stimulated emissions and derived an analogous equation [Eq. (16) ] for Raman scattering from an approach along quantum electrodynamics. Equation (16) decomposes Raman cross sections into a contribution from the vacuum electromagnetic field and an underlying molecular response captured by stimulated Raman cross sections (in the unit of Göppert–Mayer). This theoretical relation is supported by recent experimental measurements on methanol as a model compound. Foremost, it provides a connection between experimentally defined σ Raman and σ SRS under certain approximations. In addition, it quantitatively shows that it is the weak vacuum field of the Stokes channel that makes Raman cross sections appear so small, corroborating the conventional Raman theory. Moreover, it suggests stimulated Raman cross sections to be a vacuum-decoupled intrinsic quantity for characterizing molecular response during Raman scattering. Remarkably, stimulated Raman cross sections turn out to be not weak when compared to two-photon absorption, narrowing the conventional gap of cross sections between spontaneous Raman and UV–vis absorption by more than 10 10 folds.},

We use an experimentally validated full-dimensional neural network potential energy surface of a hydrogen atom interacting with a large cell of graphene containing 24 carbon atoms. For quantum dynamics simulations, we apply Monte Carlo canonical polyadic decomposition to transform the original potential energy surface (PES) into a sum of products form and use the multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method to simulate the quantum scattering of a hydrogen or deuterium atom with an initial kinetic energy of 1.96 or 0.96 eV and an incident angle of 0°, i.e., perpendicular to the graphene surface. The cMD and QD initial conditions have been carefully chosen in order to be as close as possible. Our results show little differences between cMD and QD simulations when the incident energy of the H atom is equal to 1.96 eV. However, a large difference in sticking probability is observed when the incident energy of the H atom is equal to 0.96 eV, indicating the predominance of quantum effects. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first benchmark of quantum against classical simulations for a system of this size with a realistic PES. Additionally, new projectors are implemented in the Heidelberg multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree package for the calculation of the atom scattering energy transfer distribution as a function of outgoing angles.},

Here, we eliminate the memory bottleneck of the second-order perturbation theory correction using the same (semi)stochastic approach developed previously for electronic structure theory. This allows us to treat, in an unbiased manner, much larger perturbative spaces, which are necessary for high accuracy in large systems. Stochastic errors are easily controlled to be less than 1 cm −1 . We also report two other developments: (i) we propose a new heat-bath criterion and an associated exact implicit sorting algorithm for potential energy surfaces expressible as a sum of products of one-dimensional potentials; (ii) we formulate VHCI to use a vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) reference, as opposed to the harmonic oscillator reference configuration used in previous reports. Our tests are done with quartic and sextic force fields, for which we find that with VSCF, the minor improvements to accuracy are outweighed by the higher computational cost associated the matrix element evaluations. We expect VSCF-based VHCI to be important for more general potential representations, for which the harmonic oscillator basis function integrals are no longer analytic.},

Underpinning the formal evidence are mild assumptions: the correlation energy is strictly a functional of the occupation numbers, and the occupation numbers derive from an invertible distribution. Computational support centers around employing different mean field methods and occupation number distributions (Fermi–Dirac, Gaussian, and linear), for which our claims are verified for a series of pilot calculations involving bond breaking and chemical reactions.

  abstract = {Gastropods forage with their radula, a thin chitinous membrane with embedded teeth, which scratch across the substrate to lose food particles. During this interaction, the risk of loosening particles is obvious without having a specialized mechanism holding them on the tooth surface. As mucus secretions are essential in molluscan life cycles and the locomotion and attachment gels are known to have an instant high adhesion, we have hypothesized that the saliva could support particle retention during feeding. As adhesion of snail saliva was not studied before, we present here an experimental setup to test its particle-binding capacity using a large land snail ( Lissachatina fulica , Stylommatophora, Heterobranchia). This experiment was also applied to the gels produced by the snail foot for comparison and can be potentially applied to various fluids present at a small volume in the future. We found, that the saliva has high particle retention capacity that is comparable to the foot glue of the snail. To gain some insight into the properties of the saliva, we additionally studied it in the scanning electron microscope, estimated its viscosity in a de-wetting experiment, and investigated its elemental composition using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveling higher contents of Ca, Zn and other potential cross-linkers similar to those found in the glue.},

Our model consists of a single polymer species whose charge state arises from protonation-deprotonation processes in the presence of a dissolved acid, whose anions serve as screening counterions. We explicitly account for variability in the polymers’ charge states. Homogeneous equilibria in this model system are characterised by the total concentration of polymers, the concentration of counter-ions and the charge distributions of polymers which can be computed with the help of analytical approximations. We use these analytical results to characterise how parameter values and solution acidity influence equilibrium charge distributions and identify for which regimes uni-modal and multi-modal charge distributions arise. We then study the interplay between charge regulation, solution acidity and phase separation. We find that charge regulation has a significant impact on polymer solubility and allows for non-linear responses to the solution acidity: Re-entrant phase behaviour is possible in response to increasing solution acidity. Moreover, we show that phase separation can yield to the coexistence of local environments characterised by different charge distributions.},

  abstract = {In recent years, ionic microgels have garnered much attention due to their unique properties, especially their stimulus-sensitive swelling behavior. The tunable response of these soft, permeable, compressible, charged colloidal particles is increasingly attractive for applications in medicine and biotechnologies, such as controlled drug delivery, tissue engineering, and biosensing. The ability to model and predict variation of the osmotic pressure of a single microgel with respect to changes in particle properties and environmental conditions proves vital to such applications. In this work, we apply both nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann theory and molecular dynamics simulation to ionic microgels (macroions) in the cell model to compute density profiles of microions (counterions, coions), single-microgel osmotic pressure, and equilibrium swelling ratios of spherical microgels whose fixed charge is confined to the macroion surface. The basis of our approach is an exact theorem that relates the electrostatic component of the osmotic pressure to the microion density profiles. Close agreement between theory and simulation serves as a consistency check to validate our approach. We predict that surface-charged microgels progressively deswell with increasing microgel concentration, starting well below close packing, and with increasing salt concentration, in qualitative agreement with experiments. Comparison with previous results for microgels with fixed charge uniformly distributed over their volume demonstrates that surface-charged microgels deswell more rapidly than volume-charged microgels. We conclude that swelling behavior of ionic microgels in solution is sensitive to the distribution of fixed charge within the polymer-network gel and strongly depends on bulk concentrations of both microgels and salt ions.},

  abstract = {Metal halide perovskite nanocrystals have been under intense investigation for their promise in optoelectronic devices due to their remarkable physics, such as liquid/solid duality. This liquid/solid duality may give rise to their defect tolerance and other such useful properties. This duality means that the electronic states are fluctuating in time, on a distribution of timescales from femtoseconds to picoseconds. Hence, these lattice induced energy fluctuations that are connected to polaron formation are also connected to exciton formation and dynamics. We observe these correlations and dynamics in metal halide perovskite nanocrystals of CsPbI 3 and CsPbBr 3 using two-dimensional electronic (2DE) spectroscopy, with its unique ability to resolve dynamics in heterogeneously broadened systems. The 2DE spectra immediately reveal a previously unobserved excitonic splitting in these 15 nm NCs that may have a coarse excitonic structure. 2D lineshape dynamics reveal a glassy response on the 300 fs timescale due to polaron formation. The lighter Br system shows larger amplitude and faster timescale fluctuations that give rise to dynamic line broadening. The 2DE signals enable 1D transient absorption analysis of exciton cooling dynamics. Exciton cooling within this doublet is shown to take place on a slower timescale than within the excitonic continuum. The energy dissipation rates are the same for the I and Br systems for incoherent exciton cooling but are very different for the coherent dynamics that give rise to line broadening. Exciton cooling is shown to take place on the same timescale as polaron formation, revealing both as coupled many-body excitation.},

  abstract = {Effect mechanisms of the undercooling degree and the surface configuration on the ice growth characteristics were revealed under micro-droplets icing conditions. Preferential ice crystals appear firstly on the surfaces due to the randomness of icing, and obtain growth advantages to form protruding structures. Protruding structures block the incoming droplets from contacting the substrates, causing voids around the structures. The undercooling degree mainly affects the density and the growth rate of preferential ice crystals. With the increase of undercooling degree, the preferential ice crystals have higher density and growth rate, resulting in stronger growth advantage and higher porosity. The surface configuration affects the growth mode, and the ice layer grows with uniform mode, spreading mode and structure-induced mode on the aluminum, smooth Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and rough PTFE surface respectively, causing the needle-like, ridge-like and cluster-like ice crystals. The rough structures effectively improve the porosity of the ice layer, which is beneficial for optimizing the icephobic property of the materials. This paper provides important theoretical guidance for the design of subsequent icephobic materials.},

  abstract = {Hydrophobicity has proven fundamental in an inexhaustible amount of everyday applications. Material hydrophobicity is determined by chemical composition and geometrical characteristics of its macroscopic surface. Surface roughness or texturing enhances intrinsic hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristics of a material. Here we consider crystalline surfaces presenting molecular-scale texturing typical of crystalline porous materials, e.g., metal-organic frameworks. In particular, we investigate one such material with remarkable hydrophobic qualities, ZIF-8. We show that ZIF-8 hydrophobicity is driven not only by its chemical composition but also its sub-nanoscale surface corrugations, a physical enhancement rare amongst hydrophobes. Studying ZIF-8’s hydrophobic properties is challenging as experimentally it is difficult to distinguish between the materials’ and the macroscopic corrugations’ contributions to the hydrophobicity. The computational contact angle determination is also difficult as the standard “geometric” technique of liquid nanodroplet deposition is prone to many artifacts. Here, we characterise ZIF-8 hydrophobicity via: (i) the “geometric” approach and (ii) the “energetic” method, utilising the Young–Dupré formula and computationally determining the liquid–solid adhesion energy. Both approaches reveal nanoscale Wenzel-like bathing of the corrugated surface. Moreover, we illustrate the importance of surface linker termination in ZIF-8 hydrophobicity, which reduces when varied from sp 3 N to sp 2 N termination. We also consider halogenated analogues of the methyl-imidazole linker, which promote the transition from nanoWenzel-like to nanoCassie–Baxter-like states, further enhancing surface hydrophobicity. Present results reveal the complex interface physics and chemistry between water and complex porous, molecular crystalline surfaces, providing a hint to tune their hydrophobicity.},

While the low surface energy is desirable for reducing adhesion, very little work considers the larger contribution to adhesive failure caused by the viscoelastic nature of elastomers. Here we examine several different siloxane elastomers using a JKR adhesion test, which was operated over a range of different speeds and temperatures. Additionally, we characterize the dynamic mechanical modulus over a large range of frequencies for each material. We note that surface energies of the materials are all similar, but variation in adhesion strength is clear in the data. The variation at low speeds is related to elastomer architecture but the speed dependence itself is independent of architecture. Qualitative correlations are noted between the JKR adhesion measurements and the dynamic moduli. Finally, an attempt is made to directly compare moduli and adhesion through the recent Persson–Brener model. Approximations of the model are shown to be inaccurate. The full model is found to be accurate at low speeds, although it fails to precisely capture higher speed behaviour.},

  abstract = {The electric double layer (EDL) has a pivotal role in screening charges on surfaces as in supercapacitor electrodes or colloidal and polymer solutions. Its structure is determined by correlations between the finite-sized ionic charge carriers of the underlying electrolyte, and, this way, these correlations affect the properties of the EDL and of applications utilizing EDLs. We study the structure of EDLs within classical density functional theory (DFT) in order to uncover whether a structural transition in the first layer of the EDL that is driven by changes in the surface potential depends on specific particle interactions or has a general footing. This transition has been found in full-atom simulations. Thus far, investigating the in-plane structure of the EDL for the primitive model (PM) using DFT has proved a challenge. We show here that the use of an appropriate functional predicts the in-plane structure of EDLs in excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulations. This provides the playground to investigate how the structure factor within a layer parallel to a charged surface changes as a function of both the applied surface potential and its separation from the surface. We discuss pitfalls in properly defining an in-plane structure factor and fully map out the structure of the EDL within the PM for a wide range of electrostatic electrode potentials. However, we do not find any signature of a structural crossover and conclude that the previously reported effect is not fundamental but rather occurs due to the specific force field of ions used in the simulations.},

  abstract = {The presence of gradient softer outer layers, commonly observed in biological systems (such as cartilage and ocular tissues), as well as synthetic crosslinked hydrogels, profoundly influences their interactions with opposing surfaces. Our prior research demonstrated that gradient-stiffness hydrogel layers, characterized by increasing elasticity with depth, control contact mechanics, particularly in proximity to the layer thickness. We postulate that the distribution of polymers within these gradient layers imparts extraordinary stretch and adhesion characteristics due to network adaptability and stress-induced reorganization. To investigate this phenomenon, we utilized Atomic Force Microscopy nanoindentation to assess the depth-dependent adhesion behavior of polyacrylamide hydrogels with varying gradient layer thicknesses. Two gradient layer thicknesses were achieved by employing different molding materials: glass and polyoxymethylene (POM). Glass-molded hydrogels exhibited a thinner gradient layer alongside a stiffer bulk layer compared to their POM-molded counterparts. In indentation experiments, the POM-molded hydrogel had larger adhesion compared to glass-molded hydrogel. We find that indenting within the gradient layer engenders increased load-unload hysteresis due to heightened fluid transport in the sparse outer polymer network. Consequently, this led to augmented adhesion and work of separation at shallow depths. We suggest that the prominent stretching capability of the sparse outer polymer network during probe retraction contributes to enhanced adhesion. The Maugis–Dugdale adhesive model only fits well to indentations on the thin layer or indentations which engage significantly with the bulk. These results facilitate a comprehensive characterization of adhesion mechanics in gradient-stiffness hydrogels, which could foster their application across emerging contexts in health science and environmental domains.},

  abstract = {The lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials with intriguing photo-physical properties and have immense potential for photovoltaic applications. A comprehensive study on the kinetics of charge carrier (electron/hole) generation and transfer across the interface is key to realizing their future scope for efficient device engineering. Herein, we investigate the interfacial charge transfer (CT) dynamics in cesium lead halide (CsPbBr 3 ) perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) with energetically favorable electron acceptors, anthraquinone (AQ) and p -benzoquinone (BQ), and hole acceptors such as pyrene and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP). With various steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic and microscopic measurements, a faster electron transfer rate is estimated for CsPbBr 3 PQDs with BQ compared to that of AQ, while a superior hole transfer for DMAP is divulged compared to pyrene. In concurrence with the spectroscopic measurements, conducting atomic force microscopic studies across the electrode-PQD-electrode junction reveals an increment in the conductance of the PQD in the presence of both the electron and hole acceptors. The variation of the density of states calculation in the presence of the hole acceptors offers strong support and validation for faster CT efficiency. The above findings suggest that a careful selection of simple yet efficient molecular arrangements can facilitate rapid carrier transfer, which can be designed as auxiliary layers for smooth CT and help in the engineering of cost-effective photovoltaic devices.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the single-bonded nitrogen chains stabilized by tetravalent cerium, pentavalent tantalum, and hexavalent tungsten atoms, we explored the possibility of single-bonded nitrogen polymorphs stabilized by trivalent lanthanum ions. To achieve this, we utilized the crystal structure search method on the phase diagram of binary La–N compounds. We identified three novel thermodynamically stable phases, the C 2/ c LaN 3 , P -1 LaN 4 , and P -1 LaN 8 . Among them, the C 2/ c phase with infinite helical poly -N 6 chains becomes thermodynamically stable above 50 GPa. Each nitrogen atom in the poly -N 6 chain acquires one extra electron, and the spiral chain is purely single-bonded. The C 2/ c phase has an indirect band gap of ∼1.6 eV at 60 GPa. Notably, the band gap exhibits non-monotonic behavior, decreases first and then increases with increasing pressure. This abnormal behavior is attributed to the significant bonding of two La–N bonds at around 35 GPa. Phonon spectrum calculations and AIMD simulations have confirmed that the C 2/ c phase can be quenched to ambient conditions with slight distortion, and it exhibits excellent detonation properties. Additionally, we also discovered armchair-like nitrogen chains in LaN 4 and the armchair and zigzag-like mixed nitrogen chains in LaN 8 . These results provide valuable insights into the electronic and bonding properties of nitrides under high pressure and may have important implications for the design and development of novel functional materials.},

  abstract = {Synaptic behavior simulation in transistors based on MoS 2 has been reported. MoS 2 was utilized as the active layer to prepare ambipolar thin-film transistors. The excitatory postsynaptic current phenomenon was simulated, observing a gradual voltage decay following the removal of applied pulses, ultimately resulting in a response current slightly higher than the initial current. Subsequently, ±5 V voltages were separately applied for ten consecutive pulse voltage tests, revealing short-term potentiation and short-term depression behaviors. After 92 consecutive positive pulses, the device current transitioned from an initial value of 0.14 to 28.3 mA. Similarly, following 88 consecutive negative pulses, the device current changed, indicating long-term potentiation and long-term depression behaviors. We also employed a pair of continuous triangular wave pulses to evaluate paired-pulse facilitation behavior, observing that the response current of the second stimulus pulse was ∼1.2× greater than that of the first stimulus pulse. The advantages and prospects of using MoS 2 as a material for thin-film transistors were thoroughly displayed.},

However, achieving oriented C–H activation remains challenging due to the poor selectivity of aromatic C–H bonds. Herein, we successfully constructed alternately arranged Au–C4 and Au–O4 organometallic coordination networks through selective aromatic C–H bond activation on Au(111) substrate. The stepwise reaction process of the 5, 12-dibromopyrene 3,4,9, 10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride precursor is monitored by high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy. Our results show that the gold atoms in C–Au–C organometallic chains play a crucial role in promoting the selective ortho C–H bonds activation and forming Au–C4 coordination structure, which is further demonstrated by a comparative experiment of PTCDA precursor on Au(111). Furthermore, our experiment of 2Br-PTCDA precursor on Cu(111) substrate confirms that copper atoms in C–Cu–C organometallic chains can also assist the formation of Cu–C4 coordination structure. Our results reveal the vital effect of organometallic coordination on selective C–H bond activation of reactants, which holds promising implications for controllable on-surface synthesis.},

In our previous work [R. L. Davidchack and B. B. Laird, J. Chem.

In the current work, we investigate the behavior of this quantity at small σ . In particular, using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we relate the insertion probability to the hard-sphere fluid distribution functions and thus derive the higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of μ ex ( σ , η ) at σ = 0. We also use direct evaluation of the excluded volume for pairs and triplets of hard spheres to obtain simulation results for μ ex ( σ , η ) at σ / σ 0 ≤ 0.2247 that are of much higher precision than those obtained earlier with Widom’s method. These results allow us to improve the quality of the small- σ correction in the empirical expression for μ ex ( σ , η ) presented in our previous work.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been widely used in exploring the nucleation behavior of many systems, including gas hydrates. Gas hydrates are ice-like solids in which gas molecules are trapped in water cages. During hydrate formation, a considerable amount of heat is released, and previous work has reported that the choice of temperature control scheme may affect the behavior of hydrate formation. The origins of this effect have remained an open question. To address this question, extensive NVE simulations and thermostatted (NPT and NVT) simulations with different temperature coupling strengths have been performed and compared for systems where a water nanodroplet is immersed in a H 2 S liquid. Detailed analysis of the hydrate structures and their mechanisms of formation has been carried out. Slower nucleation rates in NVE simulations in comparison to NPT simulations have been observed in agreement with previous studies. Probability distributions for various temperature measures along with their spatial distributions have been examined. Interestingly, a comparison of these temperature distributions reveals a small yet noticeable difference in the widths of the distributions for water. The somewhat reduced fluctuations in the temperature for the water species in the NVE simulations appear to be responsible for reducing the hydrate nucleation rate. We further conjecture that the NVE-impeded nucleation rate may be the result of the finite size of the surroundings (here the liquid H 2 S portion of the system). Additionally, a local spatial temperature gradient arising from the heat released during hydrate formation could not be detected.},

  abstract = {Metal hexafluorides hydrolyze at ambient temperature to deposit compounds having fluorine-to-oxygen ratios that depend upon the identity of the metal. Uranium-hexafluoride hydrolysis, for example, deposits uranyl fluoride (UO 2 F 2 ), whereas molybdenum hexafluoride (MoF 6 ) and tungsten hexafluoride deposit trioxides. Here, we pursue general strategies enabling the prediction of depositing compounds resulting from multi-step gas-phase reactions. To compare among the three metal-hexafluoride hydrolyses, we first investigate the mechanism of MoF 6 hydrolysis using hybrid density functional theory (DFT). Intermediates are then validated by performing anharmonic vibrational simulations and comparing with infrared spectra [McNamara et al. , Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 25 , 2990 (2023)]. Conceptual DFT, which is leveraged here to quantitatively evaluate site-specific electrophilicity and nucleophilicity metrics, is found to reliably predict qualitative deposition propensities for each intermediate. In addition to the nucleophilic potential of the oxygen ligands, several other contributing characteristics are discussed, including amphoterism, polyvalency, fluxionality, steric hindrance, dipolar strength, and solubility. To investigate the structure and composition of pre-nucleation clusters, an automated workflow is presented for the simulation of particle growth. The workflow entails a conformer search at the density functional tight-binding level, structural refinement at the hybrid DFT level, and computation of a composite free-energy profile. Such profiles can be used to estimate particle nucleation kinetics. Droplet formation is also considered, which helps to rationalize the different UO 2 F 2 particle morphologies observed under varying levels of humidity. Development of predictive methods for simulating physical and chemical deposition processes is important for the advancement of material manufacturing involving coatings and thin films.},

The S 1 state lifetime (mainly due to the H atom tunneling reaction) is found to be mode-dependent whereas it quickly converges and remains constant as the rapid intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) starts to participate in the S 1 state relaxation with the increase of the S 1 internal energy ( E int ). The IVR rate and its change with increasing E int have been reflected in the parent ion transients taken by tuning the total energy ( h ν pump + h ν probe ) just above the adiabatic ionization threshold (so that the dissipation of the initial mode-character could be monitored as a function of the reaction time), indicating that the mode randomization rate into the S 1 isoenergetic manifolds exceeds the tunneling rate quite early in terms of E int for m -cresol (≤∼1200 cm −1 ) or p -cresol (≤∼800 cm −1 ) compared to the case of phenol (≤∼1800 cm −1 ). Though the H atom tunneling dynamics of phenol (S 1 ) seems to be little influenced by the methyl substitution on the either m - or p -position, the IVR rate has been found to be strongly accelerated due to the sharply-increasing (S 1 ) density of states with increasing E i nt due to the pivotal role of the low-frequency CH 3 torsional mode.},

  abstract = {The three body fragmentation of methane dication has been studied using the technique of cold target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy. The process is initiated by impact of energetic Ar 9+ ions on neutral methane and the data is subsequently collected in coincidence with Ar 8+ projectile. By analysing the dissociation channels leading to (H + H + + CH 2 + ⁠ ) and (H + H 2 + + CH + ) fragments, it is concluded that these fragments are formed in a sequential manner via formation of molecular intermediates CH 3 + and CH 2 + respectively. It is shown that these molecular intermediates carry a few eVs as their internal energies, part of which is released when they emit an H-atom with the open possibility that the final detected fragments may still be internally excited. This was accomplished by analysing the two-steps of the sequential process in their own native frames. For a molecular system having three-dimensional structure, our results prove to be an ideal example to highlight the importance of using native frames for correct interpretation of the obtained results. Our results indicate that the dissociation of methane dication can be a major source of production of H-atoms in addition to H + fragments with the probability of the two being of similar order.},

Furthermore, the dissociation energies show a trend for the n = 21 magic and n = 22 anti-magic numbers relative to their neighbours, which is also in agreement with theory. These results provide further evidence to resolve the disagreement between previously published experimental values.

In the past, very promising results have been reported by combining semi-local DFAs with exact, i.e. Hartree–Fock, exchange. However, the spin-state energy ordering and the predictions of global minima structures are particularly sensitive to the choice of the hybrid functional and to the amount of exact exchange. This has been already qualitatively described for single conformations, reactions, and a limited number of conformations. Here, we have analyzed the mixing of exact exchange in exchange functionals for a set of several hundred isomers of the transition metal carbide, Mo 4 C 2 . The analysis of the calculated energies and charges using PBE0-type functional with varying amounts of exact exchange yields the following insights: (1) The sensitivity of spin-energy splitting is strongly correlated with the amount of exact exchange mixing. (2) Spin contamination is exacerbated when correlation is omitted from the exchange-correlation functional. (3) There is not one ideal value for the exact exchange mixing which can be used to parametrize or choose among the functionals. Calculated energies and electronic structures are influenced by exact exchange at a different magnitude within a given distribution; therefore, to extend the application range of hybrid functionals to the full periodic table the spin-energy splitting energies should be investigated.},

  abstract = {Absolute line strengths of several transitions in the ν 1 fundamental band of the hydroxyl radical (OH) have been measured by simultaneous determination of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and OH upon laser photolysis of H 2 O 2 . Based on the well-known quantum yield for the generation of OH radicals in the 248-nm photolysis of H 2 O 2 , the line strength of the OH radicals can be accurately derived by adopting the line strength of the well-characterized transitions of H 2 O 2 and analyzing the difference absorbance time traces of H 2 O 2 and OH obtained upon laser photolysis. Employing a synchronized two-color dual-comb spectrometer, we measured high-resolution time-resolved absorption spectra of H 2 O 2 near 7.9 µ m and the OH radical near 2.9 µ m, simultaneously, under varied conditions. In addition to the studies of the line strengths of the selected H 2 O 2 and OH transitions, the kinetics of the reaction between OH and H 2 O 2 were investigated. A pressure-independent rate coefficient k OH+H 2 O 2 was determined to be [1.97 (+0.10/−0.15)] × 10 −12 cm 3 molecule −1 s −1 at 296 K and compared with other experimental results. By carefully analyzing both high-resolution spectra and temporal absorbance profiles of H 2 O 2 and OH, the uncertainty of the obtained OH line strengths can be achieved down to &lt;10\% in this work. Moreover, the proposed two-color time-resolved dual-comb spectroscopy provides a new approach for directly determining the line strengths of transient free radicals and holds promise for investigations on their self-reaction kinetics as well as radical–radical reactions.},

  abstract = {Double Resonance is a powerful spectroscopic method that unambiguously assigns the rigorous quantum numbers of one state of a transition. However, there is often ambiguity as to the branch (Δ J ) of that transition. Spectroscopists have resolved this ambiguity by using the dependence of the double resonance intensity on the relative polarization directions of pump and probe radiation. However, published theoretical predictions for this ratio are based upon a weak (i.e., non-saturating) field approximation. This paper presents theoretical predictions for these intensity ratios for cases where the pump field is strongly saturating in the two limits of transitions dominated by homogeneous or of inhomogeneous broadening. Saturation reduces but does not eliminate the magnitude of the polarization effect (driving the intensity ratio closer to unity) even with strong pump saturation. For the case of an inhomogeneously broadened line, such as when Doppler broadened linewidth dominates over the power-broadened homogeneous line width, a large fraction of the low pump power polarization anisotropy remains. This paper reports predicted polarization ratios for both linear and circular pump and probe field polarizations. The present predictions are compared with experimental measurements on CH 4 ground state → ν 3 → 3 ν 3 transitions recently reported by de Oliveira et al. 63 and these are in better agreement than with the weak field predictions.},

  abstract = {Nuclear spin hyperpolarization derived from parahydrogen is a technique for enhancing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) sensitivity. The key to hyperpolarization experiments is to achieve rapid transfer and detection to minimize relaxation losses, while also avoiding bubbles or turbulence to guarantee high spectral resolution. In this article, we describe an experimental approach for the interleaved joint modulation of parahydrogen-induced polarization and NMR. We provide schematic diagrams of parahydrogen-based polarizer with in situ high-pressure detection capability and low-field polarization transfer. This approach can help to control the experimental process and acquire experimental information, one example of which is the attainment of the highest hyperpolarization signal intensity at 3.6 s after closing the valve. The polarizer demonstrates in situ detection capability, allowing sample to be restabilized within 0.3 ± 0.1 s and high-resolution NMR sampling under a pressure of 3 bars. Moreover, it can transfer polarized samples from the polarization transfer field to the detection region of NMR within 1 ± 0.3 s for completing signal amplification by reversible exchange experiments.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of delocalized excitons in light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) can be investigated using different experimental techniques, and transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy is one of the most valuable methods for this purpose. A careful interpretation of TA spectra is essential for the clarification of excitation energy transfer (EET) processes occurring during light-harvesting. However, even in the simplest LHCs, a physical model is needed to interpret transient spectra as the number of EET processes occurring at the same time is very large to be disentangled from measurements alone. Physical EET models are commonly built by fittings of the microscopic exciton Hamiltonians and exciton-vibrational parameters, an approach that can lead to biases. Here, we present a first-principles strategy to simulate EET and transient absorption spectra in LHCs, combining molecular dynamics and accurate multiscale quantum chemical calculations to obtain an independent estimate of the excitonic structure of the complex. The microscopic parameters thus obtained are then used in EET simulations to obtain the population dynamics and the related spectroscopic signature. We apply this approach to the CP29 minor antenna complex of plants for which we follow the EET dynamics and transient spectra after excitation in the chlorophyll b region. Our calculations reproduce all the main features observed in the transient absorption spectra and provide independent insight on the excited-state dynamics of CP29. The approach presented here lays the groundwork for the accurate simulation of EET and unbiased interpretation of transient spectra in multichromophoric systems.},

  abstract = {Paramagnetic molecules with a metal ion as an electron spin center are promising building blocks for molecular qubits and high-density memory arrays. However, fast spin relaxation and decoherence in these molecules lead to a rapid loss of magnetization and quantum information. Nonadiabatic coupling (NAC), closely related to spin-vibrational coupling, is the main source of spin relaxation and decoherence in paramagnetic molecules at higher temperatures. Predicting these couplings using numerical differentiation requires a large number of computationally intensive ab initio or crystal field electronic structure calculations. To reduce computational cost and improve accuracy, we derive and implement analytical NAC and state-specific energy gradient for the ab initio parametrized crystal field Hamiltonian describing single-ion molecular magnets. Our implementation requires only a single crystal field calculation. In addition, the accurate NACs and state-specific energy gradients can be used to model spin relaxation using sophisticated nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, which avoids the harmonic approximation for molecular vibrations. To test our implementation, we calculate the NAC values for three lanthanide complexes. The predicted values support the relaxation mechanisms reported in previous studies.},

This paper introduces a molecular-dynamics workflow that simplifies and robustly computes the solubility of molecular or ionic crystals. This method is considerably more straightforward than the state-of-the-art, as we have streamlined and optimised each step of the process. Specifically, we calculate the chemical potential of the crystal using the gas-phase molecule as a reference state, and employ the S 0 method to determine the concentration dependence of the chemical potential of the solute. We use this workflow to predict the solubilities of sodium chloride in water, urea polymorphs in water, and paracetamol polymorphs in both water and ethanol. Our findings indicate that the predicted solubility is sensitive to the chosen potential energy surface. Furthermore, we note that the harmonic approximation often fails for both molecular crystals and gas molecules at or above room temperature, and that the assumption of an ideal solution becomes less valid for highly soluble substances.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) interactions determined via bottom-up methodologies can faithfully reproduce the structural correlations observed in fine-grained (atomistic resolution) systems, yet they can suffer from limited extensibility due to complex many-body correlations. As part of an ongoing effort to understand and improve the applicability of bottom-up CG models, we propose an alternative approach to address both accuracy and transferability. Our main idea draws from classical perturbation theory to partition the hard sphere repulsive term from effective CG interactions. We then introduce Gaussian basis functions corresponding to the system’s characteristic length by linking these Gaussian sub-interactions to the local particle densities at each coordination shell. The remaining perturbative long-range interaction can be treated as a collective solvation interaction, which we show exhibits a Gaussian form derived from integral equation theories. By applying this numerical parametrization protocol to CG liquid systems, our microscopic theory elucidates the emergence of Gaussian interactions in common phenomenological CG models. To facilitate transferability for these reduced descriptions, we further infer equations of state to determine the sub-interaction parameter as a function of the system variables. The reduced models exhibit excellent transferability across the thermodynamic state points. Furthermore, we propose a new strategy to design the cross-interactions between distinct CG sites in liquid mixtures. This involves combining each Gaussian in the proper radial domain, yielding accurate CG potentials of mean force and structural correlations for multi-component systems. Overall, our findings establish a solid foundation for constructing transferable bottom-up CG models of liquids with enhanced extensibility.},

In this work, we extend our previous theoretical work by directly employing Pauli energy, Pauli potential, Pauli force, and Pauli charge to simultaneously identify both strong covalent bonding and weak noncovalent interactions. Our results from this work elucidate that using their signature isosurfaces, we can identify different types of interactions, either strong or weak, including single, double, triple, and quadruple covalent bonds, ionic bond, metallic bond, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals interaction. We also discovered strong linear correlations between Pauli energy derived quantities and different covalent bond orders. These qualitative and quantitative results from our present study solidify the viewpoint that a unified approach to simultaneously identify both strong and weak interactions is possible. In our view, this work signifies one step forward towards the goal of establishing a density-based theory of chemical reactivity in density functional theory.},

  abstract = {Stochastic chemical kinetics is a widely used formalism for studying stochasticity of chemical reactions inside single cells. Experimental studies of reaction networks are generally performed with cells that are part of a growing population, yet the population context is rarely taken into account when models are developed. Models that neglect the population context lose their validity whenever the studied system influences traits of cells that can be selected in the population, a property that naturally arises in the complex interplay between single-cell and population dynamics of cell fate decision systems. Here, we represent such systems as absorbing continuous-time Markov chains. We show that conditioning on non-absorption allows one to derive a modified master equation that tracks the time evolution of the expected population composition within a growing population. This allows us to derive consistent population dynamics models from a specification of the single-cell process. We use this approach to classify cell fate decision systems into two types that lead to different characteristic phases in emerging population dynamics. Subsequently, we deploy the gained insights to experimentally study a recurrent problem in biology: how to link plasmid copy number fluctuations and plasmid loss events inside single cells to growth of cell populations in dynamically changing environments.},

The complete exchange-correlation kernel is applied, including the direct contribution of the field-dependent basis functions and the reorthonormalization contribution from the perturbed overlap matrix. Additionally, the finite nucleus model is available for the electron-nucleus potential and the vector potential throughout. Efficiency is ensured by the diagonal local approximation to the unitary decoupling transformation in X2C as well as the (multipole-accelerated) resolution of the identity approximation for the Coulomb term (MARI-J, RI-J) and the seminumerical exchange approximation. Errors introduced by these approximations are assessed and found to be clearly negligible. The applicability of our implementation to large-scale calculations is demonstrated for a tin pincer-type system as well as low-valent tin and lead complexes.

  abstract = {The traditional foundation of science lies on the cornerstones of theory and experiment. Theory is used to explain experiment, which in turn guides the development of theory. Since the advent of computers and the development of computational algorithms, computation has risen as the third cornerstone of science, joining theory and experiment on an equal footing. Computation has become an essential part of modern science, amending experiment by enabling accurate comparison of complicated theories to sophisticated experiments, as well as guiding by triage both the design and targets of experiments and the development of novel theories and computational methods. Like experiment, computation relies on continued investment in infrastructure: it requires both hardware (the physical computer on which the calculation is run) as well as software (the source code of the programs that performs the wanted simulations). In this Perspective, I discuss present-day challenges on the software side in computational chemistry, which arise from the fast-paced development of algorithms, programming models, as well as hardware. I argue that many of these challenges could be solved with reusable open source libraries, which are a public good, enhance the reproducibility of science, and accelerate the development and availability of state-of-the-art methods and improved software.},

  abstract = {In this work we implement a new methodology to study structural and mechanical properties of systems having spherical and planar symmetries throughout Molecular Dynamics simulations. This methodology is applied here to a drug delivery system based in polymersomes, as an example. The chosen model drug was the local anesthetic prilocaine due to previous parameterization within the used coarse grain scheme. In our approach, mass density profiles (MDPs) are used to obtain key structural parameters of the systems, and pressure profiles are used to estimate the curvature elastic parameters. The calculation of pressure profiles and radial MPDs required the development of specific methods, which were implemented in an in-house built version of the GROMACS 2018 code. The methodology presented in this work is applied to characterize poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(butadiene) polymersomes and bilayers loaded with the model drug prilocaine. Our results show that structural properties of the polymersome membrane could be obtained from bilayer simulations, with significantly lower computational cost compared to whole polymersome simulations, but the bilayer simulations are insufficient to get insights on their mechanical aspects, since the elastic parameters are canceled out for the complete bilayer (as consequence of the symmetry). The simulations of entire polymersomes, although more complex, offer a complementary approach to get insights on the mechanical behavior of the systems.},

At fixed γ ̇ ⁠ , force F along a polymer increases linearly with N as previously predicted; however, contrary to existing theory, the F ( N ) slope increases for N above a transition length that exhibits minimal dependence on γ ̇ ⁠ . Force profiles are used in a stochastic model of a force-mediated reaction to compute the time for x percent of a polymer population to experience a reaction, t x . Observations are insensitive to the selected value of x in that t x data for varying N and γ ̇ can be consistently collapsed onto a single curve via appropriate scaling, with one master curve for systems below the transition N (small N ) and another for those above (large N ). Different force scaling for small and large N results in orders of magnitude difference in force-mediated reaction kinetics as represented by the population response time.

  abstract = {We present a strategic approach for enhancing the ionic conductivity of block copolymer electrolytes. This was achieved by introducing mixed ionic liquids (ILs) with varying molar ratios, wherein the imidazolium cation was paired with either tetrafluoroborate (BF 4 ) anion or bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (TFSI) anion. Two polymer matrices, poly(4-styrenesulfonate)- b -polymethylbutylene (SSMB) and poly(4-styrenesulfonyl (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide)- b -polymethylbutylene (STMB), were synthesized for this purpose. All the SSMB and STMB containing mixed ILs showed hexagonal cylindrical structures, but the type of tethered acid group significantly influenced the interfacial properties. STMB electrolytes demonstrated enhanced segregation strength, which was attributed to strengthened Coulomb and hydrogen bonding interactions in the ionic domains, where the ILs were uniformly distributed. In contrast, the SSMB electrolytes exhibited increased concentration fluctuations because the BF 4 anions were selectively sequestered at the block interfaces. This resulted in the effective confinement of imidazolium TFSI along the ionic domains, thereby preventing ion trapping in dead zones and facilitating rapid ion diffusion. Consequently, the SSMB electrolytes with mixed ILs demonstrated significantly improved ionic conductivities, surpassing the expected values based on the arithmetic average of the conductivities of each IL, whereas the ionic conductivity of the STMB was aligned with the expected average. The methodology explored in this study holds great promise for the development of solid-state polymer electrolytes.},

Using extensive Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations, we study the effect of the addition of a short-range attractive tail representing solvent-induced interactions to a fraction of the sites forming the hard helices, ranging from a single-site attraction to fully attractive helices for a specific helical shape. Different temperature regimes exist for different fractions of the attractive sites, as assessed in terms of the relative Boyle temperatures, that are found to be rather insensitive to the specific shape of the helical particle. The temperature range probed by the present study is well above the corresponding Boyle temperatures, with the phase behaviour still mainly entropically dominated and with the existence and location of the various liquid crystal phases only marginally affected. The pressure in the equation of state is found to decrease upon increasing the fraction of attractive beads and/or on lowering the temperature at fixed volume fraction, as expected on physical grounds. All screw phases are found to be stable within the considered range of temperatures with the smectic phase becoming more stable on lowering the temperature. By contrast, the location of the transition lines do not display a simple dependence on the fraction of attractive beads in the considered range of temperatures.},

  abstract = {Despite the desirability of polymers for use in many products due to their flexibility, light weight, and durability, their status as thermal insulators has precluded their use in applications where thermal conductors are required. However, recent results suggest that the thermal conductance of polymers can be enhanced and that their heat transport behaviors may be highly sensitive to nanoscale control. Here we use non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of mechanical twist on the steady-state thermal conductance across multi-stranded polyethylene wires. We find that a highly twisted double-helical polyethylene wire can display a thermal conductance up to three times that of its untwisted form, an effect which can be attributed to a structural transition in the strands of the double helix. We also find that in thicker wires composed of many parallel strands, adding just one twist can increase its thermal conductance by over 30\%. However, we find that unlike stretching a polymer wire, which causes a monotonic increase in thermal conductance, the effect of twist is highly non-monotonic, and certain amounts of twist can actually decrease the thermal conductance. Finally, we apply the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) in an attempt to explore the correlation between heat conductance and chirality. The CCM is found to correlate with twist as expected, but we attribute the observed heat transport behaviors to structural factors other than chirality.},

We discover a new simple electrostatic mechanism that rationalizes the counter-intuitive lateral coalescence of dipolar chains. There, we first demonstrate that two bent dipolar chains can either attract or repel each other depending if they possess similar or opposite curvatures, respectively. Upon bending, dipolar chains become the siege of polarization-induced local charges that in turn lead to quadrupolar couplings. This striking feature is then exploited to understand our conducted Monte Carlo simulations at finite temperature where thermal fluctuations cause local curvatures in the formed dipolar chains. The related quadrupolar attractive mode with correlated chain-curvatures is clearly identified in the simulation snapshots. Our findings shed new light on a longstanding problem in soft matter and related areas.},

External perturbations like light and electric fields exert a crucial influence on reaction-diffusion systems involving ionic species. While the separate impacts of light and electric fields have been extensively studied, comprehending their combined effects on spatiotemporal dynamics is paramount for designing versatile spatial orders. Here, we theoretically investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of chlorine dioxide-iodine-malonic acid reaction-diffusion system under photo-illumination and circularly polarized electric field (CPEF). By applying CPEF at varying intensities and frequencies, we observe the predominant emergence of oscillating hexagonal spot-like patterns from homogeneous stable steady states. Furthermore, our study unveils a spectrum of intriguing spatiotemporal instabilities, encompassing stripe-like patterns, oscillating dumbbell-shaped patterns, spot-like instabilities with square-based symmetry, and irregular chaotic patterns. However, when we introduce periodic photo-illumination to the hexagonal spot-like instabilities induced by CPEF in homogeneous steady states, we observe periodic size fluctuations. Additionally, the stripe-like instabilities undergo alternating transitions between hexagonal spots and stripes. Notably, within the Turing region, the interplay between these two external influences leads to the emergence of distinct superlattice patterns characterized by hexagonal-and square-based symmetry. These patterns include parallel lines of spots, target-like formations, black-eye patterns, and other captivating structures. Remarkably, the simple perturbation of the system through the application of these two external fields offers a versatile tool for generating a wide range of pattern-forming instabilities, thereby opening up exciting possibilities for future experimental validation.},

  abstract = {Fluid-based methods for particle sorting demonstrate increasing appeal in many areas of biosciences due to their biocompatibility and cost-effectiveness. Herein, we construct a microfluidic sorting system based on a swirl microchip. The impact of microchannel velocity on the swirl stagnation point as well as particle movement is analyzed through simulation and experiment. Moreover, the quantitative mapping relationship between flow velocity and particle position distribution is established. With this foundation established, a particle sorting method based on swirl induction is proposed. Initially, the particle is captured by a swirl. Then, the Sorting Region into which the particle aims to enter is determined according to the sorting condition and particle characteristic. Subsequently, the velocities of the microchannels are adjusted to control the swirl, which will induce the particle to enter its corresponding Induction Region. Thereafter, the velocities are adjusted again to change the fluid field and drive the particle into a predetermined Sorting Region, hence the sorting is accomplished. We have extensively conducted experiments taking particle size or color as a sorting condition. An outstanding sorting success rate of 98.75\% is achieved when dealing with particles within the size range of tens to hundreds of micrometers in radius, which certifies the effectiveness of the proposed sorting method. Compared to the existing sorting techniques, the proposed method offers greater flexibility. The adjustment of sorting conditions or particle parameters no longer requires complex chip redesign, because such sorting tasks can be successfully realized through simple microchannel velocities control.},

Several independent implementations of MBD with varying degree of functionality exist across a number of electronic structure codes, which both limits the current users of those codes and complicates dissemination of new variants of MBD. Here, we develop and document libMBD, a library implementation of MBD that is functionally complete, efficient, easy to integrate with any electronic structure code, and already integrated in FHI-aims, DFTB+, VASP, Q-Chem, CASTEP, and Quantum ESPRESSO. libMBD is written in modern Fortran with bindings to C and Python, uses MPI/ScaLAPACK for parallelization, and implements MBD for both finite and periodic systems, with analytical gradients with respect to all input parameters. The computational cost has asymptotic cubic scaling with system size, and evaluation of gradients only changes the prefactor of the scaling law, with libMBD exhibiting strong scaling up to 256 processor cores. Other MBD properties beyond energy and gradients can be calculated with libMBD, such as the charge-density polarization, first-order Coulomb correction, the dielectric function, or the order-by-order expansion of the energy in the dipole interaction. Calculations on supramolecular complexes with MBD-corrected electronic structure methods and a meta-review of previous applications of MBD demonstrate the broad applicability of the libMBD package to treat vdW interactions.},

Here, we outline an algorithm to overcome this combinatorial bottleneck, based on a bottom-up approach to energy-based screening. This is implemented within a new open-source software application (“Fragme∩t”), which is integrated with a lightweight semi-empirical method that is used to cull subsystems, attenuating the combinatorial growth of higher-order terms in the graph that is used to manage the calculations. This facilitates applications of unprecedented size, and we report four-body calculations in ( H 2 O ) 64 clusters that afford relative energies within 0.1 kcal/mol/monomer of the supersystem result using less than 10\% of the unique subsystems. We also report n -body calculations in ( H 2 O ) 20 clusters up to n = 8, at which point the expansion terminates naturally due to screening. These are the largest n -body calculations reported to date using ab initio electronic structure theory, and they confirm that high-order n -body terms are mostly artifacts of basis-set superposition error.},

Here we revisit the theory of this phenomenon by focusing attention on the reduction in the ion mobility with the concentration of salt and a consequent impact to the conductivity of a monovalent solution, from bulk to confined in a narrow slit. We first give a systematic treatment of electrophoresis of ions and obtain equations for their zeta potentials and mobilities. The latter are then used to obtain a simple expression for a bulk conductivity, which is valid in a concentration range up to a few molars and more accurate than prior analytic theories. By extending the formalism to the electrolyte solution in the charged channel the equations describing the conductivity in different modes are presented. They can be regarded as a generalization of prior work on the channel conductivity to a more realistic case of a nonzero reduction of the electrophoretic mobility of ions with salt concentration.

  abstract = {Polar surfaces undergo polarity compensation, which can lead to significantly different surface chemistry from their nonpolar counterparts. This process in turn can substantially alter the binding of adsorbates on the surface. Here, we find that hydrogen binds much more strongly to the polar (110) surface than the nonpolar (100) surface for a wide range of ABO 3 perovskites, forming a hydroxyl layer on the O 2 4− termination and a hydride layer on the ABO 4+ termination of the (110) surface. The stronger adsorption on the polar surfaces can be explained by polarity compensation: hydrogen atoms can act as electron donors or acceptors to compensate for the polarity of perovskite surfaces. The relative stability of the surface terminations is further compared under different gas environments and several perovskites have been found to form stable surface hydride layers under oxygen-poor conditions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of creating stable surface hydrides on perovskites by polarity compensation which might lead to new hydrogenation catalysts based on ABO 3 perovskites.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional transition metal chalcogenides (2D TMCs) like MoS 2 , WS 2 etc., have established significant dominance in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology, owing to their unique properties like strong light–matter interaction, high carrier mobility, large photo-responsivity etc. Despite the widespread utilization of these binary TMCs, their potential in the advancement of the optoelectronic research is limited due to the constraints in band tuning and charge carrier lifetime. To overcome these limitations, ternary transition metal chalcogenides have emerged as promising alternatives. Although, the optical properties of these materials have never been explored properly. Herein, we have investigated one such promising member of this group, Cu 2 MoS 4 (CMS) using both steady state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. The material exhibits a broad range of visible light absorption, peaking at 576 nm. Photoluminescence spectroscopy confirmed the presence of both band gap emission and trap state-mediated emissions. Transient absorption spectroscopy unraveled the excited state charge carrier dynamics of CMS in sub-ps timescale, upon irradiation of visible light. We found significant influence of the trap mediated recombination, while Auger process being dominant at high charge density. We extended our study in a wide temperature range (5–300 K), which reveals the impact of electron-phonon coupling strength on the band gap and charge carrier dynamics of this material. This detailed study would draw more attention toward the unexplored optical properties of ternary 2D chalcogenides and will open new avenues for the construction of 2D material-based optical devices.},

  abstract = {The relocation of peripheral transistors from the front-end-of-line (FEOL) to the back-end-of-line (BEOL) in fabrication processes is of significant interest, as it allows for the introduction of novel functionality in the BEOL while providing additional die area in the FEOL. Oxide semiconductor-based transistors serve as attractive candidates for BEOL. Within these categories, In 2 O 3 material is particularly notable; nonetheless, the excessive intrinsic carrier concentration poses a limitation on its broader applicability. Herein, the deposition of Hf-doped In 2 O 3 (IHO) films via atomic layer deposition for the first time demonstrates an effective method for tuning the intrinsic carrier concentration, where the doping concentration plays a critical role in determine the properties of IHO films and all-oxide structure transistors with Au-free process. The all-oxide transistors with In 2 O 3 : HfO 2 ratio of 10:1 exhibited optimal electrical properties, including high on-current with 249 µ A, field-effect mobility of 13.4 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , and on/off ratio exceeding 10 6 , and also achieved excellent stability under long time positive bias stress and negative bias stress. These findings suggest that this study not only introduces a straightforward and efficient approach to improve the properties of In 2 O 3 material and transistors, but as well paves the way for development of all-oxide transistors and their integration into BEOL technology.},

This work investigates shock-induced reaction mechanism and kinetics of premixed Ni/Al nanolaminates with molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical analysis. The reaction is found to be driven by the crystallization evolution in premixed interlayer and the diffusion of premixed atoms. Among them, multi-stage reaction patterns are strongly manifested by the crystallization evolution characteristics. Specifically, “crystallization-dissolution-secondary growth” and “crystallization-dissolution” of B 2 phase respectively correspond to the solid-state and solid-liquid reaction cases, where crystallizations are fitted well by Johnson–Mehl–Avrami kinetics model. Interestingly, the different growth mechanisms of B 2 grain are revealed, namely nuclei coalescence and atomic diffusion. Moreover, the analysis of microscopic diffusion theory indicates a certain non-random diffusion nature for solid-state reaction initiation, but near-purely random diffusion for solid-liquid reaction initiation. The diffused Al atoms possess a limited diffusion coefficient and enhanced diffusion correlation, resulting in extremely slow mixing rate in Ni layer. In addition, the influence law of Ni concentration in premixed interlayer on reactivity parameters can be quantitatively described by a quadratic function.},

There has also been no research into the thermomechanical properties of layered electrides, with computational predictions considering only static lattices. In this work, we investigate the thermomechanical properties of five layered electrides using density-functional theory to evaluate the magnitude of thermal effects on their lattice constants and cell volumes.

  abstract = {Despite the enormous theoretical and application interests, a fundamental understanding of the glassy dynamics remains elusive. The static properties of glassy and ordinary liquids are similar, but their dynamics are dramatically different. What leads to this difference is the central puzzle of the field. Even the primary defining glassy characteristics, their implications, and if they are related to a single mechanism remain unclear. This lack of clarity is a severe hindrance to theoretical progress. Here, we combine analytical arguments and simulations of various systems in different dimensions and address these questions. Our results suggest that the myriad of glassy features are manifestations of two distinct mechanisms. Particle caging controls the mean, and coexisting slow- and fast-moving regions govern the distribution of particle displacements. All the other glassy characteristics are manifestations of these two mechanisms; thus, the Fickian yet non-Gaussian nature of glassy liquids is not surprising. We discover a crossover, from stretched exponential to a power law, in the behavior of the overlap function. This crossover is prominent in simulation data and forms the basis of our analyses. Our results have crucial implications on how the glassy dynamics data are analyzed, challenge some recent suggestions on the mechanisms governing glassy dynamics, and impose strict constraints that a correct theory of glasses must have.},

  abstract = {Understanding the ionic transport through multilayer nanoporous graphene (NPG) holds great promise for the design of novel nanofluidic devices. Bilayer NPG with different structures, such as nanopore offset and interlayer space, should be the most simple but representative multilayer NPG. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate the ionic transport through a functionalized bilayer NPG, focusing on the effect of pore functionalization, offset, applied pressure and interlayer distance. For a small interlayer space, the fluxes of water and ions exhibit a sudden reduction to zero with the increase in offset that indicates an excellent on-off gate, which can be deciphered by the increasing potential of mean force barriers. With the increase in pressure, the fluxes increase almost linearly for small offsets while always maintain zero for large offsets. Finally, with the increase in interlayer distance, the fluxes increase drastically, resulting in the reduction in ion rejection. Notably, for a specific interlayer distance with monolayer water structure, the ion rejection maintains high levels (almost 100\% for coions) with considerable water flux, which could be the best choice for desalination purpose. The dynamics of water and ions also exhibit an obvious bifurcation for cationic and anionic functionalization. Our work comprehensively addresses the ionic transport through a bilayer NPG and provides a route toward the design of novel desalination devices.},

The neural network is trained on ab initio data obtained with strongly constrained and appropriately normed density functional theory. The observed changes in the XAS features of the NaCl solution, compared to those of pure water, are in good agreement between experimental and theoretical results. We provided detailed explanations for these spectral changes that occur when NaCl is solvated in pure water. Specifically, the presence of solvating ion pairs leads to localization of electron-hole excitons. Our theoretical XAS results support the theory that the effects of the solvating ions on the H-bond network are mainly confined within the first hydration shell of ions, however beyond the shell the arrangement of water molecules remains to be comparable to that observed in pure water.},

  abstract = {The solvent effects on the linear and second-order nonlinear optical properties of an aminonaphtylethenylpyridinium (ANEP) dye are investigated by combining experimental and theoretical chemistry methods. On the one hand, deep near infrared (NIR) hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) measurements (1840–1950 nm) are performed on solutions of di-8-ANEPPS in deuterated chloroform, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide to determine their first hyperpolarizablity ( β HRS ). For the first time, these HRS experiments are carried out in the picosecond regime in the deep NIR with very moderate (≤3 mW) average input power, providing a good signal-to-noise ratio and avoiding solvent thermal effects. Moreover, the frequency dispersion of β HRS is investigated for Disperse Red 1 (DR1), a dye commonly used as HRS external reference. On the other hand, these are compared with computational chemistry results obtained by using a sequential molecular dynamics (MD) then quantum mechanics (QM) approach. The MD method allows accounting for the dynamical nature of the molecular structures. Then, the QM part is based on TDDFT/M06-2X/6-311+G* calculations using solvation models ranging from continuum to discrete ones. Measurements report a decrease of the β HRS of di-8-ANEPPS in more polar solvents and these effects are reproduced by the different solvation models. For di-8-ANEPPS and DR1, comparisons show that the use of a hybrid solvation model, combining the description of the solvent molecules around the probe by point charges with a continuum model, already achieves quasi quantitative agreement with experiment. These results are further improved by using a polarizable embedding that includes the atomic polarizabilities in the solvent description.},

As a lab-scale surrogate to a high explosion detonation event, nanosecond laser ablation of an aluminum alloy (AA6061) target was performed in atmospheric pressure conditions. Optical emission spectroscopy and two mass spectrometry techniques were used to monitor the early to late stages of plasma generation to track the evolution of atoms, molecules, clusters, nanoparticles, and agglomerates. The experiments were performed under atmospheric pressure air, atmospheric pressure nitrogen, and 20\% and 5\% O 2 (balance N 2 ), the latter specifically with in situ mass spectrometry. Electron microscopy was performed ex situ to identify crystal structure and elemental distributions in individual nanoparticles. We find that the presence of ≈20\% O 2 leads to strong AlO emission, whereas in a flowing N 2 environment (with trace O 2 ), AlN and strong, unreacted Al emissions are present. In situ mass spectrometry reveals that as O 2 availability increases, Al oxide cluster size increases. Nanoparticle agglomerates formed in air are found to be larger than those formed under N 2 gas. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that Al 2 O 3 and AlN nanoparticle agglomerates are formed in both environments; indicating that the presence of trace O 2 can lead to Al 2 O 3 nanoparticle formation. The present results highlight that the availability of O 2 in the ambient gas significantly impacts spectral signatures, cluster size, and nanoparticle agglomeration behavior. These results are relevant to understanding debris formation in an explosion event, and interpreting data from forensic investigations.},

  abstract = {In this work the H 2 O–HCN complex is quantitatively characterized in two ways. First, we report a new rigid-monomer 5D intermolecular potential energy surface (PES) for this complex, calculated using the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory based on density functional theory method. The PES is based on 2833 ab initio points computed employing the aug-cc-pVQZ basis set, utilizing the autoPES code, which provides a site-site analytical fit with the long-range region given by perturbation theory. Next, we present the results of the quantum 5D calculations of the fully coupled intermolecular rovibrational states of the H 2 O–HCN complex for the total angular momentum J values of 0, 1, and 2, performed on the new PES. These calculations rely on the quantum bound-state methodology developed by us recently and applied to a variety of noncovalently bound binary molecular complexes. The vibrationally averaged ground-state geometry of H 2 O–HCN determined from the quantum 5D calculations agrees very well with that from the microwave spectroscopic measurements. In addition, the computed ground-state rotational transition frequencies, as well as the B and C rotational constants calculated for the ground state of the complex, are in excellent agreement with the experimental values. The assignment of the calculated intermolecular vibrational states of the H 2 O–HCN complex is surprisingly challenging. It turns out that only the excitations of the intermolecular stretch mode can be assigned with confidence. The coupling among the angular degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the complex is unusually strong, and as a result most of the excited intermolecular states are unassigned. On the other hand, the coupling of the radial, intermolecular stretch mode and the angular DOFs is weak, allowing straightforward assignment of the excitation of the former.},

Here we study selected ground state properties of few-atom gold clusters by using density functional theory (DFT) and various implementations of the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion Monte Carlo. We show that the QMC methods mitigate the exchange-correlation (XC) approximation made in the DFT approach: the average QMC results are more accurate and significantly more consistent than corresponding DFT results based on different XC functionals. Furthermore, we use demonstrate structural optimization of selected thiolated gold clusters with between 1 and 3 gold atoms using VMC forces. The optimization workflow is demonstrably consistent, robust, and its computational cost scales with n b , where b &lt; 3 and n is the system size.

  abstract = {Common one-electron reduced density matrix (1-RDM) functionals that depend on Coulomb and exchange-only integrals tend to underestimate dynamic correlation, preventing reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) from achieving comparable accuracy to density functional theory in main-group thermochemistry and thermochemical kinetics. The recently developed ω P22 functional introduces a semi-local density functional to screen the erroneous short-range portion of 1-RDM functionals without double-counting correlation, potentially providing a better treatment of dynamic correlation around equilibrium geometries. Herein, we systematically evaluate the performance of this functional model, which consists of two parameters, on main-group thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, nonbonded interactions, and more. Tests on atomization energies, vibrational frequencies, and reaction barriers reveal that the ω P22 functional model can reliably predict properties at equilibrium and slightly away from equilibrium geometries. In particular, it outperforms commonly used density functionals in the prediction of reaction barriers, nonbonded interactions, and singlet diradicals, thus enhancing the predictive power of RDMFT for routine calculations of thermochemistry and thermochemical kinetics around equilibrium geometries. Further development is needed in the future to refine short- and long-range approximations in the functional model in order to achieve an excellent description of properties both near and far from equilibrium geometries.},

A renewable-based multi-energy system considers power, cooling, heating, and hydrogen energy as utility systems for integrated sport buildings. In this study, we investigate the effect of radiation intensity, current density, and other performance factors on the rate of hydrogen production in water electrolysis using a polymer membrane electrolyzer in combination with a solar concentrator. The findings showed that a rise in hydrogen generation led to an increase in current density, which increased the electrolyzer’s voltage and decreased its energy and exergy efficiencies. The voltage was also increased, and the electrolyzer’s efficiency was enhanced by a rise in temperature, a decrease in pressure, and a reduction in the thickness of the nafion membrane. Additionally, with a 145\% increase in radiation intensity, hydrogen production increased by 110\% while the electrolyzer’s energy and exergy efficiencies decreased by 13.8\% as a result of the electrolyzer’s high input electric current to hydrogen output ratio.},

Recently developed potentials feature high body order and can include equivariant semi-local interactions through message-passing mechanisms. Due to their complex functional forms, they rely on automatic differentiation (AD), overcoming the need for manual implementations or finite-difference schemes to evaluate gradients. This study discusses how to use AD to efficiently obtain forces, stress, and heat flux for such potentials, and provides a model-independent implementation. The method is tested on the Lennard-Jones potential, and then applied to predict cohesive properties and thermal conductivity of tin selenide using an equivariant message-passing neural network potential.},

  abstract = {Quantitative descriptions of non-adiabatic transition rates at intermediate temperatures are challenging due to the simultaneous importance of quantum and anharmonic effects. In this paper, the interplay between quantum effects—for motion across or along the seam of crossing—and anharmonicity in the seam potential is considered within the weak coupling limit. The well-known expression for quantized 1-D motion across the seam (i.e., tunneling) in the linear terms approximation is derived in the thermal domain using the Lagrangian formalism, which is then applied to the case when tunneling is distributed along the seam of crossing (treating motion along the seam classically). For high-frequency quantum modes, a vibrationally adiabatic (VA) approach is developed that introduces to the non-adiabatic rate constant a factor associated with high-frequency wavefunction overlap; this approach treats the high-frequency motion along the seam quantum mechanically. To test these methodologies, the reaction N 2 O ↔ N 2 + O( 3 P ) was chosen. CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVTZ-F12 explorations of the 3 A ′- 1 A ′ seam of N 2 O revealed that seam anharmonicity has a strong effect on the rate constant (a factor of ∼ 20 at 2000 K). Several quantum effects were found to be significant at intermediate/lower temperatures, including the quantum N–N vibration that was coupled with seam anharmonicity using the VA approach. Finally, a 1-D approximation to non-adiabatic instanton theory is presented to estimate the validity limit of the linear terms model at low temperatures ( ⁠ ∼ 250 K for N 2 O). We recommend that the assumptions built into many statistical theories for non-adiabatic reactions—harmonic behavior, classical motion, linear terms, and weak coupling—should be verified on a case-by-case basis.},

Utilizing the derived total stress tensor and applying the mechanical equilibrium condition, we establish a general expression for the disjoining pressure of the Coulomb fluids, confined in a pore with a slit-like geometry. Using this equation, we derive an asymptotic expression for the disjoining pressure in a slit-like pore with non-electrified conductive walls.

  abstract = {The recent ω LH22t range-separated local hybrid (RSLH) is shown to provide outstanding accuracy for the notorious benchmark problem of the two lowest excited-state potential energy curves for the amino group twist in 4-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (DMABN). However, the design of ω LH22t as a general-purpose functional resulted in less convincing performance for triplet excitations, which is an important advantage of previous LHs. Furthermore, ω LH22t uses 8 empirical parameters to achieve broad accuracy. In this work, the RSLH ω LH23ct-sir is constructed with minimal empiricism by optimizing its local mixing function prefactor and range-separation parameter for only 8 excitation energies. ω LH23ct-sir maintains the excellent performance of ω LH22t for the DMABN twist and charge-transfer benchmarks but significantly improves the errors for triplet excitation energies (0.17 vs 0.24 eV). Additional test calculations for the AE6BH6 thermochemistry test set and large dipole moment and static polarizability test sets confirm that the focus on excitation energies in the optimization of ω LH23ct-sir has not caused any dramatic errors for ground-state properties. Although ω LH23ct-sir cannot replace ω LH22t as a general-purpose functional, it is preferable for problems requiring a universally good description of localized and charge-transfer excitations of both singlet and triplet multiplicity. Current limitations on the application of ω LH23ct-sir and other RSLHs to the study of singlet-triplet gaps of emitters for thermally activated delayed fluorescence are discussed. This work also includes the first systematic analysis of the influence of the local mixing function prefactor and the range-separation parameter in an RSLH on different types of excitations.},

  abstract = {Despite its simplicity and relatively low computational cost, second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) is well-known to overbind noncovalent interactions between polarizable monomers and some organometallic bonds. In such situations, the pairwise-additive correlation energy expression in MP2 is inadequate. Although energy-gap dependent amplitude regularization can substantially improve the accuracy of conventional MP2 in these regimes, the same regularization parameter worsens the accuracy for small molecule thermochemistry and density-dependent properties. Recently, we proposed a repartitioning of Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory that is size-consistent to second order (BW-s2), and a free parameter ( α ) was set to recover the exact dissociation limit of H 2 in a minimal basis set. Alternatively α can be viewed as a regularization parameter, where each value of α represents a valid variant of BW-s2, which we denote as BW-s2( α ). In this work, we semi-empirically optimize α for noncovalent interactions, thermochemistry, alkane conformational energies, electronic response properties, and transition metal datasets, leading to improvements in accuracy relative to the ab initio parameterization of BW-s2 and MP2. We demonstrate that the optimal α parameter ( α = 4) is more transferable across chemical problems than energy-gap-dependent regularization parameters. This is attributable to the fact that the BW-s2( α ) regularization strength depends on all of the information encoded in the t amplitudes rather than just orbital energy differences. While the computational scaling of BW-s2( α ) is iterative O ( N 5 ) ⁠ , this effective and transferable approach to amplitude regularization is a promising route to incorporate higher-order correlation effects at second-order cost.},

In contrast to the Jastrow transcorrelation of Boys-Handy, the effective Hamiltonian of this projective transcorrelation features: 1. a series terminating formally at four-body interactions. 2. no spin-contamination within the non-relativistic framework. 3. simultaneous satisfaction of the singlet and triplet first-order cusp conditions. 4. arbitrary choices of pairs for correlation including frozen-core approximations. We discuss the connection between the projective transcorrelation and F12 theory with applications to small molecules, to show that the cusp conditions play an important role to reduce the uncertainty arising from the nonunitary transformation.},

  abstract = {The quantum chemistry community has developed analytic forces for approximate electronic excited states to enable walking on excited state potential energy surfaces (PES). One can thereby computationally characterize excited state minima and saddle points. Always implicit in using this machinery is the fact that an excited state PES only exists within the realm of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom separate. This work demonstrates through ab initio calculations and simple nonadiabatic dynamics that some excited state minimum structures are fantastical: they appear to exist as stable configurations only as a consequence of the PES construct, rather than being physically observable. Each fantastical structure exhibits an unphysically high predicted harmonic frequency and associated force constant. This fact can serve as a valuable diagnostic of when an optimized excited state structure is non-observable. The origin of this phenomenon can be attributed to the coupling between different electronic states. As PESs approach one another, the upper surface can form a minimum that is very close to a near-touching point. The force constant, evaluated at this minimum, relates to the strength of the electronic coupling rather than to any characteristic excited state vibration. Nonadiabatic dynamics results using a Landau-Zener model illustrate that fantastical excited state structures have extremely short lifetimes on the order of a few femtoseconds. Their appearance in a calculation signals the presence of a nearby conical intersection through which the system will rapidly cross to a lower surface.},

While behavior of these biophysical properties are well understood in single component membranes, very little is known about how do they change in the mixed lipid membranes. Often various properties of the mixed lipid bilayers are assumed to change linearly with the mole fractions of the constituent lipids which, however, is true for “ideal” mixing only. In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that structural and mechanical properties of binary lipid mixture change nonlinearly with the lipid mole fractions, and the strength of the nonlinearity depends on two factors - spontaneous curvature difference and locally inhomogeneous interactions between the lipid components.},

  abstract = {Enzymes accelerate the rates of biomolecular reactions by many orders of magnitude compared to bulk solution, and it is widely understood that this catalytic effect arises from a combination of polar pre-organization and electrostatic transition state stabilization. A number of recent reports have also implicated ultrafast (femtosecond-picosecond) timescale motions in enzymatic activity. However, complications arising from spatially-distributed disorder, the occurrence of multiple substrate binding modes, and the influence of hydration dynamics on solvent-exposed active sites still confound many experimental studies. Here we use ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy and covalently-tethered substrate analogs to examine dynamical properties of the promiscuous Pyrococcus horikoshii ene-reductase ( Ph ENR) active site in two binding configurations mimicking proposed “inactive” and “reactive” Michaelis complexes. Spectral diffusion measurements of aryl-nitrile substrate analogs reveal an end-to-end tradeoff between fast (sub-ps) and slow (&gt;5 ps) motions. Fermi resonant aryl-azide analogs that sense interactions of coupled oscillators are described. Lineshape and quantum beat analyses of these probes reveal characteristics that correlate with aryl-nitrile frequency fluctuation correlation functions parameters, demonstrating that this anisotropy is an intrinsic property of the water-exposed active site, where countervailing gradients of fast dynamics and disorder in the reactant ground state are maintained near the hydration interface. Our results suggest several plausible factors leading to state-selective rate enhancement and promiscuity in Ph ENR. This study also highlights a strategy to detect perturbations to vibrational modes outside the transparent window of the mid-IR spectrum, which may be extended to other macromolecular systems.},

  abstract = {We have studied diffusion and thermodiffusion in the ternary system polystyrene + toluene + cyclohexane over the entire composition range of the binary solvent toluene + cyclohexane and for polymer concentrations up to 0.1 mass fractions by multi-color optical beam deflection. The polystyrene molar masses were 4.88 and 17.90 kg/mol. The inversion problem of the contrast factor matrix could be avoided by reasonable a priori assumptions about the diffusion eigenvectors. The fast mode of the bimodal dynamics is attributed to the interdiffusion of the two solvents at constant polymer concentration, whereas the slow mode is due to the diffusion of the polymer with respect to the binary solvent. The amplitude of the fast mode vanishes in the pure toluene and the pure cyclohexane limits of the mixed solvent. The amplitude of the slow mode increases with polymer concentration. The composition and temperature dependence of the slow diffusion eigenvalue, the hydrodynamic correlation length, and the Soret coefficient of the polymer reflect the transition from a good to a theta solvent with increasing cyclohexane content and with decreasing temperature. Due to cross diffusion, cyclohexane reverses its migration direction between the fast and the slow mode, leading to a positive thermodiffusion but a negative Soret coefficient. The polymer thermodiffusion coefficients during the slow mode vary by approximately a factor of two, depending on the solvent composition. Rescaling with the solvent viscosity collapses all data onto a single master curve with an extrapolated value of ηD T ≈ 6 × 10 −15 Pa m 2 K −1 in the dilute limit. This value is well known from various other binary polymer/solvent mixtures.},

By combining structural (x-ray diffraction), thermodynamic (differential scanning calorimetry) and dynamical probes (dielectric spectroscopy) we construct the pertinent phase diagram. It consists of liquid 1-propanol, liquid water, hexagonal ice and different hydrates, the latter sharing the same lattice. The phase diagram can be discussed in terms of four regimes, all having in common a droplet arrangement of the minority component. When water droplets are strongly confined by 1-propanol (regime I, 0.92 &lt; X V ≤ 1; “soft” confinement), water is unable to crystallize. It has dynamics reminiscent to the ultra-viscous water phase known as high-density liquid (HDL). When water droplets are moderately confined (regime II, 0.75 &lt; X V ≤ 0.92) water can crystallize via homogeneous nucleation. Strikingly, the homogeneous nucleation temperature is at 205 K, well within “no-man’s land.” The result is in line with earlier reports that soft confinement is the key to enter into the “no-man’s land”. When 1-propanol is the minority component (regimes III and IV), the structure and the dynamics are dominated by the 1-propanol/water interface with the formation of hydrates. The corresponding dynamical features suggest a link between hydrate formation and the two metastable phases of ultra-viscous water, HDL and low-density liquid.},

The intrinsic viscosity, complex viscosity and the dielectric relaxation of ring polymers are investigated within the tenets of the optimized Rouse–Zimm theory. The distance dependent excluded volume interactions (EVIs) are obtained from Flory’s mean field theory. The hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) between the pairs of monomers are estimated using the preaveraged Oseen tensor. The intrinsic viscosity of linear and ring polymers both with and without EVI are compared as a function of ring size. A monotonically increasing trend of the intrinsic viscosity is observed in both cases. The intrinsic viscosity of both linear and ring polymers both with and without EVI show a very good agreement with the experimental results of polystyrene over a wide range of molecular weights in both good and theta solvents, respectively. The fractal dimensions of the ring polymers with EVI lie between that of a random walk and a self-avoiding walk model of linear polymers in three dimensions. The ring size increases with EVI and the effect of EVI is stronger on larger rings than that on smaller rings. The dielectric relaxation follow a connectivity independent universal scaling behavior at low and high frequency regions. The imaginary part of the complex dielectric susceptibility displays a local maxima in the intermediate frequency region, which reveals a structure dependent behavior of the rings. The theoretically calculated dielectric loss of ring polymers with HI matches well with those obtained from experiments.},

We report the structure and phase behavior of a mixture of hard colloids and soft coarse-grained macromolecules. Through the use of Reference Interaction Site Model theory and molecular dynamics simulations we find that hard colloids and soft macromolecules act as depletants toward each other, generating a medium-induced effective attraction. This effective attraction leads to the formation of non-dispersed phases at high densities. At low and high fractions of hard colloids the system macrophase separates into two disparate regions of hard colloids and soft macromolecules. However, this system microphase separates into a hard-rich and soft-rich self-assembled domains at intermediate compositions. The formation of microphase separated structure in this system of isotropic, disconnected, and purely repulsive colloids is surprising and quite novel. This behavior is likely due to a softening of the interface between hard-rich and soft-rich self-assembled domains. Molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that the microphase separated state has an overall disordered bicontinuous morphology. The hard-rich domain forms an ordered FCC structure and the soft-rich domain forms a disordered cluster-fluid, making the structure simultaneously ordered and disordered.},

The surface modification of nanoparticles is used to enable their dispersion in polymers. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are useful for revealing the interfacial properties between nanoparticles and polymers to aid in the design of materials. In this study, the effect of surface coverage, modifier length, and polymer species on the interfacial structure and affinity between surface-modified Al 2 O 3 and polymer melts were investigated using all-atom MD simulations. Hexanoic, decanoic, and tetradecanoic acids were used as surface modifiers, and polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were used as polymers. The work of adhesion W adh and the work of immersion W imm were selected as quantitative measures of affinity. W adh was calculated using the phantom-wall approach, and W imm was calculated by simply subtracting the surface tension of polymers γ L from W adh . The results showed that W adh and W imm were improved by surface modification with low coverage, owing to a good penetration of the polymer. The effect of modifier length on W adh and W imm was small. Whereas W adh increased in the following order: PP &lt; PS &lt; PMMA, W imm increased as follows: PMMA &lt; PS &lt; PP. Finally, the trend of W adh and W imm was organized using the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ between the modifier and the polymer. This study demonstrates that the interfacial affinity can be improved by tuning the surface coverage and modifier species depending on the polymer matrix.},

In this work, a novel sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-assisted synthesis of BiOBr/Bi 2 WO 6 /GO ternary composite has been synthesized successfully by a handy hydrothermal method. Photoluminescence, Photocurrent, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, surface photovoltage and transient photovoltage measurements illustrate that construction of p-n BiOBr/Bi 2 WO 6 heterojunction leads to the obviously enhancement of charge separation efficiency, and the photogenerated electrons trapped by GO can effectively inhibit the recombination process of photogenerated charge, resulting in the improvement of charge separation efficiency and the longer lifetime of photogenerated carriers for BiOBr/Bi 2 WO 6 /GO. The characterization of structure and morphology indicate that role of GO can also improve the visible light absorption range, and the SDS-assisted synthesis can reduce the size of particle in the composite and enhances the specific surface area of the composite by regulating the particle size and agglomeration. Under optimal conditions, BiOBr/Bi 2 WO 6 /GO (SDS) has the outstanding photocatalytic degradation performance and the degradation rate constants for oxytetracycline, tetracycline hydrochloride, methylene blue and rhodamine are 0.056, 0.057, 0.103 and 0.414 min −1 , respectively. Notably, the degradation rate constants obtained by BiOBr/Bi 2 WO 6 /GO (SDS) are more ten times higher than that of pure BiOBr and Bi 2 WO 6 . The possible mechanism of photocatalytic degradation was suggested for BiOBr/Bi 2 WO 6 /GO based on the dynamic properties of photogenerated charge and reactive oxidation species results. Surprisingly, the recyclability of the BiOBr/Bi 2 WO 6 /GO (SDS) composite obtained from the cyclic experiments has laid a foundation for the study of efficient and stable photocatalysts.},

For both the samples, the differential probe transmission data show photo-induced bleaching at earlier pump-probe delay followed by photo-induced absorption unveiling signatures of exciton-state filling, exciton trapping, defect-mediated photo-induced probe absorption and recombination of defect bound excitons. The exciton trapping and photo-induced absorption by the trapped-carriers are estimated to occur with time constant of ∼430 to 500 fs based on multi-exponential modelling of the differential transmission till pump-probe delay of ∼3.5 ps. Biexponential modeling of the subsequent slow-recovery of the negative differential transmission at pump-probe delay ≳3.5 ps reveals that the exciton recombination happens via two distinct decay channels with ∼25 to 55 ps ( τ 1 ) and ≳1 ns ( τ 2 ) time constants. Pump-fluence dependent reduction in τ 1 and further modelling of exciton population using higher order kinetic rate equation reveals that the two-body exciton-exciton annihilation governs the exciton recombination initially with a decay rate of ∼ 10 − 8 cm 3 s −1 . The detailed analysis suggests that the fraction of total excitons that decay via long decay channel decreases with increasing exciton density for 2H–MoSe 2 , in contrast to 1T/2H–MoSe 2 where the fraction of excitons decaying via long decay channel remains constant.},

  abstract = {Double-atom catalysts (DACs) for harmful nitrate (NO 3 − ) electroreduction to valuable ammonia (eNO 3 RR) is attractive for both environmental remediation and energy transformation. However, the limited metal loading in most DACs largely hinders their applications in practical catalytic applications. Therefore, exploring ultrahigh-density (UHD) DACs with abundant active metal centers and excellent eNO 3 RR activity is highly desired under the site-distance effect. Herein, starting from the experimental M 2 N 6 motif deposited on graphene, we firstly screened the low-density (LD) Mn 2 N 6 and Fe 2 N 6 DACs with high eNO 3 RR activity and then established an appropriate activity descriptor for the LD–DAC system. By utilizing this descriptor, the corresponding Mn 2 N 6 and Fe 2 N 6 UHD–DACs with dynamic, thermal, thermodynamic, and electrochemical stabilities, are identified to locate at the peak of activity volcano, exhibiting rather-low limiting potentials of −0.25 and −0.38 V, respectively. Further analysis in term of spin state and orbital interaction, confirms that the electronic state effect similar to that of LD–DACs enable the excellent eNO 3 RR activity to be maintained in the UHD–DACs. These findings highlight the promising application of Mn 2 N 6 and Fe 2 N 6 UHD–DACs in nitrate electroreduction for NH 3 production and provide impetus for further experimental exploration of ultrahigh-density DACs based on their intrinsic electronic states.},

However, such bandgap modification in kesterite-structured Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 is normally realized via high temperature sulfurization process (above 500°C), which is not only difficult to control the sulfurization depth, but also introduces additional deep defects because of the decomposition of absorber layer at such high temperature. In this study, a low-temperature sulfurization process (150°C) is developed. Such process not only inhibits the decomposition of Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 films and controls the elemental distribution very well, but also increase the surface bandgap of the absorber layer and form a gradient energy bandgap. Also, the density of deep-level defects in the Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 layer is reduced. As a consequence, the open circuit voltage of the solar cell is improved by 60 mV. This study paves the way towards the high efficient kesterite solar cell and other solar cells.},

  abstract = {Constructing metal-semiconductor interfaces by loading metal atoms onto two-dimensional material to build atomically dispersed single-atom catalysts (SACs) has emerged as a new frontier for improving atom utilization and designing multifunctional electrocatalysts. Nowadays, studies on black phosphorus nanosheets in electrocatalysis have received much attention and the successful preparation of metal nanoparticle/black phosphorus (BP) hybrid electrocatalysts indicates BP nanosheets can serve as a potential support platform for SACs. Herein, by using large-scale ab initio calculations, we explored a large composition space of SACs with transition metal atoms supported on BP monolayer (M-BP) and built a comprehensive picture of activity trend, stability, and electronic origin towards oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR and OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results show that the catalytic activity can be widely tuned by reasonable regulation of metal atoms. Ni-, Pd-, and Pt-BP could effectively balance the binding strength of the target intermediates, thus achieving efficient bifunctional activity for OER and ORR. Favorable bifunctional catalytic performance for OER and HER can be realized on Rh-BP. Especially, Pt-BP exhibits promising trifunctional activity towards OER, ORR, and HER. Multiple-level corrections among overpotential, Gibbs free energy, orbital population, and d-band center reveal that the trend and origin of catalytic activity are intrinsically determined by the d-band center of metal sites. The thermodynamic and dynamic stability simulations demonstrate that the active metal centers are firmly anchored on BP substrate with intact M-P bonds. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the rational design of BP-based SACs toward promising multifunctional activity.},

  abstract = {Cahn introduced the concept of wall energy to describe the interaction between two immiscible fluids and a solid wall [J. W. Cahn, J. Chem. Phys. 66 , 3667–3672 (1977)]. This quintessential concept has been successfully applied to describe various wetting phenomena of a droplet in contact with a solid surface. The usually formulated wall free energy results in the so-called surface composition that is not equal to the bulk composition. This composition difference leads to a limited range of contact angles which can be achieved by the linear/high-order polynomial wall free energy. To address this issue and to improve the adaptability of the model, we symmetrically discuss the formulation of the wall free energy on the Young’s contact angle via Allen–Cahn model. In our model, we modify the calculation of the fluid-solid interfacial tensions according to the Cahn’s theory by considering the excess free energy contributed by the distorted composition profile induced by the surface effect. Additionally, we propose a semi-obstacle wall free energy which enforces the surface composition to be the bulk composition within the framework of bulk obstacle potential. By this way, the accuracy of the contact angle close to 0° and 180° is significantly improved in the phase-field simulations. We further reveal that the volume preservation term in the conservative Allen–Cahn model has a more significant impact on the wetting behavior on superhydrophobic surfaces than on hydrophilic surfaces, which is attributed to the curvature effect. Our findings provide alternative insights into wetting behavior on superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces.},

  abstract = {Highly acidic protic ionic liquids (PILs) are promising materials for potential electrochemical applications due to their high proton conductivity and excellent thermal stability. Still, little is known about the correlation between charge transport and structural dynamics as well as the proton transport mechanism despite the large body of literature on this topic. Here, we have examined the charge transport and structural dynamics by employing broadband dielectric spectroscopy in two highly acidic PILs in their supercooled liquid and glassy states, which included the same anion [TfO] − and different cations, [Tau] + vs [Ahs] + . Unlike many other ionic liquids, the conductivity relaxation time τ e of two studied PILs is substantially faster than the structural relaxation time τ α . The decoupling behavior between charge transport and structural dynamics of two materials, which is manifested by a decoupling index R τ , varies between 0.3 and 2.3 over the temperature range above T g . Moreover, “Walden” plots of the molar conductivity vs the viscosity qualify both compounds as “Super ILs.” All findings support the physical picture of large, polar, and orientationally correlated ion clusters, where the slow α -relaxation can be identified as structural relaxation associated with cooperative reorientations of the cluster macrodipole. In contrast, the shortest timescale for diffusive charge transport, τ e , is 1–2 decades shorter than τ α , implying that proton hopping is triggered by “single particle” (ions or ion pair) rotations and jumps on a sub-length scale of the cluster size, a dynamics being present even in the glassy state as indicated by a strong β -relaxation. These results demonstrate the practicality of employing highly acidic PILs in electrochemical fields.},

Using a static electric field has been shown to access physical aging above the glass transition temperature T g , in the regime of milliseconds or faster, but the relation to its temperature jump counterpart has not been investigated to date. This work compares temperature and field induced physical aging in the limit of small perturbations for supercooled tributyl phosphate. It is found that both structural recovery dynamics are very similar, and that they match the collective reorientational dynamics as observed by dielectric relaxation. The results facilitate expanding the range of aging experiments to well above T g , where a comparison with structural relaxation in equilibrium is straightforward, thus improving models of structural recovery and physical aging.},

In this paper, I propose a new equation of state (EOS) in the form of an analytical expression for the excess Helmholtz free energy of an exp-6 fluid. The EOS is based on extensive Monte Carlo simulations and therefore combines the excellent accuracy of the simulations with the numerical efficiency of a polynomial expression. The mean relative error in compressibility factor and internal energy is 0.14\% and 0.25\% respectively, which is a significant improvement over statistical mechanical theories. The EOS was implemented into a thermochemical code in order to optimize gas parameters and evaluate its performance on pure gas data, shock compression and detonation properties. Predicted gas densities, heat capacities and speed of sound for pure gases were generally within experimental uncertainties at pressures up to 1 GPa and temperatures above 300 K. For polar molecules, a simple free energy correction was introduced which greatly improved accuracy at low temperature. Calculated shock Hugoniots showed excellent agreement with experimental values up to 150 GPa and 10 000 K, and the detonation performance was accurately predicted for a number of different types of explosives.},

By employing the time-dependent density functional theory method, we investigate HHG of carbonyl sulfide molecules using a combination of a linear polarized infrared (IR) laser and a weaker orthogonal Terahertz (THz) field. Our findings show that by adjusting the amplitude of the THz field, the movement scale of electrons in the THz direction can be tuned, thereby one can control the harmonic intensity in the IR laser direction. This method allows for the creation of near-circularly polarized attosecond pulses. Furthermore, the ellipticity of the attosecond pulse may be changed by modifying the carrier-envelope phase of the IR laser pulse.},

The calculations predicted the existence of two planar PPA conformers, differing in the arrangement of the carboxylic group. The higher-energy trans -PPA conformer has a negligible population in the gas phase at room temperature and was prepared in situ in the N 2 cryomatrix through vibrationally-induced rotamerization of the lower-energy cis -PPA conformer, achieved using selective narrowband infrared excitation of the OH stretching coordinate of the latter species. Broadband UV ( λ &gt; 235 nm) irradiation of matrix-isolated cis -PPA was also undertaken, leading to the observation of c is -PPA → trans -PPA isomerization. No other UV-induced photoreactions were observed. The in situ generated trans -PPA conformer was found to decay back to cis -PPA in the dark by tunneling, and its lifetimes under different experimental conditions were determined. The assignment of the infrared spectra of both conformers is presented, considerably extending the vibrational information available on this molecule.},

  abstract = {Modeling environments that are not in local thermal equilibrium, such as protoplanetary disks or planetary atmospheres, with molecular spectroscopic data from space telescopes requires knowledge of the rate coefficients of rovibrationally inelastic molecular collisions. Here, we present such rate coefficients in a temperature range from 10 to 500 K for collisions of CO 2 with He atoms in which CO 2 is (de)excited in the bend mode. They are obtained from numerically exact coupled-channel (CC) calculations as well as from calculations with the less demanding coupled-states approximation (CSA) and the vibrational close-coupling rotational infinite-order sudden (VCC-IOS) method. All of the calculations are based on a newly calculated accurate ab initio four-dimensional CO 2 –He potential surface including the CO 2 bend ( ν 2 ) mode. We find that the rovibrationally inelastic collision cross sections and rate coefficients from the CSA and VCC-IOS calculations agree to within 50\% with the CC results at the rotational state-to-state level, except for the smaller ones and in the low energy resonance region, and to within 20\% for the overall vibrational quenching rates except for temperatures below 50 K where resonances provide a substantial contribution. Our CC quenching rates agree with the most recent experimental data within the error bars. We also compared our results with data from Clary et al. calculated in the 1980s with the CSA [A. J. Banks and D. C. Clary, J. Chem. Phys. 86 , 802 (1987)] and VCC-IOS [D. C. Clary, J. Chem. Phys. 78 , 4915 (1983)] methods and a simple atom-atom model potential based on ab initio Hartree–Fock calculations and found that their cross sections agree fairly well with ours for collision energies above 500 cm −1 , but that the inclusion of long range attractive dispersion interactions is crucial to obtain reliable cross sections at lower energies and rate coefficients at lower temperatures.},

  abstract = {Endohedral fullerenes, or endofullerenes, are chemical systems of fullerene cages encapsulating single atoms or small molecules. These species provide an interesting challenge of Potential Energy Surface determination as examples of non-covalently bonded, bound systems. While the majority of studies focus on C 60 as the encapsulating cage, introducing some anisotropy by using a different fullerene, e.g., C 70 can unveil a double well potential along the unique axis. By approximating the potential as a pairwise Lennard-Jones (LJ) summation over the fixed C cage atoms, the parameter space of the Hamiltonian includes three tunable variables: ( M , ɛ , σ ) representing the mass of the trapped species, the LJ energy, and length scales respectively. Fixing the mass and allowing the others to vary can imitate the potentials of endohedral species trapped in more elongated fullerenes. We choose to explore the LJ parameter space of an endohedral atom in C 70 with ɛ ∈ [20, 150 cm −1 ], and σ ∈ [2.85, 3.05 Å]. As the barrier height and positions of these wells vary between [1, 264 cm −1 ] and [0.35, 0.85 Å] respectively, using a 3D direct product basis of 1D harmonic oscillator (HO) wavefunctions centred at the origin where there is a local maximum is unphysical. Instead we propose the use of a non-orthogonal basis set, using 1D HO wavefunctions centred in each minimum and compare this to other choices. The ground state energy of the X@C 70 is tracked across the LJ parameter space, along with its corresponding nuclear translational wavefunctions. A classification of the wavefunction characteristics, namely the prolateness and “peanut-likeness” based on its statistical moments is also proposed. Excited states of longer fullerenes are assigned quantum numbers, and the fundamental transitions of Ne@C 70 are tracked across the parameter space.},

  abstract = {The largest ever set, RotGT-2023, of statistically validated experimental components of rotational g tensors and respective vibrational corrections, has been created. The experimental values were collected from literature data. The vibrational corrections for obtaining equilibrium molecular g values have been calculated at the highest affordable coupled cluster level of theory. The set comprises 278 parameters from 129 molecules, including their isotopologues. Statistical assessment of the data has been performed to exclude unreliable parameters. A benchmarking of two theoretical approximations, based on coupled cluster and density functional theories, has been performed. The determined weighted mean and weighted standard deviations of the relative errors in calculated equilibrium g values are 1.09\% and 2.07\% for the ae-CCSD(T)/x2c-TZVPPall-s//ae-CCSD(T)/cc-pwCVTZ level. The obtained results can be used for predicting the rotational Zeeman effect, correcting rotational constants in spectroscopic studies and in molecular structure refinements. The latter has been demonstrated on the refinement of the molecular structure of silane SiH 4 , which resulted in r e se (Si–H) = 1.473 323 1(27) Å. The other tested theoretical protocol, PBE0/x2c-TZVPPall-s//PBE0-D3BJ/def2-QZVPP, showed considerably worse statistical properties. The RotGT-2023 data set and the developed in this work statistical model are recommended for benchmarking of theoretical approximations for calculations of molecular magnetic properties.},

  abstract = {We present an IR-PD study of tantalum cluster adsorbate complexes [Ta n (N 2 ) m ] + , abbreviated (n,m), n = 5–8. We utilize infrared spectroscopy of isolated and size selected clusters as prepared and characterized by a cryogenic tandem ion trap setup, and we augment our experiments with quantum chemical simulations at the level of density functional theory. The cluster adsorbate complexes (n,m) reveal vibrational bands above 2000 cm −1 , which indicate end-on coordinated μ 1 -N 2 oscillators, and bands below 2000 cm −1 , which indicate side-on μ 2 -κN:κN,N coordinated ones. We observe a general increase in spectral complexity and an inhomogeneous broadening, mainly towards the red, at certain points of N 2 loading m, which originates from an increasingly higher amount of double and triple N 2 coordination at Ta sites, eventually at all of them. Other than the small tantalum clusters Ta n + , n = 2–4, the IR-PD spectra of the initial N 2 adsorbate species (n,1), n = 5–8, provide strong evidence for a lack of spontaneous N 2 cleavage. Spontaneous N 2 cleavage by Ta n + , n = 5–8, seems suppressed. Therefore, the ability of a small Ta cluster to cleave dinitrogen disappears with one more tantalum core atom. The study of stepwise N 2 adsorption on size selected Ta n + , n = 5–8 clusters revealed adsorption limits m (max) of [Ta n (N 2 ) m ] + that are independent of cluster size within this size range. Cryo-adsorption kinetics at 26 K allowed for kinetic fits to consecutive N 2 adsorption steps, and the fits revealed significant N 2 desorption rates upon higher N 2 loads, and the cluster adsorbate complexes eventually reached equilibrium. Some enhanced N 2 desorption rates point towards likely adsorbate shell reorganization, and there is also some evidence for the coexistence of isomeric cluster adsorbate complexes.},

A dataset of beyond-Voigt line-shape parameters (pressure broadening and shifting parameters, their speed dependencies, and the complex Dicke parameters) has been theoretically determined for the first time from generalized spectroscopic cross-section calculated by the full quantum scattering calculations. Then these parameters were employed to predict the line shape and asymmetry based on the partially-correlated speed-dependent hard-collision and the partially-correlated quadratic-speed-dependent hard-collision profiles. The effect of each parameter on the line shape and line asymmetry was further studied, which revealed that the beyond-Voigt effects were indispensable to accurately describe the line shape contour. Our results are in good agreement with the available experimental observations and provide a comprehensive set of theoretical references for further experimental measurements.},

  abstract = {Accurate description of electronic excited states of high-spin molecular species is a yet unsolved problem in modern electronic structure theory. A composite computational scheme developed in the present work contributes to solving this task for a challenging case of lanthanide-containing molecules. In the scheme, the highest-spin states whose wavefunctions are dominated by a single Slater determinant are described at the single-reference (SR) CCSD(T) level, whereas the lower-spin states, being inherently multiconfigurational in their nature, are treated with multireference (MR) methods, MRCI and/or CASPT2. An original technique which scales MR results against SR CCSD(T) ones to improve the accuracy in the former is proposed and examined, taking the example of 12 electronic states of gadolinium monoxide, X 9 Σ − , Y 7 Σ − , A′ 9 Δ, A 1 ′ 7 Δ, A 9 Π, A 1 7 Π, B 9 Σ − , B 1 7 Σ − , C 9 Π, C 1 7 Π, D 9 Σ − , and D 1 7 Σ − , up to 35 000 cm −1 . A multitude of the corresponding Ω (spin-coupled) states was then studied within the state-interacting approach employing the full Breit–Pauli spin–orbit coupling operator with CASSCF-generated ΛS states as a basis. For all ΛS and Ω states, the Gd–O bond lengths, spectroscopic constants ω e , ω e x e , α e , and adiabatic excitation energies are obtained. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data, with deviations in excitation energies not exceeding 350 cm −1 (1 kcal/mol). The spectroscopic properties of the yet unobserved electronic states, A′ 9 Δ, A 1 ′ 7 Δ, C 9 Π, C 1 7 Π, D 9 Σ − , and D 1 7 Σ − , are evaluated for the first time.},

We utilize infrared photon dissociation (IR-PD) spectroscopy of isolated and size selected clusters under cryogenic conditions within a buffer gas filled ion trap, and we augment our experiments by quantum chemical simulations (at DFT level). All Ta n + clusters, n = 2–4, seem to cleave N 2 efficiently. We confirm and extend a previous study under ambient conditions on Ta 2 + cluster [Geng et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 115 , 11680–11687 (2018)]. Our cryo studies and the concomitant DFT simulations of the tantalum trimer Ta 3 + suggest cleavage of the first and activation of the second and third N 2 molecule across surmountable barriers and along much-involved multidimensional reaction paths. We unravel the underlying reaction processes and the intermediates involved. The study of the N 2 adsorbate complexes of Ta 4 + presented here extends our earlier study and previously published spectra from (4,m), m = 1–5 [Fries et al. , Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 23 (19), 11345–11354 (2021)], up to m = 12. We confirm the priory published double activation and nitride formation, succeeded by single side-on N 2 coordination. Significant red shifts of IR-PD bands from these side-on coordinated μ 2 -κN:κN,N N 2 ligands correlate with the degree of tilting towards the second coordinating Ta center. All subsequently attaching N 2 adsorbates onto Ta 4 + coordinate in an end-on fashion, and we find clear evidence for co-existence of end-on coordination isomers. The study of stepwise N 2 adsorption revealed adsorption limits m (max) of [Ta n (N 2 ) m ] + which increase with n, and kinetic fits revealed significant N 2 desorption rates upon higher N 2 loads.

  abstract = {Polariton chemistry may provide a new means to control molecular reactivity, permitting remote, reversible modification of reaction energetics, kinetics, and product yields. A considerable body of experimental and theoretical work has already demonstrated that strong coupling between a molecular vibrational mode and the confined electromagnetic field of an optical cavity can alter chemical reactivity without external illumination. However, the mechanisms underlying cavity-altered chemistry remain unclear in large part because the experimental systems examined previously are too complex for detailed analysis of their reaction dynamics. Here, we experimentally investigate photolysis-induced reactions of cyanide radicals with strongly-coupled chloroform (CHCl 3 ) solvent molecules and examine the intracavity rates of photofragment recombination, solvent complexation, and hydrogen abstraction. We use a microfluidic optical cavity fitted with dichroic mirrors to facilitate vibrational strong coupling (VSC) of the C–H stretching mode of CHCl 3 while simultaneously permitting optical access at visible wavelengths. Ultrafast transient absorption experiments performed with cavities tuned on- and off-resonance reveal that VSC of the CHCl 3 C–H stretching transition does not significantly modify any measured rate constants, including those associated with the hydrogen abstraction reaction. This work represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental study of an elementary bimolecular reaction under VSC. We discuss how the conspicuous absence of cavity-altered effects in this system may provide insights into the mechanisms of modified ground state reactivity under VSC and help bridge the divide between experimental results and theoretical predictions in vibrational polariton chemistry.},

In our research, we delve into the placement of these states utilizing a hybrid density functional theory (DFT) combined with spin–orbit coupling (SOC) via the supercell method. Additionally, we scrutinize the transition energy, applying the constrained density functional theory (cDFT) approach in conjunction with the ΔSCF method. Our study illustrates that the synergy of cDFT and SOC generates a discrepancy of about 2\% for Ce1 and 4\% for Ce2 when comparing the calculated results to experimental data. Moreover, We have determined the positions of the 4f ground states to be 2.73 eV above the Valence Band Maximum (VBM) for Ce1 and 2.70 eV for Ce2. We also note a tight correlation between the 5d levels identified in the experimental data and the theoretical outcomes derived from wave function calculations at the CASPT2 accuracy level.},

  abstract = {Cavity coupling of gas-phase molecules will enable studies of benchmark chemical processes under strong light–matter interactions with a high level of experimental control and no solvent effects. We recently demonstrated the formation of gas-phase molecular polaritons by strongly coupling bright ν 3 , J = 3 → 4 rovibrational transitions of methane (CH 4 ) to a Fabry–Pérot optical cavity mode inside a cryogenic buffer gas cell. Here, we further explore the flexible capabilities of this infrastructure. We show that we can greatly increase the collective coupling strength of the molecular ensemble to the cavity by increasing the intracavity CH 4 number density. In doing so, we can tune from the single-mode coupling regime to a multimode coupling regime in which many nested polaritonic states arise as the Rabi splitting approaches the cavity mode spacing. We explore polariton formation for cavity geometries of varying length, finesse, and mirror radius of curvature. We also report a proof-of-principle demonstration of rovibrational gas-phase polariton formation at room temperature. This experimental flexibility affords a great degree of control over the properties of molecular polaritons and opens up a wider range of simple molecular processes to future interrogation under strong cavity-coupling. We anticipate that ongoing work in gas-phase polaritonics will facilitate convergence between experimental results and theoretical models of cavity-altered chemistry and physics.},

  abstract = {Second-order nonlinear spectroscopy is becoming an increasingly important technique in the study of interfacial systems owing to its marked ability to study molecular structures and interactions. The properties of such a system under investigation are contained within their intrinsic second-order susceptibilities which are mapped onto the measured nonlinear signals (e.g. sum-frequency generation) through the applied experimental settings. Despite this yielding a plethora of information, many crucial aspects of molecular systems typically remain elusive, for example the depth distributions, molecular orientation and local dielectric properties of its constituent chromophores. Here, it is shown that this information is contained within the phase of the measured signal and, critically, can be extracted through measurement of multiple nonlinear pathways (both the sum-frequency and difference-frequency output signals). Furthermore, it is shown that this novel information can directly be correlated to the characteristic vibrational spectra, enabling a new type of advanced sample characterization and a profound analysis of interfacial molecular structures. The theory underlying the different contributions to the measured phase of distinct nonlinear pathways is derived, after which the presented phase disentanglement methodology is experimentally demonstrated for model systems of self-assembled monolayers on several metallic substrates. The obtained phases of the local fields are compared to the corresponding phases of the nonlinear Fresnel factors calculated through the commonly used theoretical model, the three-layer model. It is found that, despite its rather crude assumptions, the model yields remarkable similarity to the experimentally obtained values, thus providing validation of the model for many sample classes.},

The assumptions of the underlying theory and a brief derivation of the main equation have been provided preliminarily for completeness and notational consistency. The resulting formulae for the Gibbs free energy of mixing and the chemical potentials are multivariate polynomials with physically meaningful coefficients and the mole fractions of the components as variables. With one additional assumption about the relative magnitudes of the solvent–solute and solute–solute interaction exchange energies, combining rules were obtained that express the mixed coefficients of the polynomial in terms of its pure coefficients. This was done by exploiting the mathematical structure of the asymmetric form of the solvent chemical potential equation. The combining rules allow one to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the solvent with multiple solutes from binary mixture data only (i.e., each solute with the solvent), and hence, are of practical importance. Furthermore, a connection was established between the osmotic virial coefficients derived in this work and the original osmotic virial coefficients of Hill found by employing a different procedure, illustrating the equivalency of what appears to be two different theories. A validation of the combining rules derived here has been provided in a separate paper where they were successfully used to predict the freezing points of ternary salt solutions of water.},

  abstract = {Ligand-decorated metal surfaces play a pivotal role in various areas of chemistry, particularly in selective catalysis. Molecular dynamics simulations at the molecular mechanics level of theory are best adapted to gain complementary insights to experiments regarding the structure and dynamics of such organic films. However, standard force fields tend to capture only weak physisorption interactions. This is inadequate for ligands that are strongly adsorbed such as carboxylates on metal surfaces. To address this limitation, we employ the Gaussian Lennard-Jones (GLJ) potential, which incorporates an attractive Gaussian potential between the surface and ligand atoms. Here, we develop this approach for the interaction between cobalt surfaces and carboxylate ligands. The accuracy of the GLJ approach is validated through the analysis of the interaction of oxygen with two distinct cobalt surfaces. The accuracy of this method reaches a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of about 3 kcal/mol across all probed configurations, which corresponds to a percentage error of roughly 4\%. Application of the GLJ force field to the dynamics of the organic layer on these surfaces reveals how the ligand concentration influences the film order, and highlights differing mobility in the x and y directions, attributable to surface corrugation on Co(11 2 ̄ 0 ⁠ ). GLJ is versatile, suitable for a broad range of metal/ligand systems, and can, subsequently, be utilized to study the organic film on the adsorption/desorption of reactants and products during a catalytic process.},

It has been proposed that information about the fermionic limit might be obtained by calculations within the bosonic sector ξ &gt; 0 combined with an extrapolation throughout the fermionic sector ξ &lt; 0, essentially bypassing the sign problem. Here, we show how the inclusion of the artificial parameter ξ can be interpreted as an effective penalty on the formation of permutation cycles in the PIMC simulation. We demonstrate that the proposed extrapolation method breaks down for moderate to high quantum degeneracy. Instead, the method constitutes a valuable tool for the description of large Fermi-systems of weak quantum degeneracy. This is demonstrated for electrons in a 2D harmonic trap and for the uniform electron gas (UEG), where we find excellent agreement ( ∼ 0.5\% ) with exact configuration PIMC results in the high-density regime while attaining a speed-up exceeding 11 orders of magnitude. Finally, we extend the idea beyond the energy and analyze the radial density distribution (2D trap), as well as the static structure factor and imaginary-time density–density correlation function (UEG).},

  abstract = {Orbital-Free Density-Functional Theory (OF-DFT) is known to represent a promising alternative to the standard Kohn-Sham (KS) DFT, as it relies on the electron density alone, without the need to calculate all KS single-particle orbitals and energies. Here, we investigate the behavior of the main ingredients of this theory, which are the non-interacting kinetic-energy density (KED) and the Pauli potential, for metal slabs. We derive explicit density functionals for these quantities in the quantum limit where all electrons are in the same slab discrete level of energy, and we present numerical calculations beyond this quantum limit for slabs of various widths. We have found the first explicit KED functional for a realistic many-particle fermionic system, which we prove to be generally valid with no assumption about the KS potential. We also discuss the total non-interacting kinetic energy and the corresponding enhancement factor, which represent basic quantities for the practical implementation of OF-DFT.},

  abstract = {Rare events include many of the most interesting transformation processes in condensed matter, from phase transitions to biomolecular conformational changes to chemical reactions. Access to the corresponding mechanisms, free-energy landscapes and kinetic rates can in principle be obtained by different techniques after projecting the high-dimensional atomic dynamics on one (or a few) collective variable. Even though it is well-known that the projected dynamics approximately follows – in a statistical sense – the generalized, underdamped or overdamped Langevin equations (depending on the time resolution), to date it is nontrivial to parameterize such equations starting from a limited, practically accessible amount of non-ergodic trajectories. In this work we focus on Markovian, underdamped Langevin equations, that arise naturally when considering, e.g., numerous water-solution processes at sub-picosecond resolution. After contrasting the advantages and pitfalls of different numerical approaches, we present an efficient parametrization strategy based on a limited set of molecular dynamics data, including equilibrium trajectories confined to minima and few hundreds transition path sampling-like trajectories. Employing velocity autocorrelation or memory kernel information for learning the friction and likelihood maximization for learning the free-energy landscape, we demonstrate the possibility to reconstruct accurate barriers and rates both for a benchmark system and for the interaction of carbon nanoparticles in water.},

  abstract = {Computational optimal transport is used to analyze the difference between pairs of continuous molecular spectra. It is demonstrated that transport distances which are derived from this approach may be a more appropriate measure of the difference between two continuous spectra than more familiar measures of distance under many common circumstances. Associated with the transport distances is the transport map which provides a detailed analysis of the difference between two molecular spectra and is a key component of our study of quantitative differences between two continuous spectra. The use of optimal transport for comparing molecular spectra is developed in detail here with a set of model spectra, so that the discussion is self-contained. The difference between the transport distance and more common definitions of distance is elucidated for some well-chosen examples and it is shown where transport distances may be very useful alternatives to standard definitions of distance. The transport distance between a theoretical and experimental electronic absorption spectrum for SO 2 is studied and it is shown how the theoretical spectrum can be modified to fit the experimental spectrum better adjusting the theoretical band origin and the resolution of the theoretical spectrum. This analysis includes the calculation of transport maps between the theoretical and experimental spectra suggesting future applications of the methodology.},

  abstract = {We numerically examine the driven transport of an overdamped self-propelled particle through a two-dimensional array of circular obstacles. A detailed analysis of transport quantifiers (mobility and diffusivity) has been performed for two types of channels, channel I and channel II, that respectively correspond to the parallel and diagonal drives with respect to the array axis. Our simulation results show that the signatures of pinning actions and depinning processes in the array of obstacles are manifested through excess diffusion peaks or sudden drops in diffusivity, and abrupt jumps in mobility with varying amplitude of the drive. The underlying depinning mechanisms and the associated threshold driving strength largely depend on the persistent length of self-propulsion. For low driving strength, both diffusivity and mobility are noticeably suppressed by the array of obstacles, irrespective of the self-propulsion parameters and direction of the drive. When self-propulsion length is larger than a channel compartment size, transport quantifiers are insensitive to the rotational relaxation time. Transport with diagonal drives features self-propulsion-dependent negative differential mobility. The amplitude of the negative differential mobility of an active particle is much larger than that of a passive one. The present analysis aims at understanding the driven transport of active species like, bacteria, virus, Janus particle etc. in porous medium.},

In this work, we overcome this limitation by a fully DFT variationally optimized, adaptive minimal basis set consistently available for the elements up to radon ( Z = 86). The new key feature is to make the linear coefficients of the primitive Gaussians in a contracted AO dependent on the effective atomic charge of the atom in the molecule, i.e., each symmetry-unique atom obtains its “own” specifically adapted basis functions. In this way, the physically important “breathing” of the AOs in a molecule with (a) atomic charge (expansion/contraction for anionic/cationic states) and (b) the number of close-lying bonded neighbor atoms is accounted for. The required atomic charges are obtained from a specially developed extended Hückel type Hamiltonian and the coordination numbers from the molecule geometry. Proper analytical derivatives of the resulting adaptive basis functions can easily be derived. Moreover, the basis functions are electric field-dependent, thus improving the description of, e.g., dipole moments and polarizabilities. The new basis set termed q-vSZP (charge dependent valence single- ζ , polarized) is thoroughly benchmarked for atomic/molecular and thermochemical properties compared to standard minimal and double- ζ basis sets at the DFT level with the accurate ω B97X-D4 functional. It is shown that q-vSZP is clearly superior to existing minimal basis sets, often reaching double- ζ quality or even better results. We expect it to be the optimal choice in future semiempirical quantum mechanical methods.},

The lift force is zero when the viscoelastic layer is not deformed, but becomes non-zero when it is deformed. We calculate the lift force by considering both the tangential stress and the normal stress applied at the surface of the viscoelastic layer. Our analysis indicates that as the layer changes from the elastic limit to the viscous limit, the lift force decreases with the decrease of the Deborah number (De). For small De, the effect of the layer elasticity is taken over by the surface tension and the lift force can become negative. We also show that the tangential stress and the interface slip velocity (the surface velocity relative to the substrate), which have been ignored in the previous analysis, give important contributions to the lift force. Especially for thin elastic layers, they give dominant contributions to the lift force.},

In recent years, this question has regained some interest in light of Stochastic Density Field Theory (SDFT) – an analytical framework that allows the approximate determination of density correlations in fluctuating systems. In spite of the success of this theory to describe dilute electrolytes, its extension to concentrated solutions raises a number of technical difficulties, and requires simplified descriptions of the short-range repulsion between the ions. In this article, we discuss recent approximations that were proposed to compute the conductivity of electrolytes, in particular truncations of Coulomb interactions at short distances. We extend them to another observable (the self-diffusion coefficient of the ions) and compare them to earlier analytical approaches, such as the mean spherical approximation and mode-coupling theory. We show how the treatment of hydrodynamic effects in SDFT can be improved, that the choice of the modified Coulomb interactions significantly affects the determination of the properties of the electrolytes, and that comparison with other theories provides a guide to extend SDFT approaches in this context.},

The FF parameters of short-range valence interactions can be derived through Quantum Mechanical (QM) calculations on model systems practical for QM (&lt;300 atoms). Similarly, the dynamic electrostatic interactions can be described with methods such as QEq or PQEq that allow charges and polarization to adjust dynamically. However, accurately extracting long-range van der Waals (vdW) interactions from QM calculations poses challenges due to the absence of a definitive method to distinguish between the different energetic components of electrostatics, polarization, vdW, hydrogen bonding, and valence interactions. To do this we use the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof flavor of Density Functional Theory, including empirical D3 vdW corrections, to predict the Equation of State for each element (keeping any covalent bonds fixed), from which we obtain the two-body vdW nonbond potential. Here, we extend these calculations to include non-bonded parameters for the N and O columns of the periodic table so that we now describe columns 15 (N), 16 (O), 17 (F), and 18 (Ne) of the periodic table. For these 20 elements, we find that the two-body vdW potentials can all be mapped to a single universal two-body curve, with just three scaling parameters: R e , D e , and L. We refer to this as the Universal NonBond (UNB) potential. We expect this to be useful for new MD simulations and a helpful starting point to obtain UNB parameters for the remainder of the periodic table.},

  abstract = {Field-theoretic simulations are numerical treatments of polymer field theory models that go beyond the mean-field self-consistent field theory level and have successfully captured a range of mesoscopic phenomena. Inherent in molecularly-based field theories is a “sign problem” associated with complex-valued Hamiltonian functionals. One route to field-theoretic simulations utilizes the complex Langevin (CL) method to importance sample complex-valued field configurations to bypass the sign problem. Although CL is exact in principle, it can be difficult to stabilize in strongly fluctuating systems. An alternate approach for blends or block copolymers with two segment species is to make a “partial saddle point approximation” (PSPA) in which the stiff pressure-like field is constrained to its mean-field value, eliminating the sign problem in the remaining field theory, allowing for traditional (real) sampling methods. The consequences of the PSPA are relatively unknown, and direct comparisons between the two methods are limited. Here, we quantitatively compare thermodynamic observables, order-disorder transitions, and periodic domain sizes predicted by the two approaches for a weakly compressible model of AB diblock copolymers. Using Gaussian fluctuation analysis, we validate our simulation observations, finding that the PSPA incorrectly captures trends in fluctuation corrections to certain thermodynamic observables, microdomain spacing, and location of order-disorder transitions. For incompressible models with contact interactions, we find similar discrepancies between the predictions of CL and PSPA, but these can be minimized by regularization procedures such as Morse calibration. These findings mandate caution in applying the PSPA to broader classes of soft-matter models and systems.},

While Paper II successfully captured translational motions in CG systems using a hard sphere mapping, the absence of rotational motions in single-site CG models introduces differences between FG and CG dynamics. In this third paper, our objective is to faithfully recover atomistic diffusion coefficients from CG dynamics by incorporating rotational dynamics. By extracting FG rotational diffusion, we unravel, for the first time reported to our knowledge, a universality in excess entropy scaling between the rotational and translational diffusion. Once the missing rotational dynamics are integrated into the CG translational dynamics, an effective translation-rotation coupling becomes essential. We propose two different approaches for estimating this coupling parameter: the rough hard sphere theory with acentric factor (temperature-independent) or the rough Lennard-Jones model with CG attractions (temperature-dependent). Altogether, we demonstrate that FG diffusion coefficients can be recovered from CG diffusion coefficients by (1) incorporating “entropy-free” rotational diffusion with translation-rotation coupling and (2) recapturing the missing entropy. Our findings shed light on the fundamental relationship between FG and CG dynamics in molecular fluids.},

Detailed quantitative analysis based on the macroscopic energy balance around the dynamic CL showed that the internal energy change of the fluid due to the change of the potential field along the pathline out of the solid–liquid interface induced a remarkable temperature drop around the receding CL, in a manner similar to latent heat upon phase changes. This result provides new insights for modeling the dynamic CL, and the framework for heat transport analysis introduced here can be applied to a wide range of nanofluidic systems.},

  abstract = {Understanding how proteins work requires a thorough understanding of their internal dynamics. Proteins support a wide range of motions, from the femtoseconds to seconds time scale, relevant to crucial biological functions. In this context, the term “protein collective dynamics” refers to the complex patterns of coordinated motions of numerous atoms throughout the protein in the sub-picosecond time scale (terahertz frequency region). It is hypothesized that these dynamics have a substantial impact on the regulation of functional dynamical mechanisms, including ligand binding and allosteric signalling, charge transport direction, and the regulation of thermodynamic and thermal transport properties. Using the theoretical framework of hydrodynamics, the collective dynamics of proteins had previously been described in a manner akin to that of simple liquids, i.e. in terms of a single acoustic-like excitation, related to intra-protein vibrational motions. Here, we employ an interacting-mode model to analyse the results from molecular dynamics simulations and we unveil that the vibrational landscape of proteins is populated by multiple acoustic-like and low-frequency optic-like modes, with mixed symmetry and interfering with each other. We propose an interpretation at the molecular level of the observed scenario that we relate to the side-chains and the hydrogen-bonded networks dynamics. The present insights provide a perspective for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the energy redistribution processes in the interior of proteins.},

  abstract = {Classical theories of enzyme inhibition kinetics predict a monotonic decrease in the mean catalytic activity with the increase in inhibitor concentration. The steady-state result, derived from deterministic mass action kinetics, ignores molecular noise in enzyme-inhibition mechanisms. Here, we present a stochastic generalization of enzyme inhibition kinetics to mesoscopic enzyme concentrations by systematically accounting for molecular noise in competitive and uncompetitive mechanisms of enzyme inhibition. Our work reveals an activator-inhibitor duality as a non-classical effect in the transient regime in which inhibitors tend to enhance enzymatic activity. We introduce statistical measures that quantify this counterintuitive response through the stochastic analog of the Lineweaver–Burk plot that shows a merging of the inhibitor-dependent velocity with the Michaelis–Menten velocity. The statistical measures of mean and temporal fluctuations - fractional enzyme activity and waiting time correlations - show a non-monotonic rise with the increase in inhibitors before subsiding to their baseline value. The inhibitor and substrate dependence of the fractional enzyme activity yields kinetic phase diagrams for non-classical activator-inhibitor duality. Our work links this duality to a molecular memory effect in the transient regime, arising from positive correlations between consecutive product turnover times. The vanishing of memory in the steady state recovers all the classical results.},

This approach provides a more sensitive analysis of local order than traditional scalar BOPs, facilitating the identification of coherent domains at the single bond level. The present study expands the method initially developed for assemblies of anisotropic particles to the isotropic ones or cases where particle orientation information is unavailable. The SymBOP analysis was applied to experiments on DNA-frame-based assembly of nanoparticle lattices. It proved highly sensitive in identifying coherent crystalline domains with different orientations, as well as detecting topological defects, such as dislocations. Furthermore, the analysis distinguishes individual sublattices within a single crystalline domain, such as pair of interpenetrating FCC lattices within a cubic diamond. The results underscore the versatility and robustness of SymBOPs in characterizing ordering phenomena, making them valuable tools for investigating structural properties in various systems.},

The particles, which are “thermophilic,” move towards the laser spot solely because of thermophoresis with no convection effects, forming dense clusters whose structure is monitored using two order parameters that gauge the local density and the orientational ordering. We find that ordering takes place when the cluster reaches an average surface density that is still below the upper equilibrium limit for the fluid phase of hard disks, meaning that we do not detect any sign of a proper “two-stage” nucleation from a glass or a polymorphic crystal structure. The crystal obtained at late growth stage displays a remarkable uniformity with a negligible amount of defects, arguably because the incoming particles diffuse, bounce, and displace other particles before settling at the crystal interface. This “fluidization” of the outer crystal edge may resemble the surface enhanced mobility giving rise to ultra-stable glasses by physical vapor deposition.},

We report on the effect of switching ON-OFF of an asymmetric bistable potential to the mean first passage time (MFPT) of a probed particle to go from one potential minima to the other. Experimental results coupled with numerical simulations shows the potential becoming more symmetric at slow switching. Moreover, the MFPT deviates from equilibrium condition with an effective temperature, T eff &lt; T , at slow switching but approaches room temperature, T , at fast switching. For each switching rate, we quantify how far the system is from equilibrium by measuring deviation from a detailed balance like relation and the net circulation of flux present in phase-space.

We find that pectin induces intriguing structural changes in the electrolyte that disrupt large ionic aggregates and promote the formation of smaller ionic clusters, which is a promising finding for ionic conductivity. Due to pectin in [BMIM][PF 6 ] electrolytes, the diffusion coefficient of cations and anions is observed to decrease by a factor of four for a loading of 25 wt.\% of pectin in [BMIM][PF 6 ] electrolyte. A strong correlation between the ionic diffusivities ( D ) and ion-pair relaxation timescales ( τ c ) is observed such that D ∼ τ c −0.75 for cations and D ∼ τ c −0.82 for anions. The relaxation timescale exponents indicate that the ion transport mechanisms in pectin-[BMIM][PF 6 ] electrolytes are slightly distinct from those found in neat [BMIM][PF 6 ] electrolytes ( ⁠ D ∼ τ c − 1 ⁠ ). Since pectin marginally affects ionic diffusivities at the gain of smaller ionic aggregates and viscosity, our results suggest that pectin-ionic liquid electrolytes offer improved properties for battery applications, including ionic conductivity, mechanical stability, and biodegradability.},

This deficiency precludes the research community from implementing widespread benchmarking, which is essential for gaining insight into model performance and transferability, and also limits the development of more general, or even universal, IPs. To address this issue, we introduce the ColabFit Exchange, the first database providing open access to a large collection of systematically organized datasets from multiple domains that is especially designed for IP development. The ColabFit Exchange is publicly available at https://colabfit.org , providing a web-based interface for exploring, downloading, and contributing datasets. Composed of data collected from the literature or provided by community researchers, the ColabFit Exchange currently (September 2023) consists of 139 datasets spanning nearly 70 000 unique chemistries, and is intended to continuously grow. In addition to outlining the software framework used for constructing and accessing the ColabFit Exchange, we also provide analyses of the data, quantifying the diversity of the database and proposing metrics for assessing the relative diversity of multiple datasets. Finally, we demonstrate an end-to-end IP development pipeline, utilizing datasets from the ColabFit Exchange, fitting tools from the KLIFF software package, and validation tests provided by the OpenKIM framework.},

  abstract = {As conducting polymers become increasingly important in electronic devices, understanding their charge transport is essential for material and device development. Various semi-empirical approaches have been used to describe temporal charge carrier dynamics in these materials, but there have yet to be any theoretical approaches utilizing ab initio molecular dynamics. In this work, we develop a computational technique based on ab initio Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics to trace charge carrier temporal motion in archetypical conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). Particularly, we analyze charge dynamics in a single PEDOT chain and in two coupled chains with different degrees of coupling and study the effect of temperature. In our model we first initiate a positively charged polaron (compensated by a negative counterion) at one end of the chain, and subsequently displace the counterion to the other end of the chain and trace polaron dynamics in the system by monitoring bond length alternation in the PEDOT backbone and charge density distribution. We find that at low temperature (T = 1 K) the polaron distortion gradually disappears from its initial location and reappears near the new position of the counterion. At the room temperature (T = 300 K), we find that the distortions induced by polaron, and atomic vibrations are of the same magnitude, which makes tracking the polaron distortion challenging because it is hidden behind the temperature-induced vibrations. The novel approach developed in this work can be used to study polaron mobility along and between the chains, investigate charge transport in highly doped polymers, and explore other flexible polymers, including n-doped ones.},

The presetting of the protonation degree is a challenging task in the case of ionizable lipids since it depends on pH and on the local lipid environment and often lacks experimental validation. Here, we introduce a methodology of combining all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with experimental total-reflection x-ray fluorescence and scattering measurements for the ionizable lipid Dlin-MC3-DMA (MC3) in POPC monolayers. This joint approach allows us to simultaneously determine the lipid packing and the protonation degree of MC3.

  abstract = {Freezing of water under nanoconfinement exhibits physical peculiarities with respect to the bulk water. However, experimental observations are extremely challenging at this scale, which limits our understanding of the effect of confinement on water properties upon freezing. In this study, we use molecular dynamic simulations to investigate how confinement affects the kinetics of growth of ice and the thermodynamic equilibrium of ice-liquid coexistence. TIP4P/Ice water model and CSH-FF model were applied to simulate ice crystallization in a confined cement system at temperatures down to 220 K. We adapted an interface detection algorithm and reparameterized the CHILL/CHILL + algorithm to capture ice growth. The confinement leads to a shift of the maximum growth rate of ice to a higher temperature than for bulk water. Both the confinement and surface impurities contribute to slowing down the ice growth. For the ice-liquid coexistence at equilibrium, we derive a formulation of Thomson’s equation adapted to statistical physics quantities accessible by molecular simulation, and we show that this adapted equation predicts accurately the melting line of bulk and confined ice Ih as a function of pressure. The confinement decreases systematically the melting temperature of ice of about 5 K compared with bulk ice Ih. A premelted water film about 1 nm thick is observed between the solid wall and ice, and its thickness is found to decrease continuously as temperature is lowered. We note that the surface impurities are key to the formation of the premelted water nanofilm when the temperature is lower than 250 K.},

  abstract = {We examine the aggregation behavior of AuNPs of different sizes on graphene as function of temperature using molecular dynamic simulations with Reax Force Field. In addition, the consequences of such aggregation on the morphology of AuNPs and the charge transfer behavior of AuNP-Graphene hybrid structure are analyzed. The aggregation of AuNPs on graphene is confirmed from the center of mass distance calculation. The simulation results indicate that the size of AuNPs and temperature significantly affect the aggregation behavior of AuNPs on graphene. The strain calculation showed that shape of AuNPs changes due to the aggregation and the smaller size AuNPs on graphene exhibit more shape changes than larger AuNPs at all the temperatures studies in this work. The charge transfer calculation reveals that, the magnitude of charge transfer is higher for larger AuNPs-graphene composite when compared with smaller AuNPs-graphene composite. The charge transfer trend and the trends seen in the number of Au atoms directly in touch with graphene are identical. Hence, our results conclude that, quantity of Au atoms directly in contact with graphene during aggregation is primarily facilitates charge transfer between AuNPs and graphene. Our results on the size dependent strain and charge transfer characteristics of AuNPs will aid in the development of AuNPs-graphene composites for sensor applications.},

  abstract = {Exciton transport in extended molecular systems and how to manipulate such transport in a complex environment are essential to many energy and optical-related applications. We investigate the mechanism of plasmon-coupled exciton transport by using the Pauli master equation approach, combined with kinetic rates derived from macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. Through our theoretical framework, we demonstrate that the presence of a silver nanorod induces significant frequency dependence in the ability of transporting exciton through a molecule chain, indicated by the exciton diffusion coefficient, due to the dispersive nature of the silver dielectric response. Compared with the same system in vacuum, great enhancement (up to a factor of 10 3 ) in the diffusion coefficient can be achieved by coupling the resonance energy transfer process to localized surface plasmon polariton modes of the nanorod. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the diffusion coefficients with the nearest-neighbor coupling approximation are ∼10 times smaller than the results obtained beyond this approximation, emphasizing the significance of long-range coupling in exciton transport influenced by plasmonic nanostructures. This study not only paves the way for exploring practical approaches to study plasmon-coupled exciton transport but also provides crucial insights for the design of innovative plasmon-assisted photovoltaic applications.},

  abstract = {The phase behavior and structural properties of hard anisotropic particles (prisms and dumbbells) are examined in one-dimensional channels using the Parsons–Lee (PL) theory, and the transfer-matrix and neighbor-distribution methods. The particles are allowed to move freely along the channel, while their orientations are constrained such that one particle can occupy only two or three different lengths along the channel. In this confinement setting, hard prisms behave as an additive mixture, while hard dumbbells behave as a non-additive one. We prove that all methods provide exact results for the phase properties of hard prisms, while only the neighbor-distribution and transfer-matrix methods are exact for hard dumbbells. This shows that non-additive effects are incorrectly included into the PL theory, which is a successful theory of the isotropic-nematic phase transition of rod-like particles in higher dimensions. In the one-dimensional channel, the orientational ordering develops continuously with increasing density, i.e., the system is isotropic only at zero density, while it becomes perfectly ordered at the close-packing density. We show that there is no orientational correlation in the hard prism system, while the hard dumbbells are orientationally correlated with diverging correlation length at close packing. On the other hand, positional correlations are present for all the systems, the associated correlation length diverging at close packing.},

The excitation energies and their variances allowed calculations of the solvent reorganization energies, reorganization free energies and reorganization entropies as functions of temperature. The entropies of solvent packing around the chromophore are found to make major contributions to the reorganization free energies. The variances of the excitation energies depend only weakly on temperature, in disagreement with an expression that is often used for solvent reorganization free energies. Polar solvents reduce the transition dipole strength of B30’s long-wavelength absorption band, probably because interactions with the solvent enhance the charge-transfer character of the transition. The dipole strength drops further at low temperatures.},

We find here that TIP4P/Ice water in solution with trehalose molecules follows the Mode Coupling Theory and undergoes a fragile to strong transition up to the highest concentration investigated, similar to the bulk. Moreover, we perform a Mode Coupling Theory test, showing that the Time Temperature Superposition principle holds for both bulk TIP4P/Ice water and for TIP4P/Ice water in the solutions and we calculate the exponents of the theory. The direct comparison of the dynamical results for bulk water and water in the solutions shows upon cooling along the isobar a fastening of water dynamics for lower temperatures, T &lt; 240 K. We found that the counter-intuitive behavior for the low temperature solutions can be explained with the diffusion anomaly of water leading us to the conclusion that the fastening observed below T = 240 K in water dynamics is only fictitious, due to the fact that the density of water molecules in the solutions is higher than the density of the bulk at the same temperature and pressure. This result should be taken into account in experimental investigations which are often carried out at constant pressure.},

Predictive accuracy is evaluated by comparing the model’s predictions with Monte Carlo simulations for various charged hard-sphere fluids. The assessment focuses on mean ionic activity coefficient, individual ionic activity coefficient, and osmotic coefficients. The results demonstrate good agreement between the model and simulations, indicating its success for different electrolyte systems. Incorporating ion-ion association improves accuracy compared to the DH theory.

  abstract = {Contrary to the case of solids and gases, where Debye theory and kinetic theory offer a good description for most of the physical properties, a complete theoretical understanding of the vibrational and thermodynamic properties of liquids is still missing. Liquids exhibit a vibrational density of states (VDOS) which does not obey Debye law, and a heat capacity which decreases monotonically with temperature, rather than growing as in solids. Despite many attempts, a simple, complete and widely accepted theoretical framework able to formally derive the aforementioned properties has not been found yet. Here, we revisit one of the theoretical proposals, and in particular we re-analyze the properties of liquids within the soft-potential model, originally formulated for glasses. We confirm that, at least at a qualitative level, many characteristic properties of liquids can be rationalized within this model. We discuss the validity of several phenomenological expressions proposed in the literature for the density of unstable modes, and in particular for its temperature and frequency dependence. We discuss the role of negative curvature regions and unstable modes as fundamental ingredients to have a linear in frequency VDOS. Finally, we compute the heat capacity within the soft potential model for liquids and we show that it decreases with temperature, in agreement with experimental and simulation data.},

Results showed the existence of three possible sticking configurations where the projectile atom can stick either to one, two or three atoms of the target fullerene. They also showed that although the two potentials give similar magnitudes for the sticking cross-sections, they yield fairly different results as far as sticking mechanisms and configurations at thermal collision-energies, i.e., in the range 0.05–0.5 eV, are concerned. While AIREBO, that takes into account the long-range Lennard-Jones interaction, essentially results in a surface-sticking configuration with a single atom of the target fullerene, SREBO potential yields both surface- and two neighbors-sticking (2N-sticking) configurations. The fullerene structure is preserved in the last configuration while it can be recovered by a 2000 K annealing in the former configuration. Results obtained with SREBO eventually showed larger sticking probabilities for C 36 as compared with C 80 . In spite of this, the sticking cross-sections obtained for C 80 are similar to or even larger than those obtained for C 36 due to the larger size of C 80 that compensates for its smaller sticking probabilities.},

The trans isomer is thermodynamically more stable than the cis , nevertheless the cis form can play a role in biopolymers’ function. The molecular system of N -methylacetamide · 2H 2 O is complex enough to reveal energetics of the cis-trans isomerization at coupled cluster single-double and coupled cluster single–double and perturbative triple [CCSD(T)] levels of theory. The cis-trans isomerization cannot be oversimplified by a rotation along ω , since this rotation is coupled with the N -atom pyramidal inversion, requesting the introduction of a second dihedral angle “ α .” Full f ( ω , α ) potential energy surfaces of the different amide protonation states, critical points and isomerization reaction paths were determined, and the barriers of the neutral, O -protonated and N -deprotonated amides were found too high to allow cis-trans interconversion at room temperature: ∼85, ∼140, and ∼110 kJ mol −1 , respectively. For the N -protonated amide bond, the cis form ( ω = 0°) is a maximum rather than a minimum, and each ω state is accessible for less than ∼10 kJ mol −1 . Here we outline a cis-trans isomerization pathway with a previously undescribed low energy transition state, which suggests that the proton is transferred from the more favorable O - to the N -protonation site with the aid of nearby water molecules, allowing the trans → cis transition to occur at an energy cost of ≤11.6 kJ mol −1 . Our results help to explain why isomerase enzymes operate via protonated amide bonds and how N- protonation of the peptide bond occurs via O -protonation.},

We experimentally demonstrate the method by reading out the ESR spectrum of nitrogen vacancy center electrons in diamond via readout of lattice 13 C nuclei. Spin-lock control on the 13 C nuclei yields a significantly enhanced signal-to-noise ratio for the nuclear readout. Spectrally mapped readout presents operational advantages in being background-free and immune to crystal orientation and optical scattering. We harness these advantages to demonstrate applications in underwater magnetometry. The physical basis for the “ one-to-many ” spectral map is itself intriguing. To uncover its origin, we develop a theoretical model that maps the system dynamics, involving traversal of a cascaded structure of Landau–Zener anti-crossings, to the operation of a tilted “ Galton board .” This work points to new opportunities for “ ESR-via-NMR ” in dilute electronic systems and in hybrid electron–nuclear quantum memories and sensors.},

A trianionic example, [ Cr ( C 2 O 4 ) 3 ] 3 − ⁠ , is of interest for constraining models linking Cr isotope ratios in rock samples to oxygen levels in Earth’s atmosphere over geological timescales. Here we describe how crowd sourcing can be used to carry out self-consistent Fermi–Löwdin–Orbital-Self-Interaction corrected calculations (FLOSIC) on this trianion in solution. The calculations give a physically correct description of the electronic structure of the trianion and water. In contrast, uncorrected local density approximation (LDA) calculations result in approximately half of the anion charge being transferred to the water bath due to the effects of self-interaction error. Use of group-theory and the intrinsic sparsity of the theory enables calculations roughly 125 times faster than our initial implementation in the large N limit reached here. By integrating charge density densities and Coulomb potentials over regions of space and analyzing core-level shifts of the Cr and O atoms as a function of position and functional, we unambiguously show that FLOSIC, relative to LDA, reverses incorrect solute-solvent charge transfer in the trianion-water complex. In comparison to other functionals investigated herein, including Hartree–Fock and the local density approximation, the FLOSIC Cr 1s eigenvalues provide the best agreement with experimental core ionization energies.},

We formulate a three-body collision rate constant based on the lifetimes of binary collisions and initialize three-body collisions by sampling the arrival time of a third body within the lifetimes of pre-simulated binary collisions. We use this method to calculate distributions of recombined product energies, probabilities of recombination, and recombination rate constants through different collision pathways. Long-lived binary atom-diatom collisions are observed, but are too rare to play a dominant role in the recombination process for shock-heated air near the equilibrium conditions studied. The resulting recombination rate constants are within an order of magnitude of the predictions of detailed balance. Notably, the recombination simulation framework does not appeal to the principle of detailed balance and could be useful for studying conditions far from equilibrium.},

  abstract = {In this paper we establish a connection between density functional theory (DFT) for lattice models and common real-space DFT. We consider the lattice DFT description of a two-level model subject to generic interactions in Mermin’s DFT formulation in the grand canonical ensemble at finite temperature. The case of only density–density and Hund’s rule interaction studied in earlier work is shown to be equivalent to an exact-exchange description of DFT in the real-space picture. In addition, we also include the so-called pair-hopping interaction which can be treated analytically and, crucially, leads to non-integer occupations of the Kohn–Sham (KS) levels even in the limit of zero temperature. Treating the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis is shown to be equivalent to our two-level lattice DFT model. By means of the fractional occupations of the KS orbitals (which, in this case, are identical to the many-body ones) we reproduce the results of full configuration interaction, even in the dissociation limit and without breaking the spin symmetry. Beyond the minimal basis, we embed our HOMO-LUMO model into a standard DFT calculation and, again, obtain results in overall good agreement with exact ones without the need of breaking the spin symmetry.},

  abstract = {We derive and implement an alternative formulation of the Stochastic Lanczos algorithm to be employed in connection with the Many-Body Dispersion model (MBD). Indeed, this formulation, which is only possible due to the Stochastic Lanczos’ reliance on matrix-vector products, introduces generalized dipoles and fields. These key quantities allow for a state-of-the-art treatment of periodic boundary conditions via the O ( N log ( N ) ) Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald (SPME) approach which uses efficient fast Fourier transforms. This SPME-Lanczos algorithm drastically outperforms the standard replica method which is affected by a slow and conditionally convergence rate that limits an efficient and reliable inclusion of long-range periodic boundary conditions interactions in many-body dispersion modelling. The proposed algorithm inherits the embarrassingly parallelism of the original Stochastic Lanczos scheme, thus opening up for a fully converged and efficient periodic boundary conditions treatment of MBD approaches.},

  abstract = {By employing a recently proposed Hubbard U density-corrected scheme within density functional theory, we provide design principles towards the design of materials exhibiting a spin crossover-assisted gas release. Small molecular fragments are used as case study to identify two main mechanisms behind the change in binding energy upon spin transitions. The feasibility of the proposed mechanism in porous crystals is assessed by correlating the change in binding energy of CO 2 , CO, N 2 , and H 2 , upon spin crossover, with the adiabatic energy difference associated with the spin state change of the square-planar metal in Hofmann-type clathrates (M = Fe, Mn, Ni). A few promising cases are identified for the adsorption of intermediate ligand field strength molecules such as N 2 and H 2 . The latter stands out as the most original result as the strong interaction in low spin, as expected from a Kubas mechanism, results in a large change in binding energy. This work provides a general perspective towards the engineering of open-metal site frameworks exhibiting local environments designed to have a spin crossover upon adsorption of specific gas molecules.},

Unfortunately, path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations of bosons are computationally prohibitive beyond ∼ 100 particles, due to a cubic scaling with the system size. We present an algorithm that reduces the complexity from cubic to quadratic, allowing the first simulations of thousands of bosons using PIMD. Our method is orders of magnitude faster, with a speedup that scales linearly with the number of particles and the number of imaginary time slices (beads). Simulations that would have otherwise taken decades can now be done in days. In practice, the new algorithm eliminates most of the added computational cost of including bosonic exchange effects, making them almost as accessible as PIMD simulations of distinguishable particles.},

  abstract = {Quantum-chemical calculations aimed at deriving magnetic coupling constants in exchange-coupled spin clusters commonly utilize a broken-symmetry (BS) approach. This involves calculating several distinct collinear spin configurations, predominantly by density-functional theory. The energies of these configurations are interpreted in terms of the Heisenberg model, H ̃ = ∑ i &lt; j J i j s ̃ i ⋅ s ̃ j ⁠ , to determine coupling constants J ij for spin pairs. However, this energy-based procedure has inherent limitations, primarily in its inability to provide information on isotropic spin interactions beyond those included in the Heisenberg model. Biquadratic exchange or multi-center terms, for example, are usually inaccessible and hence assumed to be negligible. The present work introduces a novel approach employing BS mean-field solutions, specifically Hartree–Fock wave functions, for the construction of effective spin Hamiltonians. This expanded method facilitates the extraction of a broader range of coupling parameters by considering not only the energies, but also Hamiltonian and overlap elements between different BS states. We demonstrate how comprehensive s = 1 2 Hamiltonians, including multi-center terms, can be straightforwardly constructed from a complete set of BS solutions. The approach is exemplified for small clusters within the context of the half-filled single-band Hubbard model. This allows to contrast the current strategy against exact results, thereby offering an enriched understanding of the spin-Hamiltonian construction from BS solutions.},

The topological features of the landscape play a crucial role in assessing the stability of resting states and the robustness/coherence of oscillations. We analyze the excitation characteristics in Class I and Class II neurons and establish their relation to biological function. Our findings reveal that the average curl flux and associated entropy production exhibit significant changes near bifurcation or phase transition points. Moreover, the curl flux and entropy production offer insights into the dynamical and thermodynamical origins of nonequilibrium phase transitions and exhibit distinct behaviors in Class I and Class II neurons.

  abstract = {Reliable prediction of the ground-state spin and magnetic coupling constants in transition-metal complexes is a well-known challenge for density functional theory (DFT). One popular strategy for addressing this long-standing issue involves the modification of the fraction of Fock exchange in a hybrid functional. Here we explore the viability of this approach using three polynuclear metal-organic complexes based on a Ni 4 O 4 cubane motif, having different ground state spin values (S = 0, 2, 4) owing to the use of different ligands. We systematically search for an optimum fraction of Fock exchange, across various global, range-separated, and double hybrid functionals. We find that for all functionals tested, at best there only exists a very narrow range of Fock exchange fractions which results in a correct prediction of the ground-state spin for all three complexes. The useful range is functional dependent, but general trends can be identified. Typically, at least two similar systems must be used in order to determine both an upper and lower limit of the optimal range. This is likely owing to conflicting demands of minimizing delocalization errors, which typically requires a higher percentage of Fock exchange, and addressing static correlation, which typically requires a lower one. Furthermore, we find that within the optimal range of Fock exchange, the sign and relative magnitude of Ni–Ni magnetic coupling constants are reasonably well reproduced, but there is still room for quantitative improvement in the prediction. Thus, the prediction of spin state and magnetic coupling in polynuclear complexes remains an ongoing challenge for DFT.},

In particular, when modelling sedimentation processes or systems with driven flows, it is important to accurately capture volume exclusion effects. This work applies Dynamic Density Functional Theory to the evolution of a particle density under diffusion, external forces, particle–particle interaction, and volume exclusion. Using a spectral element framework, for the first time it is possible to include all of these effects in dynamic simulations on complex domains. Moreover, this allows one to apply complicated no-flux, and other non-local, non-linear, boundary conditions. The methodology is also extended to control problems, addressing questions of how to enhance production set-up in industrially-motivated processes. In this work the relevant models are introduced, numerical methods are discussed, and several example problems are solved to demonstrate the methods’ versatility. It is shown that incorporating volume exclusion is crucial for simulation accuracy and we illustrate that the choice of boundary conditions significantly impacts the dynamics.},

Simulations of both droplet nucleation and interface roughness indicate that the nonequilibrium interfacial tension can either be increased or decreased relative to its equilibrium value, depending on whether the driven chemical reactions are accelerated or decelerated within the droplets.

It transforms the many-electron problem into a fictitious non-interacting electron problem, with the many-electron effects concealed within the exchange-correlation (XC) energy, which is expressed in terms of the electron density ρ ( r ). Unlike the wave function, ρ ( r ) can be viewed as a classical quantity, and expressing the XC energy in terms of it circumvents the need for correlated wave functions. In this work, we once again employ the re-quantization strategy and determine the XC energy using a local one-particle Schrödinger equation. The ground-state eigenfunction of the corresponding Hamiltonian is a reference point ( r ) dependent orbital φ r , σ ( u , σ ′) which is subsequently used to generate the XC hole and the XC energy. The spin coordinate is denoted by σ and u is the electron-electron separation. The one-particle equation for φ r , σ ( u , σ ′) includes a local potential v r , σ ( u , σ ′) that we approximate using two simple physical constraints. We assess the approximation by applying it to the helium iso-electronic series, the homogeneous electron gas, and the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule.},

Combining our data with literature data on the self-diffusion coefficient D s of water, we check the Stokes-Einstein relation which, based on hydrodynamics, predicts constancy of D s η / T , where T is the temperature. The observed temperature and pressure dependence of D s η / T is analogous to that obtained in simulations of a realistic water model.

  abstract = {Kinetic theory has long predicted that temperature inversion may happen in the vapor-phase for evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates, i.e., the vapor temperature at the condensation interface is higher than that at the evaporation interface. However, past studies have neglected transport in the liquid phases, which usually determine the evaporation and condensation rates. This disconnect has limited the acceptance of the kinetic theory in practical heat transfer models. In this paper, we combine interfacial conditions for mass and heat fluxes with continuum descriptions in the bulk regions of the vapor and the liquid phases to obtain a complete picture for the classical problem of evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates. The criterion for temperature inversion is rederived analytically. We also prove that the temperature jump at each interface is in the same direction as externally applied temperature difference, i.e., liquid surface is at a higher temperature than its adjacent vapor on the evaporating interface and at a lower temperature than its adjacent vapor on the condensing interface. We explain the interfacial temperature jump and temperature inversion using the interfacial cooling and heating processes, and we predict that this process can lead to a vapor phase temperature much lower than the lowest wall temperatures and much higher than the highest wall temperature imposed. When the latent heat of evaporation is small, we found that evaporation can happen at the low temperature side while condensation occurs at the high temperature side, opposing the temperature gradient.},

  abstract = {Chiral molecules can act as spin filters, preferentially transmitting electrons with spins polarized along their direction of travel, an effect known as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). In a typical experiment, injected electrons tunnel coherently through a layer of chiral material and emerge spin-polarized. It is also possible that spin polarization arises in radical pairs formed photochemically when electrons hop incoherently between donor and acceptor sites. Here we aim to identify the magnetic properties that would optimise the visibility of CISS polarization in time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of transient radical pairs without the need to orient or align their precursors. By simulating spectra of actual and model systems, we find that CISS contributions to the polarization should be most obvious when at least one of the radicals has small g -anisotropy and an inhomogeneous linewidth larger than the dipolar coupling of the two radicals. Under these conditions there is extensive cancellation of absorptive and emissive enhancements making the spectrum sensitive to small changes in the individual EPR line intensities. Although these cancellation effects are more pronounced at lower spectrometer frequencies, the spectral changes are easier to appreciate with the enhanced resolution afforded by high-frequency EPR. Consideration of published spectra of light-induced radical pairs in photosynthetic bacterial reaction centres reveals no significant CISS component in the polarization generated by the conventional spin-correlated radical pair mechanism.},

  abstract = {Experimentally, in the presence of the crowding agent polyethylene glycol (PEG), sodium ions compact double-stranded DNA more readily than potassium ions. Here, we have used molecular dynamics simulations and the “ion binding shells model” of DNA condensation to provide an explanation for the observed variations in condensation of short DNA duplexes in solutions containing different monovalent cations and PEG; several predictions are made. According to the model we use, externally bound ions contribute the most to the ion-induced aggregation of DNA duplexes. The simulations reveal that for two adjacent DNA duplexes, the number of externally bound Na + ions is larger than the number of K + ions over a wide range of chloride concentrations in the presence of PEG, providing a qualitative explanation for the higher propensity of sodium ions to compact DNA under crowded conditions. The qualitative picture is confirmed by an estimate of the corresponding free energy of DNA aggregation that is at least 0.2 k B T per base pair more favorable in solution with NaCl than with KCl at the same ion concentration. The estimated attraction free energy of DNA duplexes in the presence of Na + depends noticeably on the DNA sequence; we predict that AT-rich DNA duplexes are more readily condensed than GC-rich ones in the presence of Na + . Counter-intuitively, the addition of a small amount of a crowding agent with high affinity for the specific condensing ion may lead to the weakening of the ion-mediated DNA–DNA attraction, shifting the equilibrium away from the DNA condensed phase.},

  abstract = {Metal-reducing bacteria have adapted the ability to respire extracellular solid surfaces instead of soluble oxidants. This process requires an electron transport pathway that spans from the inner membrane, across the periplasm, through the outer membrane, and to an external surface. Multiheme cytochromes are the primary machinery for moving electrons through this pathway. Recent studies show that the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect is observable in some of these proteins extracted from the model metal-reducing bacteria, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. It was hypothesized that the CISS effect facilitates efficient electron transport in these proteins by coupling electron velocity to spin, thus reducing the probability of backscattering. However, these studies focused exclusively on the cell surface electron conduits, and thus, CISS has not been investigated in upstream electron transfer components such as the membrane-associated MtrA, or periplasmic proteins such as small tetraheme cytochrome (STC). By using conductive probe atomic force microscopy measurements of protein monolayers adsorbed onto ferromagnetic substrates, we show that electron transport is spin selective in both MtrA and STC. Moreover, we have determined the spin polarization of MtrA to be ∼77\% and STC to be ∼35\%. This disparity in spin polarizations could indicate that spin selectivity is length dependent in heme proteins, given that MtrA is approximately two times longer than STC. Most significantly, our study indicates that spin-dependent interactions affect the entire extracellular electron transport pathway.},

In the simulations, two cases are considered: freely diffusing tracer (passive microrheology) and tracer pulled with a constant force (active microrheology). Both cases are connected by linear response theory for all tracer sizes. It links both the stationary and transient regimes of the pulled tracer (for low forces) with the equilibrium correlation functions; the velocity of the pulled tracer and its displacement are obtained from the velocity auto-correlation function and the mean squared displacement, respectively. The MCT calculations give insight into the physical mechanisms: At short times, the tracer rattles in its cage of neighbours, with the frequency increasing linearly with the tracer radius asymptotically. The long-time tracer diffusion coefficient from passive microrheology, which agrees with the inverse friction coefficient from the active case, arises from the transport of transverse momentum around the tracer. It can be described with the Brinkman equation for the transverse flow field obtained in extension of MCT, but cannot be recovered from the MCT kernel coupling to densities only. The dynamics of the bath particles is also studied; for the unforced tracer the dynamics is unaffected. When the tracer is pulled, the velocity field in the bath follows the prediction of the Brinkman model, but different from the case of a Newtonian fluid.},

However, grand-canonical simulations are often computationally demanding in condensed phases. A promising method [L. Belloni, J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 021101 (2019)], one of the hybrid nonequilibrium molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo algorithms, was recently developed, which enables efficient computation of fluctuating number or charge density in dense fluids or ionic solutions. This method facilitates the exchange through an auxiliary dimension, orthogonal to all physical dimensions, by reducing initial steric and electrostatic clashes in three-dimensional systems. Here, we report the implementation of the method in LAMMPS with a Python interface, allowing facile access to grand-canonical molecular dynamics simulations with massively parallelized computation. We validate our implementation with two electrolytes, including a model Lennard-Jones electrolyte similar to a restricted primitive model and aqueous solutions. We find that electrostatic interactions play a crucial role in the overall efficiency due to their long-range nature, particularly for water or ion-pair exchange in aqueous solutions. With properly screened electrostatic interactions and bias-based methods, our approach enhances the efficiency of salt-pair exchange in Lennard-Jones electrolytes by approximately four orders of magnitude, compared to conventional grand-canonical Monte Carlo. Furthermore, the acceptance rate of NaCl-pair exchange in aqueous solutions at moderate concentrations reaches about 3\% at the maximum efficiency.},

It relies on training data generated in small unit cells and is fit using a lightweight neural network, leading to smooth interactions which exhibit the robust transferability essential for structure prediction. Here, we present a variety of applications of EDDPs, enabled by recent developments of the open-source EDDP software. New features include interfaces to phonon and molecular dynamics codes, as well as deployment of the ensemble deviation for estimating the confidence in EDDP predictions. Through case studies ranging from elemental carbon and lead to the binary scandium hydride and the ternary zinc cyanide, we demonstrate that EDDPs can be trained to cover wide ranges of pressures and stoichiometries, and used to evaluate phonons, phase diagrams, superionicity, and thermal expansion. These developments complement continued success in accelerated structure prediction.},

Using machine learning potentials is a promising method that can potentially address the accuracy issues of classical empirical potentials while maintaining high efficiency. In this work, we fitted a dipole polarizable ion model and trained machine learning potential for BaSnF 4 and made comprehensive comparisons on the ease of training, accuracy and efficiency. We also compared the results with the case of a simpler ionic system (NaF). We show that contrarily to the latter, for BaSnF 4 the machine learning potential offers much higher versatility.

While its mobility remains low as in other 2D TMDCs is inconceivable for electronic and thermoelectric applications. Earlier theoretical attempts have failed to give justification for the orders of low experimental mobility obtained for monolayer HfSe 2 . We calculate the carrier mobility in the framework of the density functional perturbation theory in conjunction with the Boltzmann transport equation and correctly ascertain the experimental value. We also calculate the carrier mobility with the previously employed method, the deformation potential (DP) model, to figure out the reason for its failure. We found that it is the strong electron-optical phonon interaction that is causing the low mobility. As the DP model does not account for the optical phonons, it overestimates the relaxation time by an order of two and also underestimates the temperature dependence of mobility. A strong polar type interaction is evidenced as a manifestation of a discontinuity in the first derivative of the optical-phonons at the K and Γ points as well as a dispersive optical phonon at the K point. We also included the spin–orbit coupling which leads to an energy splitting of ∼330 meV and significantly affects mobility and scattering rates.},

Using the hydrogen evolution reaction on S vacancies of MoS 2 as an example, we show how to track the change of surface charge in a reaction and to analyze its influence on the kinetics. Protons adsorb on S vacancies in a tough and charge-insensitive water splitting manner, which explains the observed large Tafel slope. Grand-canonical calculations report an unanticipated surface charge-induced change of the desorption pathway from the Heyrovsky route to a Volmer–Tafel route. During an electrochemical reaction, a net electron inflow into the catalyst may bring two effects, i.e., stabilization of the canonical energy and destabilization of the charge-dependent grand-canonical part. On the contrary, a net outflow of electrons from the catalyst can reverse the two effects. This surface charge effect has substantial impacts on the overpotential and the Tafel slope. We suggest that the surface charge effect is universal for all electrochemical reactions and significant for those involving interfacial proton transfers.},

  abstract = {Water dissociation on TiO 2 surfaces has been known for decades and holds great potential in various applications, many of which require a proper understanding of thermal transport across the TiO 2 –H 2 O interface. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play an important role in characterizing complex systems’ interfacial thermal transport properties. Nevertheless, due to the imprecision of empirical force field potentials, the interfacial thermal transport mechanism involving water dissociation remains to be determined. To cope with this, a deep potential (DP) model is formulated through the utilization of ab initio datasets. This model successfully simulates interfacial thermal transport accompanied by water dissociation on the TiO 2 surfaces. The trained DP achieves a total energy accuracy of ∼238.8 meV and a force accuracy of ∼197.05 meV/Å. The DPMD simulations show that water dissociation induces the formation of hydrogen bonding networks and molecular bridges. Structural modifications further affect interfacial thermal transport. The interfacial thermal conductance estimated by DP is ∼8.54 × 10 9 W/m 2 K, smaller than ∼13.17 × 10 9 W/m 2 K by empirical potentials. The vibrational density of states (VDOS) quantifies the differences between the DP model and empirical potentials. Notably, the VDOS disparity between the adsorbed hydrogen atoms and normal hydrogen atoms demonstrates the influence of water dissociation on heat transfer processes. This work aims to understand the effect of water dissociation on thermal transport at the TiO 2 –H 2 O interface. The findings will provide valuable guidance for the thermal management of photocatalytic devices.},

  abstract = {Modeling the dynamics of glassy systems has been challenging in physics for several decades. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in capturing particle dynamics from the graph structure of glassy systems. However, current GNN methods do not take the dynamic patterns established by neighboring particles explicitly into account. In contrast to these approaches, this paper introduces a novel dynamical parameter termed “smoothness” based on the theory of graph signal processing, which explores the dynamic patterns from a graph perspective. Present graph-based approaches encode structural features without considering smoothness constraints, leading to a weakened correlation between structure and dynamics, particularly on short timescales. To address this limitation, we propose a Geometry-enhanced Graph Neural Network (Geo-GNN) to learn the smoothness of dynamics. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predicting glassy dynamics. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component in capturing smoothness within dynamics. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between glassy dynamics and static structure.},

  abstract = {The aluminum ion battery (AIB) is a promising technology, but there is a lack of understanding of the desired nature of the batteries’ electrolytes. The ionic charge carriers in these batteries are not simply Al 3+ ions but the anionic AlCl 4 − and Al 2 Cl 7 − , which form in the electrolyte. Using computational analysis, this study illustrates the effect of mole ratios and organic solvents to improve the AIB electrolytes. To this end, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on varying ratios forming acidic, neutral, and basic mixtures of the AlCl 3 salt with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (EMImCl) ionic liquid (IL) and an organic solvent electrolyte [dichloromethane (DCM) or toluene]. The data obtained from diffusion calculations indicates that the solvents could improve the transport properties. Both DCM and toluene lead to higher diffusion coefficients, and higher conductivity. Detailed calculations demonstrated solvents can effectively improve the formation of AlCl 3 ⋯Cl (AlCl 4 − ) and AlCl 4 − ···AlCl 4 − (Al 2 Cl 7 − ) especially in acidic mixtures. The densities, around 1.25 g/cm 3 for electrolyte mixtures of AlCl 3 -EMImCl, were consistent with experiment. These results, in agreement with experimental findings, strongly suggest that DCM in acidic media with AlCl 3 and EMImCl might provide a promising basis for battery development.},

  abstract = {Photofunctional materials based on donor-acceptor molecules have drawn intense attention due to their unique optical properties. Importantly, Systematic investigation of substitution effects on excited-state charge transfer dynamics of donor-acceptor molecules is a powerful approach for identifying application-relevant design principles. Here, by coupling phenothiazine (PTZ) at the ortho -, meta -, and para -positions of the benzene ring of benzophenone (BP), three regioisomeric BP-PTZ dyads were designed to understand the relationship between substituted positions and excited-state evolution channels. Ultrafast transient absorption is used to detect and trace the transient species and related evolution channels of BP-PTZ dyads at excited state. In a non-polar solvent, BP- o -PTZ undergoes the through-space charge transfer process to produce a singlet charge-transfer ( 1 CT) state, which subsequently proceeds the intersystem crossing process and transforms into a triplet charge-transfer ( 3 CT) state; BP- m -PTZ experiences intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process to generate the 1 CT state, which subsequently transforms into the 3 CT state by the intersystem crossing (ISC) and finally converts into the local-excited triplet ( 3 LE) state; as for BP- p -PTZ, only 3 LE states can be detected after the ISC process from the 1 CT state. On the other hand, the twisted ICT states are generated via twisted motion between the donor and acceptor for all BP-PTZ dyads or planarization of the PTZ unit in high polar solvents. The excited-state theoretical calculations unveil that the features of ICT and intramolecular interaction between the three dyads play a decisive role in determining the through-bond charge transfer and through-space charge transfer processes. Also, these results demonstrate that the excited-state evolution channels of PTZ derivatives could be modified by tuning the substituted positions of the donor-acceptor dyads. This study provides a deep perspective for the substitute-position effect on donor-acceptor-type PTZ derivatives.},

However, the atomic-scale kinetics of the aluminosilicate network condensation remains puzzling. Here, based on reactive molecular dynamics simulations of C–A–S–H systems formation with varying Al/Ca molar ratios, we study the kinetic mechanism of the hydrated aluminosilicate gels upon precipitation. We show that the condensation activation energy decreases with the Al/Ca molar ratio, which suggests that the concentration of the Al polytopes has a great effect on controlling the kinetics of the gelation reaction. Significantly, we demonstrate that 5-fold Al atoms are mainly forming at high Al/Ca molar ratios since there are insufficient hydrogen cations or extra calcium cations to compensate the negatively charged Al polytopes at high Al/Ca molar ratios during accelerated aging.},

Detailed theoretical calculations (using DFT and TDDFT methodologies) on ground and excited states of the cis and gauche conformers of propanal are performed; a comprehensive spectral analysis of the IR and VUV spectra is presented. A reinvestigation of the IR spectrum reveals several new bands assigned to the gauche conformer based on theoretical calculations. The VUV spectrum exhibits rich Rydberg series structure assigned to ns , np and nd series converging to the first ionization potentials of the two conformers. Earlier assignments of the 3s cis and gauche origins are revised in addition to extending Rydberg series analysis to several higher members. Vibronic bands accompanying the 3s, 4s and 4p Rydberg states are assigned using estimated vibrational frequencies of cis and gauche conformers in the cationic ground state. Simulated potential energy curves of the first few excited states (singlets and triplets) of cis and gauche conformers of propanal help in gaining insights into photodissociation mechanisms and possible conformational effects therein.},

  abstract = {Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) holds promise to compute ground state molecular properties at minimal cost. However, it has been held back by our inability to compute the kinetic energy as a functional of electron density alone. Here, we set out to learn the kinetic energy functional from ground truth provided by the more expensive Kohn–Sham density functional theory. Such learning is confronted with two key challenges: Giving the model sufficient expressivity and spatial context while limiting the memory footprint to afford computations on a GPU and creating a sufficiently broad distribution of training data to enable iterative density optimization even when starting from a poor initial guess. In response, we introduce KineticNet, an equivariant deep neural network architecture based on point convolutions adapted to the prediction of quantities on molecular quadrature grids. Important contributions include convolution filters with sufficient spatial resolution in the vicinity of nuclear cusp, an atom-centric sparse but expressive architecture that relays information across multiple bond lengths, and a new strategy to generate varied training data by finding ground state densities in the face of perturbations by a random external potential. KineticNet achieves, for the first time, chemical accuracy of the learned functionals across input densities and geometries of tiny molecules. For two-electron systems, we additionally demonstrate OF-DFT density optimization with chemical accuracy.},

We derive a general perturbative expression of the charge and spin fluxes and identify the driving perturbation of the fluxes to be the time derivative of the electron-nucleus interaction term in the Hamiltonian. We then expand the expression in molecular orbitals so as to identify relevant components of the fluxes. Our perturbation theory describes the electronic fluxes in the early stage of reactions in an intuitively clear manner. The perturbation theory is then applied to an analysis of the spin flux obtained in ab initio calculations of the radical reaction of O 2 and CH 3 · starting from three distinct spin configurations; (a) CH 3 · and triplet O 2 with total spin of the system set S t o t = 1 / 2 (b) CH 3 · and singlet O 2 , S t o t = 1 / 2 ⁠ , and (c) CH 3 · and triplet O 2 , S t o t = 3 / 2 ⁠ . Further analysis of the time-dependent behaviors of the spin flux in these numerical simulations reveals (i) the spin flux induces rearrangement of the local spin structure, such as reduction of the spin polarization arising from the triplet O 2 and (ii) the spin flux flows from O 2 to CH 3 · in the reaction starting from spin configuration (a) and from CH 3 · to O 2 in that starting from configuration (b), whereas no major intermolecular spin flux was observed in that starting from configuration (c). Our study thus establishes the mechanism of the spin flux that rearranges the local spin structures associated with chemical bonds.},

In this work, we investigate the usage of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to evaluate the rate kernels in quantum rate processes. DMD is a data-driven model reduction technique that characterizes the rate kernels using snapshots collected from a small time window, allowing us to predict the long-term behaviors with only a limited number of samples. Our investigations show that whether the external field is involved or not, the DMD can give accurate prediction of the result compared with the traditional propagations, and simultaneously reduce the required computational cost.},

  abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown immense potential in fields such as text and image generation. Only very recently attempts to exploit GANs to statistical-mechanics models have been reported. Here we quantitatively test this approach by applying it to a prototypical stochastic process on a lattice. By suitably adding noise to the original data we succeed in bringing both the Generator and the Discriminator loss functions close to their ideal value. Importantly, the discreteness of the model is retained despite the noise. As typical for adversarial approaches, oscillations around the convergence limit persist also at large epochs. This undermines model selection and the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that a simple multi-model procedure where stochastic trajectories are advanced at each step upon randomly selecting a Generator leads to a remarkable increase in accuracy. This is illustrated by quantitative analysis of both the predicted equilibrium probability distribution and of the escape-time distribution. Based on the reported findings, we believe that GANs are a promising tool to tackle complex statistical dynamics by machine learning techniques.},

In this paper, we propose Vendi Sampling , a replica-based algorithm for increasing the efficiency and efficacy of the exploration of molecular conformation spaces. In Vendi sampling, replicas are simulated in parallel and coupled via a global statistical measure, the Vendi Score, to enhance diversity. Vendi sampling allows for the recovery of unbiased sampling statistics and dramatically improves sampling efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Vendi sampling in improving molecular dynamics simulations by showing significant improvements in coverage and mixing between metastable states and convergence of free energy estimates for four common benchmarks, including Alanine Dipeptide and Chignolin.},

  abstract = {Dissociative adsorption onto a surface introduces dynamic correlations between neighboring sites not found in non-dissociative absorption. We study surface coverage dynamics where reversible dissociative adsorption of dimers occurs on a finite linear lattice. We derive analytic expressions for the equilibrium surface coverage as a function of the number of reactive sites, N , and the ratio of the adsorption and desorption rates. Using these results, we characterize the finite size effect on the equilibrium surface coverage. For comparable N ’s, the finite size effect is significantly larger when N is even than when N is odd. Moreover, as N increases, the size effect decays more slowly in the even case than in the odd case. The finite-size effect becomes significant when adsorption and desorption rates are considerably different. These finite-size effects are related to the number of accessible configurations in a finite system where the odd-even dependence arises from the limited number of accessible configurations in the even case. We confirm our analytical results with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We also analyze the surface-diffusion case where adsorbed atoms can hop into neighboring sites. As expected, the odd-even dependence disappears because more configurations are accessible in the even case due to surface diffusion.},

The underlying electron transfer mechanisms can be efficiently explored using semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods.

PTB, parameterized for the entire Periodic Table up to Z = 86, incorporates approximate non-local exchange, allowing for efficient and accurate calculations for large hetero-organic compounds. Benchmarking against established databases, such as Blumberger’s HAB sets, or our newly introduced JAB69 set and comparing with high-level reference data from ω B97X-D4 calculations confirm that DIPRO@PTB consistently performs well among the tested SQM approaches for calculating coupling integrals. DIPRO@PTB yields reasonably accurate results at low computational cost, making it suitable for screening purposes and applications to large systems, such as metal-organic frameworks and cyanine-based molecular aggregates further discussed in this work.},

  abstract = {The Cattaneo–Vernotte model has been widely studied to take momentum relaxation into account in transport equations. Yet, the effect of reactions on the Cattaneo–Vernotte model has not been fully elucidated. At present, it is unclear how the current density associated with reactions can be expressed in the Cattaneo–Vernotte model. Herein, we derive a modified Cattaneo–Vernotte model by applying the projection operator method to the Fokker–Planck–Kramers equation with a reaction sink. The same modified Cattaneo–Vernotte model can be derived by a Grad procedure. We show that the inertial effect influences the reaction rate coefficient differently depending on whether the intrinsic reaction rate constant in the reaction sink term depends on the solute relative velocity or not. The momentum relaxation effect can be expressed by a modified Smoluchowski equation including a memory kernel using the Cattaneo–Vernotte model. When the intrinsic reaction rate constant is independent of the reactant velocity and is localized, the modified Smoluchowski equation should be generalized to include a reaction term without a memory kernel. When the intrinsic reaction rate constant depends on the relative velocity of reactants, an additional reaction term with a memory kernel is required because of competition between the current density associated with the reaction and the diffusive flux during momentum relaxation. The competition effect influences even the long-time reaction rate coefficient.},

  abstract = {The core valence separation (CVS) approximation is the most employed strategy to prevent the variational collapse of standard wave function optimization when attempting to compute electronic states bearing one or more electronic vacancies in core orbitals. Here, we explore the spurious consequences of this approximation on the properties of the computed core hole states. We especially focus on the less studied case of double core hole (DCH) states, whose spectroscopic interest has recently been rapidly growing. We show that the CVS error leads to a systematic underestimation of DCH energies, a property in stark contrast with the case of single core hole states. We highlight that the CVS error can then be interpreted as an over relaxation effect and design a new correction strategy adapted to these specificities.},

The present approach does not require long-range information and is entirely general. As a result, it is possible to provide the full-dimensional AlF–AlF potential energy surface, requiring ≲0.01\% of the configurations to be calculated ab initio . Furthermore, we analyze the general properties of the AlF–AlF system, finding critical differences with other reported results on CaF or bi-alkali dimers.},

We use the open-boundary molecular dynamics method, which allows us to simulate the protein exposed to acoustic waves. By analyzing the dynamic fluctuations of the protein subunits, we demonstrate that the protein is highly susceptible to acoustic waves with frequencies corresponding to those of the internal protein vibrations. This is confirmed by changes in the compactness of the protein structure. As the amplitude of the pressure wave increases, even larger deviations from average positions and larger changes in protein compactness are observed. Furthermore, performing the mode-projection analysis, we show that the breathing-like character of collective modes is enhanced at frequencies corresponding to those used to excite the protein.},

  abstract = {We report on viscous adhesion measurements conducted in sphere-plane geometry between a rigid sphere and soft surfaces submerged in silicone oils. Increasing the surface compliance leads to a decrease in the adhesive strength due to elastohydrodynamic deformation of the soft surface during debonding. The force-displacement and fluid film thickness-time data are compared to an elastohydrodynamic model that incorporates the force measuring spring and finds good agreement between the model and data. We calculate the pressure distribution in the fluid and find that, in contrast to debonding from rigid surfaces, the pressure drop is non-monotonic and includes the presence of stagnation points within the fluid film when a soft surface is present. In addition, viscous adhesion in the presence of a soft surface leads to a debonding process that occurs via a peeling front (located at a stagnation point), even in the absence of solid–solid contact. As a result of mass conservation, the elastohydrodynamic deformation of the soft surface during detachment leads to surfaces that come closer as the surfaces are separated. During detachment, there is a region with fluid drainage between the centerpoint and the stagnation point, while there is fluid infusion further out. Understanding and harnessing the coupling between lubrication pressure, elasticity, and surface interactions provides material design strategies for applications such as adhesives, coatings, microsensors, and biomaterials.},

We now show that this pumping transition is controlled by three timescales. Two timescales characterize advective and diffusive transport. The third timescale corresponds to how long a solute molecule resides in the pore before being consumed. Introducing asymmetry to the pore (either via the shape or the catalytic coating) reveals a second type of advection-enabled transition. In asymmetric pores, the flow rate exhibits discontinuous jumps and hysteresis loops upon tuning the parameters that control the asymmetry. This work demonstrates the interconnected roles of shape and catalytic patterning in the dynamics of active pores and shows how to design a pump for optimum performance.},

  abstract = {The interplay between crystal nucleation and the structure of the metastable fluid has been a topic of significant debate over recent years. In particular, it has been suggested that even in simple model systems such as hard or charged colloids, crystal nucleation might be foreshadowed by significant fluctuations in local structure around the location where the nucleus first arises. We investigate this using computer simulations of spontaneous nucleation events in both hard and charged colloidal systems. To detect local structural variations, we use both standard and unsupervised machine learning methods capable of finding hidden structures in the metastable fluid phase. We track numerous nucleation events for the face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic crystals on a local level and demonstrate that all signs of crystallinity emerge simultaneously from the very start of the nucleation process. We thus conclude that we observe no precursor for the crystal nucleation of hard and charged colloids.},

The respective translocation events are often very fast and the process needs to be controlled to promote efficient detection. To this end, we attempt to control the translocation dynamics by coating the inner surface of a nanopore. For this, different charge distributions are chosen that result in substantial variations of the pore–polymer interactions. In addition and in view of the existing detection modalities, experimental settings, and nanopore materials, different types of sensors inside the nanopore have been considered to probe the translocation process and its temporal spread. The respective transport of polyelectrolytes through the coated nanopores is modeled through a multi-physics computational scheme that incorporates a mesoscopic/electrokinetic description for the solvent and particle-based scheme for the polymer. This investigation could underline the interplay between sensing modality, nanopore material, and detection accuracy. The electro-osmotic flow and electrophoretic motion in a pore are analyzed together with the polymeric temporal and spatial fluctuations unraveling their correlations and pathways to optimize the translocation speed and dynamics. Accordingly, this work sketches pathways in order to tune the pore–polymer interactions in order to control the translocation dynamics and, in the long run, errors in their measurements.},

This program, called HORTENSIA (Hopping Real-time Trajectories for Electron-ejection by Nonadiabatic Self-Ionization in Anions), is based on the nonadiabatic surface-hopping methodology, wherein nuclei are propagated as an ensemble along classical trajectories in the quantum-mechanical potential created by the electronic density of the molecular system. The electronic Schrödinger equation is numerically integrated along the trajectory, providing the time evolution of electronic state coefficients, from which switching probabilities into discrete electronic states are determined. In the case of a discretized continuum state, this hopping event is interpreted as the ejection on an electron. The derived diabatic and nonadiabatic couplings in the time-dependent electronic Schrödinger equation are calculated from anionic and neutral wavefunctions obtained from quantum-chemical calculations with commercially available program packages interfaced with our program. Based on this methodology, we demonstrate the simulation of autoionization electron kinetic energy spectra that are both time- and angle-resolved. In addition, the program yields data that can be interpreted easily with respect to geometric characteristics, such as bonding distances and angles, which facilitate the detection of molecular configurations important for the autoionization process. Furthermore, several useful extensions are included, namely, tools for the generation of initial conditions and input files as well as for the evaluation of output files, all of this both through console commands and a graphical user interface.},

  abstract = {InP-based quantum dots (QDs) have Stokes shifts and photoluminescence (PL) line widths that are larger than in II–VI semiconductor QDs with comparable exciton energies. The mechanisms responsible for these spectral characteristics are investigated in this paper. Upon comparing different semiconductors, we find the Stokes shift decreases in the following order: InP &gt; CdTe &gt; CdSe. We also find that the Stokes shift decreases with core size and decreases upon deposition of a ZnSe shell. We suggest that the Stokes shift is largely due to different absorption and luminescent states in the angular momentum fine structure. The energy difference between the fine structure levels, and hence the Stokes shifts, are controlled by the electron–hole exchange interaction. Luminescence polarization results are reported and are consistent with this assignment. Spectral widths are controlled by the extent of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. We report PL and PL excitation (PLE) spectra that facilitate assessing the roles of homogeneous and different inhomogeneous broadening mechanisms in the spectra of zinc-treated InP and InP/ZnSe/ZnS particles. There are two distinct types of inhomogeneous broadening: size inhomogeneity and core–shell interface inhomogeneity. The latter results in a distribution of core–shell band offsets and is caused by interfacial dipoles associated with In–Se or P–Zn bonding. Quantitative modeling of the spectra shows that the offset inhomogeneity is comparable to but somewhat smaller than the size inhomogeneity. The combination of these two types of inhomogeneity also explains several aspects of reversible hole trapping dynamics involving localized In 3+ /V Zn 2− impurity states in the ZnSe shells.},

In particular, chiral plasmonics have been widely investigated due to their excellent optical chiral properties, and have led to numerous applications such as optical polarizing element etc. In this study, we develop a model based on the concept of the interaction between harmonic oscillators to investigate and explain the optical chiral mechanisms of strongly coupled metal nanoparticles (MNPs). The chirality of the scattering, absorption, and photoluminescence spectra are carefully discussed in detail. The results show that the chirality of the system originates not only from the orientations of the MNPs, but also from the different eigen parameters between them. Specifically, the derived three factors contribute to the chirality: the symmetry, the coupling strength, and the coherent superposition of the emitted electric field. This work provides a deeper understanding on the chiral plasmonics and may guide relevant applications in theory.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) have great potential in the design of non-volatile memory devices due to the tunneling electroresistance (TER) effect and the fact that it is not constrained by critical thickness. Incorporation of 2D ferroelectric materials in realistic FTJs inevitably involves the contacts to the traditional three-dimensional (3D) metals. However, how to design the FTJs by combining the 2D ferroelectric materials with the 3D metals still needs to be studied. In this work, we design a vertical 3D FTJ by adopting the 3D metal Au as the left and right electrodes and the 2D ferroelectric material In 2 Se 3 together with h-BN as the central scattering region. By density functional theory combined with the non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) method, we demonstrate that the h-BN intercalation with a large bandgap plays the role of good “insulator,” which breaks the symmetry of the left and right electrodes. As a result, we obtain the TER ratio of about 170\%, and it can be further improved to about 1200\% if two layers of In 2 Se 3 (2L-In 2 Se 3 ) are adopted as the tunneling barrier layer. Our results provide another way for the design and application of ferroelectric memory devices based on 2D ferroelectric materials.},

In an attempt to overcome this bottleneck, in this work, unique CoNiFe-layered double hydroxide nanoflowers are in situ grown on nickel-iron (NiFe) foam through a corrosive approach and following a chemical vapor deposition process to generate nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes at the presence of melamine (CoNiFe@NCNTs). The coupling effects between various metal species act a key role in accelerating the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the in situ formed NCNTs also favor promoting electrocatalytic activity and stability. For oxygen evolution reaction it requires low overpotentials of 330 and 341 mV in 1M KOH and 1M KOH + seawater to drive 500 mA cm −2 . Moreover, water electrolysis can be operated with CoNiFe@NCNTs as both anode and cathode with small voltages of 1.95 and 1.93 V to achieve 500 mA cm −2 in 1M KOH and 1M KOH + seawater, respectively.},

  abstract = {Proton transport in aqueous systems occurs by making and breaking covalent bonds, a process that classical force fields cannot reproduce. Various attempts have been made to remedy this deficiency, by valence bond theory or instantaneous proton transfers, but the ability of such methods to provide a realistic picture of this fundamental process has not been fully evaluated. Here we compare an ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation of an excess proton in water to a simulation of a classical H 3 O + in TIP3P water. The energy gap upon instantaneous proton transfer from H 3 O + to an acceptor water molecule is much higher in the classical simulation than in the AIMD configurations evaluated with the same classical potential. The origins of this discrepancy are identified by comparing the solvent structures around the excess proton in the two systems. One major structural difference is in the tilt angle of the water molecules that accept an hydrogen bond from H 3 O + . The lack of lone pairs in TIP3P produces a tilt angle that is too large and generates an unfavorable geometry after instantaneous proton transfer. This problem can be alleviated by the use of TIP5P, which gives a tilt angle much closer to the AIMD result. Another important factor that raises the energy gap is the different optimal distance in water-water vs H 3 O + -water H-bonds. In AIMD the acceptor is gradually polarized and takes a hydronium-like configuration even before proton transfer actually happens. Ways to remedy some of these problems in classical simulations are discussed.},

  abstract = {By means of massive (more than 1.2 · 10 6 molecules) molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K we have disentangled self- and cross-dipolar contributions to the dielectric relaxation of liquid water that cannot be experimentally resolved. We have demonstrated that cross dipolar correlations are of paramount importance. They amount for almost a 60\% of the total dielectric amplitude. The corresponding relaxation function is a one-step Debye-like function with a characteristic time, τ cross , of the order of the phenomenological Debye time, τ D . In contrast, the relaxation function corresponding to the self-contribution is rather complex and contains a fast decay related to dipolar librations and a second relaxation step that can be well described by two exponentials: a low-amplitude fast process ( τ 0 = 0.31 ps) and a main slow process ( τ self = 5.4 ps) that fully randomizes the dipolar orientation. In addition to dipolar relaxation functions, we have also calculated scattering-like magnitudes characterizing translation and rotation of water molecules. Although these processes can be considered as “jump” processes in the short time range, at the time scale of about τ D – τ cross , at which the cross-dipolar correlations decay to zero, the observed behavior cannot be distinguished from that corresponding to uncoupled Brownian translational and rotational diffusion. We propose that this is the reason why the Debye model, which does not consider intermolecular dipolar interactions, seems to work at time t ≳ τ D .},

  abstract = {The Soret effect, temperature gradient driven diffusion, in silicate melts has been investigated intensively in the earth sciences from the 1980s. The SiO 2 component is generally concentrated in the hotter region of silicate melts under a temperature gradient. Here, we report that at ultra-high temperatures above ∼3000 K, SiO 2 becomes concentrated in the colder region of the silicate melts under a temperature gradient. The interior of an aluminosilicate glass [63.3SiO 2 –16.3Al 2 O 3 –20.4CaO (mol.\%)] was irradiated with a 250 kHz femtosecond laser pulse for local heating. SiO 2 migrated to the colder region during irradiation with an 800 pulse (3.2 ms irradiation). The temperature analysis indicated that migration to the colder region occurred above 3060 K. In the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation, SiO 2 migrated to the colder region under a temperature gradient, which had an average temperature of 4000 K; this result supports the experimental result. On the other hand, SiO 2 exhibited a tendency to migrate to the hotter region at 2400 K in both the NEMD and experimental study. The molar volume calculated by molecular dynamics simulation without a temperature gradient indicates two bends at 1650 and 3250 K under 500 MPa. Therefore, the discontinuous (first order) transition with coexistence of two phases of different composition could be related to the migration of SiO 2 to colder region. However, the detailed mechanism has not been elucidated.},

  abstract = {The precipitation of struvite, a magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (MgNH 4 PO 4 · 6H 2 O) mineral, from wastewater is a promising method for recovering phosphorous. While this process is commonly used in engineered environments, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the formation of struvite crystals remains limited. Specifically, indirect evidence suggests the involvement of an amorphous precursor and the occurrence of multi-step processes in struvite formation, which would indicate non-classical paths of nucleation and crystallization. In this study, we use synchrotron-based in situ x-ray scattering complemented by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy to obtain new insights from the earliest stages of struvite formation. The holistic scattering data captured the structure of an entire assembly in a time-resolved manner. The structural features comprise the aqueous medium, the growing struvite crystals, and any potential heterogeneities or complex entities. By analysing the scattering data, we found that the onset of crystallization causes a perturbation in the structure of the surrounding aqueous medium. This perturbation is characterized by the occurrence and evolution of Ornstein-Zernike fluctuations on a scale of about 1 nm, suggesting a non-classical nature of the system. We interpret this phenomenon as a liquid-liquid phase separation, which gives rise to the formation of the amorphous precursor phase preceding actual crystal growth of struvite. Our microscopy results confirm that the formation of Mg-struvite includes a short-lived amorphous phase, lasting &gt;10 s.},

Nickelocene decomposed above 13 GPa, at room temperature, while lower pressure thresholds have been observed at higher temperatures (295–573 K). The products were identified as nanocomposite materials, primarily composed of disordered, nickel-rich nanoparticles segregated within an extended, amorphous matrix of hydrogenated carbon (a-C:H). The investigation was conducted by means of diamond anvil cells in combination with optical spectroscopies and microscopy, synchrotron x-ray absorption spectroscopy and diffraction, as well as transmission electron microscopy. Our findings have the potential to stimulate further research into the high-pressure chemical reactivity of organometallics and open up new synthesis routes for the production of metal-based nanoparticles, which find a wide range of applications.},

Distinct longitudinal cavity modes are either entangled with each other via the material or independently coupled to the exciton mode. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the transition between those two regimes as the cavity thickness is gradually increased while maintaining fixed coupling strength. We study the properties of the system using reflection and emission spectroscopy and show that even though the coupling strength is constant, different behavior in the spectral response is observed along the coupling–decoupling transition. In addition, we find that in such multimode cavities, pronounced upper polariton emission is observed, in contrast to the usual case of a single-mode cavity. Furthermore, we address the ultrafast dynamics of the multimode cavities by pump–probe spectroscopic measurements and observe that the transient spectra significantly change through the transition.},

  abstract = {A full-dimensional spin–orbit (SO)-corrected potential energy surface (PES) is developed for the Cl + CH 3 NH 2 multi-channel system. Using the new PES, a comprehensive reaction dynamics investigation is performed for the most reactive hydrogen-abstraction reactions forming HCl + CH 2 NH 2 /CH 3 NH. Hartree–Fock (HF) convergence problems in the reactant region are handled by the ManyHF method, which finds the lowest-energy HF solution considering several different initial guess orbitals. The PES development is carried out with the Robosurfer program package, which iteratively improves the surface. Energy points are computed at the ManyHF-UCCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVDZ-F12 level of theory combined with basis set (ManyHF-RMP2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 – ManyHF-RMP2-F12/cc-pVDZ-F12) and SO (MRCI+Q/aug-cc-pwCVDZ) corrections. Quasi-classical trajectory simulations show that the CH 3 -side hydrogen abstraction occurs more frequently in contrast to the NH 2 -side reaction. In both cases, the integral cross sections decrease with increasing collision energy ( E coll ). A reaction mechanism shifting from indirect to direct stripping can be observed from the opacity functions, scattering angle, and translation energy distributions as E coll increases. Initial attack angle distributions reveal that chlorine prefers to abstract hydrogen from the approached functional group. The collision-energy dependence of the product energy distributions shows that the initial translational energy mainly transfers to product recoil. The HCl vibrational and rotational energy values are comparable and nearly independent of collision energy, while the CH 2 NH 2 and CH 3 NH co-products’ vibrational energy values are higher than the rotational energy values with more significant E coll dependence. The HCl( v = 0) rotational distributions are compared with experiment, setting the direction for future investigations.},

  abstract = {We report the experimental resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization spectrum of isoquinoline between 315 and 310 nm, along with correlated electronic structure calculations on the ground and excited states of this species. This spectral region spans the origin transitions to a π – π * excited state, which previous work has suggested to be vibronically coupled with a lower lying singlet n – π * state. Our computational results corroborate previous density functional theory calculations that predict the vertical excitation energy for the n – π * state to be higher than the π – π * state; however, we find an increase in the C–N–C angle brings the n – π * state below the energy of the π – π * state. The calculations find two out-of-plane vibrational modes of the n – π * state, which may be brought into near resonance with the π – π * state as the C–N–C bond angle increases. Therefore, the C–N–C bond angle may be important in activating vibronic coupling between the states. We fit the experimental rotational contour with a genetic algorithm to determine the excited state rotational constants and orientation of the transition dipole moment. The fits show a mostly in-plane polarized transition, and the projection of the transition dipole moment in the a-b plane is about 84° away from the a axis. These results are consistent with the prediction of our electronic structure calculations for the transition dipole moment of the π – π * excited state.},

In this study, phenol–helium clusters (PhOH–He n with n ≤ 2) are characterized for the first time by UV and IR spectroscopies. The S 1 ← S 0 origin and ionization energy both show small but additive shifts, suggesting π-bound structures of these clusters, a conclusion supported by rotational contour analyses of the S 1 origin bands. The OH stretching vibrations of the PhOH moiety in the clusters match with those of bare PhOH in both the S 0 and D 0 states, illustrating the negligible perturbation of the He atoms on the molecular vibration. Matrix shifts induced by He attachment are discussed based on the observed band positions with the help of complementary quantum chemical calculations.

While furan has only one conformer, n-hexane exists in multiple conformations. The conformational landscape of the binary complex was systematically explored by using a semiempirical conformational search tool, namely CREST. The CREST conformational candidates were subjected to further geometry optimization and harmonic frequency calculations at the B3LYP-D3BJ/def2-TZVP level of theory, resulting in 34 minima within an energy window of 5 kJ mol −1 . The three most stable furan⋯hexane minima all contain the most stable n-hexane conformer subunit and are separated by relatively low conformational conversion barriers. Additional calculations were carried out to support the conclusive identification of the global minimum structure responsible for the set of assigned rotational transitions. These include calculations at the B3LYP-D3BJ level with the aug-cc-pVTZ and 6-311++G(d,p) basis sets and the MP2/def2-TZVP level, as well as the single point energy calculations at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVDZ level. Further non-covalent interaction and principal interacting orbital analyses show that the synergy of the π furan → σ* hexane and σ hexane → π* furan interactions plays an important role in stabilizing the observed furan–hexane conformer.},

  abstract = {The remote sensing of abundance and properties of HCl—the main atmospheric reservoir of Cl atoms that directly participate in ozone depletion—is important for monitoring the partitioning of chlorine between “ozone-depleting” and “reservoir” species. Such remote studies require knowledge of the shapes of molecular resonances of HCl, which are perturbed by collisions with the molecules of the surrounding air. In this work, we report the first fully quantum calculations of collisional perturbations of the shape of a pure rotational line in H 35 Cl perturbed by an air-relevant molecule [as the first model system we choose the R(0) line in HCl perturbed by O 2 ]. The calculations are performed on our new highly accurate HCl( X 1 Σ + )–O 2 ( ⁠ X 3 Σ g − ⁠ ) potential energy surface. In addition to pressure broadening and shift, we also determine their speed dependencies and the complex Dicke parameter. This gives important input to the community discussion on the physical meaning of the complex Dicke parameter and its relevance for atmospheric spectra (previously, the complex Dicke parameter for such systems was mainly determined from phenomenological fits to experimental spectra and the physical meaning of its value in that context is questionable). We also calculate the temperature dependence of the line shape parameters and obtain agreement with the available experimental data. We estimate the total combined uncertainties of our calculations at 2\% relative root-mean-square error in the simulated line shape at 296 K. This result constitutes an important step toward computational population of spectroscopic databases with accurate ab initio line shape parameters for molecular systems of terrestrial atmospheric importance.},

  abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics (MD) has been shown to be effective in simulating heat conduction in certain molecular junctions since it inherently takes into account some essential methodological components which are lacking in the quantum Landauer-type transport model, such as many-body full force-field interactions, anharmonicity effects and nonlinear responses for large temperature biases. However, the classical MD reaches its limit in the environments where the quantum effects are significant (e.g. with low-temperatures substrates, presence of extremely high frequency molecular modes). Here, we present an atomistic simulation methodology for molecular heat conduction that incorporates the quantum Bose–Einstein statistics into an “effective temperature” in the form of a modified Langevin equation. We show that the results from such a quasi-classical effective temperature MD method deviates drastically when the baths temperature approaches zero from classical MD simulations and the results converge to the classical ones when the bath approaches the high-temperature limit, which makes the method suitable for full temperature range. In addition, we show that our quasi-classical thermal transport method can be used to model the conducting substrate layout and molecular composition (e.g. anharmonicities, high-frequency modes). Anharmonic models are explicitly simulated via the Morse potential and compared to pure harmonic interactions to show the effects of anharmonicities under quantum colored bath setups. Finally, the chain length dependence of heat conduction is examined for one-dimensional polymer chains placed in between quantum augmented baths.},

This discrete propagator is universal , having the same two hyperbolic coefficient functions for all short-time propagators. Individual short-time propagator only modifies the coefficient function’s argument, its portal parameter, whose convergent order is the same as the thermodynamic energy. Moreover, the thermodynamic energy can be given in a closed form for any short-time propagator. Since the portal parameter can be systematically optimized by matching the expansion of the product of the two coefficients, any short-time propagator can be optimized sequentially , order by order, by matching the product coefficient’s expansion alone, without computing the energy. Previous empirical findings on the convergence of fourth and sixth-order propagators can now be understood analytically. An eight-order convergent short-time propagator is also derived.},

  abstract = {We use quantum trajectory theory to study the dynamics of the first step in photosynthesis for a single photon interacting with photosystem II (PSII). By considering individual trajectories we are able to look beyond the ensemble average dynamics to compute the PSII system evolution conditioned upon individual photon counting measurements. Measurements of the transmitted photon beam strongly affects the system state, since detection of an outgoing photon confirms that the PSII must be in the electronic ground state, while a null measurement implies it is in an excited electronic state. We show that under ideal conditions, observing the null result transforms a state with a low excited state population to a state with nearly all population contained in the excited states. We study the PSII dynamics conditioned on such photon counting for both a pure excitonic model of PSII and a more realistic model with exciton-phonon coupling to a dissipative phononic environment. In the absence of such coupling, we show that the measured fluorescence rates show oscillations constituting a photon-counting witness of excitonic coherence. Excitonic coupling to the phonon environment has a strong effect on the observed rates of fluorescence, damping the oscillations. Addition of non-radiative decay and incoherent transitions to radical pair states in the reaction center to the phononic model allows extraction of a quantum efficiency of 92.5\% from the long-time evolution, consistent with bulk experimental measurements.},

  abstract = {The generalized master equation (GME) provides a powerful approach to study biomolecular dynamics via non-Markovian dynamic models built from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Previously, we have implemented the GME, namely the quasi Markov State Model (qMSM), where we explicitly calculate the memory kernel and propagate dynamics using a discretized GME. qMSM can be constructed with much shorter MD trajectories than the MSM. However, since qMSM needs to explicitly compute the time-dependent memory kernels, it is heavily affected by the numerical fluctuations of simulation data when applied to study biomolecular conformational changes. This can lead to numerical instability of predicted long-time dynamics, greatly limiting the applicability of qMSM in complicated biomolecules. We present a new method, the Integrative GME (IGME), in which we analytically solve the GME under the condition when the memory kernels have decayed to zero. Our IGME overcomes the challenges of the qMSM by using the time integrations of memory kernels, thereby avoiding the numerical instability caused by explicit computation of time-dependent memory kernels. Using our solutions of the GME, we have developed a new approach to compute long-time dynamics based on MD simulations in a numerically stable, accurate and efficient way. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we have applied the IGME in three biomolecules: the alanine dipeptide, FIP35 WW-domain, and Taq RNA polymerase. In each system, the IGME achieves significantly smaller fluctuations for both memory kernels and long-time dynamics compared to the qMSM. We anticipate that the IGME can be widely applied to investigate biomolecular conformational changes.},

Recently, the theory was extended to atomistically describe binding processes by adopting the host–guest interaction energy as the reaction coordinate. The binding rate constants can be estimated by computing the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the reactive state existing in the binding processes. Here, we propose a methodology based on the RP theory in conjunction with the energy representation theory of solution, applicable to complex binding phenomena, such as protein–ligand binding. The derived scheme of calculating the equilibrium constant between the reactive and dissociate states, required in the RP theory, can be used for arbitrary types of reactive states. We apply the present method to the bindings of small fragment molecules [4-hydroxy-2-butanone (BUT) and methyl methylthiomethyl sulphoxide (DSS)] to FK506 binding protein (FKBP) in an aqueous solution. Estimated binding rate constants are consistent with those obtained from long-timescale MD simulations. Furthermore, by decomposing the rate constants to the thermodynamic and kinetic contributions, we clarify that the higher thermodynamic stability of the reactive state for DSS causes the faster binding kinetics compared with BUT.},

Our use of UGA in the context of state-specific (SS) Jeziorski–Monkhorst Ansatz based multireference coupled cluster (MRCC) theory obviates the non-commutativity between the spin-free cluster operators via a normal ordered exponential parametrization in the wave operator. A previous formulation of UGA-SSMRCC by us [R. Maitra, D. Sinha, and D. Mukherjee, J. Chem. Phys. 137 , 024105 (2012)], using the same ansatz, employed certain sufficiency conditions to reach the final working equations, which cannot be improved systematically. In this article, we will present a more rigorous formulation that follows from an exact factorization of the unlinked terms of the Bloch equation, resulting in equations on which a hierarchy of approximations can be systematically performed on the emergent additional terms. This derivation was shown in our recent article [D. Chakravarti, S. Sen, and D. Mukherjee, Mol. Phys. 119 , e1979676 (2021)] in the context of a single open shell CC formalism and was applied to spectroscopic energy differences where the contribution of the new terms was found to be of the order of ∼0.001 eV for ionization potential, electron affinity, and excitation energy. In the current work, we will present a comparison between the earlier and current formulations via both a theoretical analysis and a numerical demonstration of the dramatic effect of the additional terms brought in by the factorization on potential energy curves. The contribution of such terms was found to gain importance with an increase in the number of singly occupied active orbitals in the model space functions.},

  abstract = {The equilibrium association of transmembrane proteins plays a fundamental role in membrane protein function and cellular signaling. While the study of the equilibrium binding of single pass transmembrane proteins has received significant attention in experiment and simulation, the accurate assessment of equilibrium association constants remains a challenge to experiment and simulation. In experiment, there remain wide variations in association constants derived from experimental studies of the most widely studied transmembrane proteins. In simulation, state-of-the art methods have failed to adequately sample the thermodynamically relevant structures of the dimer state ensembles using coarse-grained models. In addition, all-atom force fields often fail to accurately assess the relative free energies of the dimer and monomer states. Given the importance of this fundamental biophysical process, it is essential to address these shortcomings. In this work, we establish an effective computational protocol for the calculation of equilibrium association constants for transmembrane homodimer formation. A set of transmembrane protein homodimers, used in the parameterization of the MARTINI v3 force field, are simulated using metadynamics, based on three collective variables. The method is found to be accurate and computationally efficient, providing a standard to be used in the future simulation studies using coarse-grained or all-atom models.},

  abstract = {The Fermi–Amaldi correction to the electrostatic self-repulsion of the particle density is usually regarded as a semi-classical exchange functional that happens to be exact only for one- and closed-shell two-electron systems. We show that this functional can be derived quantum-mechanically and is exact for any number of fermions or bosons of arbitrary spin as long as the particles occupy the same spatial orbital. The Fermi–Amaldi functional is also size-consistent for such systems, provided that the factor N in its expression is understood as an orbital occupation number rather than the total number of particles. These properties of the Fermi–Amaldi functional are ultimately related to the fact that it is a special case of the self-exchange energy formula. Implications of our findings are discussed.},

  abstract = {We report a method to predict equilibrium concentration profiles of hard ellipses in nonuniform fields, including multiphase equilibria of fluid, nematic, and crystal phases. Our model is based on a balance of osmotic pressure and field mediated forces by employing the local density approximation. Implementation of this model requires development of accurate equations of state for each phase as a function of hard ellipse aspect ratio in the range k = 1–9. The predicted density profiles display overall good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations for hard ellipse aspect ratios k = 2, 4, and 6 in gravitational and electric fields with fluid–nematic, fluid–crystal, and fluid–nematic–crystal multiphase equilibria. The profiles of local order parameters for positional and orientational order display good agreement with values expected for bulk homogeneous hard ellipses in the same density ranges. Small discrepancies between predictions and simulations are observed at crystal–nematic and crystal–fluid interfaces due to limitations of the local density approximation, finite system sizes, and uniform periodic boundary conditions. The ability of the model to capture multiphase equilibria of hard ellipses in nonuniform fields as a function of particle aspect ratio provides a basis to control anisotropic particle microstructure on interfacial energy landscapes in diverse materials and applications.},

  abstract = {How to fabricate perpendicularly oriented domains (PODs) of lamellar and cylinder phases in block copolymer thin films remains a major challenge. In this work, via a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation study, we report a solvent evaporation strategy starting from a mixed solution of A- b -B-type diblock copolymers (DBCs) and single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) with the same composition, which is capable of spontaneously generating PODs in drying DBC films induced by the interface segregation of SCNPs. The latter occurs at both the free surface and substrate and, consequently, neutralizes the interface selectivity of distinct blocks in DBCs, leading to spontaneous formation of PODs at both interfaces. The interface segregation of SCNPs is related to the weak solvophilicity of the internal cross-linker units. A mean-field theory calculation demonstrates that the increase in the chemical potential of SCNPs in the bulk region drives their interface segregation along with solvent evaporation. We believe that such a strategy can be useful in regulating the PODs of DBC films in practical applications.},

When the neural network is trained until “early stopping”—when the loss value of the test set increases—we calculate accurate free energy differences between thermodynamic states with spring centers separated by 1 Å and sometimes 2 Å.

  abstract = {N-6 methyladenosine is the most abundant nucleic acid modification in eukaryotes and plays a crucial role in gene regulation. The AlkB family of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases is responsible for nucleic acid demethylation. Recent studies have discovered that a chemical demethylation system using hydrogen peroxide and ammonium bicarbonate can effectively demethylate nucleic acids. The addition of ferrous ammonium sulfate boosts the oxidation rate by forming a Fenton reagent with hydrogen peroxide. However, the specific mechanism and key steps of this process remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the influence of ferrous ammonium sulfate concentration on the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of the chemical demethylation system using LC-MS. As the concentration of ferrous ions increases, the observed KIE decreases from 1.377 ± 0.020 to 1.120 ± 0.016, indicating a combination of the primary isotope effect and inverse α-secondary isotope effect with the ion pairing effect. We propose that the initial hydrogen extraction is the rate-limiting step and observe a tight transition state structure in the formation of the hm 6 A process through the analysis of KIE trends. The concentration-dependent KIE provides a novel perspective on the mechanism of chemical demethylation and offers a chemical model for enzyme-catalyzed demethylation.},

  abstract = {Ultrafast spectroscopy is a powerful technique that utilizes short pulses on the femtosecond time scale to generate and probe coherent responses in molecular systems. While the specific ultrafast methodologies vary, the most common data analysis tools rely on discrete Fourier transformation for recovering coherences that report on electronic or vibrational states and multi-exponential fitting for probing population dynamics, such as excited-state relaxation. These analysis tools are widely used due to their perceived reliability in estimating frequencies and decay rates. Here, we demonstrate that such “black box” methods for parameter estimation often lead to inaccurate results even in the absence of noise. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach based on Bayes probability theory that simultaneously accounts for both population and coherence contributions to the signal. This Bayesian inference method offers accurate parameter estimations across a broad range of experimental conditions, including scenarios with high noise and data truncation. In contrast to traditional methods, Bayesian inference incorporates prior information about the measured signal and noise, leading to improved accuracy. Moreover, it provides estimator error bounds, enabling a systematic statistical framework for interpreting confidence in the results. By employing Bayesian inference, all parameters of a realistic model system may be accurately recovered, even in extremely challenging scenarios where Fourier and multi-exponential fitting methods fail. This approach offers a more reliable and comprehensive analysis tool for time-resolved coherent spectroscopy, enhancing our understanding of molecular systems and enabling a better interpretation of experimental data.},

However, there still needs to be more clarity regarding the role of microscopic properties of interlayer functionalized interfaces on device behavior. Here, we show that the impact of functionalized electrodes on device characteristics can be predicted by a few critical computationally derived parameters representing the interface charge distribution and orbital interactions. The significant influences of interfacial orbital interactions and charge distribution over device and interface properties are exhibited. Accordingly, a function is developed based on these parameters that capture their effect on the interface resistance. A strong correlation is observed, such that enhanced orbital interactions and reduced charge separation at the interface correspond to low resistance regardless of the individual molecules utilized as the interlayer. The charge distribution and orbital interactions vary with the molecular structure of the interlayer, allowing the tuning of device characteristics. Hence, the proposed function serves as a guideline for molecular design and selection for interlayers in organic devices.},

Resolution on the atomistic scale is too computationally expensive to cover mesoscopic time and length scales on which the interesting polymer phenomena are observed.

In this work, the solvent is simulated using the well-established multi-particle collision dynamics scheme, and for the polymer, different coarse-graining methods are employed and compared against the monomer resolved Kremer–Grest model by their resulting diffusion coefficients. This research builds on previous work [Ruiz-Franco et al. , J. Chem.

It was found that both proposed models are not well suited to ring polymers; however, the introduction of a factor to the PSC model delivers satisfying results for the diffusion behavior by regulating the interaction intensity with the solvent.},

  abstract = {Mastering the manipulation of the electron spin plays a crucial role in comprehending the behavior of organic materials in several applications, such as asymmetric catalysis, chiroptical switches, and electronic devices. A promising avenue for achieving such precise control lies in the Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons with a favored spin exhibit preferential transport through chiral assemblies of specific handedness. Chiral supramolecular polymers emerge as excellent candidates for exploring the CISS effect due to their ability to modulate their helical structure through noncovalent interactions. In this context, systems capable of responding to external stimuli are particularly intriguing, sometimes even displaying chirality inversion. This study unveils spin selectivity in chiral supramolecular polymers, derived from single enantiomers, through scanning tunneling microscopy conducted in scanning tunneling spectroscopy mode. Following two distinct sample preparation protocols for each enantiomer, we generate supramolecular polymers with opposite handedness and specific spin transport characteristics. Our primary focus centers on chiral π-conjugated building blocks, with the aim of advancing novel systems that can inspire the organic spintronics community from a supramolecular chemistry level.},

  abstract = {The interfacial behavior of macromolecules dictates their intermolecular interactions, which can impact the processing and application of polymers for pharmaceutical and synthetic use. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we observe the evolution of a random heteropolymer in the presence of liquid–liquid interfaces. The system of interest forms single-chain nanoparticles through hydrophobic collapse in water, lacking permanent crosslinks and making their morphology mutable in new environments. Complex amphiphilic polymers are shown to be capable of stabilizing high interfacial tension water–hexane interfaces, often unfolding to maximize surface coverage. Despite drastic changes to polymer conformation, monomer presence in the water phase is generally maintained and most changes are due to increased hydrophobic solvent exposure toward the oil phase. These results are then compared to the behavior at the water–graphene interface, where the macromolecules adsorb but do not remodel. The polymer’s behavior is shown to depend significantly on both its own amphiphilic character and the deformability of the interface.},

  abstract = {Comb-like polymers have shown potential as advanced materials for a diverse palette of applications due to the tunability of their polymer architecture. To date, however, it still remains a challenge to understand how the conformational properties of these polymers arise from the interplay of their architectural parameters. In this work, extensive simulations were performed using dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the effect of grafting density, backbone length, and sidechain length on the conformations of comb-like polymers immersed in a good solvent. To quantify the effect of these architectural parameters on polymer conformations, we computed the asphericity, radius of gyration, and backbone and sidechain end-to-end distances. Bond–bond correlation functions and effective Kuhn lengths were computed to quantify the topological stiffness induced by sidechain–sidechain interactions. Simulation results reveal that the effective Kuhn length increases as grafting density and sidechain length increase, in agreement with previous experimental and theoretical studies. This increase in stiffness results in comb-like polymers adopting extended conformations as grafting density and sidechain length increase. Simulation results regarding the radius of gyration of comb-like polymers as a function of grafting density are compared with scaling theory predictions based on a free energy proposed by Morozova and Lodge [ACS Macro Lett. 6 , 1274–1279 (2017)] and scaling arguments by Tang et al.

  abstract = {The recent demonstration of the existence of an intimate relationship between the chiral structure of some materials and the spin polarization of electrons transmitted through them, what has been called the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, is sparking interest in many related phenomena. One of the most notorious is the possibility of using magnetic materials to apply enantioselective interactions on chiral molecules and chemical reactions involving them. In this work, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has been used to characterize the adsorption and growth kinetics of enantiopure organic molecules on magnetic (Co) and non-magnetic (Cu) substrates. While on these latter, no significant enantiosensitive effects are found, on spin-polarized, in-plane magnetized Co surfaces, the two enantiomers have been found to deposit differently. The observed effects have been interpreted as the result of one of the enantiomers being adsorbed in a transient, weakly bound physisorbed-like state with higher mobility due to limited, spin-selective charge transfer between it and the substrate. The study of these phenomena can provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the CISS effect.},

Tribotronic response, however, is expected to be highly size dependent, which represents a significant design challenge. To explore this issue, quartz crystal microbalance and cyclic voltammetry were employed to characterize nanotribological and electrochemical behavior of platinum–nanofluid interfaces formed by aqueous suspensions of different-sized negatively charged titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) NPs. Suspensions of 5, 40, and 100 nm NPs were all observed to reduced interfacial frictional drag forces upon introduction into pure water in zero field conditions, with reductions for the 40 nm NPs about twice those of 5 nm particles at comparable concentrations. Suspensions of 100 nm NPs produced even greater reductions, but rapidly precipitated from the suspension when left unstirred. NPs were also driven to and from Pt electrode surfaces by applying external electric fields with varying amplitudes and modulation frequencies. For electric fields of sufficient amplitude and duration, the 40 nm TiO 2 nanosuspension exhibited tribological properties consistent with a reversible electrophoretic deposition of the NPs, accompanied by changes in the electrochemical attributes and increasing interfacial drag. The 5 nm NP properties were consistent with progressive reductions in interfacial drag forces at the NP–suspension interface linked to field-induced increases in concentration.},

  abstract = {Cutting of soft materials is a complex problem, which is still not well understood at the fundamental level, especially for soft materials. The cutting process we consider is slicing, which starts with indentation, followed by sliding of a knife on the material to be cut. Here, we describe cutting experiments on PDMS elastomers with three different moduli. Our experiments reveal typical stages of this cutting process, starting with indentation and ending at steady state cutting. The process starts with a pre-cutting phase in which the blade does not slip grossly relative to the solid to be cut, and deformation is mostly elastic. Slip of the blade initiates suddenly and is often accompanied by initiation of cutting. Cutting is relatively smooth in the next stage, which requires a continuous increase in shear force. For soft PDMS, this smooth cutting stage is followed by one in which folds or creases form on the cutting surface. The corresponding shear force response is no longer smooth as “steady” sliding occurs in a stick–slip fashion with oscillatory forces. The average shear force reaches a plateau and no longer increases with shear displacement. Experimental observations of the various cutting stages are interpreted quantitatively.},

Moreover, large quantity of chiral molecules is required, causing low detection efficiency. Here, a self-assembled monolayer of polypeptides has been fabricated to realize trace detection of chirality based on spin selectivity of photon–electron interaction. We have utilized Kerr technique to detect the rotation angle by the molecular monolayer, which indicates the chirality of polypeptides. The chiral structure of a biological molecule could result in spin-selectivity of electrons and thus influence the interaction between electron spin and light polarization. A Kerr rotation angle of ∼3° has been obviously observed, equivalent to the magneto-optic Kerr effect without magnetic material or magnetic field. Furthermore, we have provided a novel solution to achieve chirality discrimination and amplification simultaneously through an optical fiber. The proposed design is applicable for chiral detection via increasing their differential output signal, which clearly demonstrates a useful strategy toward chirality characterization of biological molecules.},

Both experimental and fluid simulation studies were carried out. Utilizing this novel hybrid method, the controllable preparation of superamphiphobic micro–nano symbiotic structures was realized. The experimental results showed that the prepared surfaces had excellent superamphiphobic properties following subsequent modification with low surface energy substances. The contact angles of water droplets and oil droplets on the surface following electrodeposition treatment reached values of 161 ± 4° and 151 ± 4°, respectively, which showed that the prepared surface possessed perfect superamphiphobicity.

Benefiting from unique electrical features and a bi-layered structure of CZTSSe, the memristor exhibits highly stable nonvolatile resistive switching with excellent spatial uniformity, concentrated Set/Reset voltage distribution (variation 10 4 ), and long retention time (&gt;10 4 s). A possible mechanism of the switching behavior in such a device is proposed. Furthermore, these memristors successfully achieve essential bio-synaptic functions under both electrical and various visible light (470–655 nm) stimulations, including electrical-induced excitatory postsynaptic current, paired pulse facilitation, long-term potentiation, long-term depression, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, as well as light-stimulated short-/long-term plasticity and learning-forgetting-relearning process. As such, the proposed neotype kesterite-based memristor demonstrates significant potential in facilitating artificial optoelectronic synapses and enabling neuromorphic computation.},

A microscopic understanding of this robust phenomenology is, however, lacking because experimental resolution is limited. We simulate the heterogeneous transformation kinetics of ultrastable configurations prepared using the swap Monte Carlo algorithm, thus allowing a direct comparison with experiments. We resolve the liquid–glass interface both in space and in time as well as the underlying particle motion responsible for its propagation. We perform a detailed statistical analysis of the interface geometry and kinetics over a broad range of temperatures. We show that the dynamic heterogeneity of the bulk liquid is passed on to the front that propagates heterogeneously in space and intermittently in time. This observation allows us to relate the averaged front velocity to the equilibrium diffusion coefficient of the liquid. We suggest that an experimental characterization of the interface geometry during the heterogeneous devitrification of ultrastable glassy films could provide direct experimental access to the long-sought characteristic length scale of dynamic heterogeneity in bulk supercooled liquids.},

Thermal diffusion in fluid mixtures has been interpreted recently in terms of the so-called (pseudo-)isotopic Soret effect but only considering the mass and moment of inertia differences of the molecules. We demonstrate that the first moment of the molecular mass distribution, the mass dipole , contributes significantly to the isotopic Soret effect. To probe this physical effect, we investigate fluid mixtures consisting of rigid linear molecules that differ only by the first moment of their mass distributions. We demonstrate that such mixtures have non-zero Soret coefficients in contrast with S T = 0 predicted by current formulations. For the isotopic mixtures investigated in this work, the dependence of S T on the mass dipole arises mainly through the thermal diffusion coefficient D T . In turn, D T is correlated with the dependence of the molecular librational modes on the mass dipole. We examine the interplay of the mass dipole and the moment of inertia in defining the isotopic Soret effect and propose empirical equations that include the mass dipole contribution.},

  abstract = {Understanding the condensed-phase behavior of chiral molecules is important in biology as well as in a range of technological applications, such as the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study a chiral four-site molecular model that exhibits a second-order symmetry-breaking phase transition from a supercritical racemic liquid into subcritical D-rich and L-rich liquids. We determine the infinite-size critical temperature using the fourth-order Binder cumulant, and we show that the finite-size scaling behavior of the order parameter is compatible with the 3D Ising universality class. We also study the spontaneous D-rich to L-rich transition at a slightly subcritical temperature of T = 0.985 T c , and our findings indicate that the free energy barrier for this transformation increases with system size as N 2/3 , where N is the number of molecules, consistent with a surface-dominated phenomenon. The critical behavior observed herein suggests a mechanism for chirality selection in which a liquid of chiral molecules spontaneously forms a phase enriched in one of the two enantiomers as the temperature is lowered below the critical point. Furthermore, the increasing free energy barrier with system size indicates that fluctuations between the L-rich and D-rich phases are suppressed as the size of the system increases, trapping it in one of the two enantiomerically enriched phases. Such a process could provide the basis for an alternative explanation for the origin of biological homochirality. We also conjecture the possibility of observing nucleation at subcritical temperatures under the action of a suitable chiral external field.},

  abstract = {Parity non-conservation (PNC) due to the weak interaction is predicted to give rise to enantiomer dependent vibrational constants in chiral molecules, but the phenomenon has so far eluded experimental observation. The enhanced sensitivity of molecules to physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) has led to substantial advances in molecular precision spectroscopy, and these may be applied to PNC searches as well. Specifically, trapped molecular ion experiments leverage the universality of trapping charged particles to optimize the molecular ion species studied toward BSM searches, but in searches for PNC, only a few chiral molecular ion candidates have been proposed so far. Importantly, viable candidates need to be internally cold, and their internal state populations should be detectable with high quantum efficiency. To this end, we focus on molecular ions that can be created by near threshold resonant two-photon ionization and detected via state-selective photo-dissociation. Such candidates need to be stable in both charged and neutral chiral versions to be amenable to these methods. Here, we present a collection of suitable chiral molecular ion candidates we have found, including CHDBrI + and CHCaBrI + , that fulfill these conditions according to our ab initio calculations. We find that organo-metallic species have low ionization energy as neutrals and relatively high dissociation thresholds. Finally, we compute the magnitude of the PNC values for vibrational transitions for some of these candidates. An experimental demonstration of state preparation and readout for these candidates will be an important milestone toward measuring PNC in chiral molecules for the first time.},

The mass-selected Auger-electron spectra show that these fragments are associated with higher binding energy final states. Furthermore, ionization of the C 1s electron leads to a higher propensity for C–H bond fission compared to O 1s ionization. Following resonant Auger–Meitner decay after 1s → 3 π excitation, 12 different ionic products are formed. At the C 1s edge, the parent ion HCNO + is significantly more stable compared to the other two edges, which we also attribute to the higher contribution of final states with low binding energies in the C 1s resonant Auger electron spectra.},

  abstract = {The formation of angulon, stemming from the rotor (molecule or impurity), rotating in the quantum many-body field, adds a new member to the quasi-particles’ family and has aroused intense interest in multiple research fields. However, the analysis of the coupling strength between the rotor and its hosting environment remains a challenging task, both in theory and experiment. Here, we develop the all-coupling theory of the angulon by introducing a unitary transformation, where the renormalization of the rotational constants for different molecules in the helium nanodroplets is reproduced, getting excellent agreement with the experimental data collected during the past decades. Moreover, the strength of molecule-helium coupling and the effective radius of the solvation shell co-rotating along with the molecular rotor could be estimated qualitatively. This model not only provides significant enlightenment for analyzing the rotational spectroscopy of molecules in the phononic environment, but also provides a new method to study the transfer of the phonon angular momentum in the angulon frame.},

The excited state dynamics in the trans -dithionated PDI (S2-PDI) are studied here. Unlike PDI, the photo absorbing ππ * state of S2-PDI is in close proximity to quasi-degenerate nπ * states. The latter exhibits an interesting vibronic problem leading to the breaking of orbital symmetry mediated through non-totally symmetric vibrations. The time-dependent quantum dynamics are studied with a diabatic model Hamiltonian involving three singlet and three triplet states coupled via 22 vibrational modes. A combined effect of multiple internal-conversion and inter-system crossing (ISC) pathways leads to population transfer from the 1 ππ * state to the 3 ππ * state via the nπ * states, with an overall ISC rate of 0.70 ps that compares well with the experimental value. The calculated absorption spectra for PDI and S2-PDI reproduce the essential vibronic features in the observed experimental spectra. The dominant vibronic progressions are found to have significant contributions from the vinyl stretching modes of the PDI core.},

By eliminating all the vibrational hot bands, we can resolve the complicated detachment transitions due to the open-shell nature of BiB and the strong spin–orbit coupling. The electron affinity of BiB is measured to be 2.010(1) eV. The ground state of BiB − is determined to be 2 Π(3/2) with a σ 2 π 3 valence electron configuration, while the ground state of BiB is found to be 3 Σ − (0 + ) with a σ 2 π 2 electron configuration. Eight low-lying spin–orbit excited states [ 3 Σ − (1), 1 Δ(2), 1 Σ + (0 + ), 3 Π(2), 3 Π(1), 1 Π(1)], including two forbidden transitions, [ 3 Π(0 − ) and 3 Π(0 + )], are observed for BiB as a result of electron detachment from the σ and π orbitals of BiB − . The angular distribution information from the photoelectron imaging is found to be critical to distinguish detachment transitions from the σ or π orbital for the spectral assignment. This study provides a wealth of information about the low-lying electronic states and spin–orbit coupling of BiB, demonstrating the importance of cryogenic cooling for obtaining well-resolved photoelectron spectra for size-selected clusters produced from a laser vaporization cluster source.},

  abstract = {Quantum light is increasingly recognized as a promising resource for developing optical measurement techniques. Particular attention has been paid to enhancing the precision of the measurements beyond classical techniques by using nonclassical correlations between quantum entangled photons. Recent advances in the quantum optics technology have made it possible to manipulate spectral and temporal properties of entangled photons, and photon correlations can facilitate the extraction of matter information with relatively simple optical systems compared to conventional schemes. In these respects, the applications of entangled photons to time-resolved spectroscopy can open new avenues for unambiguously extracting information on dynamical processes in complex molecular and materials systems. Here, we propose time-resolved spectroscopy in which specific signal contributions are selectively enhanced by harnessing nonclassical correlations of entangled photons. The entanglement time characterizes the mutual delay between an entangled twin and determines the spectral distribution of photon correlations. The entanglement time plays a dual role as the knob for controlling the accessible time region of dynamical processes and the degrees of spectral selectivity. In this sense, the role of the entanglement time is substantially equivalent to the temporal width of the classical laser pulse. The results demonstrate that the application of quantum entangled photons to time-resolved spectroscopy leads to monitoring dynamical processes in complex molecular and materials systems by selectively extracting desired signal contributions from congested spectra. We anticipate that more elaborately engineered photon states would broaden the availability of quantum light spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {For a system without spin–orbit coupling, the (i) nuclear plus electronic linear momentum and (ii) nuclear plus orbital electronic angular momentum are good quantum numbers. Thus, when a molecular system undergoes a nonadiabatic transition, there should be no change in the total linear or angular momentum. Now, the standard surface hopping algorithm ignores the electronic momentum and indirectly equates the momentum of the nuclear degrees of freedom to the total momentum. However, even with this simplification, the algorithm still does not conserve either the nuclear linear or the nuclear angular momenta. Here, we show that one way to address these failures is to dress the derivative couplings (i.e., the hopping directions) in two ways: (i) we disallow changes in the nuclear linear momentum by working in a translating basis (which is well known and leads to electron translation factors) and (ii) we disallow changes in the nuclear angular momentum by working in a basis that rotates around the center of mass [which is not well-known and leads to a novel, rotationally removable component of the derivative coupling that we will call electron rotation factors below, cf. Eq. (96) ]. The present findings should be helpful in the short term as far as interpreting surface hopping calculations for singlet systems (without spin) and then developing the new surface hopping algorithm in the long term for systems where one cannot ignore the electronic orbital and/or spin angular momentum.},

The RKB-RI algorithm incorporates the restricted-kinetic-balance condition and offers a versatile framework for accurate computations. Notably, the Cholesky integral decomposition is employed not only to approximate symmetric large-component electron repulsion integrals but also those involving small-component basis functions. In addition to comprehensive error analysis, we investigate crucial conditions, such as the kinetic balance condition and variational stability, which underlie the applicability of Dirac relativistic electronic structure theory. We compare the computational cost of the RKB-RI approach with the full in-core method to assess its efficiency. To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the RKB-RI method proposed in this work, we employ actinyl oxides as benchmark systems, leveraging their properties for validation purposes. This investigation provides valuable insights into the capabilities and performance of the RKB-RI algorithm and establishes its potential as a powerful tool in the field of relativistic quantum chemistry.},

  abstract = {We aim to improve upon the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) approach for excitations replacing the Jastrow factor by an auxiliary bosonic (AB) ground state and multiplying it by a fermionic component factor. The instantaneous change in imaginary time of an arbitrary excitation in the original interacting fermionic system is obtained by measuring observables via the ground-state distribution of walkers of an AB system that is subject to an auxiliary effective potential. The effective potential is used to (i) drive the AB system’s ground-state configuration space toward the configuration space of the excitations of the original fermionic system and (ii) subtract from a diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculation contributions that can be included in conventional approximations, such as mean-field and configuration interaction (CI) methods. In this novel approach, the AB ground state is treated statistically in DMC, whereas the fermionic component of the original system is expanded in a basis. The excitation energies of the fermionic eigenstates are obtained by sampling a fermion–boson coupling term on the AB ground state. We show that this approach can take advantage of and correct for approximate eigenstates obtained via mean-field calculations or truncated interactions. We demonstrate that the AB ground-state factor incorporates the correlations missed by standard Jastrow factors, further reducing basis truncation errors. Relevant parts of the theory have been tested in soluble model systems and exhibit excellent agreement with exact analytical data and CI and VMC approaches. In particular, for limited basis set expansions and sufficient statistics, AB approaches outperform CI and VMC in terms of basis size for the same systems. The implementation of this method in current codes, despite being demanding, will be facilitated by reusing procedures already developed for calculating ground-state properties with DMC and excitations with VMC.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory is the workhorse of chemistry and materials science, and novel density functional approximations are published every year. To become available in program packages, the novel density functional approximations (DFAs) need to be (re)implemented. However, according to our experience as developers of Libxc [Lehtola et al. , SoftwareX 7 , 1 (2018)], a constant problem in this task is verification due to the lack of reliable reference data. As we discuss in this work, this lack has led to several non-equivalent implementations of functionals such as Becke–Perdew 1986, Perdew–Wang 1991, Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof, and Becke’s three-parameter hybrid functional with Lee–Yang–Parr correlation across various program packages, yielding different total energies. Through careful verification, we have also found many issues with incorrect functional forms in recent DFAs. The goal of this work is to ensure the reproducibility of DFAs. DFAs must be verifiable in order to prevent the reappearance of the above-mentioned errors and incompatibilities. A common framework for verification and testing is, therefore, needed. We suggest several ways in which reference energies can be produced with free and open source software, either with non-self-consistent calculations with tabulated atomic densities or via self-consistent calculations with various program packages. The employed numerical parameters—especially the quadrature grid—need to be converged to guarantee a ≲0.1 μE h precision in the total energy, which is nowadays routinely achievable in fully numerical calculations. Moreover, as such sub- μE h level agreement can only be achieved when fully equivalent implementations of the DFA are used, the source code of the reference implementation should also be made available in any publication describing a new DFA.},

Although PQE comes equipped with some degree of inherent noise resilience, any practical implementation with apposite accuracy would require additional routines to eliminate or mitigate the errors further. In this work, we propose a way to enhance the efficiency of PQE by developing an optimal framework for introducing Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) in the nonlinear iterative procedure that outlines the PQE, leading to the formulation of ZNE-PQE. Moreover, we perform a detailed analysis of how various components involved in it affect the accuracy and efficiency of the reciprocated energy convergence trajectory. Additionally, we investigate the underlying mechanism that leads to the improvements observed in ZNE-PQE over conventional PQE by performing a comparative analysis of their residue norm landscape. This approach is expected to facilitate practical applications of quantum computing in fields related to molecular sciences, where it is essential to determine molecular energies accurately.},

We here investigate the impact of polydispersity on particle currents for single-file Brownian motion of hard spheres when they are driven through periodic potentials by a constant drag force. Through theoretical analysis and extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we unveil the behavior of particle currents for random binary mixtures. The particle currents show a recurring pattern in dependence of the hard-sphere diameters and mixing ratio. We explain this recurrent behavior by showing that a basic unit cell exists in the space of the two hard-sphere diameters. Once the behavior of an observable inside the unit cell is determined, it can be inferred for any diameter. The overall variation of particle currents with the mixing ratio and hard-sphere diameters is reflected by their variation in the limit where the system is fully covered by hard spheres. In this limit, the currents can be predicted analytically. Our analysis explains the occurrence of pronounced maxima and minima of the currents by changes in the effective potential barrier for the center-of-mass motion.},

  abstract = {The use of oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) to promote and control chemical reactivity has motivated many theoretical and computational studies in the last decade to model the action of OEEFs on a molecular system and its effects on chemical processes. Given a reaction, a central goal in this research area is to predict the optimal OEEF (oOEEF) required to annihilate the reaction energy barrier with the smallest possible field strength. Here, we present a model rooted in catastrophe and optimum control theories that allows us to find the oOEEF for a given reaction valley in the potential energy surface (PES). In this model, the effective (or perturbed) PES of a polarizable molecular system is constructed by adding to the original, non-perturbed, PES a term accounting for the interaction of the OEEF with the intrinsic electric dipole and polarizability of the molecular system, so called the polarizable molecular electric dipole (PMED) model. We demonstrate that the oOEEF can be established by locating a point in the original PES with unique topological properties: the optimal barrier breakdown or bond-breaking point (oBBP). The essential feature of the oBBP structure is the fact that this point maintains its topological properties for all the applied OEEFs, also for the unperturbed PES, thus becoming much more relevant than the commonly used minima and transition state structures. The PMED model proposed here has been implemented in an open access package and is shown to successfully predict the oOEEF for two processes: an isomerization reaction of a cumulene derivative and the Huisgen cycloaddition reaction.},

  abstract = {In this computational study, we describe a self-consistent trajectory simulation approach to capture the effect of neutral gas pressure on ion–ion mutual neutralization (MN) reactions. The electron transfer probability estimated using Landau–Zener (LZ) transition state theory is incorporated into classical trajectory simulations to elicit predictions of MN cross sections in vacuum and rate constants at finite neutral gas pressures. Electronic structure calculations with multireference configuration interaction and large correlation consistent basis sets are used to derive inputs to the LZ theory. The key advance of our trajectory simulation approach is the inclusion of the effect of ion-neutral interactions on MN using a Langevin representation of the effect of background gas on ion transport. For H + − H − and Li + − H(D) − , our approach quantitatively agrees with measured speed-dependent cross sections for up to ∼10 5 m/s. For the ion pair Ne + − Cl − , our predictions of the MN rate constant at ∼1 Torr are a factor of ∼2 to 3 higher than the experimentally measured value. Similarly, for Xe + − F − in the pressure range of ∼20 000–80 000 Pa, our predictions of the MN rate constant are ∼20\% lower but are in excellent qualitative agreement with experimental data. The paradigm of using trajectory simulations to self-consistently capture the effect of gas pressure on MN reactions advanced here provides avenues for the inclusion of additional nonclassical effects in future work.},

  abstract = {Accurate and explainable artificial-intelligence (AI) models are promising tools for accelerating the discovery of new materials. Recently, symbolic regression has become an increasingly popular tool for explainable AI because it yields models that are relatively simple analytical descriptions of target properties. Due to its deterministic nature, the sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) method is a particularly promising approach for this application. Here, we describe the new advancements of the SISSO algorithm, as implemented into SISSO++, a C++ code with Python bindings. We introduce a new representation of the mathematical expressions found by SISSO. This is a first step toward introducing “grammar” rules into the feature creation step. Importantly, by introducing a controlled nonlinear optimization to the feature creation step, we expand the range of possible descriptors found by the methodology. Finally, we introduce refinements to the solver algorithms for both regression and classification, which drastically increase the reliability and efficiency of SISSO. For all these improvements to the basic SISSO algorithm, we not only illustrate their potential impact but also fully detail how they operate both mathematically and computationally.},

Due to these desirable properties, we implement the local gap model in the jellium-with-gap correlation energy, developing the local-density-approximation-with-gap correlation functional (named LDAg) that correctly gives correlation energies of atoms comparable with the LDA ones but shows an improvement for ionization potential of atoms and molecules.

In the present theoretical work, we demonstrate how the transformation and propagation of the density matrix in the basis of irreducible spherical tensors can be conveniently used to study sub-few fs spin–flip dynamics in core-excited transition metal compounds. With the help of the Wigner–Eckart theorem, such a transformation separates the essential dynamical information from the geometric factors governed by the angular momentum algebra. We show that an additional reduction can be performed by the physically motivated truncation of the spherical tensor basis. In particular, depending on the degree of coherence, the ultrafast dynamics can be considered semi-quantitative in the notably reduced spherical basis when only the total populations of the basis states of the given spin are of interest. Such truncation should be especially beneficial when the number of high-spin basis states is vast, as it reduces computational costs.},

The QED theory of THS-OA presented here is meant to be an extension of a previous study by Andrews [Symmetry 12 , 1466 (2020)]. In particular, the THS-OA phenomena are described within the Power–Zienau–Woolley multipolar Hamiltonian by including the electric-dipole, magnetic-dipole, and electric-quadrupole interactions for the absorption as well as the emission processes between the dynamic electromagnetic field (the photons) and matter. Moreover, we derive the expressions for the differential scattering ratios as a function of the scattering angle defined by the wavevectors of the incident and scattered photons. We show how the pure and mixed second hyperpolarizabilities can be obtained in the framework of response theory as specific cases of a generic cubic response function, thus enabling the computational implementation of THS-OA spectroscopy. We prove the origin-independence of the theory for exact wavefunctions. Preliminary computations on a prototype chiral molecule (methyloxirane) are considered together with an analysis of the basis set convergence and of the origin-dependence.},

  abstract = {Accurate multireference electronic structure calculations are important for constructing potential energy surfaces. Still, even in the case of low-scaling methods, their routine use is limited by the steep growth of the computational and storage costs as the active space grows. This is primarily due to the occurrence of three- and higher-body density matrices or, equivalently, their cumulants. This work examines the effect of various cumulant truncation schemes on the accuracy of the driven similarity renormalization group second-order multireference perturbation theory. We test four different levels of three-body reduced density cumulant truncations that set different classes of cumulant elements to zero. Our test cases include the singlet–triplet gap of CH 2 , the potential energy curves of the X Σ g + 1 and A Σ u + 3 states of N 2 , and the singlet–triplet splittings of oligoacenes. Our results show that both relative and absolute errors introduced by these cumulant truncations can be as small as 0.5 kcal mol −1 or less. At the same time, the amount of memory required is reduced from O ( N A 6 ) to O ( N A 5 ) ⁠ , where N A is the number of active orbitals. No additional regularization is needed to prevent the intruder state problem in the cumulant-truncated second-order driven similarity renormalization group multireference perturbation theory methods.},

In this paper, we show that for a small peptide, deca-alanine, metastable states can be identified through a neural net based on structural information alone. While processing molecular dynamics data, dimensionality reduction is a necessary step that projects high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional representation that, ideally, captures the conformational changes in the underlying data. Conventional methods make use of the temporal information contained in trajectories generated through integrating the equations of motion, which forgoes more efficient sampling schemes. We demonstrate that EncoderMap, an autoencoder architecture with an additional distance metric, can find a suitable low-dimensional representation to identify long-lived molecular conformations using exclusively structural information. For deca-alanine, which exhibits several helix-forming pathways, we show that this approach allows us to combine simulations with different biasing forces and yields representations comparable in quality to other established methods. Our results contribute to computational strategies for the rapid automatic exploration of the configuration space of peptides and proteins.},

  abstract = {Recent measurements of the third harmonic scattering responses of molecules have given a new impetus for computing molecular second hyperpolarizabilities ( γ ) and for deducing structure–property relationships. This paper has employed a variety of wavefunction and density functional theory methods to evaluate the second hyperpolarizability of the p -nitroaniline prototypical push-pull π -conjugated molecule, addressing also numerical aspects, such as the selection of an integration grid and the impact of the order of differentiation vs the achievable accuracy by using the Romberg quadrature. The reliability of the different methods has been assessed by comparison to reference Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles with perturbative treatment of the Triples results. On the one hand, among wavefunction methods, the MP2 scheme offers the best accuracy/cost ratio for computing the static γ . On the other hand, using density functional theory, γ remains a challenging property to compute because all conventional, global hybrid or range-separated hybrid, exchange–correlation functionals underestimate static γ values by at least 15\%. Even tuning the range-separating parameter to minimize the delocalization errors does not enable to improve the γ values. Nevertheless, the original double-hybrid B2-PLYP functional, which benefits from 27\% of PT2 correlation and 53\% Hartree–Fock exchange, provides accurate estimates of static γ values. Unfortunately, the best performing exchange–correlation functionals for γ are not necessarily reliable for the first hyperpolarizability, β , and vice versa. In fact, the β of p -nitroaniline ( p NA) could be predicted, with a good accuracy, with several hybrid exchange–correlation functionals (including by tuning the range-separating parameter), but these systematically underestimate γ . As for γ , the MP2 wavefunction method remains the best compromise to evaluate the first hyperpolarizability of p NA at low computational cost.},

For the first time, a variational calculation from ab initio potential energy surfaces is performed using the HBJ kinetic energy operator built from vibrational, large-amplitude motion, and rotational tensor operators expressed in terms of curvilinear and normal coordinates. Group theory for nonrigid molecules plays a central role in the characterization of the overall tunneling splittings and is discussed in the present approach.

While tremendous progress has been made in this area, however, the accurate atomistic descriptions at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces remain a great challenge. The Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) method and continuum modeling of the solvent and electrolyte interactions form the basis for most of these methodological developments. Several posterior corrections have been added to the CHE method to improve its accuracy and widen its applications. The most recently developed grand canonical potential approaches with the embedded diffuse layer models have shown considerable improvement in defining interfacial interactions at electrode/electrolyte interfaces over the state-of-the-art computational models for electrocatalysis. In this Review, we present an overview of these different computational models developed over the years to quantitatively probe the thermodynamics and kinetics of electrochemical reactions in the presence of an electrified catalyst surface under various electrochemical environments. We begin our discussion by giving a brief picture of the different continuum solvation approaches, implemented within the ab initio method to effectively model the solvent and electrolyte interactions. Next, we present the thermodynamic and kinetic modeling approaches to determine the activity and stability of the electrocatalysts. A few applications to these approaches are also discussed. We conclude by giving an outlook on the different machine learning models that have been integrated with the thermodynamic approaches to improve their efficiency and widen their applicability.},

  abstract = {Catalyzed by enormous success in the industrial sector, many research programs have been exploring data-driven, machine learning approaches. Performance can be poor when the model is extrapolated to new regions of chemical space, e.g., new bonding types, new many-body interactions. Another important limitation is the spatial locality assumption in model architecture, and this limitation cannot be overcome with larger or more diverse datasets. The outlined challenges are primarily associated with the lack of electronic structure information in surrogate models such as interatomic potentials. Given the fast development of machine learning and computational chemistry methods, we expect some limitations of surrogate models to be addressed in the near future; nevertheless spatial locality assumption will likely remain a limiting factor for their transferability. Here, we suggest focusing on an equally important effort—design of physics-informed models that leverage the domain knowledge and employ machine learning only as a corrective tool. In the context of material science, we will focus on semi-empirical quantum mechanics, using machine learning to predict corrections to the reduced-order Hamiltonian model parameters. The resulting models are broadly applicable, retain the speed of semiempirical chemistry, and frequently achieve accuracy on par with much more expensive ab initio calculations. These early results indicate that future work, in which machine learning and quantum chemistry methods are developed jointly, may provide the best of all worlds for chemistry applications that demand both high accuracy and high numerical efficiency.},

We tried two electron density functionals, Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and PBE-d3. PBE-d3 includes dispersion corrections to build in van der Waals interactions, which play a role in intermolecular bonding. Both DFT models predicted a low-frequency mode that has not been previously reported. We designed an experiment to search for this mode. Using a deliberately thick sample, intense synchrotron radiation, low temperatures, and temperature variation has enabled us to observe a new resonance at 1.79 ±0.01 THz. While the PBE and PBE-d3 spectra are similar and both match the low-energy experimental data, overall the PBE-d3 appears to be slightly superior. Further refinement still of the functional may lead to even better agreement with experiment above 2.4 THz.},

  abstract = {Cryptochrome 4a (Cry4a) has been proposed as the sensor at the heart of the magnetic compass in migratory songbirds. Blue-light excitation of this protein produces magnetically sensitive flavin–tryptophan radical pairs whose properties suggest that Cry4a could indeed be suitable as a magnetoreceptor. Here, we use cavity ring-down spectroscopy to measure magnetic field effects on the kinetics of these radical pairs in modified Cry4a proteins from the migratory European robin and from nonmigratory pigeon and chicken. B 1/2 , a parameter that characterizes the magnetic field-dependence of the reactions, was found to be larger than expected on the basis of hyperfine interactions and to increase with the delay between pump and probe laser pulses. Semiclassical spin dynamics simulations show that this behavior is consistent with a singlet–triplet dephasing (STD) relaxation mechanism. Analysis of the experimental data gives dephasing rate constants, r STD , in the range 3–6 × 10 7 s −1 . A simple “toy” model due to Maeda, Miura, and Arai [Mol. Phys. 104 , 1779–1788 (2006)] is used to shed light on the origin of the time-dependence and the nature of the STD mechanism. Under the conditions of the experiments, STD results in an exponential approach to spin equilibrium at a rate considerably slower than r STD . We attribute the loss of singlet–triplet coherence to electron hopping between the second and third tryptophans of the electron transfer chain and comment on whether this process could explain differences in the magnetic sensitivity of robin, chicken, and pigeon Cry4a’s.},

  abstract = {Torsional and bending deformations of DNA molecules often occur in vivo and are important for biological functions. DNA “under stress” is a conformational state, which is by far the most frequent state during DNA–protein and gene regulation. In DNA minicircles of length &lt; 100 base pairs (bp), the combined effect of torsional and bending stresses can cause local unusual conformations, with certain base pair steps often absorbing most of the stress, leaving other steps close to their relaxed conformation. To better understand the superhelical dynamics of DNA under stress, molecular simulations of 94 bp minicircles with different torsional linking numbers were interpreted using Fourier analyses and principal component analyses. Sharp localized bends of nearly 90° in the helical axis were observed, which in turn decreased fluctuations of the rotational register and helped redistribute the torsional stress into writhe, i.e., superhelical turn up to 360°. In these kinked minicircles, only two-thirds of the DNA molecule bends and writhes and the remaining segment stays close to straight and preserves a conformational flexibility typical of canonical B-DNA (bending of 39° ± 17° distributed parsimoniously across 36 bp), which was confirmed and visualized by principal component analysis. These results confirm that stressed DNA molecules are highly heterogeneous along their sequence, with segments designed to locally store and release stress so that nearby segments can stay relaxed.},

In this work, we use Wang–Landau sampling to study sequences of multiblock ( A n B n ) m copolymers on the simple cubic lattice, where n represents the block length and m represents the number of blocks. We first compare to the thermodynamic and structural properties of four sequences previously studied in the continuum [W. Wang et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 141 , 244907 (2014)] to observe the differences that arise during the collapse process. We then focus on the structural transitions that occur at temperatures below the coil-to-globule transition in the lattice. Moreover, by studying additional sequences, we detail the relationship between the block length, number of blocks, and, thus, overall polymer length with respect to said structural transitions. Finally, we observe how the formation and shape of a ground state core of the more strongly interacting monomer type affect the procession of structural changes that occurs as temperature increases.},

Dynamic light scattering measurements indicate the presence of distinct fast and slow diffusive modes, where the fast mode is interpreted as a collective diffusion coefficient and the slow mode is attributed to the diffusion of multi-chain dynamic clusters. The relative population of fast and slow modes varies systematically with temperature and concentration. A clustering temperature ( T *) was assigned when the slow mode first appeared upon cooling. The slow mode then increases in relative scattering amplitude as the phase boundary is approached. The fast mode exhibits a concentration dependence above T * consistent with the virial expansion in the collective diffusion. The sign of the virial coefficient ( k d ) is negative, even in the good solvent region above the expected Flory temperature (Θ ≈ 39 °C), a behavior distinct from synthetic neutral polymers in organic solvents. The onset of multi-chain clustering at T &lt; T * coincides with the poor solvent regime ( T &lt; Θ). Attractive dipolar interactions due to the zwitterionic sulfobetaine groups in pAPAPS are suggested as the origin of the multi-chain clusters with no salt. Upon the addition of 100 mM NaCl, the slow mode is suppressed, and the hydrodynamic radius is consistent with polyzwitterion chain dimensions in a dilute solution. We find that concentration dependent diffusion is highly linked to the theta temperature and the emergence of dynamic clusters as the polymer goes from good to poor solvent on approach to the UCST. The slow mode in the semidilute regime is reported along with preliminary small-angle neutron scattering data that show salt reduces clustering and leads to predominantly chain scattering.},

The helical structure of cylindrical cavities is of great importance in LC studies, particularly for their application in optical devices. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to explore the behavior of achiral smectic-B LCs confined in narrow cylindrical cavities, where geometric frustration plays an important role. By increasing the cylinder size, LCs exhibit a transition from multi-helical to layered structures. Notably, we observe two stable structures, namely the helical structure and the layered structure, at moderate cylinder size. We also investigate the effects of the arrangement of cylindrical wall particles (hexagonal or square array) and anchoring strength on the LC structure. Our findings reveal that both the hexagonal array and strong anchoring strength promote the formation of helical structures. Our study provides novel insights into the confinement physics of LCs and highlights the potential for achieving helical structures in achiral LCs, which will expand the future applications of LCs.},

  abstract = {Superconcentrated aqueous electrolytes have recently emerged as a new class of electrolytes, called water-in-salt electrolytes. They are distinguished, in both weight and volume, by a quantity of salt greater than water. Currently, these electrolytes are attracting major interest, particularly for application in aqueous rechargeable batteries. These electrolytes have only a small amount of free water due to an ultrahigh salt concentration. Consequently, the electrochemical stability window of water is wider than the predicted thermodynamic value of 1.23 V. Hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER ) and oxygen evolution reaction ( OER ) have been shown to be shifted to more negative and positive potentials, respectively. The decrease in free water population is recognized as being involved in the increase in the electrochemical stability window of water. Here, we study the quantitative contribution of the decrease in the free water molecule concentration to the permittivity of the solution and of the activity of water to the OER and HER overpotentials when the salt concentration increases. We compare our model with that of Kornyshev and get three types of electrolyte structures: diluted, gradient of water contents, and aggregation. The theoretical calculation of the redox potentials of the OER and HER is compared with the experimentally determined electrochemical properties of aqueous LiTFSI electrolytes.},

Our results show that one monolayer of water saturates the undercoordinated titanium (Ti 5c ) sites, forming one-dimensional chains of molecule hydrogen bonded to surface undercoordinated bridging oxygen (O 2c ) atoms. As the coverage increases, water adsorption on O 2c sites leads to significant restructuring of the water monolayer and the formation of a two-dimensional hydrogen bond network characterized by tightly bound pairs of water molecules on adjacent Ti 5c and O 2c sites. This structural motif likely persists at ambient conditions, influencing the reactions occurring there.

  abstract = {Colloidal quantum confined semiconductor-metal heterostructures are promising candidates for solar energy conversion because their light absorbing semiconductor and catalytic components can be independently tuned and optimized. Although the light-to-hydrogen efficiencies of such systems have shown interesting dependences on the morphologies of the semiconductor and metal domains, the mechanisms of such dependences are poorly understood. Here, we use Pt tipped 0D CdS quantum dots (with ∼4.6 nm diameter) and 1D CdS nanorods (of ∼13.8, 27.8, 66.6, and 88.9 nm average rod lengths) as a model system to study the distance-dependence of charge separation and charge recombination times and their impacts on photo-driven H 2 production. The H 2 generation quantum efficiency increases from 0.2\% ± 0.0\% in quantum dots to 28.9\% ± 0.4\% at a rod length of 28 nm and shows negligible changes at longer rod lengths. The half-life time of electron transfer from CdS to Pt increases monotonically with rod length, from 0.7 ± 0.1 in quantum dots to 170.2 ± 29.5 ps in the longest rods, corresponding to a slight decrease in electron transfer quantum efficiency from 92\% to 81\%. The amplitude-weighted average lifetime of charge recombination of the electron in Pt with the hole in CdS increases from 4.7 ± 0.4 µ s in quantum dots to 149 ± 34 µ s in 28 nm nanorods, and the lifetime does not increase further in longer rods, resembling the trend in the observed H 2 generation quantum efficiency. Our result suggests that the competition of the charge recombination process with the hole removal by the sacrificial electron donor plays a dominant role in the observed nanorod length dependent overall light driven H 2 generation quantum efficiency.},

  abstract = {Vibrational strong coupling results from the interaction between optically allowed molecular vibrational excitations and the resonant mode of an infrared cavity. Strong coupling leads to the formation of hybrid states, known as vibrational polaritons, which are readily observed in transmission measurements and a manifold of the reservoir states. In contrast, Raman spectroscopy of vibrational polaritons is elusive and has recently been the focus of both theoretical and experimental investigations. Because Raman measurements are frequently performed with high-numerical aperture excitation/collection optics, the angular dispersion of the strongly coupled system must be carefully considered. Herein, we experimentally investigated vibrational polaritons involving dispersive collective lattice resonances of infrared antenna arrays. Despite clear indications of the strong coupling to vibrational excitations in the transmission spectrum; we found that Raman spectra do not bear signatures of the polaritonic transitions. Detailed measurements indicate that the disappearance of the Raman signal is not due to the polariton dispersion in our samples. On the other hand, the Tavis–Cummings–Holstein model that we employed to interpret our results suggests that the ratio of the Raman transition strengths between the reservoir and the polariton states scales according to the number of strongly coupled molecules. Because the vibrational transitions are relatively weak, the number of molecules required to achieve strong coupling conditions is about 10 9 per unit cell of the array of infrared antennas. Therefore, the scaling predicted by the Tavis–Cummings–Holstein model can explain the absence of the polariton signatures in spontaneous Raman scattering experiments.},

  abstract = {The dissolution behavior of calcium aluminosilicate based glass fibers, such as stone wool fibers, is an important consideration in mineral wool applications for both the longevity of the mineral wool products in humid environments and limiting the health impacts of released and inhaled fibers from the mineral wool product. Balancing these factors requires a molecular-level understanding of calcium aluminosilicate glass dissolution mechanisms, details that are challenging to resolve with experiment alone. Molecular dynamics simulations are a powerful tool capable of providing complementary atomistic insights regarding dissolution; however, they require force fields capable of describing not-only the calcium aluminosilicate surface structure but also the interactions relevant to dissolution phenomena. Here, a new force field capable of describing amorphous calcium aluminosilicate surfaces interfaced with liquid water is developed by fitting parameters to experimental and first principles simulation data of the relevant oxide-water interfaces, including ab initio molecular dynamics simulations performed for this work for the wüstite and periclase interfaces. Simulations of a calcium aluminosilicate surface interfaced with liquid water were used to test this new force field, suggesting moderate ingress of water into the porous glass interface. This design of the force field opens a new avenue for the further study of calcium and network-modifier dissolution phenomena in calcium aluminosilicate glasses and stone wool fibers at liquid water interfaces.},

In this study, the interfacial adsorption thermodynamics underlying these synergistic effects are analyzed through free energy decompositions. A general decomposition method utilizing alchemical intermediate states is outlined. Combining free energy decompositions with the potential distribution theorem illuminates the statistical interpretations of correlated effects between different system components. This approach allows for the identification of the physical effects leading to synergistic adsorption thermodynamics of DS − binding to the air-C 12 E 6 -water interface. The binding properties are found to result from a combination of effects predominantly including energetic van der Waals stabilization between DS − and C 12 E 6 , as well as competing energetic and entropic effects due to changes in the interfacial water structure as a result of introducing a C 12 E 6 monolayer into the bare air–water interface.},

  abstract = {Quaternary III–V semiconductors are one of the most promising material classes in optoelectronics. The bandgap and its character, direct or indirect, are the most important fundamental properties determining the performance and characteristics of optoelectronic devices. Experimental approaches screening a large range of possible combinations of III- and V-elements with variations in composition and strain are impractical for every target application. We present a combination of accurate first-principles calculations and machine learning based approaches to predict the properties of the bandgap for quaternary III–V semiconductors. By learning bandgap magnitudes and their nature at density functional theory accuracy based solely on the composition and strain features of the materials as an input, we develop a computationally efficient yet highly accurate machine learning approach that can be applied to a large number of compositions and strain values. This allows for a computationally efficient prediction of a vast range of materials under different strains, offering the possibility of virtual screening of multinary III–V materials for optoelectronic applications.},

The Au|2T3N interface is characterized by x-ray photoelectron circular dichroism and comparing x-ray photoemission spectroscopy and electro-desorption results. Charge transmission at the Au|2T3N| solution interface is characterized by recording the cyclic voltammetry of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) reversible redox couple, finding a charge transfer rate constant, k °, variation from 1 × 10 −1 to 3.3 × 10 −2 cm s −1 , when comparing the bare Au and the Au|2T3N interfaces, respectively. The “anomalous” high value of k ° found for the chiral Au|2T3N interface can be rationalized on the basis of the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect, as further proved by magnetic–conductive atomic force microscopy measurements at room temperature. A spin polarization of about 30\% is found.},

The conduction mechanism has been ascertained using the values of the frequency exponent (s) extracted from the fitting of experimental data of the real part of electric conductivity in light of the Almond–West equation. Depending on the glass composition, the ac conduction in the glasses happened via correlated barrier hopping and non-overlapping small polaron tunneling conduction models. The electric modulus studies support the assertion of composition dependent conduction mechanisms. Furthermore, electronic conduction and ionic conduction have been studied from impedance investigations. Equivalent circuit models were used to fit the Nyquist and Bode plots of each sample at the temperatures under consideration. It has been found that the activation energy values calculated from conductivity, electric modulus, and impedance measurements are more or less the same.},

  abstract = {We present the study of the structure–dynamics correlation for systems interacting via attractive Lennard-Jones (LJ) and its repulsive counterpart, the Weeks–Chandler–Andersen (WCA) potentials. The structural order parameter (SOP) is related to the microscopic mean-field caging potential. At a particle level, the SOP shows a distribution. Although the two systems have similar pair structures, their average SOP differs. However, this difference alone is insufficient to explain the well known slowing down of the dynamics in the LJ system at low temperatures. The slowing down can be explained in terms of a stronger coupling between the SOP and the dynamics. To understand the origin of this system specific coupling, we study the difference in the microscopic structure between the hard and soft particles. We find that for the LJ system, the structural differences of the hard and soft particles are more significant and have a much stronger temperature dependence compared to the WCA system. Thus, the study suggests that attractive interaction creates more structurally different communities. This broader difference in the structural communities is probably responsible for stronger coupling between the structure and dynamics. Thus, the system specific structure–dynamics correlation, which also leads to a faster slowing down in the dynamics, appears to have a structural origin. A comparison of the predictive power of our SOP with the local energy and two body excess entropy in determining the dynamics shows that in the LJ system, the enthalpy plays a dominant role and in the WCA system, the entropy plays a dominant role, and our SOP can capture both these contributions.},

  abstract = {The plastic flow of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) at a frictional interface, which is critical to the wear behavior, was investigated by reactive molecular dynamics simulations. The UHMWPE substrate was found to experience various deformations during the friction process. First, some polyethylene (PE) chains could detach from the substrate because of their rapid movement. Second, the frequent motion of PE chains also resulted in the intermittent formation and breaking of cavities between intermolecular PE chains. These deformations were more obvious on a surface with a convex protrusion, where the plowing effect exacerbated the cavitation and elastic deformation of PE chains. Correspondingly, the plastic flow in turn reconstructed the convex protrusion by displacing the surface atoms on the Fe slab. The plastic flow of PE chains broke the C–C bonds, and the carbon moieties were then chemically bonded onto the metal surface. A rapid change of atomic charge, hence, happened when the bonds broke. Meanwhile, PE chains release short alkyl radicals gradually after bond breakage, indicating gradual wear of the substrate during friction. This work provides molecular insight into the evolution of interfacial microstructure under plastic flow on a UHMWPE substrate.},

The internal energy dependence of all primary fragmentation channels is obtained for all four target molecules. The decay dynamics of the four molecules is studied by comparing their various experimental signatures. The dominant channel for the first pair of isomers is found to be hydrogen cyanide (HCN) neutral loss, while the second pair of isomers lose HCNH neutral as its dominant channel. Despite this difference in their primary decay products and the differences in the structures of the four targets, various similarities in their experimental signatures are found, which could be explained by isomerization mechanisms to common structures. The fundamental role of these isomerization in controlling different dissociative channels is explored via a detailed analysis of the experimental photoelectron–photoion coincidences and the investigation of the theoretical potential energy surface. These results add to the notion of a universal PANH fragmentation mechanism and suggests the seven member isomerization as a key candidate for this universal mechanism. The balance between isomerization, dissociation, and other key mechanistic processes in the reaction pathways, such as hydrogen migrations, is also highlighted for the four molecules.},

The kinetic-energy distributions of the I 2 products indicate that complexes in the Ar⋯I 2 (E, v E ) levels preferentially dissociate into I 2 in the D and β ion-pair states with no change in I 2 vibrational excitation. The energetics of the levels prepared suggest that there is a non-adiabatic coupling of the initially prepared levels with the continuum of states lying above the Ar + I 2 (D, v D = v E ) and Ar + I 2 (β, v β = v E ) dissociation limits. The angular anisotropies of the I 2 product signals collected for many of the Ar⋯I 2 (E, v E ) levels have maxima parallel to the laser polarization axis. This contradicts expectations for the prompt dissociation of complexes with T-shaped geometries, which would result in images with maxima perpendicular to the polarization axis. These anisotropies suggest that there is a perturbation of the transition moment in these clusters or there are additional intermolecular interactions, likely those sampled while traversing above the attractive wells of the lower-energy potentials during dissociation. I 2 (D′, v D′ ) products are also identified when preparing several of the low-lying levels localized in the T-shaped well of the Ar + I 2 (E, v E = 0–2) potentials, and they are formed in multiple ν D′ vibrational levels spanning energy ranges up to 500 cm −1 .},

Here, we present transient absorption measurements of hot gas-phase SA, jet-cooled SA, and SA in Ar clusters using cavity-enhanced transient absorption spectroscopy (CE-TAS). Assignment of the spectra is aided by simulated TAS spectra, computed by applying time-dependent complete active space configuration interaction (TD-CASCI) to structures drawn from nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. We find prompt ESIPT in all conditions followed by the rapid generation of the trans keto metastable photochrome state and fluorescent keto state in parallel. Increasing the internal energy increases the photochrome yield and decreases the fluorescent yield and fluorescent state lifetime observed in TAS. In Ar clusters, internal conversion of SA is severely hindered, but the photochrome yield is unchanged. Taken together, these results are consistent with the photochrome being produced via the vibrationally excited keto population after ESIPT.},

  abstract = {New intermolecular potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the quintet, triplet, and singlet states of two rigid oxygen (O 2 ) molecules in their triplet ground electronic states were developed. Quintet interaction energies were obtained for 896 O 2 –O 2 configurations by supermolecular coupled cluster (CC) calculations at levels up to CC with single, double, triple, and perturbative quadruple excitations [CCSDT(Q)] with unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF) reference wave functions. Corrections for scalar relativistic effects were calculated as well. Triplet interaction energies were obtained by combining the quintet interaction energies with accurate estimates for the differences between the quintet and triplet energies obtained at the UHF-CCSD(T) level of theory. Here, we exploited the fact that the triplet state is almost identical to the readily accessible “broken-symmetry” state, as shown by Valentin-Rodríguez et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 152 , 184304 (2020)]. The singlet interaction energies were estimated from the quintet and triplet interaction energies by employing the Heisenberg Hamiltonian description of the spin splittings. The three PESs are represented analytically by site–site models with five sites per molecule and anisotropic site–site interactions. To validate the PESs, we calculated at temperatures from 55 to 2000 K the second virial coefficient using statistical thermodynamics and the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity, and self-diffusion coefficient in the dilute gas phase using the kinetic theory of molecular gases. The calculated property values are in excellent agreement with the most accurate experimental data from the literature. Therefore, we also propose new reference correlations for the investigated properties based solely on the calculated values.},

Interestingly, for phenylacetylene, the spectrum in the acetylenic C–H stretching region emerges due to anharmonic coupling of modes localized on the acetylenic moiety along with the other ring modes, which also involve displacements on the acetylenic group, which is in contrast to what has been proposed and propagated in the literature. In general, this coupling scheme is invariant to the fluorine atom substitution. For the aromatic C–H stretching region, the observed spectrum emerges due to the coupling of the C–H stretching with C–C stretching and C–H in-plane bending modes.},

  abstract = {A positive Mu is a useful tool for investigating the spin density of radical species. The theoretical estimation of its behavior in a molecule requires the inclusion of a quantum effect due to the small mass of muonium. Herein, we performed ab initio a path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulation, which accurately included a multi-dimensional quantum effect, for muoniated 9H-xanthene-9-thione ( μ XT). Our results showed that the quantum effect significantly increased the hyperfine coupling constant (HFCC) value of μ XT, which qualitatively improved the calculated HFCC value, compared to the experimental one. In the PIMD simulation, the bond length between muonium and sulfur in μ XT is longer than that between hydrogen and sulfur in a hydrogenated 9H-xanthene-9-thione (HXT), leading to a spin density transfer from XT (9H-xanthene-9-thione) to muonium due to neutral dissociations. Additionally, we found that the S–Mu bond in μ XT prefers a structure perpendicular to the molecular plane, where the interaction between Mu and the singly occupied molecular orbital of μ XT is the strongest. These structural changes resulted in a larger HFCC value in the PIMD simulation of μ XT.},

  abstract = {The swift progression and expansion of machine learning (ML) have not gone unnoticed within the realm of statistical mechanics. In particular, ML techniques have attracted attention by the classical density-functional theory (DFT) community, as they enable automatic discovery of free-energy functionals to determine the equilibrium-density profile of a many-particle system. Within classical DFT, the external potential accounts for the interaction of the many-particle system with an external field, thus, affecting the density distribution. In this context, we introduce a statistical-learning framework to infer the external potential exerted on a classical many-particle system. We combine a Bayesian inference approach with the classical DFT apparatus to reconstruct the external potential, yielding a probabilistic description of the external-potential functional form with inherent uncertainty quantification. Our framework is exemplified with a grand-canonical one-dimensional classical particle ensemble with excluded volume interactions in a confined geometry. The required training dataset is generated using a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation where the external potential is applied to the grand-canonical ensemble. The resulting particle coordinates from the MC simulation are fed into the learning framework to uncover the external potential. This eventually allows us to characterize the equilibrium density profile of the system by using the tools of DFT. Our approach benchmarks the inferred density against the exact one calculated through the DFT formulation with the true external potential. The proposed Bayesian procedure accurately infers the external potential and the density profile. We also highlight the external-potential uncertainty quantification conditioned on the amount of available simulated data. The seemingly simple case study introduced in this work might serve as a prototype for studying a wide variety of applications, including adsorption, wetting, and capillarity, to name a few.},

We present an implementation of this framework for vibrational coupled-cluster theory and response treatments. For C=O stretches of small molecules, we show that the embedded treatment accelerates convergence for enlarging subsets. For the water dimer and trimer as well as a water wire in bacteriorhodopsin, we investigate different partitioning schemes for the embedding approach: In the local partitioning of the vibrations, the modes dominated by motions in the same spatial region are correlated, whereas in the energy-based partitioning, modes of similar fundamental frequencies are correlated. In most cases, we obtain better agreement with superset reference results for the local partitioning than for energy-based partitioning. This work represents an important step toward multi-level methodologies in vibrational-structure theory required for its application to sizable (bio-)molecular systems.},

We exploit existing databases of minima and transition states harvested from previous work using tight-binding potentials. We explore the energy landscape for the full range of structures and pathways spanning from the buckminsterfullerene global minimum up to buckybowls. In the initial GAP model, the fullerene part of the landscape is reproduced quite well. However, there are extensive families of C 1 @C 59 and C 2 @C 58 structures that lie lower in energy. We succeeded in refining the potential to remove these artifacts by simply including two minima from the C 2 @C 58 families found by global landscape exploration. We suggest that the energy landscape approach could be used systematically to test and improve machine learning interatomic potentials.},

We describe a fast computational method for performing lattice thermodynamic calculations that is based on the use of the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) technique and multiple short-range order (SRO) parameters. The approach is comparable in accuracy to the Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) method. The equilibrium configuration is determined in 5–10 Newton–Raphson iterations by solving a system of coupled nonlinear algebraic SRO growth rate equations. This makes the RMC-based method computationally more efficient than MC, given that MC typically requires sampling of millions of configurations. The technique is applied to the interacting 2D adsorption problem. Unlike grand canonical MC, RMC is found to be adept at tackling geometric frustration, as it is able to quickly and correctly provide the ordered c(2 × 2) adlayer configuration for Cl adsorbed on a Cu (100) surface.},

  abstract = {Alchemical free energy calculations via molecular dynamics have been applied to obtain thermodynamic properties related to solid–liquid equilibrium conditions, such as melting points. In recent years, the pseudo-supercritical path (PSCP) method has proved to be an important approach to melting point prediction due to its flexibility and applicability. In the present work, we propose improvements to the PSCP alchemical cycle to make it more compact and efficient through a concerted evaluation of different potential energies. The multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR) estimator was applied at all stages of the new cycle to provide greater accuracy and uniformity, which is essential concerning uncertainty calculations. In particular, for the multistate expansion stage from solid to liquid, we employed the MBAR estimator with a reduced energy function that allows affine transformations of coordinates. Free energy and mean derivative profiles were calculated at different cycle stages for argon, triazole, propenal, and the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate. Comparisons showed a better performance of the proposed method than the original PSCP cycle for systems with higher complexity, especially the ionic liquid. A detailed study of the expansion stage revealed that remapping the centers of mass of the molecules or ions is preferable to remapping the coordinates of each atom, yielding better overlap between adjacent states and improving the accuracy of the methodology.},

We are studying the mechanisms that explain various observations involving combinations of magnets and chiral molecules. We find that there exists a molecule induced contribution to the magnetic anisotropy of the magnets. Out of equilibrium, when electrons are actually being transported through a nano-magnet covered with chiral molecules, a molecule induced torque acting on the magnetization is emerging. It is of the spin-transfer-torque kind, already discussed in other parts of spintronics. This current induced torque can help explain the observed breaking of the Onsager reciprocity principle in experiments involving magnets and chiral molecules.},

  abstract = {The first finite basis set implementation of the real-time time-dependent self-consistent field method in a dynamic (time-dependent) magnetic field using London atomic orbitals (LAOs) is presented. The accuracy of the finite basis approach using LAOs is benchmarked against numerical results from the literature for the hydrogen atom and H 2 in the presence of rapidly oscillating magnetic fields. This comparison is used to inform the choice of appropriate basis sets for studies under such conditions. Remarkably, relatively modest compact LAO basis sets are sufficient to obtain accurate results. Analysis of electron dynamics in the hydrogen atom shows that LAO calculations correctly capture the time evolution of orbital occupations. The Fourier transformation of the autocorrelation function yields a power spectrum exhibiting harmonics associated with coherent emission, which closely matches the literature and further confirms the accuracy of this approach. The dynamical response of the electron density in H 2 for a magnetic field parallel to the internuclear axis shows similar behavior to benchmark studies. The flexibility of this implementation is then demonstrated by considering how the dynamical response changes as a function of the orientation of the molecule relative to the applied field. At non-parallel orientations, the symmetry of the system is lowered and numerical benchmark data, which exploit cylindrical symmetry, are no-longer readily available. The present study demonstrates the utility of LAO-based calculations for extreme dynamic magnetic fields, providing a stress-test on the choice of basis. Future applications of this approach for less extreme dynamic magnetic fields are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {The calculation of two-electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) is a crucial aspect of Hartree–Fock calculations. In computing the ERIs of varying angular momentum, both the central processing unit (CPU) and the graphics processing unit (GPU) have their respective advantages. To accelerate the ERI evaluation and Fock matrix generation, a hybrid CPU/GPU method has been proposed to maximize the computational power of both CPU and GPU while overlapping the CPU and GPU computations. This method employs a task queue where each task corresponds to ERIs with the same angular momentum. The queue begins with ERIs of low angular momentum, which are computationally efficient on GPUs, and ends with ERIs of high angular momentum, which are better suited for CPU computation. CPUs and GPUs dynamically grab and complete tasks from the start and end of the queue using OpenMP dynamic scheduling until all tasks are finished. The hybrid CPU/GPU computation offers the advantage of enabling calculations with arbitrary angular momentum. Test calculations showed that the hybrid CPU/GPU algorithm is more efficient than “GPU-only” when using a single GPU. However, as more GPUs are involved, the advantage diminishes or disappears. The scaling exponents of the hybrid method were slightly higher than “GPU-only,” but the pre-exponent factor was significantly lower, making the hybrid method more effective overall.},

The four-point Optimal Point Charge (OPC) and three-point OPC (OPC3) water models were developed in 2014 and 2016, respectively. These models reproduce numerous properties of bulk water with high accuracy, such as density, dielectric constant, heat of vaporization, self-diffusion coefficient, and surface tension. In this study, we evaluated the shear viscosities of the OPC and OPC3 water models at various temperatures ranging from 273 to 373 K using the Green–Kubo formalism to assess their performance. The evaluated viscosities of both models were very close to each other at all the examined temperatures. At temperatures above 310 K, the calculated shear viscosities were in excellent agreement with the experimental results. However, at lower temperatures, the water models systematically underestimated the shear viscosity, with the calculated values at 273 and 298 K being 20\% and 10\% lower than the experimental values, respectively. Despite this limitation, the OPC and OPC3 water models outperformed other widely used water models.},

In the case of modest matrix sizes (≲4000), performance of traditional dense diagonalization algorithms on modern GPUs is underwhelming compared to the peak performance of these devices. This motivates the exploration of alternative algorithms better suited to these types of architectures. We newly derive, and present in detail, an existing Chebyshev expansion algorithm [Liang et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 119 , 4117–4125 (2003)] whose number of required matrix multiplications scales with the square root of the number of terms in the expansion. Focusing on dense matrices of modest size, our implementation on GPUs results in large speed ups when compared to diagonalization. Additionally, we improve upon this existing method by capitalizing on the inherent task parallelism and concurrency in the algorithm. This improvement is implemented on GPUs by using CUDA and HIP streams via the MAGMA library and leads to a significant speed up over the serial-only approach for smaller (≲1000) matrix sizes. Finally, we apply our technique to a model system with a high density of states around the Fermi level, which typically presents significant challenges.},

Leveraging in silico sampling and our in-house analyses, we first report the local conformational propensity of sequences that are either predisposed toward the canonical A- or B-conformations or are restrained to potential transitory pathways. It is observed that the transition from the unrestrained A-form to the B-form leads to lengthwise structural deformation. The insertion of intermittent -(CG)- base pairs in otherwise homogeneous -(AT)- sequences bears dynamical consequences for the vicinal hydration layer. Calculation of the excess (pair) entropy suggests substantially higher values of hydration water surrounding A conformations over the B- conformations. Applying the Rosenfeld approximation, we project that the diffusivity of water molecules proximal to canonical B conformation is least for the minor groove of the canonical B-conformation. We determine that structure, composition, and conformation specific groove dimension together influence the local hydration characteristics and, therefore, are expected to be important determinants of biological processes.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) simulation models of condensed-phase systems can be derived with well-established methods that perform coarse-graining in space and provide an effective Hamiltonian with which some of the structural and thermodynamic properties of the underlying fine-grained (FG) reference system can be represented. Coarse-graining in time potentially provides CG models that furthermore represent dynamic properties. However, systematic efforts in this direction have so far been limited, especially for moderately coarse-grained, chemistry-specific systems with complicated conservative interactions. With the aim of representing structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties in CG simulations of multi-component molecular systems, we investigated a recently introduced method in which the force on a CG particle originates from conservative interactions with surrounding particles and non-Markovian dissipative interactions, the latter introduced by means of a colored-noise thermostat. We examined two different methods to derive isotropic memory kernels required for integrating the corresponding generalized Langevin equation (GLE) of motion, based on the orthogonal dynamics of the FG forces and on an iterative optimization scheme. As a proof of concept, we coarse-grain single-component molecular liquids (cyclohexane, tetrachloromethane) and ideal and non-ideal binary mixtures of cyclohexane/tetrachloromethane and ethanol/tetrachloromethane, respectively. We find that for all systems, the FG single particle velocity auto-correlation functions and, consequently, both the short time and long time diffusion coefficients can be quantitatively reproduced with the CG-GLE models. We furthermore demonstrate that the present GLE-approach leads to an improved description of the rate with which the spatial correlations decay, which is artificially accelerated in the absence of dissipation.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of wire frame particles in concentrated suspension are studied by means of a 2D model and compared to those of rod-like particles. The wire frames have bent or branched structures constructed from infinitely thin, rigid rods. In the model, a particle is surrounded by diffusing points that it cannot cross. We derive a formal expression for the mean squared displacement (MSD) and, by using a self-consistent approximation, we find markedly different dynamics for wire frames and rods. For wire frames, there exists a critical concentration of points above which they become frozen with the long time MSD reaching a plateau. Rods, on the other hand, always diffuse by reptation. We also study the rheology through the elastic stress, and more striking differences are found: the initial magnitude of the stress for wire frames is much larger than for rods, scaling such as the square of the point concentration, and above the critical concentration, the stress for wire frames appears to persist indefinitely while for rods it always decays.},

  abstract = {We analyze the shear response of grafted polymer chains in shear flow via coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with an explicit solvent. We find that the solvent flow penetrates into almost the whole brush for “mushroom”-type brushes but only a few bond distances for dense brushes. In all cases, the external stress on the wall equals the entropic stress associated with the distorted polymer conformations. We find that the external stress increases linearly with shear rate at low rates and sublinearly at high rates. The transition from linear to sublinear scaling occurs where chains react to flow by reorienting. Sublinear scaling with shear rate disappears if the shear rate is nondimensionalized with the effective relaxation time of chain subsegments located in the outer part of the brush that experiences flow.},

  abstract = {Uncovering slow collective variables (CVs) of self-assembly dynamics is important to elucidate its numerous kinetic assembly pathways and drive the design of novel structures for advanced materials through the bottom-up approach. However, identifying the CVs for self-assembly presents several challenges. First, self-assembly systems often consist of identical monomers, and the feature representations should be invariant to permutations and rotational symmetries. Physical coordinates, such as aggregate size, lack high-resolution detail, while common geometric coordinates like pairwise distances are hindered by the permutation and rotational symmetry challenges. Second, self-assembly is usually a downhill process, and the trajectories often suffer from insufficient sampling of backward transitions that correspond to the dissociation of self-assembled structures. Popular dimensionality reduction methods, such as time-structure independent component analysis, impose detailed balance constraints, potentially obscuring the true dynamics of self-assembly. In this work, we employ GraphVAMPnets, which combines graph neural networks with a variational approach for Markovian process (VAMP) theory to identify the slow CVs of the self-assembly processes. First, GraphVAMPnets bears the advantages of graph neural networks, in which the graph embeddings can represent self-assembly structures in high-resolution while being invariant to permutations and rotational symmetries. Second, it is built upon VAMP theory, which studies Markov processes without forcing detailed balance constraints, which addresses the out-of-equilibrium challenge in the self-assembly process. We demonstrate GraphVAMPnets for identifying slow CVs of self-assembly kinetics in two systems: the aggregation of two hydrophobic molecules and the self-assembly of patchy particles. We expect that our GraphVAMPnets can be widely applied to molecular self-assembly.},

Traditional methods rely on ad hoc design based on the understanding of known chemistry and crystallography, which have limitations in computational efficiency and search space. In this work, we present ChecMatE (Chemical Material Explorer), a software package that automatically generates machine learning potentials (MLPs) and uses global search algorithms to screen semiconductor alloy materials. Taking advantage of MLPs, ChecMatE enables a more efficient and cost-effective exploration of the structural space of materials and predicts their energy and relative stability with ab initio accuracy.

  abstract = {The interaction between adjacent active sites is crucial to balance the efficiency and utilization of functional atoms in single-atom catalysts. Herein, the catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction at different site (nitrogen coordinated transition metal centers embedded in graphene) distances was comprehensively investigated by density functional theory calculations. The results show that a proximity effect of reactivity and site spacing can be identified in the Co-series single-atom catalysts. Although the proximity effect is more linearly responded with the site spacing along x direction, an optimal distance of ∼0.8 and ∼2.8 nm are found for Co and Rh, Ir atoms, respectively. An in-depth analysis of the electronic property reveals that the proximity effect is caused by the distinct net charge of the active site, which is affected by the d z 2 position relative to E F . Subsequently, an excess electron nodal channel in x direction was found to serve as a communication pathway between the active sites. Through the finding in this work, an optimal Fe-N2C2 structure was deliberately designed and has shown prominent proximity effect as Co-series do. The results reported in this work provide a simple and effective tuning method for the reactivity of a single-atom catalyst.},

Due to the non-negligible surface interaction and the effect of discrete solvent molecules, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is often used as an essential tool to study the behavior of ions under nanoconfinement. Despite the accuracy of MD simulation in modeling nanoconfinement systems, it is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose neural network to predict ion concentration profiles in nanochannels with different configurations, including channel widths, ion molarity, and ion types. By modeling the ion concentration profile as a probability distribution, our neural network can serve as a much faster surrogate model for MD simulation with high accuracy. We further demonstrate the superior prediction accuracy of neural network over XGBoost. Finally, we demonstrated that neural network is flexible in predicting ion concentration profiles with different bin sizes. Overall, our deep learning model is a fast, flexible, and accurate surrogate model to predict ion concentration profiles in nanoconfinement.},

  abstract = {The fluid–solid interfacial tension is of great importance to many applications including the geological storage of greenhouse gases and enhancing the recovery of geo-resources, but it is rarely studied. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations are conducted to calculate fluid–solid interfacial properties in H 2 O + gas (H 2 , N 2 , CH 4 , and CO 2 ) + rigid solid three-phase systems at various temperatures (298–403 K), pressures (0–100 MPa), and wettabilities (hydrophilic, neutral, and hydrophobic). Our results on the H 2 O + solid system show that vapor–solid interfacial tension should not be ignored in cases where the fluid–solid interaction energy is strong or the contact angle is close to 90°. As the temperature rises, the magnitude of H 2 O’s liquid–solid interfacial tension declines because the oscillation of the interfacial density/pressure profile weakens at high temperatures. However, the magnitude of H 2 O vapor–solid interfacial tension is enhanced with temperature due to the stronger adsorption of H 2 O. Moreover, the H 2 O–solid interfacial tension in H 2 O + gas (H 2 or N 2 ) + solid systems is weakly dependent on pressure, while the pressure effects on H 2 O–solid interfacial tensions in systems with CH 4 or CO 2 are significant. We show that the assumption of pressure independent H 2 O–solid interfacial tensions should be cautiously applied to Neumann’s method for systems containing non-hydrophilic surfaces with strong gas–solid interaction. Meanwhile, the magnitude of gas–solid interfacial tension increases with pressure and gas–solid interaction. High temperatures generally decrease the magnitude of gas–solid interfacial tensions. Further, we found that the increment of contact angle due to the presence of gases follows this order: H 2 &lt; N 2 &lt; CH 4 &lt; CO 2 .},

Modeling SLE in eutectic systems has as prerequisites, the melting properties and activity coefficients of components in the liquid phase. Thus, due to the unavailable melting properties of thermally unstable substances, it is impossible to estimate their activity coefficients from experimental SLE data and model the SLE phase diagram of their eutectic systems. Here, we evaluate the activity coefficients of thermally unstable constituents in the liquid phase, which were calculated independent of their melting properties by correlating the SLE data of their cocrystals. Differential scanning calorimetry and powder x-ray diffraction were employed to obtain the SLE phase diagram of three eutectic systems, i.e., tetramethylammonium chloride/catechol, tetraethylammonium chloride/catechol, and betaine/catechol systems, and identify the formation of nine cocrystals. The non-random, two-liquid equation was used to calculate the activity coefficients of the components in the liquid phase. The substantial negative deviation from ideality in the three studied systems indicated strong hydrogen bonding interactions in the liquid solution. Furthermore, modeling ion–ion interactions in eutectic systems containing ionic constituents is of utmost importance for understanding their nonideality.},

The application we make here provides a thermodynamic description of supercooled water fully consistent with that expected by crossing the liquid–liquid Widom line, indicating the presence of two distinct liquid states. In particular, the present model accurately reproduces the Widom line temperatures estimated with other two-state models and well describes the heat capacity anomalies. Differently from previous models, according to our description, a cluster of molecules that extends beyond the first hydration shell is necessary to discriminate between the statistical fluctuation regimes typical of the two liquid states.},

This general expression is used to derive explicit formulas for the lowest-order members of the W (Δ p ) hierarchy as well as for the respective lowest-order approximations to the Δ p dependences of the nucleus surface tension, the nucleus radius, the Gibbs–Tolman length, and the stationary nucleation rate. The second-order and the third-order approximations to the W (Δ p ) dependence are confronted with available W (Δ p ) data, and the latter is found to agree very well with the data.

This method is used to study the size- and system-dependent competition between various structural motifs of Cu, Ag, and Au nanoclusters in the size range 1–2 nm. Results show that there are mainly three types of structural changes in metal nanoclusters, depending on whether a solid–solid transformation occurs. In the first type, the global minimum is the dominant motif in the entire temperature range. In contrast, when a solid–solid transformation occurs, the global minimum transforms either completely to a different motif or partially, resulting in the co-existence of multiple motifs.

An application of this approach to the most symmetrical TS known to date, i.e., that which controls the Cl − + CH 3 Cl → ClCH 3 + Cl − S N 2 nucleophilic substitution, is presented and an analytical expression of its potential energy surface is provided. In a substantial range around the saddle point, approximate equations of motion for the two components of the reaction coordinate, i.e., the antisymmetrical stretching motion of the ClCCl core and the wagging motion of the hydrogen triad, can be derived in an analytical form. During an extensive period of time, the main component of the reaction coordinate is governed by an unexpectedly simple equation of motion that depends on a single initial condition, irrespective of the other ones and of the internal energy. Reactive trajectories are observed to form a perfectly collimated bundle characterized by undetectable dispersion, thereby giving a spectacular example of regular dynamics in an anharmonic potential. Regularity and collimation are brought about by local symmetry, which is a widespread feature of potential energy surfaces. Anharmonicity is observed to influence the dynamics only at a late stage. As energy increases, trajectories tend to fan out and to deviate from the analytical equation. For the wagging motion, chaos sets in at much lower energies.},

  abstract = {Conventional time-of-flight methods can be used to determine carrier mobilities for photovoltaic cells in which the transit time between electrodes is greater than the RC time constant of the device. To measure carrier drift on sub-ns timescales, we have recently developed a two-pulse time-of-flight technique capable of detecting drift velocities with 100-ps time resolution in perovskite materials. In this method, the rates of carrier transit across the active layer of a device are determined by varying the delay time between laser pulses and measuring the magnitude of the recombination-induced nonlinearity in the photocurrent. Here, we present a related experimental approach in which diffractive optic-based transient grating spectroscopy is combined with our two-pulse time-of-flight technique to simultaneously probe drift and diffusion in orthogonal directions within the active layer of a photovoltaic cell. Carrier density gratings are generated using two time-coincident pulse-pairs with passively stabilized phases. Relaxation of the grating amplitude associated with the first pulse-pair is detected by varying the delay and phase of the density grating corresponding to the second pulse-pair. The ability of the technique to reveal carrier diffusion is demonstrated with model calculations and experiments conducted using MAPbI 3 photovoltaic cells.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of (few) electrons dissolved in an ionic fluid—as when a small amount of metal is added to a solution while upholding its electronic insulation—manifests interesting properties that can be ascribed to nontrivial topological features of particle transport (e.g., Thouless’ pumps). In the adiabatic regime, the charge distribution and the dynamics of these dissolved electrons are uniquely determined by the nuclear configuration. Yet, their localization into effective potential wells and their diffusivity are dictated by how the self-interaction is modeled. In this article, we investigate the role of self-interaction in the description of the localization and transport properties of dissolved electrons in non-stoichiometric molten salts. Although the account for the exact (Fock) exchange strongly localizes the dissolved electrons, decreasing their tunneling probability and diffusivity, we show that the dynamics of the ions and of the dissolved electrons are largely uncorrelated, irrespective of the degree to which the electron self-interaction is treated and in accordance with topological arguments.},

Our modification treats populations and coherences on an equal footing and is guaranteed to give populations in any electronic basis that tend to the correct quantum–classical equilibrium values in the long-time limit (assuming ergodicity). We demonstrate its accuracy by comparison with exact benchmark results for three- and seven-state models of the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex, obtaining electronic populations and coherences that are significantly more accurate than those of fewest switches surface hopping and at least as good as those of any other semiclassical method we are aware of. Since these results were obtained by adapting the scheme of Mannouch and Richardson, we go on to compare our results with theirs for a variety of problems with two electronic states. We find that their method is sometimes more accurate, especially in the Marcus inverted regime. However, in other situations, the accuracies are comparable, and since our scheme can be used with multiple electronic states it can be applied to a wider variety of electronically nonadiabatic systems.},

  abstract = {Among the single-trajectory Gaussian-based methods for solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the variational Gaussian approximation is the most accurate one. In contrast to Heller’s original thawed Gaussian approximation, it is symplectic, conserves energy exactly, and may partially account for tunneling. However, the variational method is also much more expensive. To improve its efficiency, we symmetrically compose the second-order symplectic integrator of Faou and Lubich and obtain geometric integrators that can achieve an arbitrary even order of convergence in the time step. We demonstrate that the high-order integrators can speed up convergence drastically compared to the second-order algorithm and, in contrast to the popular fourth-order Runge–Kutta method, are time-reversible and conserve the norm and the symplectic structure exactly, regardless of the time step. To show that the method is not restricted to low-dimensional systems, we perform most of the analysis on a non-separable twenty-dimensional model of coupled Morse oscillators. We also show that the variational method may capture tunneling and, in general, improves accuracy over the non-variational thawed Gaussian approximation.},

  abstract = {Numerically “exact” methods addressing the dynamics of coupled electron–phonon systems have been intensively developed. Nevertheless, the corresponding results for the electron mobility μ dc are scarce, even for the one-dimensional (1d) Holstein model. Building on our recent progress on single-particle properties, here we develop the momentum-space hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method to evaluate real-time two-particle correlation functions of the 1d Holstein model at a finite temperature. We compute numerically “exact” dynamics of the current–current correlation function up to real times sufficiently long to capture the electron’s diffusive motion and provide reliable results for μ dc in a wide range of model parameters. In contrast to the smooth ballistic-to-diffusive crossover in the weak-coupling regime, we observe a temporally limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales already in the intermediate-coupling regime, which translates to a finite-frequency peak in the optical response. Our momentum-space formulation lowers the numerical effort with respect to existing HEOM-method implementations, while we remove the numerical instabilities inherent to the undamped-mode HEOM by devising an appropriate hierarchy closing scheme. Still, our HEOM remains unstable at too low temperatures, for too strong electron–phonon coupling, and for too fast phonons.},

Since they are subject to electronic decay, inner-valence ionized states are not bound states but electronic resonances whose transient nature can only be described with special quantum-chemical methods. In this work, we explore the capacity of equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory with two techniques from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, complex basis functions and Feshbach–Fano projection with a plane wave description of the outgoing electron, to describe ICD. To this end, we compute the decay rates of several dimers: Ne 2 , NeAr, NeMg, and (HF) 2 , among which the energy of the outgoing electron varies between 0.3 and 16 eV. We observe that both methods deliver better results when the outgoing electron is fast, but the characteristic R −6 distance dependence of the ICD width is captured much better with complex basis functions.},

  abstract = {The influence of fluctuating charges or charge flow on the dynamic linear response properties of isolated molecules from the TS42 database is evaluated, with particular emphasis on dipole polarizability and C 6 dispersion coefficients. Two new descriptors are defined to quantify the charge-flow contribution to response properties, making use of the recoupled dipole polarizability to separate isotropic and anisotropic components. Molecular polarizabilities are calculated using the “frequency-dependent atom-condensed Kohn–Sham density functional theory approximated to second order,” i.e., the ACKS2 ω model. With ACKS2 ω , the charge-flow contribution can be constructed in two conceptually distinct ways that appear to yield compatible results. The charge-flow contribution is significantly affected by molecular geometry and the presence of polarizable bonds, in line with previous studies. We show that the charge-flow contribution qualitatively reproduces the polarizability anisotropy. The contribution to the anisotropic C 6 coefficients is less pronounced but cannot be neglected. The effect of fluctuating charges is only negligible for small molecules with at most one non-hydrogen atom. They become important and sometimes dominant for larger molecules or when highly polarizable bonds are present, such as conjugated, double, or triple bonds. Charge flow contributions cannot be explained in terms of individual atomic properties because they are affected by non-local features such as chemical bonding and geometry. Therefore, polarizable force fields and dispersion models can benefit from the explicit modeling of charge flow.},

Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) targets quantifying which parameter uncertainties impact the accuracy of the simulation results, e.g., to identify which parameters need to be determined more accurately. We present a GSA approach based on the Cramérs–von Mises distance. Unlike prevalent approaches, it combines the following properties: (i) it is equally suited for deterministic as well as stochastic model outputs, (ii) it does not require gradients, and (iii) it can be estimated from numerical quadrature without further numerical approximations. Using quasi-Monte Carlo for numerical integration and a first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo model for the CO oxidation on RuO 2 (110), we examine the performance of the approach. We find that the results agree very well with what is known in the literature about the sensitivity of this model and that the approach converges in a modest number of quadrature points. Furthermore, it appears to be robust against even extreme relative noise. All these properties make the method particularly suited for expensive (kinetic) Monte Carlo models because we can reduce the number of simulations as well as the target variance of each of these.},

  abstract = {In this work, we have proposed a Continuous Constant Potential Model (CCPM) based on grand canonical density functional theory for describing the electrocatalytic thermodynamics on single atom electrocatalysts dispersed on graphene support. The linearly potential-dependent capacitance is introduced to account for the net charge variation of the electrode surface and to evaluate the free energetics. We have chosen the CO 2 electro-reduction reaction on single-copper atom catalysts, dispersed by nitrogen-doped graphene [CuN X @Gra ( X = 2, 4)], as an example to show how our model can predict the potential-dependent free energetics. We have demonstrated that the net charges of both catalyst models are quadratically correlated with the applied potentials and, thus, the quantum capacitance is linearly dependent on the applied potentials, which allows us to continuously quantify the potential effect on the free energetics during the carbon dioxide reduction reaction instead of confining it to a specific potential. On the CuN 4 @Gra model, it is suggested that CO 2 adsorption, coupled with an electron transfer, is a potential determining step that is energetically unfavorable even under high overpotentials. Interestingly, the hydrogen adsorption on CuN 4 @Gra is extremely easy to occur at both the Cu and N sites, which probably results in the reconstruction of the CuN 4 @Gra catalyst, as reported by many experimental observations. On CuN 2 @Gra, the CO 2 RR is found to exhibit a higher activity at the adjacent C site, and the potential determining step is shifted to the *CO formation step at a wide potential range. In general, CCPM provides a simple method for studying the free energetics for the electrocatalytic reactions under constant potential.},

Quantum Monte Carlo methods are a promising avenue of development as their core algorithm exhibits a number of favorable properties: it is highly parallel and scales favorably with the considered system size, with an accuracy that is limited only by the choice of the wave function Ansatz . The recently introduced machine-learned parametrizations of quantum Monte Carlo Ansätze rely on the efficiency of neural networks as universal function approximators to achieve state of the art accuracy on a variety of molecular systems. With interest in the field growing rapidly, there is a clear need for easy to use, modular, and extendable software libraries facilitating the development and adoption of this new class of methods. In this contribution, the DeepQMC program package is introduced, in an attempt to provide a common framework for future investigations by unifying many of the currently available deep-learning quantum Monte Carlo architectures. Furthermore, the manuscript provides a brief introduction to the methodology of variational quantum Monte Carlo in real space, highlights some technical challenges of optimizing neural network wave functions, and presents example black-box applications of the program package. We thereby intend to make this novel field accessible to a broader class of practitioners from both the quantum chemistry and the machine learning communities.},

For larger systems, an accurate description of the underlying quantum dynamics is still a formidable task, and, hence, approaches employing machine learning techniques have been developed to reduce the computational effort of accurate dissipative quantum dynamics. A downside of many previous machine learning methods is that they require expensive numerical training datasets for systems of the same size as the ones they will be employed on, making them unfeasible to use for larger systems where those calculations are still too expensive. In this work, we will introduce a new method that is implemented as a machine-learned correction term to the so-called Numerical Integration of Schrödinger Equation (NISE) approach. It is shown that this term can be trained on data from small systems where accurate quantum methods are still numerically feasible. Subsequently, the NISE scheme, together with the new machine-learned correction, can be used to determine the dissipative quantum dynamics for larger systems. Furthermore, we show that the newly proposed machine-learned correction outperforms a previously handcrafted one, which, however, improves the results already considerably.},

  abstract = {The electric polarizability and the spread of the total position tensors are used to characterize the metallic vs insulator nature of large (finite) systems. Finite clusters are usually treated within the open boundary condition formalism. This introduces border effects, which prevent a fast convergence to the thermodynamic limit and can be eliminated within the formalism of periodic boundary conditions. Recently, we introduced an original approach to periodic boundary conditions, named Clifford boundary conditions. It considers a finite fragment extracted from a periodic system and the modification of its topology into that of a Clifford torus. The quantity representing the position is modified in order to fulfill the system periodicity. In this work, we apply the formalism of Clifford boundary conditions to the case of carbon nanotubes, whose treatment results in a particularly simple zigzag geometry. Indeed, we demonstrate that at the Hückel level, these nanotubes, either finite or periodic, are formally equivalent to a collection of non-interacting dimerized linear chains , thus simplifying their treatment. This equivalence is used to describe some nanotube properties as the sum of the contributions of the independent chains and to identify the origin of peculiar behaviors (such as conductivity). Indeed, if the number of hexagons along the circumference is a multiple of three, a metallic behavior is found, namely a divergence of both the (per electron) polarizability and total position spread of at least one linear chain. These results are in agreement with those in the literature from tight-binding calculations.},

In contrast to standard CCSD(T), the focal-point CCSD(T) method approaches the complete basis set (CBS) limit with only triple- ζ basis sets for the coupled-cluster portion of the computation. The predicted harmonic and fundamental frequencies were compared with the experimental values for a set of 20 molecules containing up to six atoms. The focal-point method combining CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T + d)Z with CBS-extrapolated MP2 has mean absolute errors vs experiment of only 7.3 cm −1 for the fundamental frequencies, which are essentially the same as the mean absolute error for CCSD(T) extrapolated to the CBS limit using the aug-cc-pV(Q + d)Z and aug-cc-pV(5 + d)Z basis sets.

  abstract = {We develop an accurate and numerically efficient non-adiabatic path-integral approach to simulate the non-linear spectroscopy of exciton–polariton systems. This approach is based on the partial linearized density matrix approach to model the exciton dynamics with explicit propagation of the phonon bath environment, combined with a stochastic Lindblad dynamics approach to model the cavity loss dynamics. Through simulating both linear and polariton two-dimensional electronic spectra, we systematically investigate how light–matter coupling strength and cavity loss rate influence the optical response signal. Our results confirm the polaron decoupling effect, which is the reduced exciton–phonon coupling among polariton states due to the strong light–matter interactions. We further demonstrate that the polariton coherence time can be significantly prolonged compared to the electronic coherence outside the cavity.},

  abstract = {It is known that some non-dynamic effects of electron correlation can be included in coupled cluster theory using a tailoring technique that separates the effects of non-dynamic and dynamic correlations. Recently, the simple pCCD (pair coupled cluster doubles) wavefunction was shown to provide good results for some non-dynamic correlation problems, such as bond-breaking, in a spin-adapted way with no active space selection. In this paper, we report a study of excited states using “tailored coupled cluster singles and doubles,” to attempt to use pCCD as a kernel for more complete coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) results for excited states. Several excited states are explored from those primarily due to single excitations to those dominated by doubly excited states and from singlet–triplet splittings for some diradical states. For the first two situations, tailored pCCD-TCCSD offers no improvement over equation of motion-CCSD. However, when we explore the singlet–triplet gap of diradical molecules that are manifestly multi-reference, a pCCD kernel provides improved results, particularly with generalized valence bond orbitals.},

Inspired by the recently synthesized metallic Janus MoSH, this study employs first-principles calculations to investigate the electronic structure, mechanical properties, and interface characteristics of Janus MoSH/GaN and MoHS/GaN van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. We find that both heterostructures exhibit isotropic mechanical properties and form p-type Schottky barrier contacts ( p -ShC) and the SB height of MoHS/GaN is smaller than that of the MoSH/GaN heterostructure. The variation in SB height and contact type under biaxial strain and electric field is also studied for both vdW heterostructures, respectively. Compared to the MoSH/GaN heterostructure, the MoHS/GaN heterostructure can transition to Ohmic contact (OhC) under biaxial strain and electric field, making the S-face contact of MoSH with GaN a more effective contact approach. These findings could provide a new pathway for the design of controllable Schottky nanodevices and high-performance electronic devices on GaN-based vdW heterostructures.},

  abstract = {Chiral materials exhibit many interesting physical properties including circular dichroism, circularly polarized photoluminescence, and spin selectivity. Since its discovery, chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) has been demonstrated in many chiral material systems, which indicates promising applications in spintronic devices. Thus, searching for compounds that possess both sizable chirality and excellent spin transport properties is in order. Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have attracted intensive research interest due to their long carrier lifetime, high carrier mobility, chemically tunable electronic properties, and long spin lifetime, which make this emerging class of semiconductors promising candidate for spintronics. Moreover, hybrid perovskites integrate inorganic octahedral framework and organic ligands, which may introduce chirality into the materials, especially in quasi-two-dimensional structures. Recently, CISS has been observed in 2D chiral hybrid perovskites, showing the spin filtering effect. Studies of CISS in chiral hybrid perovskites not only help deepen our understanding of CISS mechanism but also shed new light on designing novel spintronic devices. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art studies of CISS effect in 2D chiral hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites system. We also discuss the remaining challenges and research opportunities of employing CISS in next-generation spintronic devices.},

In this article, we review early efforts to use machine learning to approximate the XC functional, with a focus on the challenge of transferring knowledge from small molecules to larger systems. Recently, the transferability problem has been addressed through the use of quasi-local density-based descriptors, which are rooted in the holographic electron density theorem. We also discuss recent developments using deep-learning techniques that target high-level ab initio molecular energy and electron density for training. These efforts can be unified under a general framework, which will also be discussed from this perspective.

Our conclusions support the hypothesis that NN CG force fields trained with samples from one region of the proteins’ free energy surface can, indeed, extrapolate to unseen regions.

To help understand the radiosensitization of ● NO, we report reaction dynamics between ● NO and the radical cations of guanine (a 9HG ●+ conformer) and 9-methylguanine (9MG ●+ ). On the basis of the formation of 9HG ●+ and 9MG ●+ in the gas phase and the collisions of the radical cations with ● NO in a guided-ion beam mass spectrometer, the charge transfer reactions of 9HG ●+ and 9MG ●+ with ● NO were examined. For both reactions, the kinetic energy-dependent product ion cross sections revealed a threshold energy that is 0.24 (or 0.37) eV above the 0 K product 9HG (or 9MG) + NO + asymptote. To interrogate this abnormal threshold behavior, the reaction potential energy surface for [9MG + NO] + was mapped out at closed-shell singlet, open-shell singlet, and triplet states using density functional and coupled cluster theories. The results showed that the charge transfer reaction requires the interaction of a triplet-state surface originating from a reactant-like precursor complex 3 [9MG ●+ (↑)⋅(↑) ● NO] with a closed-shell singlet-state surface evolving from a charge-transferred complex 1 [9MG⋅NO + ]. During the reaction, an electron is transferred from π ∗ (NO) to perpendicular π ∗ (9MG), which introduces a change in orbital angular momentum. The latter offsets the change in electron spin angular momentum and facilitates intersystem crossing. The reaction threshold in excess of the 0 K thermochemistry and the low charge-transfer efficiency are rationalized by the vibrational excitation in the product ion NO + and the kinetic shift arising from a long-lived triplet intermediate.},

  abstract = {In liquid water, there is a natural tendency to form aggregates that consist of water molecules linked by hydrogen bonds. Such spontaneously formed aggregates are surrounded by a “sea” of disordered water molecules, with both forms remaining in equilibrium. The process of creating water aggregates also takes place in the solvation water of proteins, but in this case, the interactions of water molecules with the protein surface shift the equilibrium of the process. In this paper, we analyze the structural properties of the solvation water in antifreeze proteins (AFPs). The results of molecular dynamics analysis with the use of various parameters related to the structure of solvation water on the protein surface are presented. We found that in the vicinity of the active region responsible for the binding of AFPs to ice, the equilibrium is clearly shifted toward the formation of “ice-like aggregates,” and the solvation water has a more ordered ice-like structure. We have demonstrated that a reduction in the tendency to create “ice-like aggregates” results in a significant reduction in the antifreeze activity of the protein. We conclude that shifting the equilibrium in favor of the formation of “ice-like aggregates” in the solvation water in the active region is a prerequisite for the biological functionality of AFPs, at least for AFPs having a well-defined ice binding area. In addition, our results fully confirm the validity of the “anchored clathrate water” concept, formulated by Garnham et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 108 , 7363 (2011)].},

  abstract = {We extend a recently proposed kinetic theory of virus capsid assembly based on Model A kinetics and study the dynamics of the interconversion of virus capsids of different sizes triggered by a quench, that is, by sudden changes in the solution conditions. The work is inspired by in vitro experiments on functionalized coat proteins of the plant virus cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, which undergo a reversible transition between two different shell sizes ( T = 1 and T = 3) upon changing the acidity and salinity of the solution. We find that the relaxation dynamics are governed by two time scales that, in almost all cases, can be identified as two distinct processes. Initially, the monomers and one of the two types of capsids respond to the quench. Subsequently, the monomer concentration remains essentially constant, and the conversion between the two capsid species completes. In the intermediate stages, a long-lived metastable steady state may present itself, where the thermodynamically less stable species predominate. We conclude that a Model A based relaxational model can reasonably describe the early and intermediate stages of the conversion experiments. However, it fails to provide a good representation of the time evolution of the state of assembly of the coat proteins in the very late stages of equilibration when one of the two species disappears from the solution. It appears that explicitly incorporating the nucleation barriers to assembly and disassembly is crucial for an accurate description of the experimental findings, at least under conditions where these barriers are sufficiently large.},

In this study, a strategy was proposed for mapping PALS measurement data of isotactic polypropylene to classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations. The discrepancy between simulated and experimental glass transition temperatures was resolved by shortening the polymer chains, rather than adjusting for the temperature, using the Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) equation. The effective probe radii of ortho-positronium (o-Ps), determined by comparing PALS data with CMD simulations, were ∼0.8 nm, which was consistent with the o-Ps size given by the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The free-volume fraction corresponding to the effective probe radius was 12.3\% at the glass transition temperature, close to the value estimated using Simha–Boyer theory. The cavity number density was proportional to the effective probe radius and decreased with temperature. The o-Ps effective probe radius was proportional to both the critical probe radius and the −1/3 power of the monomer number density, and increased with increasing temperature. These findings suggest that combining PALS measurements with CMD simulations may provide insight into cavities in polymeric materials without relying on the WLF equation.},

While some larger asymmetric anions had higher diffusivities than smaller spherical anions, their diffusivities and mobilities did not exhibit a direct correlation to the anion volumes. The conductivity and anion dynamical correlations also followed the same trends as displayed by the diffusivity and mobility of anions. All the systems we examined displayed positively correlated motion among anions, suggesting a contribution that enhances the conductivity beyond the ideal Nernst–Einstein value. Analysis of ion transport mechanisms demonstrated very similar hopping characteristics among the spherical anions despite differences in their sizes.},

  abstract = {The performance of sustainable polymers can be modified and enhanced by incorporating functional groups in the backbone of the polymer chain that increases intermolecular interactions, thus impacting the thermal properties of the material. However, in-depth studies on the role of intermolecular interactions on the crystallization of these polymers are still needed. This work aims to ascertain whether incorporating functional groups able to induce intermolecular interactions can be used as a suitable systematic strategy to modify the polymer thermal properties and crystallization kinetics. Thus, amide and additional ester groups have been incorporated into aliphatic polyesters (PEs). The impact of intermolecular interactions on the melting and crystallization behavior, crystallization kinetics, and crystalline structure has been determined. Functional groups that form strong intermolecular interactions increase both melting and crystallization temperatures but retard the crystallization kinetics. Selecting appropriate functional groups allows tuning the crystallinity degree, which can potentially improve the mechanical properties and degradability in semicrystalline materials. The results demonstrate that it is possible to tune the thermal transitions and the crystallization kinetics of PEs independently by varying their chemical structure.},

Standard semilocal functionals based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are inclined toward an imprecise quantitative description of defects’ electronic structure. Hybrid functionals provide an improved prediction of electronic properties, albeit at a much higher computational cost. In this work, we test the newly developed Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) family of meta -GGA density functionals for selected color centers in diamond. In particular, we study nitrogen-, silicon-, germanium-, and tin-vacancy centers that have been recently investigated for their use in quantum technological applications. We show that SCAN and its derivatives, the rSCAN and r 2 SCAN functionals, significantly improve the calculated energies of optical transitions within the delta-self-consistent-field approach, almost reaching the accuracy of the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) functional. In the case of the NV − center, we also show that the SCAN family of functionals improves the description of the adiabatic potential energy surfaces compared to both GGA and hybrid functionals, improving calculated luminescence lineshapes. As a result of these findings, we recommend using the SCAN family of functionals as a promising alternative for studying color centers in solids.},

  abstract = {In silico property prediction based on density functional theory (DFT) is increasingly performed for crystalline materials. Whether quantitative agreement with experiment can be achieved with current methods is often an unresolved question, and may require detailed examination of physical effects such as electron correlation, reciprocal space sampling, phonon anharmonicity, and nuclear quantum effects (NQE), among others. In this work, we attempt first-principles equation of state prediction for the crystalline materials ScF 3 and CaZrF 6 , which are known to exhibit negative thermal expansion (NTE) over a broad temperature range. We develop neural network (NN) potentials for both ScF 3 and CaZrF 6 trained to extensive DFT data, and conduct direct molecular dynamics prediction of the equation(s) of state over a broad temperature/pressure range. The NN potentials serve as surrogates of the DFT Hamiltonian with enhanced computational efficiency allowing for simulations with larger supercells and inclusion of NQE utilizing path integral approaches. The conclusion of the study is mixed: while some equation of state behavior is predicted in semiquantitative agreement with experiment, the pressure-induced softening phenomenon observed for ScF 3 is not captured in our simulations. We show that NQE have a moderate effect on NTE at low temperature but does not significantly contribute to equation of state predictions at increasing temperature. Overall, while the NN potentials are valuable for property prediction of these NTE (and related) materials, we infer that a higher level of electron correlation, beyond the generalized gradient approximation density functional employed here, is necessary for achieving quantitative agreement with experiment.},

The obtained values of shift and broadening for E g and A 1g bands can be used for quantitative characterization of temperature change, for example, due to laser-induced heating during Raman spectra measurements. The theoretical analysis of the experimental results lets us conclude that Raman spectra changes for LiCoO 2 can be explained by the combination of thermal expansion of the crystal lattice and phonon damping by anharmonic coupling with comparable contributions of the three-phonon and four-phonon processes. The obtained results can be further used to develop Raman-based quality control tools.},

  abstract = {We investigate diffusion in fluids near surfaces that may be coated with polymer films. We first consider diffusion in hard sphere fluids near a planar hard wall. We specifically consider color diffusion, where hard spheres are labeled A or B but are otherwise identical in all respects. In this inhomogeneous fluid, we consider a surface reaction–diffusion problem. At the left wall, a particle of species A is converted to one of species B upon a wall collision. At the opposing wall, the reverse reaction takes place: B → A . Using molecular dynamics simulation, we study the steady state of this system. We demonstrate that in the homogeneous region, a diffusing particle is subject to an equilibrium oscillatory force, the solvation force, that arises from the interfacial structuring of the fluid at the wall. For the hard sphere/hard wall system, the solvation force can be determined in various ways. We use the solvation force [the potential of mean force (PMF)] to solve the continuum diffusion equation. This provides an adequate and accurate description of the reaction–diffusion problem. The analysis is then extended to consider both color diffusion in the presence of a slowly varying one-body field such as gravity and a more applied problem of diffusion of free species through a surface film consisting of tethered chains. In both cases, the PMF experienced by the free particles is affected, but the diffusion problem can be treated in the same way as for the simpler hard sphere color diffusion case.},

Consequently, this effect can significantly broaden the UV–vis absorption spectra of dyes but fail to improve the light-harvesting capability of DSSCs. Strikingly, YY-ThP(3F) , featuring 3-position fluorine substitution to cyanoacrylic acid, yields a relatively high V oc compared to the corresponding fluorine-free dye ( YY-ThP ). Furthermore, the co-sensitization of YY-ThP+YY-ThP(3F) achieves a remarkably high PCE and long-term stability.

The transport measurements indicate that an increment in O 2 concentration enhances the resistivity of a Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 film by two orders of magnitude. The adsorption of O 2 on the film’s surface helps in passivation of defects (∼50\% reduction in defect density on O 2 exposure), which inhibits ion migration and results in an increased resistivity of the film. The process of adsorption and desorption of O 2 on the film surface is found to be fully reversible. In contrast, the resistivity of double perovskite films decreases by an order of magnitude in the presence of moisture. This is attributed to the generation of free protons as a result of the dissociation of water molecules at the films’ surface, hence exhibiting an increase in current under external bias. The HDP films possess high resistivity (for T &lt; 100 °C) due to the desorption of physisorbed water layers from the surface, which gradually decreases with an increase in the operating temperature. This work demonstrates that O 2 and moisture are a good combination for defect passivation in any HDPs, in general.},

  abstract = {Metal–water interfaces are central to understanding aqueous-phase heterogeneous catalytic processes. However, the explicit modeling of the interface is still challenging as it necessitates extensive sampling of the interfaces’ degrees of freedom. Herein, we use ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study the adsorption of furfural, a platform biomass chemical on several catalytically relevant metal–water interfaces (Pt, Rh, Pd, Cu, and Au) at low coverages. We find that furfural adsorption is destabilized on all the metal–water interfaces compared to the metal–gas interfaces considered in this work. This destabilization is a result of the energetic penalty associated with the displacement of water molecules near the surface upon adsorption of furfural, further evidenced by a linear correlation between solvation energy and the change in surface water coverage. To predict solvation energies without the need for computationally expensive AIMD simulations, we demonstrate OH binding energy as a good descriptor to estimate the solvation energies of furfural. Using microkinetic modeling, we further explain the origin of the activity for furfural hydrogenation on intrinsically strong-binding metals under aqueous conditions, i.e., the endothermic solvation energies for furfural adsorption prevent surface poisoning. Our work sheds light on the development of active aqueous-phase catalytic systems via rationally tuning the solvation energies of reaction intermediates.},

Using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the permeation of pure gas compounds (CH 4 , CO 2 , O 2 , N 2 , and H 2 ) through nanoporous graphene membranes with varying pore sizes and geometries. Our simulations consider the recrossing mechanism, often neglected in previous studies, which has a significant effect on permeation for intermediate pore size to molecular diameter ratios. We find that the permeation process can be decoupled into two steps: the crossing process of gas molecules through the pore plane and the escaping process from the pore region to a neighboring adsorption site, which prevents recrossing. To account for these mechanisms, we use a permeance model expressed as the product of the permeance for the crossing process and the probability of molecule escape. This phenomenological model is extended to account for small polyatomic gas molecules and to describe permeation regimes ranging from molecular sieving to effusion. The proposed model captures the temperature dependence and provides insights into the key parameters of the gas/membrane interaction controlling the permeance of the system. This work lays the foundation for predicting gas permeance and exploring membrane separation factors in 2D materials such as graphene.},

  abstract = {Mass transfer through fluid interfaces is an important phenomenon in industrial applications as well as in naturally occurring processes. In this work, we investigate the mass transfer across vapor–liquid interfaces in binary mixtures using molecular dynamics simulations. We investigate the influence of interfacial properties on mass transfer by studying three binary azeotropic mixtures known to have different interfacial behaviors. Emphasis is placed on the effect of the intermolecular interactions by choosing mixtures with the same pure components but different cross-interactions such that different azeotropic behaviors are obtained. The molar flux is created by utilizing a non-stationary molecular dynamics simulation approach, where particles of one component are inserted into the vapor phase over a short period of time before the system’s response to this insertion is monitored. From a direct comparison of the density profiles and the flux profiles in close proximity to the interface, we analyze the particles’ tendency to accumulate in the interfacial region throughout the different stages of the simulation. We find that for mixtures with strong attractive cross-interactions, the inserted particles are efficiently transported into the liquid phase. For systems with weak attractive cross-interactions, the inserted particles show a tendency to accumulate in the interfacial region, and the flux through the system is lower. The results from this work indicate that the accumulation of particles at the interface can act as a hindrance to mass transfer, which has practical relevance in technical processes.},

In this study, we report experimental investigations of the high temperature (700–4000 K) transformation of a-pCO in the 47–120 GPa pressure range, conducted by x-ray diffraction in laser heated diamond anvil cells. Our results show the formation of no crystalline phases other than CO 2 phase V, thus indicating the decomposition of the pristine a-pCO into CO 2 and, likely, a mixture of amorphous C x O y suboxides and amorphous carbon hardly detectable at extreme conditions. These results support the theoretical picture of the pCO decomposition. We also show that the pressure-temperature kinetic border for this decomposition is very steep, thus indicating a strongly pressure-dependent kinetic barrier.},

After the inclusion of spin–orbit coupling and an external magnetic field, different ultrafast spin dynamics scenarios involving spin-flip and long-distance spin-transfer processes are achieved by various appropriately well-tailored time-resolved laser pulses within subpicosecond timescales. We additionally study the various effects of an external magnetic field on spin-flip and spin-transfer processes. Moreover, we obtain spin-dynamics processes induced by a double laser pulse, rather than a single one. We suggest enhancing the spatial addressability of spin-flip and spin-transfer processes. The findings presented in this article will improve our knowledge of the magnetic properties of carbon-based magnetic molecular structures. They also support the relevant experimental realization of spin dynamics and their potential applications in future molecular spintronics devices.},

  abstract = {A pulse-shaping technique in the mid-infrared spectral range based on pulses with a super-Gaussian temporal profile is considered for laser control. We show a realistic and efficient path to the population of a dark rovibrational state in acetylene (C 2 H 2 ). The laser-induced dynamics in C 2 H 2 are simulated using fully experimental structural parameters. Indeed, the rotation–vibration energy structure, including anharmonicities, is defined by the global spectroscopic Hamiltonian for the ground electronic state of C 2 H 2 built from the extensive high-resolution spectroscopy studies on the molecule, transition dipole moments from intensities, and the effects of the (inelastic) collisions that are parameterized from line broadenings using the relaxation matrix [A. Aerts, J. Vander Auwera, and N. Vaeck, J. Chem. Phys. 154 , 144308 (2021)]. The approach, based on an effective Hamiltonian, outperforms today’s ab initio computations both in terms of accuracy and computational cost for this class of molecules. With such accuracy, the Hamiltonian permits studying the inner mechanism of theoretical pulse shaping [A. Aerts et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 156 , 084302 (2022)] for laser quantum control. Here, the generated control pulse presents a number of interferences that take advantage of the control mechanism to populate the dark state. An experimental setup is proposed for in-laboratory investigation.},

Potential energy curves and crossing points of the low-lying excited states were analyzed. The results show that the tautomerization only occurs from 2-pyridone to 2-hydroxypyridine after electronic excitation to the S 1 ( ππ *) state. From this state, the system would be able to reach a conical intersection between S 1 and the dissociative S 2 ( πσ *) due to vibrational effects. Then, it can evolve to the hydroxy form in its ground state by reaching an intersection seam between the S 0 and the πσ * states. For this to happen, a roaming process responsible for the hydrogen atom migration would be required; otherwise, the system would revert to the 2-pyridone tautomer. The unfeasibility of the reverse process after optical excitation from the lactim to the lactam form is explained by the great amount of energy needed to reach the conical intersection between the ππ * and πσ * states. These findings would provide new insights into the understanding of the photophysics and photochemistry of a primordial heterocycle, considered a prebiotic model known to be found in interstellar clouds.},

This requires a minimal master equation description of both charge separation and recombination through a chiral bridge. To achieve this without adding complexity and entering in the microscopic origin of the phenomenon, we investigate the implications of spin-polarizing reaction operators to the master equation. The explicit inclusion of coherent evolution yields non-trivial behaviors in the charge and spin dynamics of the system. Finally, we apply this master equation to a setup comprising a molecular qubit attached to the donor–bridge–acceptor molecule, enabling qubit initialization, control, and read-out. Promising results are found by simulating this sequence of operations assuming realistic parameters and achievable experimental conditions.},

Following photoexcitation of the “bright” state (i.e., a singlet electron–hole pair) in a single carotenoid, the first step in the singlet fission process is ultrafast intramolecular conversion into the highly correlated “dark” (or 2 A g ) state. This state has both entangled singlet triplet-pair and charge-transfer character. Our theory is predicated on the assumption that it is the singlet triplet-pair component of the “dark” state that undergoes bimolecular singlet fission. We use valence bond theory to develop a minimal two-chain model of the triplet-pair states. The single and double chain triplet-pair spectra are described, as this helps explain the dynamics and the equilibrated populations. We simulate the dynamics of the initial entangled pair state using the quantum Liouville equation, including both spin-conserving and spin-nonconserving dephasing processes. By computing the intrachain and interchain singlet, triplet, and quintet triplet-pair populations, we show that singlet fission critically depends on the interchain coupling and the driving potential (that determines endothermic vs exothermic fission).},

  abstract = {A unified theory is presented for finite-temperature many-body perturbation expansions of the anharmonic vibrational contributions to thermodynamic functions, i.e., the free energy, internal energy, and entropy. The theory is diagrammatically size-consistent at any order, as ensured by the linked-diagram theorem proved in this study, and, thus, applicable to molecular gases and solids on an equal footing. It is also a basis-set-free formalism, just like its underlying Bose–Einstein theory, capable of summing anharmonic effects over an infinite number of states analytically. It is formulated by the Rayleigh–Schrödinger-style recursions, generating sum-over-states formulas for the perturbation series, which unambiguously converges at the finite-temperature vibrational full-configuration-interaction limits. Two strategies are introduced to reduce these sum-over-states formulas into compact sum-over-modes analytical formulas. One is a purely algebraic method that factorizes each many-mode thermal average into a product of one-mode thermal averages, which are then evaluated by the thermal Born–Huang rules. Canonical forms of these rules are proposed, dramatically expediting the reduction process. The other is finite-temperature normal-ordered second quantization, which is fully developed in this study, including a proof of thermal Wick’s theorem and the derivation of a normal-ordered vibrational Hamiltonian at finite temperature. The latter naturally defines a finite-temperature extension of size-extensive vibrational self-consistent field theory. These reduced formulas can be represented graphically as Feynman diagrams with resolvent lines, which include anomalous and renormalization diagrams. Two order-by-order and one general-order algorithms of computing these perturbation corrections are implemented and applied up to the eighth order. The results show no signs of Kohn–Luttinger-type nonconvergence.},

In a class of models widely used for the simulation of such dynamics, field-induced transitions between electronic states result in linear transformations (Duschinsky rotations) between the normal coordinates of the vibrational modes. Here, we present an approach for the calculation of the response functions, based on the explicit derivation of the vibrational state. This can be shown to coincide with a multimode squeezed coherent state, whose expression we derive within a quantum-optical formalism, and specifically by the sequential application to the initial state of rotation, displacement, and squeeze operators. The proposed approach potentially simplifies the numerical derivation of the response functions, avoiding the time integration of the Schrödinger equation, the Hamiltonian diagonalization, and the sum over infinite vibronic pathways. In addition, it quantitatively substantiates in the considered models the intuitive interpretation of the response functions in terms of the vibrational wave packet dynamics.},

For non-linear external potentials, we show analytically and numerically that the non-Gaussian parameter and the incoherent intermediate scattering function will not be correctly reproduced by the GLE if a linear projection is applied. This, however, can be overcome by using non-linear projection operators.

  abstract = {We introduce S z spin-projection based on cluster mean-field theory and apply it to the ground state of strongly correlated spin systems. In cluster mean-fields, the ground state wavefunction is written as a factorized tensor product of optimized cluster states. In previous work, we have focused on unrestricted cluster mean-field, where each cluster is S z symmetry adapted. We here remove this restriction by introducing a generalized cluster mean-field (GcMF) theory, where each cluster is allowed to access all S z sectors, breaking S z symmetry. In addition, a projection scheme is used to restore global S z , which gives rise to the S z spin-projected generalized cluster mean-field (S z GcMF). Both of these extensions contribute to accounting for inter-cluster correlations. We benchmark these methods on the 1D, quasi-2D, and 2D J 1 − J 2 and XXZ Heisenberg models. Our results indicate that the new methods (GcMF and S z GcMF) provide a qualitative and semi-quantitative description of the Heisenberg lattices in the regimes considered, suggesting them as useful references for further inter-cluster correlations, which are discussed in this work.},

  abstract = {Complex and even non-monotonic responses to external control can be found in many thermodynamic systems. In such systems, nonequilibrium shortcuts can rapidly drive the system from an initial state to a desired final state. One example is the Mpemba effect, where preheating a system allows it to cool faster. We present nonequilibrium hasty shortcuts—externally controlled temporal protocols that rapidly steer a system from an initial steady state to a desired final steady state. The term “hasty” indicates that the shortcut only involves fast dynamics without relying on slow relaxations. We provide a geometric analysis of such shortcuts in the space of probability distributions by using timescale separation and eigenmode decomposition. We further identify the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of nonequilibrium hasty shortcuts in an arbitrary system. The geometric analysis within the probability space sheds light on the possible features of a system that can lead to hasty shortcuts, which can be classified into different categories based on their temporal pattern. We also find that the Mpemba-effect-like shortcuts only constitute a small fraction of the diverse categories of hasty shortcuts. This theory is validated and illustrated numerically in the self-assembly model inspired by viral capsid assembly processes.},

  abstract = {A hybrid stochastic simulation method is developed to study H 2 –O 2 auto-ignition at the microscale. Simulation results show that the discrete and stochastic characteristics of reaction collisions have notable impacts on the ignition process, particularly in the early stages when only a few radicals exist. The statistical properties of ignition delay time, which reflect the accumulated stochasticity during ignition, are obtained and analyzed for different initial temperatures and total molecular numbers. It is found that the average and standard deviation of ignition delay time increase as the total molecular number decreases, with this phenomenon being particularly pronounced near the crossover temperature. When the total molecular number is sufficiently small, the chain initiation reaction becomes crucial to the stochastic properties, as its average firing time exhibits an inverse proportionality to the total molecular number. As the total molecular number increases, the influence of other chain reactions intensifies, causing the power law relation between standard deviation and total molecular number to shift from −1 power to −0.5 power. Owing to different chain reaction paths for high- and low-temperature auto-ignition, the strongest relative fluctuation occurs near the crossover temperature. A theoretical equation for the standard deviation of ignition delay time is obtained based on dimensional analysis, giving excellent agreement with the simulation results in both high- and low-temperature modes.},

  abstract = {We present numerically exact quantum dynamics simulations using the hierarchical equation of motion approach to investigate the resonance enhancement of chemical reactions due to the vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in polariton chemistry. The results reveal that the cavity mode acts like a “rate-promoting vibrational mode” that enhances the ground state chemical reaction rate constant when the cavity mode frequency matches the vibrational transition frequency. The exact simulation predicts that the VSC-modified rate constant will change quadratically as the light–matter coupling strength increases. When changing the cavity lifetime from the lossy limit to the lossless limit, the numerically exact results predict that there will be a turnover of the rate constant. Based on the numerical observations, we present an analytic rate theory to explain the observed sharp resonance peak of the rate profile when tuning the cavity frequency to match the quantum transition frequency of the vibrational ground state to excited states. This rate theory further explains the origin of the broadening of the rate profile. The analytic rate theory agrees with the numerical results under the golden rule limit and the short cavity lifetime limit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytic theory that is able to explain the sharp resonance behavior of the VSC-modified rate profile when coupling an adiabatic ground state chemical reaction to the cavity. We envision that both the numerical analysis and the analytic theory will offer invaluable theoretical insights into the fundamental mechanism of the VSC-induced rate constant modifications in polariton chemistry.},

Convergence of the iterative, non-linear optimization in VSCF calculations can be erratic or altogether unsuccessful, particularly for chemical systems involving low-frequency motions. In this work, a vibrational formulation of the Direct Inversion of the Iterative Subspace method of Pulay is presented and investigated. This formulation accounts for distinct attributes of the vibrational and electronic cases, including the expansion of each single-mode vibrational wavefunction in its own basis set. The resulting Direct Inversion of the Iterative Subspace method is shown to substantially accelerate VSCF convergence in all convergent cases as well as rectify many cases where Roothaan-based methods fail. Performance across systems ranging from small, rigid molecules to weakly bound molecular clusters is investigated in this analysis.},

The computational strategy is based on carefully calibrated time dependent density functional theory calculations and operates in conjunction with an excited state dynamics approach to treat in addition to absorption (ABS) and photoluminescence (PL), electronic circular dichroism (ECD), and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopies, respectively. The employed computational approach provides, an addition, access to the computation of phosphorescence rates in terms of radiative and non-radiative relaxation processes. The chosen molecules consist of representative examples of non-helicenic (NHC) and helicenic diastereomers. The agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra, including absorption (ABS, ECD) and emission (PL, CPL), is excellent, validating a quantitative interpretation of the spectral features on the basis of natural transition orbitals and TheoDore analyses. It is demonstrated that across the set of studied Re(I) diastereomers, the emission process in the case of NHC diastereomers is metal to ligand charge transfer in nature and is dominated by the easy-axis anisotropy of the emissive excited multiplet. On the contrary, in the cases of the helicenic diastereomers, the emission process is intra ligand charge transfer in nature and is dominated by the respective easy-plane anisotropy of the emissive excited multiplet. This affects remarkably the photoluminescent properties of the molecules in terms of PL and CPL spectral band shapes, spin-vibronic coupling, relaxation times, and the respective quantum yields. Spin-vibronic coupling effects are investigated at the level of the state-average complete active space self-consistent field in conjunction with quasi-degenerate second order perturbation theory. It is in fact demonstrated that a spin-vibronic coupling mechanism controls the observed photophysics of this class of Re(I) complexes.},

A promising method to achieve this is machine-learning potentials, which is an alternative to computationally demanding ab initio calculations. When applying machine-learning potentials, the construction of descriptors to represent atomic configurations is crucial. These descriptors should be invariant to symmetry operations. Handcrafted representations using a smooth overlap of atomic positions and graph neural networks (GNN) are examples of methods used for constructing symmetry-invariant descriptors. In this study, we propose a novel descriptor based on a persistence diagram (PD), a two-dimensional representation of persistent homology (PH). First, we demonstrated that the normalized two-dimensional histogram obtained from PD could predict the average energy per atom of amorphous carbon at various densities, even when using a simple model. Second, an analysis of the dimensional reduction results of the descriptor spaces revealed that PH can be used to construct descriptors with characteristics similar to those of a latent space in a GNN. These results indicate that PH is a promising method for constructing descriptors suitable for machine-learning potentials without hyperparameter tuning and deep-learning techniques.},

Moreover, the reciprocal activation can also induce a non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluid on a sphere. The spherical structure factor at the absorbing transition and the non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluid phases are scaled as S ( l → 0) ∼ ( l / R ) 0.45 and S ( l → 0) ∼ l ( l + 1)/ R 2 , respectively, which are both hyperuniform according to the definition of hyperuniformity on a sphere with l , the wave number, and R , the radius of the spherical surface. We also consider the impact of inertia in realistic hyperuniform fluids, and it is found only by adding an extra length-scale, above which hyperuniform scaling appears.

Here, we improve the original model, explicitly treating the electrostatic interactions between different lipid molecules and adding CG particle types. As a result, the available lipid types increase to 30. To parameterize the potential functions of the new model, we performed all-atom MD simulations of each lipid at three different temperatures using the CHARMM36 force field and the modified TIP3P model. Then, we parameterized both the bonded and non-bonded interactions to fit the area per lipid and the membrane thickness of each lipid bilayer by using the multistate Boltzmann Inversion method. The final model reproduces the area per lipid and the membrane thickness of each lipid bilayer at the three temperatures. We also examined the applicability of the new model, iSoLFv2, to simulate the phase behaviors of mixtures of DOPC and DPPC at different concentrations. The simulation results with iSoLFv2 are consistent with those using Dry Martini and Martini 3, although iSoLFv2 requires much fewer computations. iSoLFv2 has been implemented in the GENESIS MD software and is publicly available.},

  abstract = {PbS semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have been heavily explored for infrared optoelectronics but can exhibit visible-wavelength quantum-confined optical gaps when sufficiently small (⌀ = 1.8–2.7 nm). However, small PbS NCs traditionally exhibited very broad ensemble absorption linewidths, attributed to poor size-heterogeneity. Here, harnessing recent synthetic advances, we report photophysical measurements on PbS ensembles that span this underexplored size range. We observe that the smallest PbS NCs pervasively exhibit lower brightness and anomalously accelerated photoluminescence decays—relative to the idealized photophysical models that successfully describe larger NCs. We find that effects of residual ensemble size-heterogeneity are insufficient to explain our observations, so we explore plausible processes that are intrinsic to individual nanocrystals. Notably, the anomalous decay kinetics unfold, surprisingly, over hundreds-of-nanosecond timescales. These are poorly matched to effects of direct carrier trapping or fine-structure thermalization but are consistent with non-radiative recombination linked to a dynamic surface. Thus, the progressive enhancement of anomalous decay in the smallest particles supports predictions that the surface plays an outsized role in exciton–phonon coupling. We corroborate this claim by showing that the anomalous decay is significantly remedied by the installation of a rigidifying shell. Intriguingly, our measurements show that the anomalous aspect of these kinetics is insensitive to temperature between T = 298 and 77 K, offering important experimental constraint on possible mechanisms involving structural fluctuations. Thus, our findings identify and map the anomalous photoluminescence kinetics that become pervasive in the smallest PbS NCs and call for targeted experiments and theory to disentangle their origin.},

  abstract = {The transition to renewable energy sources comes along with the search for new energy storage solutions. Molecular solar thermal systems directly harvest and store solar energy in a chemical manner. By a suitable molecular design, a higher overall efficiency can be achieved. In this study, we investigate the surface chemistry of oxa-norbornadiene/quadricyclane derivatives on a Pt(111) surface. Specifically, we focus on the energy storage and release properties of molecules that are substituted with ester moieties of different sizes. For our model catalytic approach, synchrotron radiation-based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were conducted in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and correlated with the catalytic behavior in the liquid phase monitored by photochemical infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy. The differences in their spectral appearance enabled us to unambiguously differentiate the energy-lean and energy-rich isomers and decomposition products. Next to qualitative information on the adsorption motifs, temperature-programmed experiments allowed for the observation of thermally induced reactions and the deduction of the related reaction pathways. We analyzed the selectivity of the cycloreversion reaction from the energy-rich quadricyclane derivative to its energy-lean norbornadiene isomer and competing processes, such as desorption and decomposition. For the 2,3-bis(methylester)-substitution, the cycloreversion reaction was found to occur between 310 and 340 K, while the thermal stability limit of the compounds was determined to be 380 K. The larger 2,3-bis(benzylester) derivatives have a lower apparent adsorption energy and a decomposition onset already at 135 K. In the liquid phase (in acetonitrile), we determined the rate constants for the cycloreversion reaction on Pt(111) to k = 5.3 × 10 −4 s −1 for the 2,3-bis(methylester)-substitution and k = 6.3 × 10 −4 s −1 for the 2,3-bis(benzylester) derivative. The selectivities were of &gt;99\% and 98\% for the two molecules, respectively. The difference in the catalytic behavior of Pt(111) for both derivatives is less pronounced in the liquid phase than in UHV, which we attribute to the passivation of the Pt(111) surface by carbonaceous species under ambient conditions.},

While many properties of these materials have already been characterized, we are not aware of any study that focuses on the comprehensive property assessment of a large number of formate perovskites. A comparison of the properties of materials within the family is challenging due to systematic errors attributed to different techniques or the lack of data. For example, complete piezoelectric, dielectric, and elastic tensors are not available. In this work, we utilize first-principles density functional theory based simulations to overcome these challenges and to report structural, mechanical, dielectric, piezoelectric, and ferroelectric properties of 29 formate perovskites. We find that these materials exhibit elastic stiffness in the range 0.5–127.0 GPa; highly anisotropic linear compressibility, including zero and even negative values; dielectric constants in the range 0.1–102.1; highly anisotropic piezoelectric response with the longitudinal values in the range 1.18–21.12 pC/N; and spontaneous polarizations in the range 0.2–7.8 μ C/cm 2 .

In chains where the curvature and torsion of the helix are small, we find that the EMF on the binormal component of the atomic OAM is created by the curvature, while that on the tangential component is produced by the torsion. We show that such coupling of the atomic OAM and the interatomic hopping leads to current-induced orbital and spin polarizations. We expect that the present coupling, which is expressed locally, can be used to estimate orbital and spin polarizations locally induced in molecules and solids.},

It is evidenced that D 11 and a can be simultaneously determined for binary mixtures with Lewis numbers Le = a / D 11 ranging over two orders of magnitude down to Le ≈ 5 or in the presence of minor advection for binary mixtures possessing a negative Soret coefficient in the investigated temperature and pressure ranges from (298.15 to 473.15) K and from about (0.5 to 25) MPa. The determined diffusivities are compared with those measured by heterodyne dynamic light scattering or obtained from the literature, with a focus on achievable uncertainties. By this comparison, it is shown that the determination of a by the shadowgraph method was hindered by mode-coupling effects for Le ≈ 5, whereas a determination of D 11 was always possible for mixtures with Le ≥ 5. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that even in the presence of solutal advection, the description of the purely diffusive behavior of non-equilibrium fluctuations in concentration remains valid.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the molecular dynamics simulation of 1 mol kg −1 LiPF 6 in a binary solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethylcarbonate, which is a representative electrolyte solution for lithium-ion batteries. The simulation successfully reproduced the diffusion coefficient, ionic conductivity, and shear viscosity as functions of EC content at 300 K, which had been experimentally determined in our previous study. The Yukawa potential was adopted to model intercharge interactions to reduce computational costs, which consequently allowed us to precisely calculate the conductivity and viscosity by directly integrating time-correlation functions without explicitly modeling the molecular polarization. Breaking down microscopic current correlation functions into components revealed that, whereas the cation–anion attractive interaction dominantly impedes the conduction when the EC content is low, it is the cation–cation and anion–anion repulsive interactions that reduce the conductivity at a high EC content. An analysis of the pressure correlations revealed that all components positively contribute to the viscosity in the binary solvent without the electrolyte. On the other hand, negative terms are observed in five out of six cross correlations in the presence of the electrolyte, implying that these correlations negatively contribute to the shear stress and entropy production, both of which are net positive.},

Despite the small size of these droplets (1000 He atoms in the merged droplet) imposed by computational limitations, we have found that quantized vortices may be readily nucleated for reasonable collision parameters. At variance with head-on collisions, where only vortex rings are produced, collisions with a non-zero impact parameter produce linear vortices that are nucleated at indentations appearing on the surface of the deformed merged droplet. Whereas for equal-size droplets, vortices are produced in pairs, an odd number of vortices can appear when the colliding droplet sizes are different. In all cases, vortices coexist with surface capillary waves. The possibility for collisions to be at the origin of vortex nucleation in experiments involving very large droplets is discussed. An additional surprising result is the observation of the drops coalescence even for grazing and distal collisions at relative velocities as high as 80 and 40 m/s, respectively, induced by the long-range van der Waals attraction between the droplets.},

Such collisions can occur in the interstellar medium with H 2 in either para ( p- ) or ortho ( o- ) state, of which the p- H 2 state can be approximated via its collision with He (using a scaling factor) or with a reduced rigid rotor-H 2 surface (by averaging over various orientations of H 2 ). In the current work, a four-dimensional (4D) ab initio potential energy surface (PES) is considered to study the collision dynamics of H 2 in both p - and o - states and the results are compared with previous approximations. The 4D surface is constructed using the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster method CCSD(T)-F12b with the augmented triple zeta basis AVTZ and then fitted into an artificial neural networks (NN) model to augment the surface and account for missing data points. The radial coefficients are obtained from this NN fitted 4D PES via a least square fit over two spherical harmonics functions. The cross sections ( σ ) are computed using the close-coupling (CC) method (until 230 cm −1 ) for both p- and o- H 2 collisions, and the rates are obtained by Boltzmann distribution over the translational energy of H 2 until 100 K. The o- H 2 rates are found to be higher by 25\%–30\% and 10\%–20\% compared to the p- H 2 rates for Δ j = 2 and higher order transitions, respectively. The coupled-state/centrifugal sudden approximated rates are also computed and found to have deviations as large as 40\% when compared to CC rates, thus making quantitative descriptions unreliable.},

Studying such a system in solution is a crucial step for understanding the solvent effects on its properties, which can have implications in fields such as optoelectronics and biophysics. We found that the DMACA molecule presents different geometries in nonpolar and polar solvents, changing from a polyene-like structure with a pyramidal dimethylamino group (in gas phase or nonpolar solvents) to a cyanine-like structure with a planar dimethylamino group in water due to the stabilizing effect of hydrogen bonds between DMACA and water. The molecular absorption spectrum showed a significant change, increasing solvent polarity with a large shift of the lower energy band, while the other two low lying bands did not shift significantly. The study accurately described the solvatochromic shift of the lowest-energy band and analyzed the structure of the excited states in terms of the one-electron transition density matrix, which showed that the dominant excited state (associated with the first lower energy band) is characterized by a local excitation on the benzene ring with charge transfer character to the carbon conjugated segment.},

In addition, the ultraviolet (UV)–vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) absorption spectra of gas-phase RIs have been measured in the photon energy range of 5–11 eV using the VUV Fourier transform spectrometer at the VUV DESIRS beamline of the synchrotron SOLEIL facility. The use of high-laser-field strengths in matter–radiation interaction generates highly non-linear phenomena, such as the Stark shift effect, which distorts the potential energy surfaces of molecules by varying both the energy of electronic and rovibrational states and their ionization energies. The Stark shift can then generate resonances between intermediate states and an integer number of laser photons of a given wavelength, which are commonly known as Freeman resonances. Here, we study how the molecular structure of linear and branched alkyl iodides affects the UV–VUV absorption spectrum, the MPI process, and the generation of Freeman resonances. The obtained results reveal a dominant resonance in the experiments at 800 nm, which counter-intuitively appears at the same photoelectron kinetic energy in the whole alkyl iodide series. The ionization pathways of this resonance strongly involve the 6 p ( 2 E 3/2 ) Rydberg state with different degrees of vibrational excitation, revealing an energy compensation effect as the R-chain complexity increases.},

  abstract = {We study the chaotic, huge fluctuation of electronic state, resultant intramolecular energy redistribution, and strong chemical bonding surviving the fluctuation with exceedingly long lifetimes of highly excited boron clusters. Those excited states constitute densely quasi-degenerate state manifolds. The huge fluctuation is induced by persisting multidimensional nonadiabatic transitions among the states in the manifold. We clarify the mechanism of their coexistence and its physical significance. In doing so, we concentrate on two theoretical aspects. One is quantum chaos and energy randomization, which are to be directly extracted from the properties of the total electronic wavefunctions. The present dynamical chaos takes place through frequent transitions from adiabatic states to others, thereby making it very rare for the system to find dissociation channels. This phenomenon leads to the concept of what we call intramolecular nonadiabatic electronic-energy redistribution, which is an electronic-state generaliztion of the notion of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution. The other aspect is about the peculiar chemical bonding. We investigate it with the energy natural orbitals (ENOs) to see what kind of theoretical structures lie behind the huge fluctuation. The ENO energy levels representing the highly excited states under study appear to have four robust layers. We show that the energy layers responsible for chaotic dynamics and those for chemical bonding are widely separated from each other, and only when an event of what we call “inter-layer crossing” happens to burst can the destruction of these robust energy layers occur, resulting in molecular dissociation. This crossing event happens only rarely because of the large energy gaps between the ENO layers. It is shown that the layers of high energy composed of complex-valued ENOs induce the turbulent flow of electrons and electronic-energy in the cluster. In addition, the random and fast time-oscillations of those high energy ENOs serve as a random force on the nuclear dynamics, which can work to prevent a concentration of high nuclear kinetic energy in the dissociation channels.},

  abstract = {With relevant chemical space growing larger and larger by the day, the ability to extend computational tractability over that larger space is of paramount importance in virtually all fields of science. The solution we aim to provide here for this issue is in the form of the generalized many-body expansion for building density matrices (GMBE-DM) based on the set-theoretical derivation with overlapping fragments, through which the energy can be obtained by a single Fock build. In combination with the purification scheme and the truncation at the one-body level, the DM-based GMBE(1)-DM-P approach shows both highly accurate absolute and relative energies for medium-to-large size water clusters with about an order of magnitude better than the corresponding energy-based GMBE(1) scheme. Simultaneously, GMBE(1)-DM-P is about an order of magnitude faster than the previously proposed MBE-DM scheme [F. Ballesteros and K. U. Lao, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 18 , 179 (2022)] and is even faster than a supersystem calculation without significant parallelization to rescue the fragmentation method. For even more challenging systems including ion–water and ion–pair clusters, GMBE(1)-DM-P also performs about 3 and 30 times better than the energy-based GMBE(1) approach, respectively. In addition, this work provides the first overlapping fragmentation algorithm with a robust and effective binning scheme implemented internally in a popular quantum chemistry software package. Thus, GMBE(1)-DM-P opens a new door to accurately and efficiently describe noncovalent clusters using quantum mechanics.},

  abstract = {Explanation for the modification of rates and mechanism of reactions carried out in optical cavities still eludes us. Several studies indicate that the cavity-mediated changes in the nature of vibrational energy flow within a molecule may play a significant role. Here, we study a model polaritonic system, proposed and analyzed earlier by Fischer et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 156 , 154305 (2022), comprising a one-dimensional isomerization mode coupled to a single photon mode in a lossless cavity. We show that the isomerization probability in the presence of virtual photons, for specific cavity–system coupling strengths and cavity frequencies, can exhibit suppression or enhancement for different choices of the initial reactant vibropolariton wavepacket. We observe a qualitative agreement between the classical and quantum average isomerization probabilities in the virtual photon case. A significant part of the effects due to coupling to the cavity can be rationalized in terms of a “chaos–order–chaos” transition of the classical phase space and the phase space localization nature of the polariton states that dominantly participate in the quantum isomerization dynamics. On the other hand, for initial states with zero photons (i.e., a “dark cavity”), the isomerization probability is suppressed when the cavity frequency is tuned near to the fundamental frequency of the reactive mode. The classical–quantum correspondence in the zero photon case is unsatisfactory. In this simple model, we find that the suppression or enhancement of isomerization arises due to the interplay between cavity–system energy flow dynamics and quantum tunneling.},

  abstract = {Slow kinetic processes in molecular systems can be analyzed by computing the dominant eigenpairs of the Koopman operator or its generator. In this context, the Variational Approach to Markov Processes (VAMP) provides a rigorous way of discerning the quality of different approximate models. Kernel methods have been shown to provide accurate and robust estimates for slow kinetic processes, but they are sensitive to hyper-parameter selection and require the solution of large-scale generalized eigenvalue problems, which can easily become computationally demanding for large data sizes. In this contribution, we employ a stochastic approximation of the kernel based on random Fourier features (RFFs) to derive a small-scale dual eigenvalue problem that can be easily solved. We provide an interpretation of this procedure in terms of a finite, randomly generated basis set. By combining the RFF approach and model selection by means of the VAMP score, we show that kernel parameters can be efficiently tuned and accurate estimates of slow molecular kinetics can be obtained for several benchmarking systems, such as deca alanine and the NTL9 protein.},

  abstract = {Recent coarse-grained (CG) models have often supplemented conventional pair potentials with potentials that depend upon the local density around each particle. In this work, we investigate the temperature-dependence of these local density (LD) potentials. Specifically, we employ the multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) force-matching variational principle to parameterize pair and LD potentials for one-site CG models of molecular liquids at ambient pressure. The accuracy of these MS-CG LD potentials quite sensitively depends upon the length-scale, r c , that is employed to define the local density. When the local density is defined by the optimal length-scale, r c * ⁠ , the MS-CG potential often accurately describes the reference state point and can provide reasonable transferability across a rather wide range of temperatures. At ambient pressure, the optimal LD length-scale varies linearly with temperature over a very wide range of temperatures. Moreover, if one adopts this temperature-dependent LD length-scale, then the MS-CG LD potential appears independent of temperature, while the MS-CG pair potential varies linearly across this temperature range. This provides a simple means for predicting pair and LD potentials that accurately model new state points without performing additional atomistic simulations. Surprisingly, at certain state points, the predicted potentials provide greater accuracy than MS-CG potentials that were optimized for the state point.},

To understand the mechanism of E2P-EA, we analyze how dipole orientation, radiative lifetime, energy detuning between intermediate states, separation distance, and entanglement time impact the E2P-EA rate. Our study shows that there are quantum interference effects in the E2P-EA rate expression that lead to oscillations in the rate as a function of entanglement time. Furthermore, we find that the E2P-EA rate for a representative system consisting of two quantum dots can be comparable to one-photon emission/absorption (OP-EA) when donor and acceptor are within a few nm. However, the E2P-EA rate falls off much more quickly with separation distance than does OP-EA.},

  abstract = {Empirical force fields employed in molecular dynamics simulations of complex systems are often optimized to reproduce experimentally determined structural and thermodynamic properties. In contrast, experimental knowledge about the interconversion rates between metastable states in such systems is hardly ever incorporated in a force field due to a lack of an efficient approach. Here, we introduce such a framework based on the relationship between dynamical observables, such as rate constants, and the underlying molecular model parameters using the statistical mechanics of trajectories. Given a prior ensemble of molecular dynamics trajectories produced with imperfect force field parameters, the approach allows for the optimal adaption of these parameters such that the imposed constraint of equally predicted and experimental rate constant is obeyed. To do so, the method combines the continuum path ensemble maximum caliber approach with path reweighting methods for stochastic dynamics. When multiple solutions are found, the method selects automatically the combination that corresponds to the smallest perturbation of the entire path ensemble, as required by the maximum entropy principle. To show the validity of the approach, we illustrate the method on simple test systems undergoing rare event dynamics. Next to simple 2D potentials, we explore particle models representing molecular isomerization reactions and protein–ligand unbinding. Besides optimal interaction parameters, the methodology gives physical insights into what parts of the model are most sensitive to the kinetics. We discuss the generality and broad implications of the methodology.},

Accurately simulating the associated transport mechanisms ideally requires utilizing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to model the bond breaking and formation involved in proton transfer and path-integral simulations to model the nuclear quantum effects relevant to light hydrogen atoms. These requirements result in a prohibitive computational cost, especially at the time and length scales needed to converge proton transport properties. Here, we present machine-learned potentials (MLPs) that can model both excess protons and hydroxide ions at the generalized gradient approximation and hybrid density functional theory levels of accuracy and use them to perform multiple nanoseconds of both classical and path-integral proton defect simulations at a fraction of the cost of the corresponding ab initio simulations. We show that the MLPs are able to reproduce ab initio trends and converge properties such as the diffusion coefficients of both excess protons and hydroxide ions. We use our multi-nanosecond simulations, which allow us to monitor large numbers of proton transfer events, to analyze the role of hypercoordination in the transport mechanism of the hydroxide ion and provide further evidence for the asymmetry in diffusion between excess protons and hydroxide ions.},

For confined films, perfect scaling of the thickness-dependent end-to-end distance and radius of gyrations normalized to their bulk values in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the surfaces is obtained. In particular, the reduced end-to-end distance in the perpendicular direction is very well described by an extended Silberberg model. For bulk polymer melts, the relation between the chain length and T g follows the Fox–Flory equation. For films, no further confinement induced chain length effect is observed. T g decreases and is well described by Keddie’s formula, where the reduction is more pronounced for free-standing films. It is shown that T g begins to deviate from bulk T g at the characteristic film thickness, where the average bond orientation becomes anisotropic and the entanglement density decreases.},

  abstract = {A polarization consistent framework, where dielectric screening is affected consistently in polarizable continuum model (PCM) calculations, is employed for the study of solvation energies. The computational framework combines a screened range-separated-hybrid functional (SRSH) with PCM calculations, SRSH-PCM, where dielectric screening is imposed in both PCM self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) iterations and the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We begin by demonstrating the impact of modifying the Hamiltonian to include such dielectric screening in SCRF iterations by considering the solutions of electrostatically embedded Hartree–Fock (HF) exact exchange equations. Long-range screened HF-PCM calculations are shown to capture properly the linear dependence of gap energy of frontier orbitals on the inverse of the dielectric constant, whereas unscreened HF-PCM orbital energies are fallaciously semi-constant with respect to the dielectric constant and, therefore, inconsistent with the ionization energy gaps. Similar trends affect density functional theory (DFT) calculations that aim to achieve predictive quality. Importantly, the dielectric screened calculations are shown to significantly affect DFT- and HF PCM-based solvation energies, where screened solvation energies are smaller compared to the unscreened values. Importantly, SRSH-PCM, therefore, appears to reduce the tendency of DFT-PCM to overestimate solvation energies, where we find the effect to increase with the dielectric constant and the polarity of the molecular solute, trends that enhance the quality of DFT-PCM calculations of solvation energy. Understanding the relationship of dielectric screening in the Hamiltonian and DFT-PCM calculations can ultimately benefit on-going efforts for the design of predictive and parameter free descriptions of solvation energies.},

Here, it was used to calculate the nucleation free energies of both bcc and fcc clusters formed by Lennard–Jones particles. Under the simulation conditions considered in this study, a cross-over of the thermodynamic stability from the bcc to the fcc structure was observed directly from the free energy results. In addition, the free energies obtained for both types of clusters were used to extrapolate bulk phase information, including chemical potential and surface tension, which revealed that bcc clusters are favored due to the lower surface tension. These results corroborate a recent classical density functional theory study. This work also demonstrates that this approach can be used to predict the entire thermodynamic landscape (i.e., free energies for clusters of different structures and sizes, including an infinitely large cluster, which is the bulk phase), which is important to answer fundamental questions related to crystallization such as the origin of polymorphism.},

We then show that many of these small elements can be replaced by zero with small errors of the resulting full set of eigenvalues, depending on the threshold value for this replacement. As a result of this empirical evidence, we investigate three machine learning approaches to predict the zero elements. This is shown to be successful for these H -matrices after training on a small set of calculated elements. For H -matrices of vinyl and glycine, of order 15 552 and 8828, respectively, training on a percent or so of elements is sufficient to obtain all eigenvalues with a mean absolute error of roughly 2 cm −1 .},

Live-cell compatible approaches that can quantify to what extent a given protein participates in homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes of different size and subunit composition are therefore critical to advance our understanding of how cellular physiology is governed by these molecular interactions. Biomolecular complex formation changes the diffusion coefficient of constituent proteins, and these changes can be measured using fluorescence microscopy-based approaches, such as single-molecule tracking, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. In this review, we focus on the use of single-molecule tracking to identify, resolve, and quantify the presence of freely-diffusing proteins and protein complexes in living cells. We compare and contrast different data analysis methods that are currently employed in the field and discuss experimental designs that can aid the interpretation of the obtained results. Comparisons of diffusion rates for different proteins and protein complexes in intracellular aqueous environments reported in the recent literature reveal a clear and systematic deviation from the Stokes–Einstein diffusion theory. While a complete and quantitative theoretical explanation of why such deviations manifest is missing, the available data suggest the possibility of weighing freely-diffusing proteins and protein complexes in living cells by measuring their diffusion coefficients. Mapping individual diffusive states to protein complexes of defined molecular weight, subunit stoichiometry, and structure promises to provide key new insights into how protein–protein interactions regulate protein conformational, translational, and rotational dynamics, and ultimately protein function.},

The current account presents a comparative study, emphasizing the impact of engineering nanostructures and selecting magnetic ions in shaping carrier–magnetic ion interactions. Various host materials, including the II–VI group, halide perovskites, and I–III–VI 2 in diverse structural configurations such as core/shell quantum dots, seeded nanorods, and nanoplatelets, incorporated with magnetic ions such as Mn 2+ , Ni 2+ , and Cu 1+/2+ are highlighted.

The information extracted from the analyses of the ODMR spectra in those studies exposes fundamental physical parameters, such as g -factors, exchange coupling constants, and hyperfine interactions, together providing insights into the nature of the carrier (electron, hole, dopant), its local surroundings (isotropic/anisotropic), and spin dynamics.

More recently, this question has witnessed a renewed interest in light of the hypothesis that knotted proteins require the assistance of non-native interactions to fold efficiently. Here, we conduct extensive equilibrium and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of a simple off-lattice C-alpha model to explore the role of non-native interactions in the thermodynamics and kinetics of three proteins embedding a trefoil knot in their native structure. We find that equilibrium knotted conformations are stabilized by non-native interactions that are non-local, and proximal to native ones, thus enhancing them. Additionally, non-native interactions increase the knotting frequency at high temperatures, and in partially folded conformations below the transition temperatures. Although non-native interactions clearly enhance the efficiency of transition from an unfolded conformation to a partially folded knotted one, they are not required to efficiently fold a knotted protein. Indeed, a native-centric interaction potential drives the most efficient folding transition, provided that the simulation temperature is well below the transition temperature of the considered model system.},

More recently, they have become a key component of rotationally equivariant models in geometric machine learning, including applications to atomic-scale modeling of molecules and materials. We present an elegant and efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the real-valued spherical harmonics. Our construction features many of the desirable properties of existing schemes and allows us to compute Cartesian derivatives in a numerically stable and computationally efficient manner. To facilitate usage, we implement this algorithm in sphericart , a fast C++ library that also provides C bindings, a Python API, and a PyTorch implementation that includes a GPU kernel.},

The organization of the potential energy landscape plays a crucial role in such processes, which may involve changes in the periodic boundaries. This study reports the implementation of a general framework for periodic condensed matter systems in our energy landscape analysis software, allowing for variation in both the unit cell and atomic positions. This implementation provides access to basin-hopping global optimization, the doubly nudged elastic band procedure for identifying transition state candidates, the missing connection approach for multi-step pathways, and general tools for the construction and analysis of kinetic transition networks. The computational efficacy of the procedures is explored using the state-of-the-art semiempirical method GFN1-xTB for the first time in this solid-state context. We investigate the effectiveness of this level of theory by characterizing the potential energy and enthalpy landscapes of several systems, including silicon, CdSe, ZnS, and NaCl, and discuss further technical challenges, such as translational permutation of the cell. Despite the expected limitations of the semiempirical method, we find that the resulting energy landscapes provide useful insight into solid-state simulations, which will facilitate detailed analysis of processes such as defect and ion migration, including refinement at higher levels of theory.},

Here, we use magneto-optical Kerr microscopy to image domains in thin films and show that chiral polypeptides strongly pin domains, increasing the coercive field locally. In our study, we also observe a rotation of the easy magnetic axis toward the out-of-plane, depending on the sample’s domain size and the adsorption area.

However, the application of DFT methods becomes computationally intensive when hundreds of thousands of compounds are to be screened. Such is the case when all the isomers for the 1-alkyl-3-alkylimidazolium cation [C n C m im] + (n = 1–10, m = 1–10) are considered. Enumerating the isomer space of [C n C m im] + yields close to 386 000 cation structures. Calculating frontier orbital energies for each would be computationally very expensive and time-consuming using DFT. In this article, we develop a machine learning model based on the extreme gradient boosting method using a small subset of the isomer space and predict the HOMO and LUMO energies. Using the model, the HOMO energies are predicted with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.4 eV and the LUMO energies are predicted with a MAE of 0.2 eV. Inferences are also drawn on the type of the descriptors deemed important for the HOMO and LUMO energy estimates. Application of the machine learning model results in a drastic reduction in computational time required for such calculations.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have provided conclusive evidence for the existence of a liquid–liquid critical point in numerical models of water. Such a scenario implies the competition between two local molecular arrangements of different densities: a high-density liquid (HDL) and a low-density liquid (LDL). Within this context, the development of accurate structural indicators to properly characterize the two interconverting local structures is demanded. In a previous study, we introduced a reliable energy-based structural descriptor that properly discriminates water molecules into tetrahedrally arranged molecules (T molecules) and distorted molecules (D molecules). The latter constitute defects in terms of hydrogen bond (HB) coordination and have been shown to represent a minority component, even at high temperatures above the melting point. In addition, the D molecules tend to form high-quality HBs with three T molecules and to be surrounded by T and D molecules at further distances. Thus, it became evident that, while the LDL state might consist of a virtually pure T state, the HDL state would comprise mixed molecular arrangements including the D molecules. Such a need to abandon the single-molecule description requires the investigation of the degree of structural information to be incorporated in order to build an appropriate multi-molecule indicator. Hence, in this work, we shall study the effect of the local structural constraints on the water molecules in order to discriminate the different molecular arrangements into two disjoint classes. This will enable us to build a multi-molecule structural indicator for water whose performance will then be investigated within the water’s supercooled regime.},

  abstract = {The propensity of water to remain in a metastable liquid state at temperatures below its equilibrium melting point holds significant potential for cryopreserving biological material such as tissues and organs. The benefits conferred are a direct result of progressively reducing metabolic expenditure due to colder temperatures while simultaneously avoiding the irreversible damage caused by the crystallization of ice. Unfortunately, the freezing of water in bulk systems of clinical relevance is dominated by random heterogeneous nucleation initiated by uncharacterized trace impurities, and the marked unpredictability of this behavior has prevented the implementation of supercooling outside of controlled laboratory settings and in volumes larger than a few milliliters. Here, we develop a statistical model that jointly captures both the inherent stochastic nature of nucleation using conventional Poisson statistics as well as the random variability of heterogeneous nucleation catalysis through bivariate extreme value statistics. Individually, these two classes of models cannot account for both the time-dependent nature of nucleation and the sample-to-sample variability associated with heterogeneous catalysis, and traditional extreme value models have only considered variations of the characteristic nucleation temperature. We conduct a series of constant cooling rate and isothermal nucleation experiments with physiological saline solutions and leverage the statistical model to evaluate the natural variability of kinetic and thermodynamic nucleation parameters. By quantifying freezing probability as a function of temperature, supercooled duration, and system volume while accounting for nucleation site variability, this study also provides a basis for the rational design of stable supercooled biopreservation protocols.},

  abstract = {During devitrification, pre-existing crystallites grow by adding particles to their surface via a process that is either thermally activated (diffusive mode) or happens without kinetic barriers (fast crystal growth mode). It is yet unclear what factors determine the crystal growth mode and how to predict it. With simulations of repulsive hard-sphere-like (Weeks–Chandler–Andersen) glasses, we show for the first time that the same system at the same volume fraction and temperature can devitrify via both modes depending on the preparation protocol of the glass. We prepare two types of glass: conventional glass (CG) via fast quenching and uniform glass (UG) via density homogenization. First, we bring either glass into contact with a crystal (X) and find the inherent structure (CGX/UGX). During energy minimization, the crystal front grows deep into the CG interface, while the growth is minimal for UG. When thermal noise is added, this behavior is reflected in different crystallization dynamics. CGX exhibits a density drop at the crystal growth front, which correlates with enhanced dynamics at the interface and a fast growth mode. This mechanism may explain the faster crystal growth observed below the glass transition experimentally. In contrast, UGX grows via intermittent avalanche-like dynamics localized at the interface, a combination of localized mechanical defects and the exceptional mechanical stability imposed by the UG glass phase.},

  abstract = {Experiments investigating the properties of deeply supercooled liquid water are needed to develop a comprehensive understanding of water’s anomalous properties. One approach involves transiently heating nanoscale water films into the supercooled region for several nanoseconds at a time and then interrogating the water films after they have quenched to cryogenic temperatures. To relate the results obtained with this approach to other experiments and simulations on supercooled water, it is important to understand how closely the quenched structure tracks the (metastable) equilibrium structure of water as a function of the transient heating temperature. A key step involves quantifying the extent to which water that is transiently heated to ambient temperatures [hyperquenched water (HQW)] subsequently relaxes toward the structure of low-density amorphous (LDA) ice as it cools. We analyzed the infrared reflection–absorption spectra of LDA, HQW, and crystalline ice films to determine their complex indices of refraction. With this information, we estimate that HQW retains ∼50\%–60\% of a structural motif characteristic of water at high temperatures with the balance comprised of a low-temperature motif. This result, along with results from x-ray diffraction experiments on water and amorphous ices, allows one to quantify the fraction of the high-temperature motif at approximately zero pressure as a function of temperature from 150 to 350 K.},

In isotropic and homogeneous solutions, the time-correlation function of a solute is expected to vanish over time due to the translational and diffusive motions of the solvent. The three-pulse photon echo peak shift (3PEPS) is a third-order nonlinear spectroscopy technique that records the time-correlation function of a solute molecule in a solution, including an offset (inhomogeneity). In this work, we utilized a diffractive optics-based 3PEPS apparatus to fully resolve the dynamics in liquids from femtoseconds to nanoseconds while varying the temperature in the range of 80–298 K and the probe solute molecules. Our observations reveal dynamics slower than the dielectric relaxation of n -alcohols, even at room temperature, consisting of a ∼0.5 ns time constant that persists below the melting points and a static component (offset) on a nanosecond timescale. Based on the experiments, we suggest that locally formed glass-like clusters in liquids can be responsible for the slow dynamics. Our results may provide new insights into the dynamics of liquids and related phenomena such as liquid-glass and liquid-liquid phase transitions.},

  abstract = {Boron phosphide (BP) is a (super)hard semiconductor constituted of light elements, which is promising for high demand applications at extreme conditions. The behavior of BP at high temperatures and pressures is of special interest but is also poorly understood because both experimental and conventional ab initio methods are restricted to studying refractory covalent materials. The use of machine learning interatomic potentials is a revolutionary trend that gives a unique opportunity for high-temperature study of materials with ab initio accuracy. We develop a deep machine learning potential (DP) for accurate atomistic simulations of the solid and liquid phases of BP as well as their transformations near the melting line. Our DP provides quantitative agreement with experimental and ab initio molecular dynamics data for structural and dynamic properties. DP-based simulations reveal that at ambient pressure, a tetrahedrally bonded cubic BP crystal melts into an open structure consisting of two interpenetrating sub-networks of boron and phosphorous with different structures. Structure transformations of BP melt under compressing are reflected by the evolution of low-pressure tetrahedral coordination to high-pressure octahedral coordination. The main contributions to structural changes at low pressures are made by the evolution of medium-range order in the B-subnetwork and, at high pressures, by the change of short-range order in the P-subnetwork. Such transformations exhibit an anomalous behavior of structural characteristics in the range of 12–15 GPa. DP-based simulations reveal that the T m ( P ) curve develops a maximum at P ≈ 13 GPa, whereas experimental studies provide two separate branches of the melting curve, which demonstrate the opposite behavior. Analysis of the results obtained raises open issues in developing machine learning potentials for covalent materials and stimulates further experimental and theoretical studies of melting behavior in BP.},

  abstract = {The description of kinetics of physical aging, namely the slow evolution of a glass thermodynamic state toward equilibrium, generally relies on the exclusive role of the main α relaxation. Here, we study the kinetics of physical aging over a wide temperature range in five small molecules interacting via van der Waals forces monitoring the time evolution of the glass enthalpic state. To this aim, we employ fast scanning calorimetry, which permits exploring a wide range of aging times. To challenge the role of the α relaxation in the description of physical aging, we employ a model-independent approach, based on the time to reach equilibrium, and a modified version of the single parameter aging model. The latter accounts for the non-linearity of aging making use of the so-called density scaling approach to describe the dependence of the α relaxation time on the glass thermodynamic state. We show that the α relaxation is generally adequate to describe aging at temperatures close to the glass transition and, for lower temperatures, the latest stages of equilibration. In contrast, at low aging temperatures, it fails to catch a wide portion of the time-dependent evolution of the glass thermodynamic state, which is found to be much faster than predicted considering only the α relaxation. Hence, our results and analysis provide compelling arguments that the description of glass equilibration under a wide range of aging conditions is conveyed by different molecular mechanisms, beyond the mere role of the α relaxation.},

For this nonequilibrium phenomenon, we identify the symmetry of the underlying ground state as undulating smectic A -like layering and the applied concentration gradient applied in the layer planes as the nonequilibrium driving force. As a result of our analysis, we find a coherent motion of undulating layers generated by a Helfrich–Hurault type instability propagating at a fixed velocity in accordance with the observations.

We put the solid hydrate phase in contact with a guest aqueous solution in equilibrium with the pure guest phase and study the growth of both hydrates at 400 bars with temperature. We compare our results with previous calculations of the ice growth rate. We find a growth rate maximum as a function of the supercooling in all cases. The incorporation of guest molecules into the solid structure strongly decelerates hydrate growth. Consistently, ice grows faster than either hydrate and the CO 2 hydrate grows faster than the CH 4 one because of the higher solubility of CO 2 . We also quantify the molecular motion required to build the solids under study and find that the distance traveled by liquid molecules exceeds by orders of magnitude that advanced by any solid. Less molecular motion is needed in order for ice to grow as compared to the hydrates. Moreover, when temperature increases, more motion is needed for solid growth. Finally, we find a good agreement between our growth rate calculations and experiments of hydrate growth along the guest–solution interface. However, more work is needed to reconcile experiments of hydrate growth toward the solution among each other and with simulations.},

We demonstrate that simultaneous injection of charge currents in the opposite ends of the device with the nonlocal setup induces the switching behavior of spin polarization in a controllable manner. Such a nonlocal spin polarization appears regardless of the difference in the materials and device dimensions, implying that the current injection in the nonlocal configuration splits spin-dependent chemical potentials throughout the chiral crystal even though the current is injected into only a part of the crystal. We show that the proposed model of the spin dependent chemical potentials explains the experimental data successfully. The nonlocal double-injection device may offer significant potential to control the spin polarization to large areas because of the nature of long-range nonlocal spin polarization in chiral materials.},

The results were interpreted using an analytical model for the composition-dependent structure in which the zinc ions do not act as network formers. Four-coordinated aluminum atoms were found to be in the majority for all the investigated glasses, with five-coordinated aluminum atoms as the main minority species. Mean Al–O bond distances of 1.764(5) and 1.855(5) Å were obtained for the four- and five-coordinated aluminum atoms, respectively. The coordination environment of zinc was not observed to be invariant. Instead, it is dependent on whether zinc plays a predominantly network-modifying or charge-compensating role and, therefore, varies systematically with the glass composition. The Zn–O coordination number and bond distance were found to be 4.36(9) and 2.00(1) Å, respectively, for the network-modifying role vs 5.96(10) and 2.08(1) Å, respectively, for the charge-compensating role. The more open coordination environment of the charge-compensator is related to an enhanced probability of zinc finding bridging oxygen atoms as nearest-neighbors, reflecting a change in the connectivity of the glass network comprising four-coordinated silicon and aluminum atoms as the alumina content is increased.},

We also provide analytical expressions for the response functions in the short time limit using the two-body approximation, which shows that double quantum spectroscopy for atomic vapors directly probes the transition amplitude of the electronic excitation between two atoms. We also propose an expression for the double quantum spectrum that includes the effect of Doppler broadening, and we discuss the effect of density on the spectrum. We show that when Doppler broadening is negligible compared to self-broadening, the double quantum spectrum scales with the atomic density, while when Doppler broadening dominates, it scales as the square of the density.},

Prompt dissociation through the conical intersection between the A ̃ 1 A ′ first excited state and the ground state located in the exit channel is, indeed, revealed as a minor channel.

First, a Bayesian approach is developed to include not only measurements but also additional information related to how the experiment is performed. To cope with the resulting computationally demanding likelihood, we use the Morris screening method to find the reactions that influence the solution to the stochastic inverse problem from a mechanism comprising 21 different reactions for an air mixture with seven species: O 2 , N 2 , NO, NO + , O, N, e − . A set of six reactions, mainly involving nitrogen dissociation and exchange, are the ones identified to impact the solution the most. As such, they are assumed to be uncertain and estimated along with the boundary conditions of the experiment and the catalytic recombination parameters of the materials involved in the testing. The remaining 15 reactions are set to their nominal values. The posterior distribution is then propagated through the proposed boundary layer model to produce the posterior predictive distributions of the temperature and mass fraction profiles along the boundary layer stagnation line. It is identified that NO concentrations have the largest increase in uncertainty levels compared to cases where the inference problem is carried out for fixed chemical model parameter values. This allows us to inform a new experimental campaign targeting the reduction of uncertainties affecting the chemical models.},

Memory effects and anomalous diffusion have been reported in a number of studies, but directly inferring such effects from trajectories, especially given limited temporal and/or spatial resolution, has been a challenge. Recently, we proposed that this can be achieved with information-theoretical analysis of trajectories, which is based on the general observation that non-Markov effects make trajectories more predictable and, thus, more “compressible” by lossless compression algorithms. Toy models where discrete molecular states evolve in time were shown to be amenable to such analysis, but its application to continuous trajectories presents a challenge: the trajectories need to be digitized first, and digitization itself introduces non-Markov effects that depend on the specifics of how trajectories are sampled. Here we develop a milestoning-based method for information-theoretical analysis of continuous trajectories and show its utility in application to Markov and non-Markov models and to trajectories obtained from molecular simulations.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation produces three-dimensional data on molecular structures. The classification of molecular structure is an important task. Conventionally, various order parameters are used to classify different structures of liquid and crystal. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been proposed based on order parameters to find optimal choices or use them as input features of neural networks. Conventional ML methods still require manual operation, such as calculating the conventional order parameters and manipulating data to impose rotational/translational invariance. Conversely, deep learning models that satisfy invariance are useful because they can automatically learn and classify three-dimensional structural features. However, in addition to the difficulty of making the learned features explainable, deep learning models require information on large structures for highly accurate classification, making it difficult to use the obtained parameters for structural analysis. In this work, we apply two types of graph neural network models, the graph convolutional network (GCN) and the tensor embedded atom network (TeaNet), to classify the structures of Lennard-Jones (LJ) systems and water systems. Both models satisfy invariance, while GCN uses only length information between nodes. TeaNet uses length and orientation information between nodes and edges, allowing it to recognize molecular geometry efficiently. TeaNet achieved a highly accurate classification with an extremely small molecular structure, i.e., when the number of input molecules is 17 for the LJ system and 9 for the water system, the accuracy is 98.9\% and 99.8\%, respectively. This is an advantage of our method over conventional order parameters and ML methods such as GCN, which require a large molecular structure or the information of wider area neighbors. Furthermore, we verified that TeaNet could build novel order parameters without manual operation. Because TeaNet can recognize extremely small local structures with high accuracy, all structures can be mapped to a low-dimensional parameter space that can explain structural features. TeaNet offers an alternative to conventional order parameters because of its novelty.},

Core-specialized basis sets are designed with specific features to accurately represent the behavior of the core region. This design typically incorporates Gaussian primitives with higher exponents to capture core behavior effectively, as well as some decontraction of basis functions to provide flexibility in describing the core electronic wave function. The highest Gaussian exponent and the degree of contraction for both s - and p -basis functions effectively characterize these design aspects. In this study, we compare the design and performance of general-purpose basis sets against several literature-based basis sets specifically designed for three core-dependent properties: J coupling constants, hyperfine coupling constants, and magnetic shielding constants (used for calculating chemical shifts). Our findings consistently demonstrate a significant reduction in error when employing core-specialized basis sets, often at a marginal increase in computational cost compared to the popular 6-31G** basis set. Notably, for expedient calculations of J coupling, hyperfine coupling, and magnetic shielding constants, we recommend the use of the pcJ-1, EPR-II, and pcSseg-1 basis sets, respectively. For higher accuracy, the pcJ-2, EPR-III, and pcSseg-2 basis sets are recommended.},

Therefore, formation of the exciplex can hinder the generation of a radical anion OPP ·− necessary for subsequent CO 2 reduction. We report an implementation of a workflow automating quantum-chemistry calculations that generate and characterize an ensemble of structures to represent this exciplex state. We use FireWorks, Pymatgen, and Custodian Python packages for high-throughput ensemble generation. The workflow includes time-dependent density functional theory optimization, verification of excited-state minima, and exciplex characterization with natural transition orbitals, exciton analysis, excited-state Mulliken charges, and energy decomposition analysis. Fluorescence spectra computed for these ensembles using Boltzmann-weighted contributions of each structure agree better with experiment than our previous calculations based on a single representative exciplex structure [Kron et al. , J.

  abstract = {Biological systems are homochiral, raising the question of how a racemic mixture of prebiotically synthesized biomolecules could attain a homochiral state at the network level. Based on our recent results, we aim to address a related question of how chiral information might have flowed in a prebiotic network. Utilizing the crystallization properties of the central ribonucleic acid (RNA) precursor known as ribose-aminooxazoline (RAO), we showed that its homochiral crystals can be obtained from its fully racemic solution on a magnetic mineral surface due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect [Ozturk et al. , arXiv:2303.01394 (2023)]. Moreover, we uncovered a mechanism facilitated by the CISS effect through which chiral molecules, such as RAO, can uniformly magnetize such surfaces in a variety of planetary environments in a persistent manner [Ozturk et al. , arXiv:2304.09095 (2023)]. All this is very tantalizing because recent experiments with tRNA analogs demonstrate high stereoselectivity in the attachment of L-amino acids to D-ribonucleotides, enabling the transfer of homochirality from RNA to peptides [Wu et al. , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 143 , 11836 (2021)]. Therefore, the biological homochirality problem may be reduced to ensuring that a single common RNA precursor (e.g., RAO) can be made homochiral. The emergence of homochirality at RAO then allows for the chiral information to propagate through RNA, then to peptides, and ultimately through enantioselective catalysis to metabolites. This directionality of the chiral information flow parallels that of the central dogma of molecular biology—the unidirectional transfer of genetic information from nucleic acids to proteins [F. H. Crick, in Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology, Number XII: The Biological Replication of Macromolecules, edited by F. K.

First, we demonstrate the emergence of directed rotational motion from shape changes, which is independent of angular momentum. Then, we computationally design knotted polyalanine molecules and demonstrate the organization of individual atom thermal vibrations into collective rotational motion, which is independent of angular momentum. The motion occurs effortlessly even in ambient water and can be further enhanced through spontaneous symmetry breaking, rendering the molecule an effective theory time crystal. Our findings can be experimentally verified via nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and hold practical potential for molecular motor design and engineering.},

  abstract = {Local diffusivity of a protein depends crucially on the conformation, and the conformational fluctuations are often non-Markovian. Here, we investigate the Langevin equation with non-Markovian fluctuating diffusivity, where the fluctuating diffusivity is modeled by a generalized Langevin equation under a double-well potential. We find that non-Markovian fluctuating diffusivity affects the global diffusivity, i.e., the diffusion coefficient obtained by the long-time trajectories when the memory kernel in the generalized Langevin equation is a power-law form. On the other hand, the diffusion coefficient does not change when the memory kernel is exponential. More precisely, the global diffusivity obtained by a trajectory whose length is longer than the longest relaxation time in the memory kernel is not affected by the non-Markovian fluctuating diffusivity. We show that these non-Markovian effects are the consequences of an everlasting effect of the initial condition on the stationary distribution in the generalized Langevin equation under a double-well potential due to long-term memory.},

The measurements of the thermodynamic stability, ΔG, of G-quadruplexes shed light on the molecular forces involved in the stabilization of these structures. In thermodynamic studies, the differential heat capacity, ΔC P , of the folded and unfolded states of a G-quadruplex is a fundamental property that describes the temperature dependences of the differential enthalpy, ΔH, entropy, ΔS, and free energy, ΔG. Despite its recognized importance, the ΔC P of G-quadruplex unfolding has not been measured directly. Here, we use differential scanning calorimetry to evaluate changes in heat capacity, ΔC P , accompanying the unfolding transitions of G-quadruplexes formed by modified DNA sequences from the promoter regions of the c-MYC, VEGF, and Bcl-2 oncogenes. The average value of ΔC P is 0.49 ± 0.12 kcal mol −1 K −1 . Our analysis revealed that disregarding ΔC P leads to significant errors in extrapolated values of the differential enthalpy, ΔH, and entropy, ΔS, of the folded and unfolded DNA conformations. Although the compensation between ΔH and ΔS weakens the effect of ΔC P on the differential free energy, ΔG, neglecting ΔC P may still result in relative errors in ΔG extrapolated to room temperature as great as 140\%. We emphasize the importance of proper consideration of the effect of ΔC P in conformational studies of guanine-rich DNA molecules.},

  abstract = {Optical phonons serve as the fast and efficient carriers of energy across periodic polymers due to their delocalization, large group velocity because of covalent bonding, and large energy quantum compared to that for acoustic phonons as it was observed in a number of recent measurements in different oligomers. However, this transport is dramatically sensitive to anharmonic interactions, including the unavoidable interaction with acoustic phonons responsible for transport decoherence, suppressing ballistic transport at long distances. Here, we show that this decoherence is substantially suppressed if the group velocity of optical phonons is less than the sound velocity of acoustic phonons; otherwise, ballistic transport is substantially suppressed by a Cherenkov-like emission of acoustic phonons. This conclusion is justified considering energy and momentum conservation during phonon absorption or emission and supported by the numerical evaluation of the lifetimes of the optical phonons. It is also consistent with the recent experimental investigations of ballistic optical phonon transport in oligomers with the minor exception of relatively short oligophenylenes.},

  abstract = {For industrial applications of self-assembled wormlike micelles, measurement and characterization of a micellar material’s microstructure and rheology are paramount for the development and deployment of new high-performing and cost-effective formulations. Within this workflow, there are significant bottlenecks associated with experimental delays and a lack of transferability of results from one chemistry to another. In this work, we outline a process to predict microscopic and thermodynamic characteristics of wormlike micelles directly from rheological data by combining a more robust and efficient fitting algorithm with a recently published constitutive model called the Toy Shuffling model [J. D. Peterson and M. E. Cates, J. Rheol. 64 , 1465–1496 (2020) and J. D. Peterson and M. E. Cates, J. Rheol. 65 , 633–662 (2021)]. To support this work, linear rheology measurements were taken for 143 samples comprising a common base formulation of commercial sodium lauryl ether sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, and salt (NaCl). The steady state zero shear viscosity evident in linear rheology was measured in duplicate via direct steady and oscillatory shear experiments. Fitting the collected data to the model, we found trends in the microstructural and thermodynamic characteristics that agree with molecular dynamics simulations. These trends validate our new perspective on the parameters that inform the study of the relationship between chemical formulation and rheology. This work, when implemented at scale, can potentially be used to inform and test strategies for predicting self-assembled micellar structures based on chemical formulation.},

First, we utilize hydrodynamic bead-shell calculations to compute the microscopic diffusion coefficients for different particle aspect ratios. These values are then used to obtain continuous empirical formulas for said coefficients. As an application example for the empirical formulas, we perform Brownian dynamics simulations of monolayers consisting of a linear trimer surrounded by colloidal spheres. Here, we obtain empirical formulas for the corresponding long-time diffusion coefficients of the trimer. By comparing our data for the microscopic and long-time diffusion coefficients with known results for spherocylinders, we find that the diffusive behavior of both particle geometries is approximately identical. Based on this observation, we introduce simplified equations for the microscopic diffusion coefficients that can be used for arbitrary short rods that are spheres at the minimum aspect ratios. The calculated equations for the diffusion coefficients can be applied to various further numerical and experimental studies utilizing linear trimer particles.},

The partial occupation in the 4f orbitals creates a fundamental challenge for commonly used density functional theory (DFT) methods, including semilocal functionals with Hubbard U correction to force localization and hybrid functionals. In this work, we benchmark the random phase approximation (RPA) for ceria surface properties, including surface energy and hydrogenation energy, compared to the results utilizing the DFT + U approach or hybrid functionals. We show that, for the latter approaches, different surface properties require opposite directions of parameter tuning. This forms a dilemma for the parameter based DFT methods, as the improvement of a certain property by tuning parameters will inevitably lead to the worsening of other properties. Our results suggest that the parameter-free many-body perturbation theory methods exemplified by RPA are a promising strategy to escape the dilemma and provide highly accurate descriptions, which will allow us to better understand the catalytic reactions in ceria related systems.},

Recent experiments have demonstrated that electron transmission through chiral molecules depends on the electron spin orientation, a phenomenon known as chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this study, we show that CISS can be observed in achiral systems driven by an external circularly polarized laser field in the framework of Floquet engineering. By using the Floquet theory for a time-periodically driven system to investigate spin-dependent electron transport in a two-terminal setup, we demonstrate that the spin polarization can approach unity if the light intensity is sufficiently strong, the rate of dephasing is sufficiently low, and the average chemical potential of the two leads is within an appropriate range of values, which is narrow because of the high frequency of the laser field. To obtain a broader range of energies for large spin polarization, a combination of chiral molecules and light–matter interactions is considered, and the spin polarization of electrons transported through a helical molecule driven by a laser field is evaluated.},

However, this bound does not apply to sorption-driven membrane processes such as CO 2 /N 2 separation, which lacks a theoretical explanation. As a result, we are uncertain about the factors that control the limiting behavior of sorption-driven separations. To address this issue, we employed a simple lattice model and dynamic mean field theory to examine the transport properties of disordered model structures, isolating sorption effects from purely kinetic effects. Our findings indicate that transport effects play a crucial role in sorption-driven processes, and perm-selectivity is consistently lower than sorption selectivity, which is an unattainable limit. We used basic geometric fragments of the structure to explain how transport effects emerge and manifest themselves in sorption-driven processes.},

At select incident angles for the three systems, angular distributions show super-specular scattering for the impulsive scattering channel, an effect attributed to anisotropic momentum transfer to the liquid surface.

Among the various factors that can influence the photoemission of the upconverted hot electrons, we studied the role of PEDOT:PSS in facilitating the hole transfer from QDs and altering the energy of photoemitted hot electrons. Compared to hot electrons emitted from QDs deposited directly on the ITO substrate, the addition of the PEDOT:PSS layer between the QD and ITO layers increased the energy of the photoemitted hot electrons. The increased energy of the photoemitted hot electrons is attributed in part to the reduced steady-state positive charge on the QDs under continuous photoexcitation, which reduces the energy required to eject the electron from the conduction band.},

  abstract = {Single molecule junctions based on selected 4,4′-biphenyldithiol and 4,4′-dicyanobiphenyl derivatives bonded to gold electrodes are analyzed from a dynamical point of view. A fully quantum mechanical description of the internal rotation of the biphenyl moiety is carried out in terms of the nuclear wavepacket dynamics obtained by the solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation expressed in terms of the torsion angle between the phenyl rings. The required potential energy surfaces are computed using ab initio electronic structure methods. The nature and positions of the substituents on the phenyl rings determine the features of the potential energy surfaces. The effect of the initial conditions on the time propagation of the nuclear wavepackets and, as a consequence, on the evolution of the conformational distribution is also analyzed. In addition, the conductances at zero bias for the nanojunctions were computed for different conformations of the biphenyl fragments. Weighted by the wavepacket amplitudes, non-stationary conductance expectation values, and time-averaged torsion angles and conductances for the entire simulation are obtained. The consequences of using the time-averaged values to perform a linear regression between the conductance and the square of the cosine of the dihedral angle between the phenyl rings are analyzed and compared to the usual static approach based only on the information for equilibrium geometries. The study of the time dependent conformational variations of the biphenyl moieties in the nanojunctions allows for a better understanding of the quantum chemical phenomena that affect their transport properties.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in photocatalysis include the development of floating catalysts since they assure efficient and rapid recollection of the catalysts from the purified liquid, besides enhancing the availability of photons at the catalytic surface. Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO 3 and BFO) is a multifunctional perovskite material renowned for its excellent photocatalytic properties. Since bandgap of BFO falls in the visible spectrum, BFO nanoparticles could be combined with a suitable floating substrate to develop efficient visible light photocatalysts. Here, we report the synthesis of BFO–polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) hybrids for photocatalytic applications, where sol-gel–synthesized BFO nanoparticles are immobilized on a floating porous PDMS sponge. The successful incorporation of the nanoparticles on PDMS is confirmed using Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the floating catalysts was studied by monitoring the degradation of malachite green dye under visible light irradiation. The effect of the amount of BFO immobilized, and the area and thickness of the PDMS sponge on the photocatalytic activity of the floating catalysts were investigated. An efficiency of 80.5\% was obtained when the weight of BFO immobilized on the PDMS sponge was 5 mg. The method yields degradation efficiencies comparable with or higher than that of conventional BFO powder catalysts, even with 6–18 times less catalyst loading. The method introduces the fabrication of recyclable floating photocatalysts of notable efficiency using significantly less amount of BFO nanoparticles, which could be further modified by approaches such as doping, functionalization, or composite formation.},

At all these temperatures, simulating liquid water with electric fields of 0.1 and 0.4 V/nm has no additional effect on its structural and dynamical changes, which otherwise already take place due to cooling. However, the introduction of 1.0 V/nm field enhances the slowing down of liquid water dynamics, crystallizes it to cubic ice at 240 and 220 K, and amorphizes it at 200 K. At 240 and 220 K, crystallization occurs within 5 and 50 ns, respectively. An electric field of 1 V/nm increases the relaxation times in addition to what cooling does. We note that when liquid water’s metastability limit is reached, crystallization is averted and amorphization takes place. Both equilibrium (liquid–solid) and non-equilibrium (liquid–amorphous) transformations are observed at 1 V/nm. Moreover, with an increase in the electric field, H-bonds become stronger. However, the donor–acceptor asymmetry (the difference between the strengths of two donor/acceptor bonds) remains even when crystallization or amorphization takes place. At low temperatures, increasing electric fields on liquid water increases both its crystallization and amorphization tendencies.},

In this work, we extend the two-phase thermodynamic model (2PT) to shape anisotropic soft repulsive spherocylinders (SRSs) and report the absolute values of entropy for different LC phases for a range of aspect ratios L / D = 2 − 5. We calculate the density of states for different LC phases and decompose it into contributions arising from translational and rotational degrees of freedom. The translational and rotational modes are further partitioned into diffusive, gas-like, and non-diffusive, solid-like components using a fluidicity factor. In the dilute limit, the entropy values obtained from the 2PT method match exactly those of an ideal rigid rotor. We find that, for a given packing fraction, the magnitude of the total entropy is roughly equal regardless of the different LC phases associated with different aspect ratios. We also compute the excess entropy (for L / D = 5) and compare those with the values obtained using the standard integration approach of MD or Monte Carlo equation of state of SRS. The values obtained using both approaches match very well. The rotational and translational fluidicity factors are further used to determine the phase boundaries of different LC phases.},

  abstract = {The possible existence of a liquid–liquid critical point in deeply supercooled water has been a subject of debate due to the challenges associated with providing definitive experimental evidence. The pioneering work by Mishima and Stanley [Nature 392 , 164–168 (1998)] sought to shed light on this problem by studying the melting curves of different ice polymorphs and their metastable continuation in the vicinity of the expected liquid–liquid transition and its associated critical point. Based on the continuous or discontinuous changes in the slope of the melting curves, Mishima [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 , 334 (2000)] suggested that the liquid–liquid critical point lies between the melting curves of ice III and ice V. We explore this conjecture using molecular dynamics simulations with a machine learning model based on ab initio quantum-mechanical calculations. We study the melting curves of ices III, IV, V, VI, and XIII and find that all of them are supercritical and do not intersect the liquid–liquid transition locus. We also find a pronounced, yet continuous, change in the slope of the melting lines upon crossing of the liquid locus of maximum compressibility. Finally, we analyze the literature in light of our findings and conclude that the scenario in which the melting curves are supercritical is favored by the most recent computational and experimental evidence. Although the preponderance of evidence is consistent with the existence of a second critical point in water, the behavior of ice polymorph melting lines does not provide strong evidence in support of this viewpoint, according to our calculations.},

  abstract = {We investigate the reorientation dynamics of four octanol isomers with very different characteristics regarding the formation of hydrogen-bonded structures by means of photon-correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and broadband dielectric spectroscopy. PCS is largely insensitive to orientational cross-correlations and straightforwardly probes the α -process dynamics, thus allowing us to disentangle the complex dielectric relaxation spectra. The analysis reveals an additional dielectric relaxation contribution on time scales between the structural α -process and the Debye process. In line with nuclear magnetic resonance results from the literature and recent findings from rheology experiments, we attribute this intermediate contribution to the dielectric signature of the O–H bond reorientation. Due to being incorporated into hydrogen-bonded suprastructures, the O–H bond dynamically decouples from the rest of the molecule. The relative relaxation strength of the resulting intermediate contribution depends on the respective position of the hydroxy group within the molecule and seems to vanish at sufficiently high temperatures, i.e., exactly when the overall tendency to form hydrogen bonded structures decreases. Furthermore, the fact that different octanol isomers share the same dipole density allows us to perform an in-depth analysis of how dipolar cross-correlations appear in dielectric loss spectra. We find that dipolar cross-correlations are not solely manifested by the presence of the slow Debye process but also scale the relaxation strength of the self-correlation contribution depending on the Kirkwood factor.},

This relaxation is only possible if the inner valence’s ionization potential (IP) exceeds the system’s double ionization potential (DIP). To study the effects of charge and solvation shell, we have calculated the IP, DIP values, and lifetime of Na-2s and Mg-2s temporary bound states in various optimized structures of Na + -(H 2 O) n and Mg 2+ -(H 2 O) n ( n = 1–5) micro-solvated clusters, where n water molecules are distributed in a way that some are directly bound to the metal ion and the rest to the water molecules. The first and second solvation shells are the names for the former and the latter water-binding positions, respectively. For a given n , the lifetime of decaying states is longer when water molecules are in the second solvation shell. We found that the Mg-2p state can decay for all n values in Mg 2+ -(H 2 O) n clusters, whereas the Na-2p state’s decay is possible for n ≥ 2 in Na + -(H 2 O) n clusters. Our findings highlight the influence of metal ions’ charge, different solvation shell structures, and the number of water molecules on the decay rate. These systems are relevant to the human body, which makes this study significant.},

  abstract = {Planar hexacoordination (ph) is only rarely reported in the literature. So far, only a few neutral and cationic molecules possessing phE (E = C, Si, B, Al, Ga) in the most stable isomer are predicted theoretically. Present electronic structure calculations report hitherto unknown anionic planar hexcoordinate beryllium and magnesium, phBe/Mg, as the most stable isomer. Global minimum searches show that the lowest energy structure of BeC 6 M 3 − (M = Al, Ga) and MgC 6 M 3 − (M = Ga, In, Tl) is the D 3 h symmetric phBe/Mg clusters, where beryllium/magnesium is covalently bonded with six carbon centers and M is located in a bridging position between two carbon centers. These global minimum phBe/Mg clusters are highly kinetically stable against isomerization, facilitating the experimental confirmation by photoelectron spectroscopy. Noteworthy is the fact that the phBe/Mg center is linked with carbon centers through three 7c–2e delocalized σ bonds and three 7c–2e π bonds, making the cluster double aromatic (σ + π) in nature. The bonding between the Be/Mg and outer ring moiety can be best expressed as an electron-sharing σ-bond between the s orbital of Be + /Mg + and C 6 M 3 2− followed by three dative interactions involving empty p π and two in-plane p orbitals of Be/Mg. Furthermore, Lewis basic M centers of the title clusters can be passivated through the complexation with bulky Lewis acid, 9-boratriptycene, lowering the overall reactivity of the cluster, which can eventually open up the possibility of their large-scale syntheses.},

We use the sum-over-state approach and modified rotating wave approximation to describe interactions of the static and optical fields with the permanent and transition dipoles of the excited states. The SF spectral profiles are calculated using the standard and modified Redfield theories for the emission lineshapes. The resulting expression allows an interpretation of the SF response based on the calculation of only one-exciton states (i.e., the calculation of two-exciton states is not needed). The shape and amplitude of the SF spectrum can exhibit dramatic changes in the presence of the CT states, especially when the CT state is mixed with the red-most emitting exciton levels. In this case, the SF responses are much more sensitive to the exciton-CT mixing as compared with the usual Stark absorption. The limitation of the proposed theory is related to the simplified nature of the Redfield picture, which neglects the dynamic localization within the mixed exciton-CT configuration.},

  abstract = {“Gating” is a widely observed phenomenon in biochemistry that describes the transition between the activated (or open) and deactivated (or closed) states of an ion-channel, which makes transport through that channel highly selective. In general, gating is a mechanism that imposes an additional restriction on a transport, as the process ends only when the “gate” is open and continues otherwise. When diffusion occurs in the presence of a constant bias to a gated target, i.e., to a target that switches between an open and a closed state, the dynamics essentially slow down compared to ungated drift-diffusion, resulting in an increase in the mean completion time, ⟨ T G ⟩ &gt; ⟨ T ⟩, where T denotes the random time of transport and G indicates gating. In this work, we utilize stochastic resetting as an external protocol to counterbalance the delay due to gating. We consider a particle in the positive semi-infinite space that undergoes drift-diffusion in the presence of a stochastically gated target at the origin and is moreover subjected to rate-limiting resetting dynamics. Calculating the minimal mean completion time ⟨ T r ⋆ G ⟩ rendered by an optimal resetting rate r ⋆ for this exactly solvable system, we construct a phase diagram that owns three distinct phases: (i) where resetting can make gated drift-diffusion faster even compared to the original ungated process, ⟨ T r ⋆ G ⟩ &lt; ⟨ T ⟩ &lt; ⟨ T G ⟩ ⁠ , (ii) where resetting still expedites gated drift-diffusion but not beyond the original ungated process, ⟨ T ⟩ ≤ ⟨ T r ⋆ G ⟩ &lt; ⟨ T G ⟩ ⁠ , and (iii) where resetting fails to expedite gated drift-diffusion, ⟨ T ⟩ &lt; ⟨ T G ⟩ ≤ ⟨ T r ⋆ G ⟩ ⁠ . We also highlight various non-trivial behaviors of the completion time as the resetting rate, gating parameters, and geometry of the set-up are carefully ramified. Gated drift-diffusion aptly models various stochastic processes such as chemical reactions that exclusively take place in certain activated states of the reactants. Our work predicts the conditions under which stochastic resetting can act as a useful strategy to enhance the rate of such processes without compromising their selectivity.},

  abstract = {Single-molecule and related experiments yield time series of an observable as it fluctuates due to thermal motion. In such data, it can be difficult to distinguish fluctuating signal from fluctuating noise. We present a method of separating signal from noise using nonlinear-correlation functions. The method is fully nonparametric: No a priori model for the system is required, no knowledge of whether the system is continuous or discrete is needed, the number of states is not fixed, and the system can be Markovian or not. The noise-corrected, nonlinear-correlation functions can be converted to the system’s Green’s function; the noise-corrected moments yield the system’s equilibrium-probability distribution. As a demonstration, we analyze synthetic data from a three-state system. The correlation method is compared to another fully nonparametric approach—time binning to remove noise, and histogramming to obtain the distribution. The correlation method has substantially better resolution in time and in state space. We develop formulas for the limits on data quality needed for signal recovery from time series and test them on datasets of varying size and signal-to-noise ratio. The formulas show that the signal-to-noise ratio needs to be on the order of or greater than one-half before convergence scales at a practical rate. With experimental benchmark data, the positions and populations of the states and their exchange rates are recovered with an accuracy similar to parametric methods. The methods demonstrated here are essential components in building a complete analysis of time series using only high-order correlation functions.},

In this context, there has been much interest in developing ML-based charge equilibration models, which allow the rigorous calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions and the energetic response of molecules and materials to external fields. The recently reported kQEq method achieves this by predicting local atomic electronegativities using Kernel ML.

  abstract = {The velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) encapsulates extensive information about a fluid’s molecular-structural and hydrodynamic properties. We address the following fundamental question: How well can a purely hydrodynamic description recover the molecular features of a fluid as exhibited by the VACF? To this end, we formulate a bona fide hydrodynamic theory of the tagged-particle VACF for simple fluids. Our approach is distinguished from previous efforts in two key ways: collective hydrodynamic modes and tagged-particle self-motion are modeled by linear hydrodynamic equations; the fluid’s spatial velocity power spectrum is identified as a necessary initial condition for the momentum current correlation. This formulation leads to a natural physical interpretation of the VACF as a superposition of products of quasinormal hydrodynamic modes weighted commensurately with the spatial velocity power spectrum, the latter of which appears to physically bridge continuum hydrodynamical behavior and discrete-particle kinetics. The methodology yields VACF calculations quantitatively on par with existing approaches for liquid noble gases and alkali metals. Furthermore, we obtain a new, hydrodynamic form of the self-intermediate scattering function whose description has been extended to low densities where the Schmidt number is of order unity; various calculations are performed for gaseous and supercritical argon to support the general validity of the theory. Excellent quantitative agreement is obtained with recent MD calculations for a dense supercritical Lennard-Jones fluid.},

  abstract = {Free energy simulations that employ combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potentials at ab initio QM (AI) levels are computationally highly demanding. Here, we present a machine-learning-facilitated approach for obtaining AI/MM-quality free energy profiles at the cost of efficient semiempirical QM/MM (SE/MM) methods. Specifically, we use Gaussian process regression (GPR) to learn the potential energy corrections needed for an SE/MM level to match an AI/MM target along the minimum free energy path (MFEP). Force modification using gradients of the GPR potential allows us to improve configurational sampling and update the MFEP. To adaptively train our model, we further employ the sparse variational GP (SVGP) and streaming sparse GPR (SSGPR) methods, which efficiently incorporate previous sample information without significantly increasing the training data size. We applied the QM-(SS)GPR/MM method to the solution-phase S N 2 Menshutkin reaction, N H 3 + C H 3 C l → C H 3 N H 3 + + C l − ⁠ , using AM1/MM and B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/MM as the base and target levels, respectively. For 4000 configurations sampled along the MFEP, the iteratively optimized AM1-SSGPR-4/MM model reduces the energy error in AM1/MM from 18.2 to 4.4 kcal/mol. Although not explicitly fitting forces, our method also reduces the key internal force errors from 25.5 to 11.1 kcal/mol/ A ̊ and from 30.2 to 10.3 kcal/mol/ A ̊ for the N–C and C–Cl bonds, respectively. Compared to the uncorrected simulations, the AM1-SSGPR-4/MM method lowers the predicted free energy barrier from 28.7 to 11.7 kcal/mol and decreases the reaction free energy from −12.4 to −41.9 kcal/mol, bringing these results into closer agreement with their AI/MM and experimental benchmarks.},

In this work, the RKS method is developed and tested alongside Slater atomic orbital basis functions for the first time. To evaluate this approach, full configuration interaction computations in the Slater orbital basis are employed to give quality input to RKS, allowing full correlation to be present along with correct nuclei cusps and asymptotic decay of the wavefunction. SlaterRKS is shown to be an efficient algorithm to arrive at exchange-correlation potentials without unphysical artifacts in moderately-sized basis sets. Furthermore, enforcement of the nuclear cusp conditions will be shown to be vital for the success of the Slater-basis RKS method. Examples of weakly and strongly correlated molecular systems will demonstrate the main features of SlaterRKS.},

  abstract = {Theoretical discussions are given on issues in relativistic molecular orbital theory to which the quantum electrodynamics (QED) Hamiltonian is applied. First, several QED Hamiltonians previously proposed are sifted by the orbital rotation invariance, the charge conjugation and time reversal invariance, and the nonrelativistic limit. The discussion on orbital rotation invariance shows that orbitals giving a stationary point of total energy should be adopted for QED Hamiltonians that are not orbital rotation invariant. A new total energy expression is then proposed, in which a counter term corresponding to the energy of the polarized vacuum is subtracted from the total energy. This expression prevents the possibility of total energy divergence due to electron correlations, stemming from the fact that the QED Hamiltonian does not conserve the number of particles. Finally, based on the Hamiltonian and energy expression, the Dirac–Hartree–Fock (DHF) and electron correlation methods are reintroduced. The QED-based DHF equation is shown to give information on positrons from negative-energy orbitals while having the same form as the conventional DHF equation. Three electron correlation methods are derived: the QED-based configuration interactions and single- and multireference perturbation methods. Numerical calculations show that the total energy of the QED Hamiltonian indeed diverged and that the counter term is effective in avoiding the divergence. The relativistic molecular orbital theory presented in this article also provides a methodology for dealing with systems containing positrons based on the QED Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations address lengthscales and timescales that are critical to many chemical and material applications. Nevertheless, contemporary CGMD modeling is relatively bespoke and there are no black-box CGMD methodologies available that could play a comparable role in discovery applications that density functional theory plays for electronic structure. This gap might be filled by machine learning (ML)-based CGMD potentials that simplify model development, but these methods are still in their early stages and have yet to demonstrate a significant advantage over existing physics-based CGMD methods. Here, we explore the potential of Δ-learning models to leverage the advantages of these two approaches. This is implemented by using ML-based potentials to learn the difference between the target CGMD variable and the predictions of physics-based potentials. The Δ-models are benchmarked against the baseline models in reproducing on-target and off-target atomistic properties as a function of CG resolution, mapping operator, and system topology. The Δ-models outperform the reference ML-only CGMD models in nearly all scenarios. In several cases, the ML-only models manage to minimize training errors while still producing qualitatively incorrect dynamics, which is corrected by the Δ-models. Given their negligible added cost, Δ-models provide essentially free gains over their ML-only counterparts. Nevertheless, an unexpected finding is that neither the Δ-learning models nor the ML-only models significantly outperform the elementary pairwise models in reproducing atomistic properties. This fundamental failure is attributed to the relatively large irreducible force errors associated with coarse-graining that produces little benefit from using more complex potentials.},

  abstract = {Continuum solvation models are becoming increasingly relevant in condensed matter simulations, allowing to characterize materials interfaces in the presence of wet electrified environments at a reduced computational cost with respect to all atomistic simulations. However, some challenges with the implementation of these models in plane-wave simulation packages still persists, especially when the goal is to simulate complex and heterogeneous environments. Among these challenges is the computational cost associated with large heterogeneous environments, which in plane-wave simulations has a direct effect on the basis-set size and, as a result, on the cost of the electronic structure calculation. Moreover, the use of periodic simulation cells is not well-suited for modeling systems embedded in semi-infinite media, which is often the case in continuum solvation models. To address these challenges, we present the implementation of a double-cell formalism, in which the simulation cell used for the continuum environment is uncoupled from the one used for the electronic-structure simulation of the quantum-mechanical system. This allows for a larger simulation cell to be used for the environment, without significantly increasing computational time. In this work, we show how the double-cell formalism can be used as an effective periodic boundary conditions correction scheme for nonperiodic and partially periodic systems. The accuracy of the double-cell formalism is tested using representative examples with different dimensionalities, both in vacuum and in a homogeneous continuum dielectric environment. Fast convergence and good speedups are observed for all the simulation setups, provided the quantum-mechanical simulation cell is chosen to completely fit the electronic density of the system.},

  abstract = {Computational simulation of biomolecules can provide important insights into protein design, protein-ligand binding interactions, and ab initio biomolecular folding, among other applications. Accurate treatment of the solvent environment is essential in such applications, but the use of explicit solvents can add considerable cost. Implicit treatment of solvent effects using a dielectric continuum model is an attractive alternative to explicit solvation since it is able to describe solvation effects without the inclusion of solvent degrees of freedom. Previously, we described the development and parameterization of implicit solvent models for small molecules. Here, we extend the parameterization of the generalized Kirkwood (GK) implicit solvent model for use with biomolecules described by the AMOEBA force field via the addition of corrections to the calculation of effective radii that account for interstitial spaces that arise within biomolecules. These include element-specific pairwise descreening scale factors, a short-range neck contribution to describe the solvent-excluded space between pairs of nearby atoms, and finally tanh-based rescaling of the overall descreening integral. We then apply the AMOEBA/GK implicit solvent to a set of ten proteins and achieve an average coordinate root mean square deviation for the experimental structures of 2.0 Å across 500 ns simulations. Overall, the continued development of implicit solvent models will help facilitate the simulation of biomolecules on mechanistically relevant timescales.},

These results suggest that N → I and I → N PIPTs can be driven by electronic excitation, and the I → N PIPT can also be driven by vibrational excitation. However, the feasibility of the N → I PIPT using vibrational excitation remains an open question. In this study, we address this issue by simulating the PIPT processes using a nonadiabatic molecular dynamics approach combined with real-time electron dynamics at the level of a semiempirical quantum chemical model, density-functional tight binding. The results show the importance of vibronic interactions in the PIPT processes, thereby suggesting the possibility of N → I PIPT by vibrational excitations with infrared irradiation.},

Recent advances in electron monochromators have expanded EELS capabilities from chemical identification to the realms of synchrotron-level core-loss measurements and to low-loss, 10–100 meV excitations, such as phonons, excitons, and valence structures. EELS measurements are easily correlated with electron diffraction and atomic-scale real-space imaging in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to provide detailed local pictures of quasiparticle and bonding states. This perspective provides an overview of existing high-resolution EELS (HR-EELS) capabilities while also motivating the powerful next step in the field—ultrafast EELS in a TEM. Ultrafast EELS aims to combine atomic-level, element-specific, and correlated temporal measurements to better understand spatially specific excited-state phenomena. Ultrafast EELS measurements also add to the abilities of steady-state HR-EELS by being able to image the electromagnetic field and use electrons to excite photon-forbidden and momentum-specific transitions. We discuss the technical challenges ultrafast HR-EELS currently faces, as well as how integration with in situ and cryo measurements could expand the technique to new systems of interest, especially molecular and biological samples.},

Ion channels are the basis of biological electrical signals, so studying the effect of terahertz electromagnetic fields on ion channels is significant. In this paper, the effect of a terahertz electromagnetic field with three different frequencies, 6, 15, and 25 THz, on the Kv1.2 potassium ion channel was investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that an electromagnetic field with a 15 THz frequency can significantly enhance the permeability of the Kv1.2 potassium ion channel, which is 1.7 times higher than without an applied electric field. By analyzing the behavior of water molecules, it is found that the electromagnetic field with the 15 THz frequency shortens the duration of frozen and relaxation processes when potassium ions pass through the channel, increases the proportion of the direct knock-on mode, and, thus, enhances the permeability of the Kv1.2 potassium ion channel.},

  abstract = {Amorphous solids, such as glasses and gels, arise as the asymptotic limit of non-equilibrium and irreversible relaxation aging processes. These amorphous solids form when the system is suddenly and deeply quenched in the dynamic arrest region. We use the non-equilibrium self-consistent generalized Langevin equation (NE-SCGLE) theory to investigate the formation of such structures via arrested spinodal decomposition in the screened symmetric restricted primitive model. We propose a direct correlation function that allows us to derive an expression for the functional derivative of the chemical potential, which serves as the necessary input in the NE-SCGLE theory. By analyzing the asymptotic localization length and the asymptotic characteristic length, we identify different classes of dynamic arrest states as a function of the density and the final quench temperature. The system features simultaneously attractive and repulsive interactions, resulting in different arrested regions in the non-equilibrium phase diagram for a given screened parameter: (i) ionic glasses, (ii) electrostatic gels, and (iii) attractive glasses. Finally, by collapsing the asymptotic effective structure factors at a typical fractal dimension of d f = 3, we confirm the formation of gels slightly above the glass-gel transition in the arrested phase diagram.},

  abstract = {Thixotropic yield-stress fluids (TYSFs) are a unique class of materials whose properties are affected by both shear rate and shear history. When sheared, these materials undergo a transition from an elastic solid to a viscoelastic fluid, which is accompanied by a structural transition that slowly recovers upon the cessation of shear. The strong interdependence between structure, dynamics, and rheological properties in TYSFs make it challenging to identify the fundamental physics controlling these phenomena. In this study, we vary the ionic strength of a suspension of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) to generate model TYSFs with tunable moduli and thixotropic kinetics. We use a novel rheological protocol—serial creep divergence—to identify the physics underlying the yield transition and recovery of CNC gels. Our protocol identifies a critical transition that bifurcates the solid-like and fluid-like regimes of the gels to precisely determine the yield stress of these materials even in the presence of thixotropic effects. Additionally, the thixotropic kinetics collapse onto a single master curve, which we fit to a transient solution to a coupled diffusion–aggregation model. Our work thereby identifies the underlying physicochemical mechanisms driving yielding and thixotropic recovery in attractive colloidal gels.},

  abstract = {Biomolecular condensates can form through the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and RNAs in cells. However, other states of organization, including mesostructured network microstructures and physical gels, have been observed, the physical mechanism of which are not well understood. We use the Polymer Reference Interaction Site Model liquid state integral equation theory to study the equilibrium behavior of (generally aperiodic in sequence) biomolecular condensates based on a minimal sticker–spacer associating polymer model. The role of polymer packing fraction, sequence, and the strength and range of intermolecular interactions on macromolecular scale spatial organization and phase behavior is studied for typical sticker–spacer sequences. In addition to the prediction of conventional LLPS, a sequence-dependent strongly fluctuating polymeric microemulsion homogeneous state is predicted at high enough concentrations beyond the so-called Lifshitz-like point, which we suggest can be relevant to the dense phase of microstructured biomolecular condensates. New connections between local clustering and the formation of mesoscopic microdomains, the influence of attraction range, compressibility, and the role of spatial correlations across scales, are established. Our results are also germane to understanding the polymer physics of dense solutions of nonperiodic and unique sequence synthetic copolymers and provide a foundation to create new theories for how polymer diffusion and viscosity are modified in globally isotropic and homogeneous dense polymeric microemulsions.},

  abstract = {By mostly using Monte Carlo numerical simulation, this work investigates the densest-known packings and phase behavior of hard spherical capsids, i.e., hard infinitesimally thin spherical caps with a subtended angle larger than the straight angle. The infinitely degenerate densest-known packings are all characterized by hard spherical capsids that interlock and can be subdivided into three families. The first family includes crystalline packings that are constructed by suitably rotating and stacking layers of hexagonally arranged and suitably tilted hard spherical capsids; depending on the successive rotations, the crystalline packings of this family can become the face-centered cubic crystal, the hexagonal close-packed crystal, and their infinitely degenerate variants in the hard-sphere limit. The second family includes crystalline packings that are characterized by rhombic motifs; they all become the face-centered cubic crystal in the hard-sphere limit. The third family includes crystalline packings that are constructed by suitably shifting and stacking layers in which hard spherical capsids are arranged in tightly packed, straight or zigzag, columns; depending on the successive shifts, the crystalline packings of this family can become the face-centered cubic crystal, the hexagonal close-packed crystal, and their infinitely degenerate variants in the hard-sphere limit. In the plane number density vs subtended angle, the phase diagram of hard spherical capsids features a hexagonal columnar liquid-crystalline phase, toward the hard-hemispherical-cap limit, and a plastic-crystalline phase, toward the hard-sphere limit, in addition to the isotropic fluid phase and crystalline phases. On departing from the hard-sphere limit, the increasing propensity of hard spherical capsids to interlock progressively disfavors the plastic-crystalline phase while favoring auto-assemblage into mostly dimeric interlocks in the denser isotropic fluid phase so that a purely entropic isotropic- fluid –plastic- crystal –isotropic- fluid re-entrant sequence of phase transitions is observed in systems of hard spherical capsids with a subtended angle intermediate between the straight angle and the complete angle.},

In contrast, 1,4- trans PI homopolymers or random copolymers have seldom been examined, despite a handful of investigations suggesting a distinct dynamic behavior. Herein, we employ all-atom simulations to investigate the effect of chemical architecture on the dynamics of cis and trans -PI homopolymers, as well as copolymers. We examine the thermodynamic, conformational, and structural properties of the polymers and validate the performance of the models. We probe chain dynamics, revealing that cis -PI presents accelerated translation and reorientation modes relative to trans as recorded by the mean square displacement of the chain center-of-mass as well as by the characteristic times of the lower modes in a Rouse analysis. Interestingly, progressing to higher modes, we observe a reversal with trans units exhibiting faster dynamics. This was further confirmed by calculations of local carbon–hydrogen vector reorientation dynamics, which offer a microscopic view of segmental mobility. To obtain insight into the simulation trajectories, we evaluate the intermediate incoherent scattering function that supports a temperature-dependent crossover in relative mobility that extends over separations beyond the Kuhn-length level. Finally, we analyzed the role of non-Gaussian displacements, which demonstrate that cis -PI exhibits increased heterogeneity in dynamics over short-timescales in contrast to trans -PI, where deviations persist over times extending to terminal dynamics. Our all-atom simulations provide a fundamental understanding of PI dynamics and the impact of microstructure while providing important data for the design and optimization of PI-based materials.},

The intramolecular correlation functions required as input for PRISM theory were calculated by the generator matrix method, accompanied by changes in the distribution of dihedral angles. In the infinite dilution limit, the increased probability of gauche conformation of the OCCO dihedral angles stabilizes the hydration of PEG through enhanced hydrogen bonding between the ether oxygen of PEG and water. The mixing Gibbs energies of the liquid mixtures were also calculated in the whole concentration range based on the Gibbs–Duhem equation, as per our recent proposal. A liquid–liquid phase separation was observed when all the dihedral angles of PEG were in the trans conformation; for the liquid mixture to be miscible in the whole concentration range, the introduction of the OCCO gauche conformation was found to be indispensable. The above theoretical results support the conventional idea that the OCCO gauche conformation is important for the high miscibility of PEG and water.},

In order to systematically investigate the structural information and relevant natures of C–S–H superconductors, we performed an extremely extensive structure search and first-principles calculations under high pressures. As a result, the metastable stoichiometries of CSH 7 , C 2 SH 14 , CS 2 H 10 , and CS 2 H 11 were unveiled under high pressure, which can be viewed as CH 4 units inserted into the S–H framework. Given the super-high superconductivity of Im 3 ̄ m -SH 3 , we performed electron–phonon coupling calculations of these compounds,the metastable of R 3 m -CSH 7 , Cm -CSH 7 , Cm -CS 2 H 10 , P 3 m 1-CS 2 H 10 , Cm -CS 2 H 11 , and Fmm 2-CS 2 H 11 are predicted to become good phonon-mediated superconductors that could reach T c of 130, 120, 72, 74, 92, and 70 K at 270 GPa, respectively. Furthermore, we identified that high T c is associated with the large contribution of the S–H framework to the electron density of states near the Fermi level. Our results highlight the importance of the S–H framework in superconductivity and verify that the suppression of density of states of these carbonaceous sulfur hydrides by CH 4 units results in T c lower than that of Im 3 ̄ m -SH 3 , which could act as a useful guidance in the design and optimization of high- T c superconductors in these and related systems.},

Here, we have theoretically investigated a bipartite tetragonal lattice composed of tetragons and octagons using both Tight-Binding (TB) model and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The TB model predicts that the system exhibits nodal line semi-metallic properties when the on-site energies of all atoms are identical. When the on-site energies differ, the formation of an elliptical Dirac cone is predicted. Its physical properties (anisotropy, tilting, merging, and emerging) can be regulated by the hopping energies. An exact analytical formula is derived to determine the position of the Dirac point by the TB parameters, and a criterion for the existence of Dirac cones is obtained. The “divide-and-coupling” method is applied to understand the origin of the Dirac cone, which involves dividing the bands into several groups and examining the couplings among inter-groups and intra-groups. Various practical systems computed by DFT methods, e.g., t -BN, t -Si, 4,12,2-graphyne, and t -SiC, are also examined, and they all possess nodal lines or Dirac cones as predicted by the TB model. The results provide theoretical foundation for designing novel Dirac materials with tetragonal symmetry.},

  abstract = {Machine learning potentials (MLPs) are poised to combine the accuracy of ab initio predictions with the computational efficiency of classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. While great progress has been made over the last two decades in developing MLPs, there is still much to be done to evaluate their model transferability and facilitate their development. In this work, we construct two deep potential (DP) models for liquid water near graphene surfaces, Model S and Model F, with the latter having more training data. A concurrent learning algorithm (DP-GEN) is adopted to explore the configurational space beyond the scope of conventional ab initio MD simulation. By examining the performance of Model S, we find that an accurate prediction of atomic force does not imply an accurate prediction of system energy. The deviation from the relative atomic force alone is insufficient to assess the accuracy of the DP models. Based on the performance of Model F, we propose that the relative magnitude of the model deviation and the corresponding root-mean-square error of the original test dataset, including energy and atomic force, can serve as an indicator for evaluating the accuracy of the model prediction for a given structure, which is particularly applicable for large systems where density functional theory calculations are infeasible. In addition to the prediction accuracy of the model described above, we also briefly discuss simulation stability and its relationship to the former. Both are important aspects in assessing the transferability of the MLP model.},

While first-principles methods can reliably be used to compute such binding energies, the complex structure and varying sizes and stoichiometries of realistic dust grains make a complete characterization of all adsorption sites exposed by their surfaces challenging. Here, we focus on nanoclusters composed of Mg-rich silicates as models of interstellar dust grains and two adsorbates of particular astrochemical relevance; H and CO. We employ a compressed sensing method to identify descriptors for the binding energies, which are expressed as analytical functions of intrinsic properties of the clusters, obtainable through a single first-principles calculation of the cluster. The descriptors are identified based on a diverse training dataset of binding energies at low-energy structures of nanosilicate clusters, where the latter structures were obtained using a first-principles-based global optimization method. The composition of the descriptors reveals how electronic, electrostatic, and geometric properties of the nanosilicates control the binding energies and demonstrates distinct physical origins of the bond formation for H and CO. The predictive performance of the descriptors is found to be limited by cluster reconstruction, e.g., breaking of internal metal–oxygen bonds, upon the adsorption event, and strategies to account for this phenomenon are discussed. The identified descriptors and the computed datasets of stable nanosilicate clusters along with their binding energies are expected to find use in astrochemical models of reaction networks occurring at silicate grain surfaces.},

We analyze the kinetic energy distribution and discuss the role of effective temperatures. Measurements of the reflectance and simulations of the absorbance of the helices based on retarded field calculations are compared to the anisotropy in photoemission. We find a significant enhancement of the anisotropy in the electron emission in comparison to the optical absorption. Neither simple thermionic nor a multiphoton photoemission can explain the experimentally observed asymmetries. Single photon deep-UV photoemission from these helices together with a change of the work function suggests a contribution of the chirally induced spin selectivity effect to the observed asymmetries.},

  abstract = {Field-effect transistors (FETs) made from colloidal quantum dot (QD) solids commonly suffer from current–voltage hysteresis caused by the bias-stress effect (BSE), which complicates fundamental studies of charge transport in QD solids and the use of QD FETs in electronics. Here, we show that the BSE can be eliminated in n -channel PbSe QD FETs by first removing the QD ligands with a dose of H 2 S gas and then infilling the QD films with alumina by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The H 2 S-treated, alumina-infilled FETs have stable, hysteresis-free device characteristics (total short-term stability), indefinite air stability (total long-term stability), and a high electron mobility of up to 14 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , making them attractive for QD circuitry and optoelectronic devices. The BSE-free devices are utilized to conclusively establish the dependence of the electron mobility on temperature and QD diameter. We demonstrate that the BSE in these devices is caused by both electron trapping at the QD surface and proton drift within the film. The H 2 S/alumina chemistry produces ligand-free PbSe/PbS/Al 2 O 3 interfaces that lack the traps that cause the electronic part of the BSE, while full alumina infilling stops the proton motion responsible for the ionic part of the BSE. Our matrix engineering approach should aid efforts to eliminate the BSE, boost carrier mobilities, and improve charge transport in other types of nanocrystal solids.},

The aim is to identify the best performing monomer binder blend and carbon-based material for the design of battery-optimized energy devices. The PVP:PAA monomer binder blend and graphite are found to have the best interaction energies, densification upon adsorption, and more ordered structure. The adsorption of both monomer binder blends is strongly guided by the higher affinity of PVP and PAA monomeric molecules for the surfaces compared to PVDF. The structure of adsorbed layers of PVP:PVDF monomer binder blend on graphene and graphite develops more quickly than PVP:PAA, indicating faster kinetics. This study complements a previous density functional theory study recently reported by our group and contributes to a better understanding of the nanoscopic features of relevant interfacial regions involving mixtures of monomers of PVP-based battery binders and different carbon-based materials. The effect of a blend of commonly used monomer binders on carbon-based materials is essential for obtaining tightly bound anode and cathode active materials in lithium-ion batteries, which is crucial for designing battery-optimized energy devices.},

  abstract = {Controlling matter at the level of electrons using ultrafast laser sources represents an important challenge for science and technology. Recently, we introduced a general laser control scheme (the Stark control of electrons at interfaces or SCELI) based on the Stark effect that uses the subcycle structure of light to manipulate electron dynamics at semiconductor interfaces [A. Garzón-Ramírez and I. Franco, Phys. Rev. B 98 , 121305 (2018)]. Here, we demonstrate that SCELI is also of general applicability in molecule–semiconductor interfaces. We do so by following the quantum dynamics induced by non-resonant few-cycle laser pulses of intermediate intensity (non-perturbative but non-ionizing) across model molecule–semiconductor interfaces of varying level alignments. We show that SCELI induces interfacial charge transfer regardless of the energy level alignment of the interface and even in situations where charge exchange is forbidden via resonant photoexcitation. We further show that the SCELI rate of charge transfer is faster than those offered by resonant photoexcitation routes as it is controlled by the subcycle structure of light. The results underscore the general applicability of SCELI to manipulate electron dynamics at interfaces on ultrafast timescales.},

These calculations complement previous predictions of the coefficient of noncontact friction in an electric force microscopy measurement for the same model, and also previous predictions of the jitter power spectrum for a dielectric continuum. The inclusion both of a finite sample thickness and a wavevector-dependent dielectric response can significantly enhance the magnitude of the predicted jitter spectrum for a conductor, relative to a simpler model of an infinitely thick dielectric continuum. These calculations provide a baseline prediction of the jitter power spectrum generated by the dynamics of conduction electrons in a metal sample.},

The average lifetime of the photo-excited electrons in a Quantum Dot-DNA system is influenced by the CISS effect generated by the DNA molecule, and the difference in average time decay of electrons was found to be 345 ps for opposite polarity (“UP” and “DOWN”) of spins due to the CISS effect. Moreover, the yield of spin-polarized electrons due to the CISS effect was reduced by more than 35\% from perfect DNA to DNA with point mutations. Remarkably, by employing a tight binding method combined with Green’s function formalism for transport, simulations of the process support the observed experimental trends.

However, these promising proof-of-concept photoemission experiments lack the angular and energy resolution that could provide the necessary insights into the mechanism of this phenomenon. In order to fill in the missing gaps, we provide a detailed spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of heptahelicene layers on a Cu(111) substrate. Throughout the large accessible energy and angle range, no chirality induced spin asymmetry in photoemission could be observed. Possible reasons for the absence of signatures of the spin-dependent electron transmission through the chiral molecular layer are briefly discussed.},

Although poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is found to be one of the most potent biomimetic IRI agents, the molecular understanding of the nucleation behavior of water in the presence of PVA is still lacking. Here, we use molecular dynamics to elucidate the role of concentration, degree of supercooling, degree of polymerization, and amphiphilicity of PVA and PVA-like polymers on the homogeneous nucleation of water in dilute polymeric solutions using the seeding method. Using classical nucleation theory ( CNT ), our simulations indicate an increase in the chemical potential difference between ice and melt that favors ice nucleation. However, it also predicts a significant increase in the ice–melt interfacial energy that impedes nucleation. The relative increase in the interfacial energy dominates the increase in the chemical potential difference, which results in a decrease in the nucleation rate of water with an increase in the solute concentration. This study contradicts the previous simulation study that suggested the promotion of homogeneous ice nucleation by PVA and supports the experimental observations of the heterogeneous origins of ice nucleation. Our results also suggest the non-classical origins of ice nucleation in polymeric solutions and the limitation of the CNT in predicting heterogeneous ice nucleation in polymeric solutions.},

  abstract = {In polydisperse systems, describing the structure and any structural order parameter (SOP) is not trivial as it varies with the number of species we use to describe the system, M . Depending on the degree of polydispersity, there is an optimum value of M = M 0 where we show that the mutual information of the system increases. However, surprisingly, the correlation between a recently proposed SOP and the dynamics is highest for M = 1. This effect increases with polydispersity. We find that the SOP at M = 1 is coupled with the particle size, σ , and this coupling increases with polydispersity and decreases with an increase in M . Careful analysis shows that at lower polydispersities, the SOP is a good predictor of the dynamics. However, at higher polydispersity, the dynamics is strongly dependent on σ . Since the coupling between the SOP and σ is higher for M = 1, it appears to be a better predictor of the dynamics. We also study the Vibrality, an order parameter independent of structural information. Compared to SOP, at high polydispersity, we find Vibrality to be a marginally better predictor of the dynamics. However, this high predictive power of Vibrality, which is not there at lower polydispersity, appears to be due to its stronger coupling with σ . Therefore, our study suggests that for systems with high polydispersity, the correlation of any order parameter and σ will affect the correlation between the order parameter and dynamics and need not project a generic predictive power of the order parameter.},

The use of MTA and the inherently parallel nature of the fragment calculations enables a rapid and accurate calculation of the IR spectrum. The applicability of MTA to optimize the protein geometry and evaluate its IR spectrum employing a polarizable continuum model with water as a solvent is also showcased. The typical errors in the total energy and IR frequencies computed by MTA vis-à-vis their full calculation (FC) counterparts for the studied protein are 5–10 millihartrees and 5 cm −1 , respectively. Moreover, due to the independent execution of the fragments, large-scale parallelization can also be achieved. With increasing size and level of theory, MTA shows an appreciable advantage in computer time as well as memory and disk space requirement over the corresponding FCs.

A novel ultrafast (i.e., femtosecond) laser absorption spectroscopy diagnostic was developed to provide broadband (≈400 cm −1 ) spectrally resolved (0.02 nm resolution) measurements of CN absorbance spectra belonging to its B 2 Σ + ← X 2 Σ + electronic system and its first four Δv = 0 vibrational bands (v″ = 0, 1, 2, 3). Measurements were acquired behind reflected shock waves in a mixture with 5.65\% CH 4 and 94.35\% N 2 at initial chemically and vibrationally frozen temperatures and pressures of 4400–5900 K and 0.55–0.75 bar, respectively. A six-temperature line-by-line absorption spectroscopy model for CN was developed to determine the rotational temperature of CN in v″ = 0, 1, 2, and 3, as well as two vibrational temperatures via least-squares fitting. The measured CN spectra revealed rotationally and vibrationally non-Boltzmann population distributions that strengthened with increasing shock speed and persisted for over 100 µ s. The measured vibrational temperatures of CN initially increase in time with the increasing CN mole fraction and eventually exceed the expected post-shock rotational temperature of N 2 . The results suggest that strong chemical pumping is ultimately responsible for these trends and that, at the conditions studied, CN is primarily formed in high vibrational states within the A 2 Π or B 2 Σ + state at characteristic rates, which are comparable to or exceed those of key vibrational equilibration processes.},

The PTB7/BTA3 system with a large short-circuit current density (J SC ) exhibited a large charge CT distance and electronic coupling. Contrastingly, the PTB7/BTA1 system with a low J SC has a large HR factor because of the low-wavenumber vibrational modes in the CT state of the D/A complex and is prone to nonadiabatic relaxation to the ground state. Systematic theoretical analysis of the excitonic states in the D/A complex has provided insight into the control of CT exciton dynamics, namely J SC and electron–hole recombination.},

  abstract = {The collective coupling of an ensemble of molecules to a light field is commonly described by the Tavis–Cummings model. This model includes numerous eigenstates that are optically decoupled from the optically bright polariton states. Accessing these dark states requires breaking the symmetry in the corresponding Hamiltonian. In this paper, we investigate the influence of non-unitary processes on the dark state dynamics in the molecular Tavis–Cummings model. The system is modeled with a Lindblad equation that includes pure dephasing, as it would be caused by weak interactions with an environment, and photon decay. Our simulations show that the rate of pure dephasing, as well as the number of two-level systems, has a significant influence on the dark state population.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive genetic algorithm is used to perform a global search for Cl − (H 2 O) 1–9 and NaCl(H 2 O) 1–9 . The structural optimization, energy calculations, vibrational characteristics, and charge distribution were performed at an ab initio high-level theory. Combined with the calculation results of Na + (H 2 O) 1–6 by Wang et al. [Front. Chem. 7 , 624 (2019)] in our group, we systematically investigate these three systems at the same theoretical level. A comparison of bond lengths reveals that in Cl − (H 2 O) n , the inclusion of Na + to form NaCl(H 2 O) n reduces the average distance between Cl − and H 2 O, indicating that Na + has a stabilizing effect on ionic hydrogen bonds. Conversely, in Na + (H 2 O) n , the introduction of Cl − weakens the interactions between Na + and H 2 O. In the NaCl(H 2 O) 1–9 structures searched by the genetic algorithm, the ground-state configurations correspond to contact ion pairs, and the solvent-separated ion pair structures appear when n = 7. Furthermore, the anharmonic corrected infrared spectra of Cl − (H 2 O) 1–5 and NaCl(H 2 O) 1–4 exhibit good agreement with the experimental results. According to charge analysis of NaCl(H 2 O) n , it is observed that charge transfer primarily occurs from Cl − to H 2 O, resulting in the presence of negative charges on the water molecules. These findings are helpful to understand the effects of Na + and Cl − on hydrated clusters at the molecular level.},

  abstract = {The non-adiabatic relaxation processes and the fragmentation dynamics of Rydberg-excited N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylmethylenediamine (TMMDA) are investigated using femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron imaging and time-resolved mass spectroscopy. Excitation at 208 nm populates TMMDA in a charge-localized 3 p state. Rapid internal conversion (IC) to 3 s produces two charge-delocalized conformers with independent time constants and distinct population ratios. As the system explores the 3 s potential surface, the structural evolution continues on a 1.55 ps timescale, followed by a slower (12.1 ps) relaxation to the ground state. A thorough comparison of the time-dependent mass and photoelectron spectra suggests that ionization out of the 3 p state ends up with the parent ion, the vibrational energy of which is insufficient for the bond cleavage. On the contrary, by virtue of the additional energy acquired by IC from 3 p , the internal energy deposited in 3 s is available to break the C–N bond, leading to the fragment ion. The fragmentation is found to occur on the ion surface instead of the Rydberg surface.},

Experiments on a single colloidal particle trapped in a carefully shaped double well potential have demonstrated this effect recently [A. Kumar and J. Bechhoefer, Nature 584 , 64 (2020)]. In a similar vein, here, we consider a piece-wise linear double well potential that allows us to demonstrate the Mpemba effect using an exact analysis based on the spectral decomposition of the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation. We elucidate the role of the metastable states in the energy landscape as well as the initial population statistics of the particles in showcasing the Mpemba effect. Crucially, our findings indicate that neither the metastability nor the asymmetry in the potential is a necessary or a sufficient condition for the Mpemba effect to be observed.},

We find that trial wave functions beyond single Slater determinants improve the performance of AFQMC and allow it to generate energies close to chemical accuracy compared to full configuration interaction or experimental results. In the field of material science, we study the electronic structure properties of cuprates through the quasi-1D Fermi–Hubbard model derived from CuBr 2 , where we find that trial wave functions with both significantly larger fidelities and lower energies over a mean-field solution do not necessarily lead to AFQMC results closer to the exact ground state energy.},

  abstract = {Classical optimizers play a crucial role in determining the accuracy and convergence of variational quantum algorithms; leading algorithms use a near-term quantum computer to solve the ground state properties of molecules, simulate dynamics of different quantum systems, and so on. In the literature, many optimizers, each having its own architecture, have been employed expediently for different applications. In this work, we consider a few popular and efficacious optimizers and assess their performance in variational quantum algorithms for applications in quantum chemistry in a realistic noisy setting. We benchmark the optimizers with critical analysis based on quantum simulations of simple molecules, such as hydrogen, lithium hydride, beryllium hydride, water, and hydrogen fluoride. The errors in the ground state energy, dissociation energy, and dipole moment are the parameters used as yardsticks. All the simulations were carried out with an ideal quantum circuit simulator, a noisy quantum circuit simulator, and finally a noisy simulator with noise embedded from the IBM Cairo quantum device to understand the performance of the classical optimizers in ideal and realistic quantum environments. We used the standard unitary coupled cluster ansatz for simulations, and the number of qubits varied from two starting from the hydrogen molecule to ten qubits in hydrogen fluoride. Based on the performance of these optimizers in the ideal quantum circuits, the conjugate gradient, limited-memory Broyden—Fletcher—Goldfarb—Shanno bound, and sequential least squares programming optimizers are found to be the best-performing gradient-based optimizers. While constrained optimization by linear approximation (COBYLA) and Powell&#39;s conjugate direction algorithm for unconstrained optimization (POWELL) perform most efficiently among the gradient-free methods, in noisy quantum circuit conditions, simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation, POWELL, and COBYLA are among the best-performing optimizers.},

Compared to the canonical CD- GW method, computational scaling is reduced by an order of magnitude without sacrificing accuracy. This allows for an efficient calculation of core ionization energies. The improved computational efficiency is used to provide benchmarks for core ionized states, comparing the performance of 15 density functional approximations as Kohn–Sham starting points for GW calculations on a set of 65 core ionization energies of 32 small molecules. Contrary to valence states, GW calculations on core states prefer functionals with only a moderate amount of Hartree–Fock exchange. Moreover, modern ab initio local hybrid functionals are also shown to provide excellent generalized Kohn–Sham references for core GW calculations. Furthermore, the core–valence separated Bethe–Salpeter equation (CVS-BSE) is outlined. CVS-BSE is a convenient tool to probe core excited states. The latter is tested on a set of 40 core excitations of eight small inorganic molecules. Results from the CVS-BSE method for excitation energies and the corresponding absorption cross sections are found to be in excellent agreement with those of reference damped response BSE calculations.},

The Zn 2 P 2 S 3 Se 3 and Cd 2 P 2 S 3 Se 3 monolayers are indirect-gap semiconductors. The high polarizability of M-Se/S bonds in the MS 3 Se 3 distorted octahedrons leads to anharmonic phonon behavior, which produces an intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity ( κ l ) as low as 1.06 and 1.99 W m −1 K −1 at 300 K for Zn 2 P 2 S 3 Se 3 and Cd 2 P 2 S 3 Se 3 monolayers, respectively. The lower κ l of the Zn 2 P 2 S 3 Se 3 monolayer is mainly attributed to more pronounced flat modes of the phonon dispersion in a frequency range of 1–1.7 THz caused by the softer Zn–Se/S bonds. The polar optical phonon scattering of carriers surprisingly plays a dominant role in carrier transport of both the monolayers, which greatly suppresses the electrical conductivity and thereby the power factor by about an order of magnitude. The predicted figure of merit ( zT ) increases monotonically with the temperature at the optimal carrier density, and at the operating temperature of 1200 K, it reaches an optimal value of 0.86 at an optimal electron density of ∼ 1.5 × 1 0 13 cm −2 for the n-type Zn 2 P 2 S 3 Se 3 monolayer and 0.30 at an optimal electron density of ∼ 7 × 1 0 12 cm −2 for the n-type Cd 2 P 2 S 3 Se 3 monolayer.},

We have predicted the aqueous solubility of urea at 300 K from chemical potential calculations for two urea model combinations: Özpinar/TIP3P and Hölzl/(TIP4P/2005). The methodology assumes that the intramolecular contribution of the urea molecule to the chemical potentials is identical in the crystal and in solution and, hence, cancels out. In parallel to the chemical potential calculations, we also performed direct coexistence simulations of a urea crystal slab in contact with urea-water solutions with the aim to identify upper and lower bounds to the solubility value using an independent route. The chemical potential approach yielded similar solubilities for both urea models, despite the actual chemical potential values showing a significant dependence on the force field. The predicted solubilities for the two models were 0.013–0.018 (Özpınar) and 0.008–0.012 (Hölzl) mole fraction, which are an order of magnitude lower than the experimental solubility that lies in a range of 0.125–0.216 mole fraction. The direct coexistence solubility bounds were relatively wide and did not encompass the chemical potential based solubilities, although the latter were close to the lower bound values.},

Specifically, we explore driven resonant electronic excitations in magnesium fluoride in the proximity of an avoided crossing. Near the avoided crossing, the CCSD similarity-transformed Hamiltonian is defective, meaning that it has complex eigenvalues, and oscillator strengths may take on negative values. When an external field is applied to drive transitions to states exhibiting these traits, unphysical dynamics are observed. For example, the stationary states that make up the time-dependent state acquire populations that can be negative, exceed one, or even complex-valued.},

  abstract = {Electronic structure calculations have the potential to predict key matter transformations for applications of strategic technological importance, from drug discovery to material science and catalysis. However, a predictive physicochemical characterization of these processes often requires accurate quantum chemical modeling of complex molecular systems with hundreds to thousands of atoms. Due to the computationally demanding nature of electronic structure calculations and the complexity of modern high-performance computing hardware, quantum chemistry software has historically failed to operate at such large molecular scales with accuracy and speed that are useful in practice. In this paper, novel algorithms and software are presented that enable extreme-scale quantum chemistry capabilities with particular emphasis on exascale calculations. This includes the development and application of the multi-Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) library LibCChem 2.0 as part of the General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System package and of the standalone Extreme-scale Electronic Structure System (EXESS), designed from the ground up for scaling on thousands of GPUs to perform high-performance accurate quantum chemistry calculations at unprecedented speed and molecular scales. Among various results, we report that the EXESS implementation enables Hartree–Fock/cc-pVDZ plus RI-MP2/cc-pVDZ/cc-pVDZ-RIFIT calculations on an ionic liquid system with 623 016 electrons and 146 592 atoms in less than 45 min using 27 600 GPUs on the Summit supercomputer with a 94.6\% parallel efficiency.},

  abstract = {Multifidelity modeling is a technique for fusing the information from two or more datasets into one model. It is particularly advantageous when one dataset contains few accurate results and the other contains many less accurate results. Within the context of modeling potential energy surfaces, the low-fidelity dataset can be made up of a large number of inexpensive energy computations that provide adequate coverage of the N -dimensional space spanned by the molecular internal coordinates. The high-fidelity dataset can provide fewer but more accurate electronic energies for the molecule in question. Here, we compare the performance of several neural network-based approaches to multifidelity modeling. We show that the four methods (dual, Δ-learning, weight transfer, and Meng–Karniadakis neural networks) outperform a traditional implementation of a neural network, given the same amount of training data. We also show that the Δ-learning approach is the most practical and tends to provide the most accurate model.},

  abstract = {We present a time-dependent theory for non-resonant x-ray emission spectrum (XES) and normal Auger spectrum (NAS) calculation, based on a fully quantum description of nuclear dynamics using the vibrational wave packet concept. We compare two formulations of the time-dependent theory, either employing a two-time propagation scheme or using spectral integration over the electron energy continuum. We find that the latter formulation is more efficient for numerical simulations, providing a reasonable accuracy when the integration step is shorter than the lifetime broadening of the core-ionized state. We demonstrate our approach using the example of non-resonant x-ray emission from a water molecule, considering the lowest core-ionized K −1 and first core-ionized shake-up K −1 V −1 V 1 intermediate states. These channels exemplify the developed theory on bound–bound, bound–continuum, continuum–bound, and continuum–continuum transitions. Our results suggest that the time-dependent approach is efficient for simulating XES involving dissociative states, whereas the time-independent approach, based on Franck–Condon factors, is more efficient for bound–bound transitions expressed as discrete frequency dependence in the energy domain. The methods and discussion have general applicability, including both NAS and more complex systems, such as liquid water.},

Elastic and inelastic components of the scattering signal, as well as coherent-mixed scattering that arises from electron dynamics, are calculated. By virtue of a near-quantitative distinction between scattering related to electronic transitions into bound and continuum states, we demonstrate how Compton ionization contributes to the coherent-mixed component. Analogous to inelastic scattering, the contribution to the coherent-mixed signal is significant and particularly manifests at intermediate and high-momentum transfers. Strikingly, for molecules with inversion symmetry, the exclusion of bound or continuum transitions may lead to the prediction of spurious coherent-mixed signals. We conclude that qualitative and quantitative accuracies of predicted scattering signals on detectors without energy resolution require that elements of the two-electron density operator are used. This approach inherently accounts for all accessible electronic transitions, including ionization.},

In this paper, we present an attempt to tackle this problem using machine learning. Although most recent applications of machine learning for the analysis of diffraction images apply only a single neural network to an experimental dataset and train it on the task of prediction, our approach utilizes an additional generator network trained on both synthetic and experimental data. Our network converts experimental data into idealized diffraction patterns from which information is extracted via a convolutional neural network trained on synthetic data only. We validate this approach on ultrafast electron diffraction data of bismuth samples undergoing thermalization upon excitation via 800 nm laser pulses. The network was able to predict transient temperatures with a deviation of less than 6\% from analytically estimated values. Notably, this performance was achieved on a dataset of 408 images only. We believe that employing this network in experimental settings where high volumes of visual data are collected, such as beam lines, could provide insights into the structural dynamics of different samples.},

  abstract = {We have designed a [Fe(SH) 4 H] − model with the fifth proton binding either to Fe or S. We show that the energy difference between these two isomers (∆ E ) is hard to estimate with quantum-mechanical (QM) methods. For example, different density functional theory (DFT) methods give ∆ E estimates that vary by almost 140 kJ/mol, mainly depending on the amount of exact Hartree–Fock included (0\%–54\%). The model is so small that it can be treated by many high-level QM methods, including coupled-cluster (CC) and multiconfigurational perturbation theory approaches. With extrapolated CC series (up to fully connected coupled-cluster calculations with singles, doubles, and triples) and semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction methods, we obtain results that seem to be converged to full configuration interaction results within 5 kJ/mol. Our best result for ∆ E is 101 kJ/mol. With this reference, we show that M06 and B3LYP-D3 give the best results among 35 DFT methods tested for this system. Brueckner doubles coupled cluster with perturbaitve triples seems to be the most accurate coupled-cluster approach with approximate triples. CCSD(T) with Kohn–Sham orbitals gives results within 4–11 kJ/mol of the extrapolated CC results, depending on the DFT method. Single-reference CC calculations seem to be reasonably accurate (giving an error of ∼5 kJ/mol compared to multireference methods), even if the D 1 diagnostic is quite high (0.25) for one of the two isomers.},

  abstract = {Atomic description of electrochemical systems requires reactive interaction potential to explicitly describe the chemistry between atoms and molecules and the evolving charge distribution and polarization effects. Calculating Coulomb electrostatic interactions and polarization effects requires a better estimate of the partial charge distribution in molecular systems. However, models such as reactive force fields and charge equilibration (QEq) include Coulomb interactions up to a short-distance cutoff for better computational speeds. Ignoring long-distance electrostatic interaction affects the ability to describe electrochemistry in large systems. We studied the long-range Coulomb effects among charged particles and extended the QEq method to include long-range effects. By this extension, we anticipate a proper account of Coulomb interactions in reactive molecular dynamics simulations. We validate the approach by computing charges on a series of metal-organic frameworks and some simple systems. Results are compared to regular QEq and quantum mechanics calculations. The study shows slightly overestimated charge values in the regular QEq approach. Moreover, our method was combined with Ewald summation to compute forces and evaluate the long-range effects of simple capacitor configurations. There were noticeable differences between the calculated charges with/without long-range Coulomb interactions. The difference, which may have originated from the long-range influence on the capacitor ions, makes the Ewald method a better descriptor of Coulomb electrostatics for charged electrodes. The approach explored in this study enabled the atomic description of electrochemical systems with realistic electrolyte thickness while accounting for the electrostatic effects of charged electrodes throughout the dielectric layer in devices like batteries and emerging solid-state memory.},

This ω GDD ML model has been built using a wide range of systems (11 466 complexes, ten different elements, and up to 139 heavy atoms) with fingerprints for the local atomic environment and histograms of distances for the long-range atomic correlation for mapping the quantum mechanical range-separation values. The promising performance on the testing set with 7046 complexes shows a mean absolute error of 0.001 117 a 0 − 1 and only five systems (0.07\%) with an absolute error larger than 0.01 a 0 − 1 ⁠ , which indicates the good transferability of our ω GDD ML model. In addition, the only required input to obtain ω GDD ML is the Cartesian coordinates without electronic structure calculations, thereby enabling rapid predictions. LRC- ω PBE ( ω GDD ML ) is used to predict polarizabilities for a series of oligomers, where polarizabilities are sensitive to the asymptotic density decay and are crucial in a variety of applications, including the calculations of dispersion corrections and refractive index, and surpasses the performance of all other popular density functionals except for the non-tuned LRC- ω PBE. Finally, LRC- ω PBE ( ω GDD ML ) combined with (extended) symmetry-adapted perturbation theory is used in calculating noncovalent interactions to further show that the traditional ab initio system-specific tuning procedure can be bypassed. The present study not only provides an accurate and efficient way to determine the range-separation parameter for LRC- ω PBE but also shows the synergistic benefits of fusing the power of physically inspired density functional LRC- ω PBE and the data-driven ω GDD ML model.},

It is found that, with a reasonable set of parameters, the main features of the recent experimental studies of hydrogen atom scattering on metal surfaces can be reproduced. Vibrational states on the chemisorption state whose energies are close to the incident energy are found to play an important role, and the scattering process is dominated by a single-pass electronic transition forth and back between the diabatic physisorption and chemisorption states. Further study on the effects of the atom-surface coupling strength reveals that, upon increasing the atom-surface coupling strength, the scattering mechanism changes from typical nonadiabatic transitions to dynamics in the electronic friction regime.},

Frequency-resolved spectra in the carbonyl stretch region show relatively strong bleaching signals that oscillate at the difference frequency between the two observed vibrational features as a function of the pump–probe waiting time. This observation is consistent with the presence of nonlinear pathways resulting from underlying cross-peak signals between the coupled symmetric–asymmetric C≡O stretch pair.

  abstract = {The adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–protein interactions have been of great interest since the recent experimental finding of ATP’s role as a hydrotrope. The interaction between ATP and disordered proteins is fundamental to the dissolution of protein aggregates and the regulation of liquid–liquid phase separation by ATP. Molecular dynamics simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing these interactions in molecular detail but often suffers from inaccuracies in describing disordered proteins and ATPs in high concentrations. Recently, several water models have been proposed to improve the description of the protein-disordered states, yet how these models work with ATP has not been explored. To this end, here, we study how water models affect ATP and alter the ATP–ATP and ATP–protein interactions for the intrinsically disordered protein, α -Synuclein. Three water models, TIP4P-D, OPC, and TIP3P, are compared, while the protein force field is fixed to ff99SBildn. The results show that ATP over-aggregates into a single cluster in TIP3P water, but monomers and smaller clusters are found in TIP4P-D and OPC waters. ATP–protein interaction is also over-stabilized in TIP3P, whereas repeated binding/unbinding of ATP to α -Synuclein is observed in OPC and TIP4P-D waters, which is in line with the recent nuclear magnetic resonance experiment. The adenine ring-mediated interaction is found to play a major role in ATP–ATP and ATP–protein contacts. Interestingly, changing Mg 2+ into Na + strengthened the electrostatic interaction and promoted ATP oligomerization and ATP– α -Synuclein binding. Overall, this study shows that changing the water model can be an effective approach to improve the properties of ATP in high concentration.},

  abstract = {Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have gained popularity in recent years as they provide a cost-effective alternative to ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Despite a small error on the test set, MLFFs inherently suffer from generalization and robustness issues during MD simulations. To alleviate these issues, we propose global force metrics and fine-grained metrics from element and conformation aspects to systematically measure MLFFs for every atom and every conformation of molecules. We selected three state-of-the-art MLFFs (ET, NequIP, and ViSNet) and comprehensively evaluated on aspirin, Ac-Ala3-NHMe, and Chignolin MD datasets with the number of atoms ranging from 21 to 166. Driven by the trained MLFFs on these molecules, we performed MD simulations from different initial conformations, analyzed the relationship between the force metrics and the stability of simulation trajectories, and investigated the reason for collapsed simulations. Finally, the performance of MLFFs and the stability of MD simulations can be further improved guided by the proposed force metrics for model training, specifically training MLFF models with these force metrics as loss functions, fine-tuning by reweighting samples in the original dataset, and continued training by recruiting additional unexplored data.},

  abstract = {The elastic behavior of nematics is commonly described in terms of the three so-called bulk deformation modes, i.e., splay, twist, and bend. However, the elastic free energy contains also other terms, often denoted as saddle–splay and splay–bend, which contribute, for instance, in confined systems. The role of such terms is controversial, partly because of the difficulty of their experimental determination. The saddle–splay ( K 24 ) and splay–bend ( K 13 ) elastic constants remain elusive also for theories; indeed, even the possibility of obtaining unambiguous microscopic expressions for these quantities has been questioned. Here, within the framework of Onsager theory with Parsons–Lee correction, we obtain microscopic estimates of the deformation free energy density of hard rod nematics in the presence of different director deformations. In the limit of a slowly changing director, these are directly compared with the macroscopic elastic free energy density. Within the same framework, we derive also closed microscopic expressions for all elastic coefficients of rodlike nematics. We find that the saddle–splay constant K 24 is larger than both K 11 and K 22 over a wide range of particle lengths and densities. Moreover, the K 13 contribution comes out to be crucial for the consistency of the results obtained from the analysis of the microscopic deformation free energy density calculated for variants of the splay deformation.},

We find long-ranged structural order using bond order parameters in both cold and hot regions of the system beyond a certain diameter ratio of the cold and hot particles.

We present solutions to equations of motion derived with a Liouvillian superoperator approach, which encompass the coherent quadrupolar interaction in conjunction with relaxation, to give a full analytical description of the evolution trajectories of rank-1 ( ⁠ T ^ 1 ± 1 ⁠ ), rank-2 ( ⁠ T ^ 2 ± 1 ⁠ ), and rank-3 ( ⁠ T ^ 3 ± 1 ⁠ ) SQCs.

  abstract = {In this work, we compare the single chain dynamic structure factors for five different polymers: polyolefins (PE and PEP), poly-dienes (PB and PI), and a polyether (PEO). For this purpose, we have extended the De Gennes approximation for the dynamic structure factor. We describe the single chain dynamic structure factor in multiplying the coherent scattering functions for local reptation and Rouse motion within the Rouse blob. Important results are (i) the simple De Gennes structure factor S ( Q , t ) DG approximates within a few Å the outcome for the tube diameter of the more elaborate structure factor (exception PI); (ii) the extended De Gennes structure factor together with the Rouse blob describes the neutron spin echo spectra from the different polymers over the complete momentum transfer range and the full time regime from early Rouse motion to local reptation; and (iii) the representation of the scattering functions could significantly be improved by introducing non-Gaussianity corrections to the Rouse-blob dynamics. (iv) The microscopic tube step length in all cases is significantly larger than the rheological one; further tweaking the relation between tube length and entanglement blob size may indicate a possible trend toward an anisotropic lean tube with a step-length larger than the lateral extension. (v) All considered polymer data coincide after proper ( Q , t ) scaling to a universal behavior according to the length scale of the tube, while the relevant time scale is the entanglement time τ e . (vi) In terms of the packing model, the required number of chains spanning the entanglement volume consistently is about 40\% larger than that obtained from rheology.},

Going beyond the model requires directly representing the effect of γ -ray irradiation in first-principles calculations, which was not feasible previously. In this work, we examine the defect-based model of the ISE by developing a multiscale method for the simulation of the γ -ray irradiation, where the γ -ray-induced electronic excitations are treated explicitly in excited-state first-principles calculations. We find the calculations agree with experiments, and the effect of the γ -ray-induced excitation is significantly different from the effects of defect charge state and temperature.

However, quantum optics predicts that the EM enhancement of such optical responses, e.g., fluorescence, Raman, and their nonlinear counterparts, is related directly to optical absorption and indirectly to Rayleigh scattering and extinction. To demonstrate this prediction, a micro-spectroscopic method for obtaining Rayleigh scattering, extinction, absorption, and EM enhancement is developed using single-coupled plasmonic systems composed of silver nanoparticle dimers and dye molecules. The EM enhancement is derived from ultrafast surface-enhanced fluorescence. An evaluation of the spectral relationships demonstrates that the EM enhancement can be reproduced better by absorption than by Rayleigh scattering or extinction. This reproduction is phenomenologically confirmed by numerical calculations based on classical electromagnetism, indicating the importance of absorption spectroscopy in coupled plasmonic systems for evaluating EM enhancement.},

  abstract = {Spin–orbit coupling in a chiral medium is generally assumed to be a necessary ingredient for the observation of the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. However, some recent studies have suggested that CISS may manifest even when the chiral medium has zero spin–orbit coupling. In such systems, CISS may arise due to an orbital polarization effect, which generates an electromagnetochiral anisotropy in two-terminal conductance. Here, we examine these concepts using a chirally functionalized carbon nanotube network as the chiral medium. A transverse measurement geometry is used, which nullifies any electromagnetochiral contribution but still exhibits the tell-tale signs of the CISS effect. This suggests that CISS may not be explained solely by electromagnetochiral effects. The role of nanotube spin–orbit coupling on the observed pure CISS signal is studied by systematically varying nanotube diameter. We find that the magnitude of the CISS signal scales proportionately with the spin–orbit coupling strength of the nanotubes. We also find that nanotube diameter dictates the supramolecular chirality of the medium, which in turn determines the sign of the CISS signal.},

Experimental evidence of such fringes measured from centrosymmetric bulks is provided for a diamond window in the far infrared and suggested for other materials in previously published data. The existence of a stationary point in the phase mismatch, related to the group velocity mismatch, is shown to be the source of another pseudo-resonant process in centrosymmetric calcium and barium fluorides, for which theoretical predictions reproduce the experimental observations.},

  abstract = {The well-known formalism for Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG) reflected or transmitted by a three-layer system involves three equations defining the emitted SFG intensity, the effective nonlinear susceptibility, and a set of Fresnel factors specific to the three-layer system. We generalize the equations to an N-layer system, where all media have non-vanishing thicknesses, by leaving the first two equations unchanged and modifying only the Fresnel factors. These universal Fresnel factors bear all the complexity of light propagation and interference in the system, in amplitude and phase. They are analytically known anywhere in the N-layer system, either at any interface or in any of the bulks, and share common expressions for the three beams, incoming or emitted, of the SFG process in reflection. Enclosing an ultrathin layer (e.g., a molecular monolayer) in the system does not modify the Fresnel factors except for boundary conditions at this layer, as in the three-layer case. Specific rules are elaborated to simplify systems containing macroscopic layers. Equations for the four- and five-layer systems are explicitly provided. Simulations in the four-layer system allow for the recovery of the results of the transfer matrix formalism at a lower complexity cost for SFG users. Finally, when several interfaces in the system produce SFG signals, we show that it is possible to probe only the most buried one by canceling all the SFG responses except at this last interface, generalizing the results of the three-layer system.},

  abstract = {When a homogeneous film of finite thickness is optically probed, interference due to multiple reflections modulates in amplitude the electric field of light. For optical processes located only at the interfaces between two media, as is common for Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG), interference also modulates the contrast between signals generated at the entrance and exit planes of the film. We introduce a universal formalism for Fresnel factors, which bear all the information about interference, valid at any point in a three-layer system and for the three beams involved in the SFG process. Their analysis provides general rules for obtaining a high contrast. In particular, we define four configurations leading to the cancellation of the SFG response from the entrance side of the film when its thickness or the angles of incidence are tuned. Cancellation conditions depend on the polarization of light and follow simple analytical rules, leading to a straightforward experimental implementation. Such a selective cancellation makes it possible to independently measure single components of the nonlinear susceptibility, for example, in a ppp experiment and to separate surface from bulk response by combining a few measurements.},

  abstract = {The facet-dependent adsorption of CO on oxidized and reduced CeO 2 single crystal surfaces is reviewed, with emphasis on the effect of CO coverage and the ability of state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods to provide reliable energies and an accurate description of the IR vibrational frequency of CO. Comparison with detailed, high-resolution experimental infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy data obtained for single crystal samples allows the assignment of the different CO vibrational bands observed on all three low-index ceria surfaces. Good agreement is achieved with the hybrid density functional theory approach with the HSE06 functional and with saturation coverage. It is shown that CO is very sensitive to the structure of cerium oxide surfaces and to the presence of oxygen vacancies. The combined theoretical-experimental approach offers new opportunities for a better characterization of ceria nanoparticles and for unraveling changes occurring during reactions involving CO at higher pressures.},

  abstract = {Salt solubility is generally determined under isotropic stress conditions. Yet, in the context of salt weathering of porous media, mechanical constraints on the in-pore growth of salt crystals are likely to be orientation-dependent, resulting in an anisotropic stress state on the crystal. In this paper, we determine by molecular simulation the solubility of NaCl in water when the crystal is subjected to anisotropic stress. Such anisotropy causes the chemical potential of the crystal to be orientation-dependent, and proper thermodynamic formulation requires describing the chemical potential as a tensor. The solute and crystal chemical potentials are computed from free energy calculations using Hamiltonian thermodynamic integration, and the usual condition of solubility is reformulated to account for the tensorial nature of the crystal chemical potential. We investigate in detail how the uniaxial compression of the crystal affects its solubility. The molecular simulation results led to revisiting the Correns law under anisotropic stress. Regarding the solute, the non-ideal behavior of the liquid phase is captured using Pitzer’s ion interaction approach up to high concentrations of interest for in-pore crystallization and beyond the concentrations addressed in the existing literature. Regarding NaCl crystals, the validity of the generalized Gibbs–Duhem equation for a tensorial chemical potential is carefully verified, and it is found that crystallization progresses almost orthogonally to the crystal surface even under high shear stresses. Comparing uniaxial and isotropic compression highlights the major differences in solubility caused by stress anisotropy, and the revisited Correns law offers an appropriate framework to capture this phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Metal oxide semiconductors constitute a vast group of materials whose physical properties are greatly affected by native defects. For decades, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been widely used in defect analysis. However, correct interpretation of XPS results remains a difficult task. In this work, we present a detailed first-principles study on the core-level shift of the most stable and commonly cited crystal imperfections in ZnO, including O and –OH species at the surface with different coverages and bulk defects, including O interstitial (O i ), O vacancy in the +2 charge state (Vo 2+ ), and the neutral vacancy (Vo 0 ). The O1s core level spectrum is simulated and compared with experiments to understand the correlation between local atomic structures and features in the O1s spectrum. In particular, our results indicate that the widely adopted assignment in the defect analysis of ZnO, which links the defect peak in XPS to Vo, the most stable defect, is very likely a misinterpretation. Theoretical analysis indicates that there are no distinguishable XPS features arising from the Vo defect. Furthermore, we show that the commonly observed defect-related peak instead arises due to O i or specific surface configurations. Given the importance of native defects in materials performance, misinterpretation of XPS results may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding materials properties. This work provides a first-principles basis for the analysis of oxide defects through XPS.},

These quasiparticles exhibit nontrivial transport phenomena due to the long-range correlations induced by the photonic system and elastic and inelastic scattering processes driven by matter disorder. In this article, we employ the Ioffe–Regel criterion to obtain vibrational polariton mobility edges and to identify distinct regimes of delocalization and transport under variable experimental conditions of light–matter detuning, disorder, and interaction strength. Correlations between the obtained trends and recent observations of polariton effects on reactivity are discussed, and essential differences between transport phenomena in organic electronic exciton and vibrational polaritons are highlighted. Our transport diagrams show the rich diversity of transport phenomena under vibrational strong coupling and indicate that macroscopic delocalization is favored at negative detuning and large light–matter interaction strength. We also find the surprising feature that, despite the presence of dephasing-induced inelastic scattering processes, macroscopic lower polariton delocalization and wave transport are expected to persist experimentally, even in modes with small photonic weight.},

  abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics simulations of water in ionic and dipolar solvents were used to interpret the far-infrared (FIR) rotation/libration spectra of “solitary water” in terms of water’s rotational dynamics and interactions with solvents. Seven solvents represented by nonpolarizable all-atom force fields and a series of idealized variable-charge solvents were used to span the range of solvent polarities (hydrogen bonding) studied experimentally. Simulated spectra capture the solvent dependence observed, as well as the relationship between the frequencies of water libration ( ν L ) and OH stretching bands ( ν OH ). In more strongly interacting solvents, simulated ν L are ∼20\% higher than those of experiment. In all solvents, the simulated spectra are composites of rotational motions about the two axes perpendicular to water’s dipole moment, and the different frequencies of these two motions are responsible for the breadth of the libration band and the bimodal shape observed in halide ionic liquids. Simulations overestimate the separation of these two components in most solvents. The character of water rotational motions changes markedly with solvent polarity, from quasi-free rotation in nonpolar and weakly polar solvents to highly constrained libration in strongly hydrogen bonding environments. The changeover to librational motions dominating the spectrum occurs between solvents such as benzene ( ν L ∼ 250 cm −1 ) and acetonitrile ( ν L ∼ 400 cm −1 ). For solvents in the latter category, the mean frequency of the experimental FIR band provides a direct measure of mean-squared torques and, therefore, force constants associated with interactions constraining water’s librational motion.},

We observe that the rotational correlation times follow Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann and Arrhenius ( E a = 0.48 eV) relations above ∼225 K and below ∼170 K, respectively, whereas the temperature dependence continuously evolves from one to the other behavior in the broad crossover zone in between. In the common temperature range, the present NMR results are fully consistent with previous broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) data on water (H 2 O) in a very similar framework. Several of our observations, e.g., rotational–translational coupling, indicate that a bulk-like structural ( α ) relaxation is observed above the crossover region. When cooling through the crossover zone, a quasi-isotropic reorientation mechanism is retained, while 2 H spin-lattice relaxation evolves from exponential to nonexponential, implying that the water dynamics probed at low temperatures does no longer fully restore ergodicity on the time scale of this experiment. We discuss that the latter effect may result from bulk-like and/or confinement-imposed spatially heterogeneous water properties. Comparison with previous NMR and BDS results for water in other confinements reveals that, for confinement sizes around 2 nm, water reorientation depends more on the pore diameter than on the pore chemistry, while water diffusion is strongly affected by the connectivity and topology of the pores.},

Combining experimental NIPE spectra and theoretical calculations, various Gly· X − complexes were found to adopt the same types of low-lying isomers, albeit with different relative energies. Despite more congested spectral profiles for Gly·Cl − and Gly·Br − , spectral assignments were accomplished with the guidance of the knowledge learned from Gly·I − , where a larger spin–orbit splitting of iodine afforded well-resolved, recognizable spectral peaks. Three canonical plus one zwitterionic isomer for Gly·Cl − and four canonical conformers for Gly·Br − were experimentally identified and characterized in contrast to the five canonical ones observed for Gly·I − under similar experimental conditions. Taken together, this study investigates both genericity and variations in binding patterns for the complexes composed of glycine and various halides, demonstrating that iodide-tagging is an effective spectroscopic means to unravel diverse ion-molecule binding motifs for cluster anions with congested spectral bands by substituting the respective ion with iodide.},

  abstract = {The UV photochemistry of small heteroaromatic molecules serves as a testbed for understanding fundamental photo-induced chemical transformations in moderately complex compounds, including isomerization, ring-opening, and molecular dissociation. Here, a combined experimental-theoretical study of 268 nm UV light-induced dynamics in 2-iodothiophene (C 4 H 3 IS) is performed. The dynamics are experimentally monitored with a femtosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) probe that measures iodine N-edge 4d core-to-valence transitions. Experiments are complemented by density functional theory calculations of both the pump-pulse induced valence excitations and the XUV probe-induced core-to-valence transitions. Possible intramolecular relaxation dynamics are investigated by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Gradual absorption changes up to ∼0.5 to 1 ps after excitation are observed for both the parent molecular species and emerging iodine fragments, with the latter appearing with a characteristic rise time of 160 ± 30 fs. Comparison of spectral intensities and energies with the calculations identifies an iodine dissociation pathway initiated by a predominant π → π* excitation. In contrast, initial excitation to a nearby n ⟂ → σ* state appears unlikely based on a significantly smaller oscillator strength and the absence of any corresponding XUV absorption signatures. Excitation to the π → π* state is followed by contraction of the C–I bond, enabling a nonadiabatic transition to a dissociative π → σ C − I * state. For the subsequent fragmentation, a relatively narrow bond-length region along the C–I stretch coordinate between 230 and 280 pm is identified, where the transition between the parent molecule and the thienyl radical + iodine atom products becomes prominent in the XUV spectrum due to rapid localization of two singly occupied molecular orbitals on the two fragments.},

Two structures of the water dimer radical cation, namely, proton-transfer and hemi-bonded structures, have been suggested using density functional theory (DFT) and coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)]. Both structures are identified by us as local minima, and their relative stability strongly depends on the level of theory. The exact exchange correlates linearly to the energy difference between both local minima. DFT functionals with less than 20 percent exact exchange predict the hemi-bonded structure to be more stable, while more than 20 percent of the exact exchange stabilizes the proton-transfer structure. The latter structure is also confirmed by CCSD(T) benchmark computations. These computations, furthermore, indicate that the oxidized water dimer consists of a hydronium cation (H 3 O + ) and an HO · radical. These results are reproduced by DFT functionals with more than 50\% of exact exchange (BHandH, M06-2X, and M06-HF). The transition barrier for the interconversion from the proton-transfer to the hemi-bonded structure is 0.6 eV, while the reverse reaction has a barrier of 0.1 eV.},

Using a commercial quadrupole mass spectrometer and a photoelectron–photoion coincidence spectrometer, we systematically measure yields of ions and electrons created in pure and doped He nanodroplets in a wide size range and in two ionization regimes—direct ionization and secondary ionization after resonant photoexcitation of the droplets. For two different types of dopants (oxygen molecules, O 2 , and lithium atoms, Li), we infer the optimal droplet size to maximize the yield of ejected ions. When dopants are ionized by charge-transfer to photoionized He nanodroplets, the highest yield of O 2 and Li ions is detected for a mean size of ∼ 5 × 1 0 4 He atoms per nanodroplet. When dopants are Penning ionized via photoexcitation of the He droplets, the highest yield of O 2 and Li ions is detected for ∼ 1 0 3 and ∼ 1 0 5 He atoms per droplet, respectively. At optimum droplet sizes, the detection efficiency of dopant ions in proportion to the number of primary photoabsorption events is up to 20\% for charge-transfer ionization of O 2 and 2\% for Li, whereas for Penning ionization it is 1\% for O 2 and 4\% for Li.

  abstract = {Ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy is a relatively new methodology, which has now been widely used to study the molecular structure and dynamics of molecular processes occurring in solution. Typically, in 2DIR spectroscopy the dynamics of a system is inferred from the evolution of 2DIR spectral features over waiting times. One of the most important metrics derived from the 2DIR is the frequency–frequency correlation function (FFCF), which can be extracted using different methods, including center and nodal line slope. However, these methods struggle to correctly describe the dynamics in 2DIR spectra with multiple and overlapping transitions. Here, a new approach, utilizing pseudo-Zernike moments, is introduced to retrieve the FFCF dynamics of each spectral component from complex 2DIR spectra. The results show that this new method not only produces equivalent results to more established methodologies in simple spectra but also successfully extracts the FFCF dynamics of individual component from very congested and unresolved 2DIR spectra. In addition, this new methodology can be used to locate the individual frequency components from those complex spectra. Overall, a new methodology for analyzing the 2D spectra is presented here, which allows us to retrieve previously unattainable spectral features from the 2DIR spectra.},

  abstract = {The present paper reformulates and improves a previously proposed determinant-based second-order multi-reference perturbative formalism. Through a rather simple modification of the energy denominators, this formalism takes into account the interactions between the model space determinants, which are repeated in outer space. The method has been shown to be size-consistent when the model space is a complete active space, which is a severe limit. It is shown here that the completeness of the model space is not necessary to keep this property, provided that the zero-order function satisfies some conditions. For instance, size consistency may be obtained from truncated complete active spaces. It may even be satisfied from Singles and Doubles Configuration Interactions, provided that a coupled electron pair approximation is used in the definition of the model space wave function. The physical content of the method is illustrated by a series of model problems, showing its robustness. A major benefit of the fact that the perturbers are single determinants is the possibility to revise with full flexibility the model-space component of the wave function, i.e., to treat the feedback effect of the dynamic correlation on the valence component of the wave function.},

  abstract = {Contemporary graph learning algorithms are not well-suited for large molecules since they do not consider the hierarchical interactions among the atoms, which are essential to determining the molecular properties of macromolecules. In this work, we propose Multiresolution Graph Transformers (MGT), the first graph transformer architecture that can learn to represent large molecules at multiple scales. MGT can learn to produce representations for the atoms and group them into meaningful functional groups or repeating units. We also introduce Wavelet Positional Encoding (WavePE), a new positional encoding method that can guarantee localization in both spectral and spatial domains. Our proposed model achieves competitive results on three macromolecule datasets consisting of polymers, peptides, and protein-ligand complexes, along with one drug-like molecule dataset. Significantly, our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and achieves chemical accuracy in estimating molecular properties (e.g., highest occupied molecular orbital, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and their gap) calculated by Density Functional Theory in the polymers dataset. Furthermore, the visualizations, including clustering results on macromolecules and low-dimensional spaces of their representations, demonstrate the capability of our methodology in learning to represent long-range and hierarchical structures.

In particular, molecular systems are rigorously projected onto their J = 0 rotational state by an “Eckart spring” that connects two adjacent beads in a ring polymer. Using this procedure, the tunneling splitting can be obtained from thermodynamic integration at just one (sufficiently low) temperature. Converged results are formally identical to the values that would have been obtained by solving the full rovibrational Schrödinger equation on a given Born–Oppenheimer potential energy surface. The new approach is showcased with simulations of hydronium and methanol, which are in good agreement with wavefunction-based calculations and experimental measurements. The method will be of particular use for the study of low-barrier methyl rotations and other floppy modes, where instanton theory is not valid.},

Yalouz et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 157 , 214112 (2022)]. We prove mathematically that the equivalence remains valid when the density matrix is not idempotent anymore, thus allowing for the construction of correlated (one-electron) quantum baths. A density-matrix functional exactification of DMET is derived within the present unified quantum embedding formalism. Numerical examples reveal that the embedding cluster can be quite sensitive to the level of density-matrix functional approximation used for computing the reference density matrix.},

Unfortunately, the most accurate representations require a high dimensional feature mapping, thereby imposing a considerable computational burden on model training and use. We introduce compact yet accurate, linear scaling QML representations based on atomic Gaussian many-body distribution functionals (MBDF) and their derivatives. Weighted density functions of MBDF values are used as global representations that are constant in size, i.e., invariant with respect to the number of atoms. We report predictive performance and training data efficiency that is competitive with state-of-the-art for two diverse datasets of organic molecules, QM9 and QMugs. Generalization capability has been investigated for atomization energies, highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital eigenvalues and gap, internal energies at 0 K, zero point vibrational energies, dipole moment norm, static isotropic polarizability, and heat capacity as encoded in QM9. MBDF based QM9 performance lowers the optimal Pareto front spanned between sampling and training cost to compute node minutes, effectively sampling chemical compound space with chemical accuracy at a sampling rate of ∼ 48 molecules per core second.},

Comparisons with other widely known second-order wave function methods are also reported. Additionally, we calculate the singlet-triplet gap of cycl[3,3,3]azine, a model molecular emitter for thermally activated delayed fluorescence, which has the particularity of having an inverted gap thanks to a substantial contribution from the double excitations.

We apply the entropy production invariance condition to different sets of electrolyte variables and obtain a general set of formulas. We demonstrate the application of these formulas to an electrolyte typical for lithium-ion batteries, 1M lithium hexafluoro-phosphate in a 1:1 wt.\% mixture of ethylene and diethyl carbonates. While simplifications can be introduced, they provide inadequate predictions of conductivity and transport numbers, and we argue that a full matrix of Onsager coefficients is needed for adequate property predictions.

However, the electronic coupling is sensitive to many nuclear degrees of freedom, particularly those involved in intermolecular movements, making its characterization challenging. As a result, dynamic disorder in electron transfer coupling has rarely been investigated, hindering our understanding of charge transport dynamics in complex chemical and biological systems. In this work, we employed molecular dynamic simulations and machine-learning models to study dynamic disorder in the coupling of hole transfer between neighboring ethylene and naphthalene dimer. Our results reveal that low-frequency modes dominate these dynamics, resulting primarily from intermolecular movements such as rotation and translation. Interestingly, we observed an increasing contribution of translational motion as temperature increased. Moreover, we found that coupling is sub-Ohmic in its spectral density character, with cut-off frequencies in the range of 10 2 cm −1 . Machine-learning models allow direct study of dynamics of electronic coupling in charge transport with sufficient ensemble trajectories, providing further new insights into charge transporting dynamics.},

  abstract = {Determining collective variables (CVs) for conformational transitions is crucial to understanding their dynamics and targeting them in enhanced sampling simulations. Often, CVs are proposed based on intuition or prior knowledge of a system. However, the problem of systematically determining a proper reaction coordinate (RC) for a specific process in terms of a set of putative CVs can be achieved using committor analysis (CA). Identifying essential degrees of freedom that govern such transitions using CA remains elusive because of the high dimensionality of the conformational space. Various schemes exist to leverage the power of machine learning (ML) to extract an RC from CA. Here, we extend these studies and compare the ability of 17 different ML schemes to identify accurate RCs associated with conformational transitions. We tested these methods on an alanine dipeptide in vacuum and on a sarcosine dipeptoid in an implicit solvent. Our comparison revealed that the light gradient boosting machine method outperforms other methods. In order to extract key features from the models, we employed Shapley Additive exPlanations analysis and compared its interpretation with the “feature importance” approach. For the alanine dipeptide, our methodology identifies ϕ and θ dihedrals as essential degrees of freedom in the C 7 ax to C 7 eq transition. For the sarcosine dipeptoid system, the dihedrals ψ and ω are the most important for the cis α D to trans α D transition. We further argue that analysis of the full dynamical pathway, and not just endpoint states, is essential for identifying key degrees of freedom governing transitions.},

One strategy to minimize this loss of efficiency at higher luminance is the use of non-uniform or graded guest:host blend ratios within the emissive layer. This work applies a multi-scale modeling framework to elucidate the mechanisms by which a non-uniform blend ratio can change the performance of an OLED. Mobility and exciton data are extracted from a kinetic Monte–Carlo model, which is then coupled to a drift diffusion model for fast sampling of the parameter space. The model is applied to OLEDs with uniform, linear, and stepwise graduations in the blend ratio in the emissive layer. The distribution of the guests in the film was found to affect the mobility of the charge carriers, and it was determined that having a graduated guest profile broadened the recombination zone, leading to a reduction in second order annihilation rates. That is, there was a reduction in triplet–triplet and triplet-polaron annihilation. Reducing triplet–triplet and triplet-polaron annihilation would lead to an improvement in device efficiency.},

These calculations are computationally demanding and have asymptotic cubic scaling complexity with the number of electrons. Large-scale matrix eigenvalue problems arising from the discretization of the Kohn–Sham DFT equations employing a systematically convergent basis traditionally rely on iterative orthogonal projection methods, which are shown to be computationally efficient and scalable on massively parallel computing architectures. However, as the size of the material system increases, these methods are known to incur dominant computational costs through the Rayleigh–Ritz projection step of the discretized Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian matrix and the subsequent subspace diagonalization of the projected matrix. This work explores the potential of polynomial expansion approaches based on recursive Fermi-operator expansion as an alternative to the subspace diagonalization of the projected Hamiltonian matrix to reduce the computational cost. Subsequently, we perform a detailed comparison of various recursive polynomial expansion approaches to the traditional approach of explicit diagonalization on both multi-node central processing unit and graphics processing unit architectures and assess their relative performance in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, scaling behavior, and energy efficiency.},

  abstract = {In a viscoelastic environment, the diffusion of a particle becomes non-Markovian due to the memory effect. An open question concerns quantitatively explaining how self-propulsion particles with directional memory diffuse in such a medium. Based on simulations and analytic theory, we address this issue with active viscoelastic systems where an active particle is connected with multiple semiflexible filaments. Our Langevin dynamics simulations show that the active cross-linker displays superdiffusive and subdiffusive athermal motion with a time-dependent anomalous exponent α . In such viscoelastic feedback, the active particle always exhibits superdiffusion with α = 3/2 at times shorter than the self-propulsion time ( τ A ). At times greater than τ A , the subdiffusive motion emerges with α bounded between 1/2 and 3/4. Remarkably, active subdiffusion is reinforced as the active propulsion (Pe) is more vigorous. In the high Pe limit, athermal fluctuation in the stiff filament eventually leads to α = 1/2, which can be misinterpreted with the thermal Rouse motion in a flexible chain. We demonstrate that the motion of active particles cross-linking a network of semiflexible filaments can be governed by a fractional Langevin equation combined with fractional Gaussian noise and an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck noise. We analytically derive the velocity autocorrelation function and mean-squared displacement of the model, explaining their scaling relations as well as the prefactors. We find that there exist the threshold Pe (Pe ∗ ) and crossover times ( τ ∗ and τ † ) above which active viscoelastic dynamics emerge on timescales of τ ∗ ≲ t ≲ τ † . Our study may provide theoretical insight into various nonequilibrium active dynamics in intracellular viscoelastic environments.},

This problem is particularly acute where hyperparameters have no intuitive physical interpretation and where the corresponding optimization space is large. Here, we describe an openly available Python package that facilitates hyperparameter optimization across different ML potential fitting frameworks. We discuss methodological aspects relating to the optimization itself and to the selection of validation data, and we show example applications.

  abstract = {Machine learning interatomic potentials have emerged as a powerful tool for bypassing the spatiotemporal limitations of ab initio simulations, but major challenges remain in their efficient parameterization. We present AL4GAP, an ensemble active learning software workflow for generating multicomposition Gaussian approximation potentials (GAP) for arbitrary molten salt mixtures. The workflow capabilities include: (1) setting up user-defined combinatorial chemical spaces of charge neutral mixtures of arbitrary molten mixtures spanning 11 cations (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and two heavy species, Nd, and Th) and 4 anions (F, Cl, Br, and I), (2) configurational sampling using low-cost empirical parameterizations, (3) active learning for down-selecting configurational samples for single point density functional theory calculations at the level of Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) exchange-correlation functional, and (4) Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning of two-body and many-body GAP models. We apply the AL4GAP workflow to showcase high throughput generation of five independent GAP models for multicomposition binary-mixture melts, each of increasing complexity with respect to charge valency and electronic structure, namely: LiCl–KCl, NaCl–CaCl 2 , KCl–NdCl 3 , CaCl 2 –NdCl 3 , and KCl–ThCl 4 . Our results indicate that GAP models can accurately predict structure for diverse molten salt mixture with density functional theory (DFT)-SCAN accuracy, capturing the intermediate range ordering characteristic of the multivalent cationic melts.},

  abstract = {Tensor algebra operations such as contractions in computational chemistry consume a significant fraction of the computing time on large-scale computing platforms. The widespread use of tensor contractions between large multi-dimensional tensors in describing electronic structure theory has motivated the development of multiple tensor algebra frameworks targeting heterogeneous computing platforms. In this paper, we present Tensor Algebra for Many-body Methods (TAMM), a framework for productive and performance-portable development of scalable computational chemistry methods. TAMM decouples the specification of the computation from the execution of these operations on available high-performance computing systems. With this design choice, the scientific application developers (domain scientists) can focus on the algorithmic requirements using the tensor algebra interface provided by TAMM, whereas high-performance computing developers can direct their attention to various optimizations on the underlying constructs, such as efficient data distribution, optimized scheduling algorithms, and efficient use of intra-node resources (e.g., graphics processing units). The modular structure of TAMM allows it to support different hardware architectures and incorporate new algorithmic advances. We describe the TAMM framework and our approach to the sustainable development of scalable ground- and excited-state electronic structure methods. We present case studies highlighting the ease of use, including the performance and productivity gains compared to other frameworks.},

  abstract = {Inkjet-printed micro-patterns on hydrophobic surfaces have promising applications in the fabrication of microscale devices such as organic thin-film transistors. The low wettability of the surface prevents the inkjet-printed droplets from spreading, connecting to each other, and forming a pattern. Consequently, it is challenging to form micro-patterns on surfaces with low wettability. Here, we propose a sequential printing and drying method to form micro-patterns and control their shape. The first set of droplets is inkjet-printed at a certain spacing and dried. The second set of droplets is printed between these dry anchors on the surface with low wettability. As a result, a stable bridge on the surface with low wettability forms. This printing method is extended to more complicated shapes such as triangles. By implementing an energy minimization technique, a simple model was devised to predict the shape of the inkjet-printed micro-patterns while confirming that their equilibrium shape is mainly governed by surface tension forces. The gradient descent method was utilized with parametric boundaries to emulate droplet pinning and wettability of the anchors and to prevent convergence issues from occurring in the simulations. Finally, the energy minimization based simulations were used to predict the required ink to produce dry lines and triangles with smooth edges.},

The envelope function approach is used to describe semiclassical electron transfer in a tight-binding model of DNA at half filling in the presence of intrinsic spin–orbit coupling. Spin-phonon coupling arises from the orbital-configuration dependence of the spin–orbit interaction. We find spin-phonon coupling only for the acoustic modes, while the optical modes exhibit electron–phonon interaction without coupling to spin. We derive an effective Hamiltonian whose eigenstates carry spin currents that are protected by spin-inactive stretching optical modes. As optical phonons interact more strongly than acoustic phonons, side buckling and tilting optical base modes will be more strongly associated with decoherence, which allows for the two terminal spin filtering effects found in CISS.},

Here, we introduce a simple model system of a straight cylindrical free-electron wire containing a helical string of atomic scattering centers with spin–orbit interaction. The advantage of this simple model is that it allows deriving analytical expressions for the spin scattering rates, such that the origin of the effect can be easily followed. We find that spin-selective scattering can be viewed as resulting from the constructive interference of partial waves scattered by the spin–orbit terms. We demonstrate that forward scattering rates are independent of spin, while back scattering is spin dependent over wide windows of energy. Although the model does not represent the full details of electron transmission through chiral molecules, it clearly reveals a mechanism that could operate in chiral systems.},

E 95 , 060602 (2017)], which takes into account the structural interactions between ions through a bilinear form over the gradients of local ionic concentrations in the grand thermodynamic potential, as well as their steric interactions through the lattice gas model. The structural interactions may describe the effects of the molecular structure of ions at a phenomenological level. For example, these effects include steric effects due to non-spherical shapes of ions, their conformational lability, and solvent effects. In addition, we explore their specific interactions with the pore walls by incorporating external attractive potentials. Our primary focus is on observing the behavior of ionic concentration profiles and the disjoining pressure as the pore width changes. By starting with the local mechanical equilibrium condition, we derive a general expression for the disjoining pressure. Our findings indicate that considering the structural interactions of ions leads to a pronounced minimum on the disjoining pressure profiles at small pore widths. We attribute this minimum to the formation of electric double layers on the electrified surfaces of the pore. In addition, our results demonstrate that the inclusion of the attractive interactions of ions with the pore walls enhances this minimum and shifts it to smaller pore thicknesses. Our theoretical discoveries may be useful for those involved in supercapacitor electrochemical engineering, particularly when working with porous electrodes that have been infused with concentrated electrolyte solutions.},

While it offers various exciting phenomena to investigate, it is simultaneously challenging to make stable bio-spinterfaces as biomolecules are sensitive to many factors that it encounters during thin-film growth to device fabrication. The chirality-induced spin-selectivity effect is an exciting discovery, demonstrating an understanding that a specific electron’s spin (either up or down) passes through a chiral molecule. The present work utilizes Ustilago maydis Rvb2 protein, an ATP-dependent DNA helicase (also known as Reptin), to fabricate bio-spintronic devices to investigate spin-selective electron transport through the protein. Ferromagnetic materials are well-known for exhibiting spin-polarization, which many chiral and biomolecules can mimic. We report herein spin-selective electron transmission through Rvb2 that exhibits 30\% spin polarization at a low bias (+0.5 V) in a device configuration, Ni/Rvb2 protein/indium tin oxide measured under two different magnetic configurations. Our findings demonstrate that biomolecules can be put in circuit components without any expensive vacuum deposition for the top contact.

GO exists as lamellar structures in these applications and, thus, it urges to enhance interface interaction to prevent interfacial failure. This study explores the adhesion of GO with and without intercalated water utilizing steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. We find the interfacial adhesion energy ( γ ) depends on the synergistic effect of the types of functional groups, the degree of oxidation ( c ), and water content ( wt ). The intercalated monolayer water confined within GO flakes can improve the γ by more than 50\% whereas the interlayer spacing is enlarged. The enhancement of adhesion is from the cooperative hydrogen bonding bridges between confined water and functional group on GO. Furthermore, the optimal water content wt = 20\% and oxidation degree c = 20\% are obtained. Our findings provide an experimentally available way to improve interlayer adhesion through molecular intercalation, which opens the possibility of high-performance laminate nanomaterial-based films for versatile applications.},

However, little is known about the structures of the a-TiO 2 surface and aqueous interface, particularly at the microscopic level. In this work, we construct a model of the a-TiO 2 surface via a cut-melt-and-quench procedure based on molecular dynamics simulations with deep neural network potentials (DPs) trained on density functional theory data. After interfacing the a-TiO 2 surface with water, we investigate the structure and dynamics of the resulting system using a combination of DP-based molecular dynamics (DPMD) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Both AIMD and DPMD simulations reveal that the distribution of water on the a-TiO 2 surface lacks distinct layers normally found at the aqueous interface of crystalline TiO 2 , leading to an ∼10 times faster diffusion of water at the interface. Bridging hydroxyls (Ti 2 –O b H) resulting from water dissociation decay several times more slowly than terminal hydroxyls (Ti–O w H) due to fast Ti–O w H 2 → Ti–O w H proton exchange events. These results provide a basis for a detailed understanding of the properties of a-TiO 2 in electrochemical environments. Moreover, the procedure of generating the a-TiO 2 -interface employed here is generally applicable to studying the aqueous interfaces of amorphous metal oxides.},

Compared with simple antiperovskite, Ruddlesden–Popper (R–P) antiperovskite is an updated material, which is not only more stable but also reported to significantly enhance conductivity when added to simple antiperovskite. However, systematic theoretical research on R–P antiperovskite is scarce, hindering its further development. In this study, the recently reported easily synthesized R–P antiperovskite LiBr(Li 2 OHBr) 2 is calculated for the first time. Comparative calculations were conducted on the transport performance, thermodynamic properties, and mechanical properties of H-rich LiBr(Li 2 OHBr) 2 and H-free LiBr(Li 3 OBr) 2 . Our results indicate that due to the presence of protons, LiBr(Li 2 OHBr) 2 is more prone to defects, and synthesizing more LiBr Schottky defects can improve its Li-ion conductivity. Young’s modulus of the LiBr(Li 2 OHBr) 2 is as low as 30.61 GPa, which is beneficial for its application as a sintering aid. However, the calculated Pugh’s ratio ( B / G ) of 1.28 and 1.50, respectively, indicates that R–P antiperovskites LiBr(Li 2 OHBr) 2 and LiBr(Li 3 OBr) 2 exhibit mechanical brittleness, which is not conducive to its application as solid electrolytes. Through quasi-harmonic approximation, we found that the linear thermal expansion coefficient of LiBr(Li 2 OHBr) 2 is 2.07 × 10 −5 K −1 , which is more advantageous in matching electrodes than LiBr(Li 3 OBr) 2 and even simple antiperovskites. Overall, our research provides comprehensive insights into the practical application of R–P antiperovskite in solid-state batteries.},

The present study aims to understand the formation and stability of wetting films during the evaporation of volatile liquid drops on surfaces with a micro-pattern of triangular posts arranged in a rectangular lattice. Depending on the density and aspect ratio of the posts, we observe either spherical-cap shaped drops with a mobile three-phase contact line or the formation of circular or angular drops with a pinned three-phase contact line. Drops of the latter class eventually evolve into a liquid film extending to the initial footprint of the drop and a shrinking cap-shaped drop sitting on the film. The drop evolution is controlled by the density and aspect ratio of the posts, while no influence of the orientation of the triangular posts on the contact line mobility becomes evident. Our experiments corroborate previous results of systematic numerical energy minimization, predicting that conditions for a spontaneous retraction of a wicking liquid film depend weakly on the orientation of the film edge relative to the micro-pattern.},

During the shape reconstruction of Pd@Ag nanoalloys, concurrent surface restructuring of the (100) facet and internal multi-twinned phase change are observed with collaborative displacive characters. The presence of vacancies can influence the final product and reconstructing rate of Pd@Ag core–shell nanoalloys. The Ag outward diffusion on Ag@Pd nanoalloys is more pronounced in Ih geometry compared to Oh geometry and can be further accelerated by the Oh to Ih deformation. The deformation of single-crystalline Pd@Ag nanoalloys is characterized by a displacive transformation involving the collaborative displacement of a large number of atoms, distinguishing it from the diffusion-coupled transformation of Ag@Pd nanoalloys.},

  abstract = {Solid–liquid friction plays a key role in nanofluidic systems. Following the pioneering work of Bocquet and Barrat, who proposed to extract the friction coefficient (FC) from the plateau of the Green–Kubo (GK) integral of the solid–liquid shear force autocorrelation, the so-called plateau problem has been identified when applying the method to finite-sized molecular dynamics simulations, e.g., with a liquid confined between parallel solid walls. A variety of approaches have been developed to overcome this problem. Here, we propose another method that is easy to implement, makes no assumptions about the time dependence of the friction kernel, does not require the hydrodynamic system width as an input, and is applicable to a wide range of interfaces. In this method, the FC is evaluated by fitting the GK integral for the timescale range where it slowly decays with time. The fitting function was derived based on an analytical solution of the hydrodynamics equations [Oga et al. , Phys. Rev. Res. 3 , L032019 (2021)], assuming that the timescales related to the friction kernel and the bulk viscous dissipation can be separated. By comparing the results with those of other GK-based methods and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, we show that the FC is extracted with excellent accuracy by the present method, even in wettability regimes where other GK-based methods suffer from the plateau problem. Finally, the method is also applicable to grooved solid walls, where the GK integral displays complex behavior at short times.},

  abstract = {Tritium self-sufficiency in fusion nuclear reactors will be based on the neutron capture by lithium in the so-called breeding blankets of the reactor, a nuclear reaction that will produce helium along with tritium. The low solubility of helium in liquid metals could cause the eventual formation of helium bubbles, which may have a negative impact on the performance of the breeding blanket in a way that has yet to be fully understood. In this work, we provide deep insight into the behavior of lithium and helium mixtures at experimentally operating conditions (800 K and pressures between 1 and 100 bars) using a microscopic model suitable to describe the interactions between helium and lithium at the atomic level, in excellent agreement with available experimental data. The simulations predict the formation of helium bubbles with radii around 10 Å at ambient pressure with surface tension values in the range of 0.6–1.0 N/m. We also report the cohesive energies of helium and the work of formation of the cluster of atoms, as well as a quantitative estimation of the Hildebrand and Kumar cohesion parameters. Our results indicate that the segregation between He and Li atoms is strong, and once a bubble is formed, it never dissociates.},

  abstract = {We calculated the one- (OPA) and two-photon absorption (TPA) spectra of two large water-soluble stilbene derivatives presenting TPA cross sections of about 400 GM. However, the reported experimental TPA spectra present a spectral gap region, and a theoretical study of these promising molecules seems now timely and relevant. These molecules are composed of 200 or more atoms, becoming a challenge to obtain the TPA spectra even using density functional theory at the time-dependent quadratic response formalism. Thus, both OPA and TPA were also calculated using the INDO-S semi-empirical method. We used explicit solvent molecules using the sequential-quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics to include the solvent effects. Our results show that different transitions are participating in the OPA and TPA processes and that exchange–correlation functionals, including larger Hartree–Fock contributions, provide a better description of the OPA spectra; however, the opposite trend is observed on the TPA spectra. Alternatively, INDO-S/CISD, including contributions from single and double excitations, systematically describes both OPA and TPA bands with similar shifts and better reproduces the relative intensities of the two TPA bands compared to the experimental ones. The OPA spectra are characterized by a Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital-Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO–LUMO) excitation, while the low-energy TPA band is ascribed to a single transition encompassing the (HOMO-1)–LUMO and HOMO–(LUMO+1) excitations and the high-energy one is a combination of several transitions. Thus, although more studies are required to better assess the capability of the INDO-S/CISD method in describing the TPA spectra of large molecules, our results corroborate that it is a promising alternative.},

The translational energy distributions and the branching ratios of the O( 3 P J =2,1,0 ) spin–orbit products at six photolysis wavelengths have been acquired.

The branching ratios of O( 3 P J =2,1,0 ) products are almost similar at most wavelengths, except at 194.8 nm.

Key to this continuing success story has been the kinetic equation formulated by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872, which provides the theoretical foundations necessary for analyzing such highly non-equilibrium situations. However, as discussed here, the full potential of Boltzmann’s equation has been realized only in the past 50 years or so, with modern computing power and analytical techniques facilitating accurate solutions for various types of charged particles (ions, electrons, positrons, and muons) in gases. Our example of thermalization of electrons in xenon gas highlights the need for such accurate methods—the traditional Lorentz approximation is shown to be hopelessly inadequate. We then discuss the emerging role of Boltzmann’s equation in determining cross sections by inverting measured swarm experiment transport coefficient data using machine learning with artificial neural networks.},

The rigorous coupled cluster single, double, and triple excitations/cc-pVTZ level of theory was used to fully optimize all reaction species and transition states, thus, removing some substantial flaws in reference geometries existing in the literature. The vital i -propylperoxy radical ( MIN1 ) and its concerted elimination transition state ( TS1 ) were found 34.8 and 4.4 kcal mol −1 below the reactants, respectively. Two β-hydrogen transfer transition states ( TS2 , TS2 ′) lie above the reactants by (1.4, 2.5) kcal mol −1 and display large Born–Oppenheimer diagonal corrections indicative of nearby surface crossings. An α -hydrogen transfer transition state ( TS5 ) is discovered 5.7 kcal mol −1 above the reactants that bifurcates into equivalent α-peroxy radical hanging wells ( MIN3 ) prior to a highly exothermic dissociation into acetone + OH. The reverse TS5 → MIN1 intrinsic reaction path also displays fascinating features, including another bifurcation and a conical intersection of potential energy surfaces. An exhaustive conformational search of two hydroperoxypropyl (QOOH) intermediates ( MIN2 and MIN3 ) of the i -propyl + O 2 system located nine rotamers within 0.9 kcal mol −1 of the corresponding lowest-energy minima.},

  abstract = {Perusing the non-radiative processes requires a reliable prediction of non-adiabatic couplings (NACs) describing the interaction of two Born–Oppenheimer surfaces. In this regard, the development of appropriate and affordable theoretical methods that accurately account for the NAC terms between different excited-states is desirable. In this work, we develop and validate several variants of the optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functionals (OT-RSHs) for investigating NACs and related properties, such as excited states energy gaps and NAC forces, within the time-dependent density functional theory framework. Particular attention is paid to the influence of the underlying density functional approximations (DFAs), the short- and long-range Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange contributions, and the range-separation parameter. Considering several radical cations and sodium-doped ammonia clusters with the available reference data for the NACs and related quantities as the working models, we have evaluated the applicability and accountability of the proposed OT-RSHs. The obtained results unveil that any combination of the ingredients in the proposed models is not proper for describing the NACs, but a particular compromise among the involved parameters is needed to achieve reliable accuracy. Scrutinizing the results of our developed methods, the OT-RSHs based on the PBEPW91, BPW91, and PBE exchange and correlation DFAs, including about 30\% HF exchange at the short-range regime, appeared to be the best performers. We also find that the newly developed OT-RSHs with correct asymptotic exchange-correlation potential have superior performances as compared to their standard counterparts with the default parameters and many earlier hybrids with both fixed and interelectronic distance-dependent HF exchange. The recommended OT-RSHs in this study can hopefully be applicable as computationally efficient alternatives to the expensive wave function-based methods for the systems prone to non-adiabatic properties as well as to screen out the novel candidates prior to their challenging synthesis.},

  abstract = {The equilibrium structure of selenophenol has been investigated using rotational spectroscopy and high-level quantum mechanical calculations, offering electronic and structural insight into the scarcely studied selenium compounds. The jet-cooled broadband microwave spectrum was measured in the 2–8 GHz cm-wave region using broadband (chirped-pulse) fast-passage techniques. Additional measurements up to 18 GHz used narrow-band impulse excitation. Spectral signatures were obtained for six isotopic species of selenium ( 80 Se, 78 Se, 76 Se, 82 Se, 77 Se, and 74 Se), together with different monosubstituted 13 C species. The (unsplit) rotational transitions associated with the non-inverting μ a -dipole selection rules could be partially reproduced with a semirigid rotor model. However, the internal rotation barrier of the selenol group splits the vibrational ground state into two subtorsional levels, doubling the dipole-inverting μ b transitions. The simulation of the double-minimum internal rotation gives a very low barrier height (B3PW91: 42 cm −1 ), much smaller than for thiophenol (277 cm −1 ). A monodimensional Hamiltonian then predicts a huge vibrational separation of 72.2 GHz, justifying the non-observation of μ b transitions in our frequency range. The experimental rotational parameters were compared with different MP2 and density functional theory calculations. The equilibrium structure was determined using several high-level ab initio calculations. A final Born–Oppenheimer ( ⁠ r e BO ⁠ ) structure was obtained at the coupled-cluster CCSD(T)_ae/cc-wCVTZ level of theory, including small corrections for the wCVTZ → wCVQZ basis set enlargement calculated at the MP2 level. The mass-dependent method with predicates was used to produce an alternative r m ( 2 ) structure. The comparison between the two methods confirms the high accuracy of the r e BO structure and offers information on other chalcogen-containing molecules.},

  abstract = {The quantum adiabatic method, which maintains populations in their instantaneous eigenstates throughout the state evolution, is an established and often a preferred choice for state preparation and manipulation. Although it minimizes the driving cost significantly, its slow speed is a severe limitation in noisy intermediate-scale quantum era technologies. Since adiabatic paths are extensive in many physical processes, it is of broader interest to achieve adiabaticity at a much faster rate. Shortcuts to adiabaticity techniques, which overcome the slow adiabatic process by driving the system faster through non-adiabatic paths, have seen increased attention recently. The extraordinarily long lifetime of the long-lived singlet states (LLS) in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), established over the past decade, has opened several important applications ranging from spectroscopy to biomedical imaging. Various methods, including adiabatic methods, are already being used to prepare LLS. In this article, we report the use of counterdiabatic driving (CD) to speed up LLS preparation with faster drives. Using NMR experiments, we show that CD can give stronger LLS order in shorter durations than conventional adiabatic driving.},

The average experimental trajectories of a probe bead compare well with the theoretical computation, illustrating the role of viscous coupling and setting timescales for probe bead relaxation. The findings also provide direct experimental corroborations of hydrodynamic coupling at large, micrometer spatial scales and long, millisecond timescales, of relevance to, e.g., microfluidic device design and hydrodynamic-assisted colloidal assembly, improving the capability of optical tweezers, and understanding the coupling between micrometer-scale objects within a living cell.},

  abstract = {The nature of an atom in a bonded structure—such as in molecules, in nanoparticles, or in solids, at surfaces or interfaces—depends on its local atomic environment. In atomic-scale modeling and simulation, identifying groups of atoms with equivalent environments is a frequent task, to gain an understanding of the material function, to interpret experimental results, or to simply restrict demanding first-principles calculations. However, while routine, this task can often be challenging for complex molecules or non-ideal materials with breaks in symmetries or long-range order. To automatize this task, we here present a general machine-learning framework to identify groups of (nearly) equivalent atoms. The initial classification rests on the representation of the local atomic environment through a high-dimensional smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) vector. Recognizing that not least thermal vibrations may lead to deviations from ideal positions, we then achieve a fuzzy classification by mean-shift clustering within a low-dimensional embedded representation of the SOAP points as obtained through multidimensional scaling. The performance of this classification framework is demonstrated for simple aromatic molecules and crystalline Pd surface examples.},

In the stochastic representation, the kinetic energy representing the self-interaction of momentum is reduced to a linear term of momentum. As such, the quantum evolution operator factorizes into two contributions due to the momentum and the potential, respectively. The exact quantum propagator thereby becomes an expectation of the stochastic one in which the amplitude results from the potential with a fluctuating position: The particle moves with a constant velocity, subjected to a complex Brownian motion. We demonstrate that the stochastic Schrödinger equation can be feasibly used to derive the quantum propagators for the linear potential and the harmonic oscillator system.

  abstract = {The ability to predict transport properties of fluids, such as the self-diffusion coefficient and viscosity, has been an ongoing effort in the field of molecular modeling. While there are theoretical approaches to predict the transport properties of simple systems, they are typically applied in the dilute gas regime and are not directly applicable to more complex systems. Other attempts to predict transport properties are performed by fitting available experimental or molecular simulation data to empirical or semi-empirical correlations. Recently, there have been attempts to improve the accuracy of these fittings through the use of Machine-Learning (ML) methods. In this work, the application of ML algorithms to represent the transport properties of systems comprising spherical particles interacting via the Mie potential is investigated. To this end, the self-diffusion coefficient and shear viscosity of 54 potentials are obtained at different regions of the fluid-phase diagram. This data set is used together with three ML algorithms, namely, k -Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Symbolic Regression (SR), to find correlations between the parameters of each potential and the transport properties at different densities and temperatures. It is shown that ANN and KNN perform to a similar extent, followed by SR, which exhibits larger deviations. Finally, the application of the three ML models to predict the self-diffusion coefficient of small molecular systems, such as krypton, methane, and carbon dioxide, is demonstrated using molecular parameters derived from the so-called SAFT-VR Mie equation of state [T. Lafitte et al. J. Chem. Phys. 139 , 154504 (2013)] and available experimental vapor–liquid coexistence data.},

For the computed IR spectra in the fingerprint region, the computations for para -chloro-phenol in water are in good qualitative agreement with experiment carried out in CCl 4 . Moreover, relative intensities are largely consistent with experimental findings. The barrier for rotation of the –OH group increases from ∼ 3.5 kcal/mol in the gas phase to ∼ 4.1 kcal/mol from simulations in water due to favorable H-bonding interactions of the –OH group with surrounding water molecules.},

  abstract = {We present a time-dependent variational method to learn the mechanisms of equilibrium reactive processes and efficiently evaluate their rates within a transition path ensemble. This approach builds off of the variational path sampling methodology by approximating the time-dependent commitment probability within a neural network ansatz. The reaction mechanisms inferred through this approach are elucidated by a novel decomposition of the rate in terms of the components of a stochastic path action conditioned on a transition. This decomposition affords an ability to resolve the typical contribution of each reactive mode and their couplings to the rare event. The associated rate evaluation is variational and systematically improvable through the development of a cumulant expansion. We demonstrate this method in both over- and under-damped stochastic equations of motion, in low-dimensional model systems, and in the isomerization of a solvated alanine dipeptide. In all examples, we find that we can obtain quantitatively accurate estimates of the rates of the reactive events with minimal trajectory statistics and gain unique insights into transitions through the analysis of their commitment probability.},

In this work, we discuss a type of structure generation, which locally optimizes structures in complementary energy (CE) landscapes. These landscapes are formulated temporarily during the searches as machine learned potentials (MLPs) using local atomistic environments sampled from collected data. The CE landscapes are deliberately incomplete MLPs that rather than mimicking every aspect of the true PES are sought to become much smoother, having only a few local minima. This means that local optimization in the CE landscapes may facilitate the identification of new funnels in the true PES. We discuss how to construct the CE landscapes and we test their influence on the global optimization of a reduced rutile SnO 2 (110)-(4  × 1) surface and an olivine (Mg 2 SiO 4 ) 4 cluster for which we report a new global minimum energy structure.},

  abstract = {The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that controls the folding and activation of client proteins using the free energy of ATP hydrolysis. The Hsp90 active site is in its N-terminal domain (NTD). Our goal is to characterize the dynamics of NTD using an autoencoder-learned collective variable (CV) in conjunction with adaptive biasing force Langevin dynamics. Using dihedral analysis, we cluster all available experimental Hsp90 NTD structures into distinct native states. We then perform unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to construct a dataset that represents each state and use this dataset to train an autoencoder. Two autoencoder architectures are considered, with one and two hidden layers, respectively, and bottlenecks of dimension k ranging from 1 to 10. We demonstrate that the addition of an extra hidden layer does not significantly improve the performance, while it leads to complicated CVs that increase the computational cost of biased MD calculations. In addition, a two-dimensional (2D) bottleneck can provide enough information of the different states, while the optimal bottleneck dimension is five. For the 2D bottleneck, the 2D CV is directly used in biased MD simulations. For the five-dimensional (5D) bottleneck, we perform an analysis of the latent CV space and identify the pair of CV coordinates that best separates the states of Hsp90. Interestingly, selecting a 2D CV out of the 5D CV space leads to better results than directly learning a 2D CV and allows observation of transitions between native states when running free energy biased dynamics.},

  abstract = {Spin crossover (SCO) complexes, which exhibit changes in spin state in response to external stimuli, have applications in molecular electronics and are challenging materials for computational design. We curate a dataset of 95 Fe(II) SCO complexes (SCO-95) from the Cambridge Structural Database that have available low- and high-temperature crystal structures and, in most cases, confirmed experimental spin transition temperatures (T 1/2 ). We study these complexes using density functional theory (DFT) with 30 functionals spanning across multiple rungs of “Jacob’s ladder” to understand the effect of exchange–correlation functional on electronic and Gibbs free energies associated with spin crossover. We specifically assess the effect of varying the Hartree–Fock exchange fraction ( a HF ) in structures and properties within the B3LYP family of functionals. We identify three best-performing functionals, a modified version of B3LYP ( a HF = 0.10), M06-L, and TPSSh, that accurately predict SCO behavior for the majority of the complexes. While M06-L performs well, MN15-L, a more recently developed Minnesota functional, fails to predict SCO behavior for all complexes, which could be the result of differences in datasets used for parametrization of M06-L and MN15-L and also the increased number of parameters for MN15-L. Contrary to observations from prior studies, double-hybrids with higher a HF values are found to strongly stabilize high-spin states and therefore exhibit poor performance in predicting SCO behavior. Computationally predicted T 1/2 values are consistent among the three functionals but show limited correlation to experimentally reported T 1/2 values. These failures are attributed to the lack of crystal packing effects and counter-anions in the DFT calculations that would be needed to account for phenomena such as hysteresis and two-step SCO behavior. The SCO-95 set thus presents opportunities for method development, both in terms of increasing model complexity and method fidelity.},

We present new methods that allow one to accurately determine the brightness and diffusivity of individual molecule species from the photon arrival times of selected bursts. We derive analytical expressions for the distribution of inter-photon times (with and without burst selection), the distribution of the number of photons in a burst, and the distribution of photons in a burst with recorded arrival times. The theory accurately treats the bias introduced due to the burst selection criteria. We use a Maximum Likelihood (ML) method to find the molecule’s photon count rate and diffusion coefficient from three kinds of data, i.e., the bursts of photons with recorded arrival times (burstML), inter-photon times in bursts (iptML), and the numbers of photon counts in a burst (pcML). The performance of these new methods is tested on simulated photon trajectories and on an experimental system, the fluorophore Atto 488.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) is an extremely powerful, highly effective, and widely used approach to understanding the nature of chemical processes in atomic details for proteins. The accuracy of results from MD simulations is highly dependent on force fields. Currently, molecular mechanical (MM) force fields are mainly utilized in MD simulations because of their low computational cost. Quantum mechanical (QM) calculation has high accuracy, but it is exceedingly time consuming for protein simulations. Machine learning (ML) provides the capability for generating accurate potential at the QM level without increasing much computational effort for specific systems that can be studied at the QM level. However, the construction of general machine learned force fields, needed for broad applications and large and complex systems, is still challenging. Here, general and transferable neural network (NN) force fields based on CHARMM force fields, named CHARMM-NN, are constructed for proteins by training NN models on 27 fragments partitioned from the residue-based systematic molecular fragmentation (rSMF) method. The NN for each fragment is based on atom types and uses new input features that are similar to MM inputs, including bonds, angles, dihedrals, and non-bonded terms, which enhance the compatibility of CHARMM-NN to MM MD and enable the implementation of CHARMM-NN force fields in different MD programs. While the main part of the energy of the protein is based on rSMF and NN, the nonbonded interactions between the fragments and with water are taken from the CHARMM force field through mechanical embedding. The validations of the method for dipeptides on geometric data, relative potential energies, and structural reorganization energies demonstrate that the CHARMM-NN local minima on the potential energy surface are very accurate approximations to QM, showing the success of CHARMM-NN for bonded interactions. However, the MD simulations on peptides and proteins indicate that more accurate methods to represent protein–water interactions in fragments and non-bonded interactions between fragments should be considered in the future improvement of CHARMM-NN, which can increase the accuracy of approximation beyond the current mechanical embedding QM/MM level.},

The pros and cons of these approaches are benchmarked using both a set of small molecules for which very accurate reference data are available and the challenging case of increasingly extended push–pull oligomer chains.

  abstract = {Rotational circular dichroism (RCD) has not been observed yet, but it is expected to deliver information about chiral molecules useful in many branches of chemistry. In the past, rather weak RCD intensities were predicted for model diamagnetic molecules and a limited number of rotational transitions. Here, we review quantum-mechanical foundations and simulate entire spectral profiles, including larger molecules, open-shell molecular radicals, and high-momentum rotational bands. Contribution of the electric quadrupolar moment was considered, but it turned out that it does not contribute to field-free RCD. Two conformers of a model dipeptide provided clearly distinct spectra. The dissymmetry Kuhn parameter g K predicted for the diamagnetic molecules even for high-J transitions rarely exceeded 10 −5 , and the simulated RCD spectra were often biased to one sign. In the radicals, the coupling of the rotational angular momentum with the spin for some transitions raised g K to about 10 −2 , and the RCD pattern was more conservative. In the resultant spectra, many transitions had negligible intensities due to small populations of the involved states, and a convolution with a spectral function made the typical RCD/absorption ratios about 100-times smaller ( g K ∼ 10 −4 ). This is still comparable with values typical for electronic or vibrational circular dichroism, and paramagnetic RCD is thus likely to be measurable relatively easily.},

  abstract = {Exploring mesoscopic physical phenomena has always been a challenge for brute-force all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Although recent advances in computing hardware have improved the accessible length scales, reaching mesoscopic timescales is still a significant bottleneck. Coarse-graining of all-atom models allows robust investigation of mesoscale physics with a reduced spatial and temporal resolution but preserves desired structural features of molecules, unlike continuum-based methods. Here, we present a hybrid bond-order coarse-grained forcefield (HyCG) for modeling mesoscale aggregation phenomena in liquid–liquid mixtures. The intuitive hybrid functional form of the potential offers interpretability to our model, unlike many machine learning based interatomic potentials. We parameterize the potential with the continuous action Monte Carlo Tree Search (cMCTS) algorithm, a reinforcement learning (RL) based global optimizing scheme, using training data from all-atom simulations. The resulting RL-HyCG correctly describes mesoscale critical fluctuations in binary liquid–liquid extraction systems. cMCTS, the RL algorithm, accurately captures the mean behavior of various geometrical properties of the molecule of interest, which were excluded from the training set. The developed potential model along with the RL-based training workflow could be applied to explore a variety of other mesoscale physical phenomena that are typically inaccessible to all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.},

The method proposed is able to correctly characterize resonance Raman scattering and enhancement, including the description of overtones and combination bands.

This framework states that Markovian dynamic equations governing the evolution of coarse-grained variables have a universal structure that ensures energy conservation (first law) and entropy increase (second law). However, the presence of external time-dependent forces can break the energy conservation law, requiring modifications to the framework’s structure. To address this issue, we start from a rigorous and exact transport equation for the average of a set of coarse-grained variables derived from a projection operator technique in the presence of external forces. Under the Markovian approximation, this approach provides the statistical mechanics underpinning of the generic framework under external forcing conditions. By doing so, we can account for the effects of external forcing on the system’s evolution while ensuring thermodynamic consistency.},

  abstract = {Excited states are the key species in photocatalysis, while the critical parameters that govern their applications are (i) excitation energy, (ii) accessibility, and (iii) lifetime. However, in molecular transition metal-based photosensitizers, there is a design tension between the creation of long-lived excited (triplet), e.g., metal-to-ligand charge transfer ( 3 MLCT) states and the population of such states. Long-lived triplet states have low spin–orbit coupling (SOC) and hence their population is low. Thus, a long-lived triplet state can be populated but inefficiently. If the SOC is increased, the triplet state population efficiency is improved—coming at the cost of decreasing the lifetime. A promising strategy to isolate the triplet excited state away from the metal after intersystem crossing (ISC) involves the combination of transition metal complex and an organic donor/acceptor group. Here, we elucidate the excited state branching processes in a series of Ru(II)-terpyridyl push–pull triads by quantum chemical simulations. Scalar-relativistic time-dependent density theory simulations reveal that efficient ISC takes place along 1/3 MLCT gateway states. Subsequently, competitive electron transfer (ET) pathways involving the organic chromophore, i.e., 10-methylphenothiazinyl and the terpyridyl ligands are available. The kinetics of the underlying ET processes were investigated within the semiclassical Marcus picture and along efficient internal reaction coordinates that connect the respective photoredox intermediates. The key parameter that governs the population transfer away from the metal toward the organic chromophore either by means of ligand-to-ligand ( 3 LLCT; weakly coupled) or intra-ligand charge transfer ( 3 ILCT; strongly coupled) states was determined to be the magnitude of the involved electronic coupling.},

This approach significantly reduces the overall computational cost, as integrals can be efficiently computed in both regions.

  abstract = {By considering only one electronic state per molecule, charge transport models of molecular solids neglect intramolecular charge transfer. This approximation excludes materials with quasi-degenerate spatially separated frontier orbitals, such as non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) and symmetric thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters. By analyzing the electronic structure of room-temperature molecular conformers of a prototypical NFA, ITIC-4F, we conclude that the electron is localized on one of the two acceptor blocks with the mean intramolecular transfer integral of 120 meV, which is comparable with intermolecular couplings. Therefore, the minimal basis for acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) molecules consists of two molecular orbitals localized on the acceptor blocks. This basis is robust even with respect to geometry distortions in an amorphous solid, in contrast to the basis of two lowest unoccupied canonical molecular orbitals withstanding only thermal fluctuations in a crystal. The charge carrier mobility can be underestimated by a factor of two when using single site approximation for A–D–A molecules in their typical crystalline packings.},

  abstract = {The dual exponential coupled cluster theory proposed by Tribedi et al. [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16 , 10, 6317–6328 (2020)] performs significantly better for a wide range of weakly correlated systems than the coupled cluster theory with singles and doubles excitations due to the implicit inclusion of high-rank excitations. The high-rank excitations are included through the action of a set of vacuum annihilating scattering operators that act non-trivially on certain correlated wavefunctions and are determined via a set of local denominators involving the energy difference between certain excited states. This often leads the theory to be prone to instabilities. In this paper, we show that restricting the correlated wavefunction, on which the scattering operators act, to be spanned by only the singlet-paired determinants can avoid catastrophic breakdown. For the first time, we present two nonequivalent approaches to arrive at the working equations, viz., the projective approach with sufficiency conditions and the amplitude form with many-body expansion. Although the effect of the triple excitation is quite small around molecular equilibrium geometry, this scheme leads to a better qualitative description of the energetics in the regions of strong correlation. With many pilot numerical applications, we have demonstrated the performance of the dual-exponential scheme with both the proposed solution strategies while restricting the excitation subspaces coupled to the corresponding lowest spin channels.},

  abstract = {Clustering has become an indispensable tool in the presence of increasingly large and complex datasets. Most clustering algorithms depend, either explicitly or implicitly, on the sampled density. However, estimated densities are fragile due to the curse of dimensionality and finite sampling effects, for instance, in molecular dynamics simulations. To avoid the dependence on estimated densities, an energy-based clustering (EBC) algorithm based on the Metropolis acceptance criterion is developed in this work. In the proposed formulation, EBC can be considered a generalization of spectral clustering in the limit of large temperatures. Taking the potential energy of a sample explicitly into account alleviates requirements regarding the distribution of the data. In addition, it permits the subsampling of densely sampled regions, which can result in significant speed-ups and sublinear scaling. The algorithm is validated on a range of test systems including molecular dynamics trajectories of alanine dipeptide and the Trp-cage miniprotein. Our results show that including information about the potential-energy surface can largely decouple clustering from the sampled density.},

However, numerical simulations of SDE models may be problematic if the values of noise terms are negative and large, which is not realistic for biological systems since the molecular copy numbers or protein concentrations should be non-negative. To address this issue, we propose the composite Patankar-Euler methods to obtain positive simulations of SDE models. A SDE model is separated into three parts, namely, the positive-valued drift terms, negative-valued drift terms, and diffusion terms. We first propose the deterministic Patankar-Euler method to avoid negative solutions generated from the negative-valued drift terms. The stochastic Patankar-Euler method is designed to avoid negative solutions generated from both the negative-valued drift terms and diffusion terms. These Patankar-Euler methods have the strong convergence order of a half. The composite Patankar-Euler methods are the combinations of the explicit Euler method, deterministic Patankar-Euler method, and stochastic Patankar-Euler method. Three SDE system models are used to examine the effectiveness, accuracy, and convergence properties of the composite Patankar-Euler methods. Numerical results suggest that the composite Patankar-Euler methods are effective methods to ensure positive simulations when any appropriate stepsize is used.},

  abstract = {We investigate, in this paper, the Gaussian (G) function with odd powers of r , rx a y b z c exp(− αr 2 ), called the r-Gaussian or simply the rG function. The reason we investigate this function here is that it is generated as the elements of the complement functions (cf’s) when we apply the free complement (FC) theory for solving the Schrödinger equation to the initial functions composed of the Gaussian functions. This means that without the rG functions, the Gaussian set of functions cannot produce the exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation, showing the absolute importance of the rG functions in quantum chemistry. Actually, the rG functions drastically improve the wave function near the cusp region. This was shown by the applications of the present theory to the hydrogen and helium atoms. When we use the FC- s ij theory, in which the inter-electron function r ij is replaced with its square s i j = r i j 2 that is integrable, we need only one- and two-electron integrals for the G and rG functions. The one-center one- and two-electron integrals of the rG functions are always available in a closed form. To calculate the integrals of the multi-centered rG functions, we proposed the rG- N G expansion method, in which an rG function is expanded by a linear combination of the G functions. The optimal exponents and coefficients of this expansion were given for N = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9. To show the accuracy and the usefulness of the rG- N G method, we applied the FC- s ij theory to the hydrogen molecule.},

A number of technical and methodological improvements made allowed us to extend this approach toward calculations of larger molecular systems than those previously accessible and maintain the very high accuracy of constructed potential energy surfaces. On the methodological side, improvements were made by using a Δ-learning approach, predicting the difference against a fully harmonic potential, and employing a computationally more efficient hyperparameter optimization procedure. We demonstrate the performance of this method on a test set of molecules of growing size and show that up to 80\% of single point calculations could be avoided, introducing a root mean square deviation in fundamental excitations of about 3 cm −1 . A much higher accuracy with errors below 1 cm −1 could be achieved with tighter convergence thresholds still reducing the number of single point computations by up to 68\%. We further support our findings with a detailed analysis of wall times measured while employing different electronic structure methods. Our results demonstrate that GPR-ADGA is an effective tool, which could be applied for cost-efficient calculations of potential energy surfaces suitable for highly accurate vibrational spectra simulations.},

  abstract = {Supported metallic nanoparticles play a central role in catalysis. However, predictive modeling is particularly challenging due to the structural and dynamic complexity of the nanoparticle and its interface with the support, given that the sizes of interest are often well beyond those accessible via traditional ab initio methods. With recent advances in machine learning, it is now feasible to perform MD simulations with potentials retaining near-density-functional theory (DFT) accuracy, which can elucidate the growth and relaxation of supported metal nanoparticles, as well as reactions on those catalysts, at temperatures and time scales approaching those relevant to experiments. Furthermore, the surfaces of the support materials can also be modeled realistically through simulated annealing to include effects such as defects and amorphous structures. We study the adsorption of fluorine atoms on ceria and silica supported palladium nanoparticles using machine learning potential trained by DFT data using the DeePMD framework. We show defects on ceria and Pd/ceria interfaces are crucial for the initial adsorption of fluorine, while the interplay between Pd and ceria and the reverse oxygen migration from ceria to Pd control spillover of fluorine from Pd to ceria at later stages. In contrast, silica supports do not induce fluorine spillover from Pd particles.},

The correlation between COVID-19 and the onset of Parkinson’s disease led to the idea that amyloidogenic segments in SARS-COV-2 proteins can induce aggregation of α-synuclein. Using molecular dynamic simulations, we show that the fragment FKNIDGYFKI of the spike protein, which is unique for SARS-COV-2, preferentially shifts the ensemble of α-synuclein monomer toward rod-like fibril seeding conformations and, at the same time, differentially stabilizes this polymorph over the competing twister-like structure.

  abstract = {Cytokinesis requires a apoptosis-linked gene 2 interacting protein X (ALIX) and a 55 kDa midbody centrosomal protein (CEP55) to activate the cell abscission in somatic cells. However, in germ cells, CEP55 forms intercellular bridges with testis-expressed gene 14 (TEX14), which blocks the cell abscission. These intercellular bridges play important roles in the synchronization of the germ cells and facilitate the coordinated passage of organelles and molecules between germ cells. If TEX14 is intentionally removed, intercellular bridges are disrupted, leading to sterility. Hence, a deeper understanding regarding the roles of TEX14 can provide significant insights into the inactivation of abscission and the inhibition of proliferation in cancer cells. Previous experimental studies have shown that the high affinity and low dissociation rate of TEX14 for CEP55 prevent ALIX from binding CEP55 and inactivate the germ cell abscission. However, detailed information about how TEX14 interacts with CEP55 to prevent the cell abscission is still lacking. To gain more specific insights into the interactions between CEP55 and TEX14 and the difference in reactivity between TEX14 and ALIX, we performed well-tempered metadynamics simulations of these protein complexes using atomistic models of CEP55, TEX14, and ALIX. We identified the major binding residues of TEX14 and ALIX with CEP55 by using 2D Gibbs free energy evaluations, the results of which are consistent with previous experimental studies. Our results may help design synthetic TEX14 mimicking peptides, which can bind CEP55 and facilitate the inactivation of abscission in abnormal cells, including cancer cells.},

  abstract = {Atomistic simulations of biological processes offer insights at a high level of spatial and temporal resolution, but accelerated sampling is often required for probing timescales of biologically relevant processes. The resulting data need to be statistically reweighted and condensed in a concise yet faithful manner to facilitate interpretation. Here, we provide evidence that a recently proposed approach for the unsupervised determination of optimized reaction coordinate (RC) can be used for both analysis and reweighting of such data. We first show that for a peptide interconverting between helical and collapsed configurations, the optimal RC permits efficient reconstruction of equilibrium properties from enhanced sampling trajectories. Upon RC-reweighting, kinetic rate constants and free energy profiles are in good agreement with values obtained from equilibrium simulations. In a more challenging test, we apply the method to enhanced sampling simulations of the unbinding of an acetylated lysine-containing tripeptide from the bromodomain of ATAD2. The complexity of this system allows us to investigate the strengths and limitations of these RCs. Overall, the findings presented here underline the potential of the unsupervised determination of reaction coordinates and the synergy with orthogonal analysis methods, such as Markov state models and SAPPHIRE analysis.},

The complex interplay of the ionization of various species, the electrostatic interactions, and the partitioning of small ions leads to a non-monotonous, stepwise swelling behavior of the weak polybase chains.},

  abstract = {The diffusion of small molecular penetrants through polymeric materials represents an important fundamental problem, relevant to the design of materials for applications such as coatings and membranes. Polymer networks hold promise in these applications because dramatic differences in molecular diffusion can result from subtle changes in the network structure. In this paper, we use molecular simulation to understand the role that cross-linked network polymers have in governing the molecular motion of penetrants. By considering the local, activated alpha relaxation time of the penetrant and its long-time diffusive dynamics, we can determine the relative importance of activated glassy dynamics on penetrants at the segmental scale vs entropic mesh confinement on penetrant diffusion. We vary several parameters, such as the cross-linking density, temperature, and penetrant size, to show that cross-links primarily affect molecular diffusion through the modification of the matrix glass transition, with local penetrant hopping at least partially coupled to the segmental relaxation of the polymer network. This coupling is very sensitive to the local activated segmental dynamics of the surrounding matrix, and we also show that penetrant transport is affected by dynamic heterogeneity at low temperatures. To contrast, only at high temperatures and for large penetrants or when the dynamic heterogeneity effect is weak, does the effect of mesh confinement become significant, even though penetrant diffusion more broadly empirically follows similar trends as established models of mesh confinement-based transport.},

The model used explicitly considers the movement of solute particles and polyelectrolyte chains. These movements are performed by following a Brownian dynamics algorithm. The effect of three electrostatic parameters characterizing the system (solute charge, polyelectrolyte chain charge, and ionic strength) is analyzed. Our results show that the behavior of both the diffusion coefficient and the anomalous diffusion exponent changes upon the reversal of the electric charge of one of the species. In addition, the diffusion coefficient in flexible gels differs significantly from that in rigid gels if the ionic strength is low enough. However, the effect of chain flexibility on the exponent of anomalous diffusion is significant even at high ionic strength (100 mM). Our simulations also prove that varying the polyelectrolyte chain charge does not have exactly the same effect as varying the solute particle charge.},

However, semiflexible linear chains though navigate smoothly, shrink at lower activities, followed by swelling at higher activities, while semiflexible rings exhibit a contrasting behavior. Semiflexible rings shrink, get trapped at lower activities, and escape at higher activities. This demonstrates how activity and topology interplay and control the structure and dynamics of linear chains and rings in porous media.

We performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a single phospholipid bilayer under shear flow to clarify the relationship between the shear rate, bilayer undulation, and negative tension, providing molecular-level insight into the undulation suppression. An increasing shear rate suppressed bilayer undulation and increased negative tension; these results are consistent with theoretical predictions. The non-bonded forces between the hydrophobic tails facilitated negative tension, whereas the bonded forces within the tails suppressed it. The force components of the negative tension were anisotropic in the bilayer plane and prominently changed in the flow direction, although the resultant tension was isotropic. Our findings regarding a single bilayer will underlie further simulation studies of multilamellar bilayers, including inter-bilayer interactions and topological changes of bilayers under shear flow, which are essential for the onion transition and are unresolved in the theoretical and experimental studies.},

In such cases, QDs are usually dispersed in water. As is known, water has strong absorbance in the NIR-II region. However, investigations on the interaction between NIR-II emitters and water molecules are ignored in previous studies. Herein, we synthesized a series of mercaptoundecanoic acid-coated silver sulfide (Ag 2 S/MUA) QDs with various emissions that partially or completely overlapped with the absorbance of water at 1200 nm. By constructing a hydrophobic interface of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) with MUA on the Ag 2 S QDs surface via forming an ionic bond, significant enhancement of Ag 2 S QDs photoluminescence (PL) intensity was observed, as well as a prolonged lifetime. These findings suggest that there is an energy transfer between Ag 2 S QDs and water in addition to the classical resonance absorption. Transient absorption and fluorescence spectra results revealed that the increased PL intensities and lifetime of Ag 2 S QDs originated from the suppressed energy transfer from Ag 2 S QDs to the water due to the CTAB bridged hydrophobic interfaces. This discovery is important for a deeper understanding of the photophysical mechanisms of QDs and their applications.},

Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we show that energy transfer only occurs from RhB (donor) to Co center (acceptor) when RhB is confined into the ZIF-8 structure, which is in stark contrast to the system based on the physical mixture of RhB with Co-doped ZIF-8, where negligible energy transfer was observed. In addition, energy transfer efficiency increases with the concentration of Co and reaches a plateau when the molar ratio of Co to RhB reaches 32. These results suggest that RhB confined in the ZIF-8 structure is essential for energy transfer to occur, and energy transfer efficiency can be controlled by tuning the concentration of acceptors.},

At higher energies, direct decomposition becomes more favored. Our work also predicts that the primary decomposition pathways for CH 3 F and CF 4 are CH 3 F → CH 3 + F and CF 4 → CF 2 + 2F, respectively.

We obtain trends of the fundamental and optical gaps with increasing M -atomic number, in agreement with experiment. In particular, we reproduce the experimental fundamental gap, optical gap, and Cu 3 d energy of CuAlO 2 almost perfectly, in contrast to the various calculations that have traditionally focused on valence electrons, which are unable to reproduce these key properties simultaneously. Since all that distinguishes our calculations is simply the use of a different Cu pseudopotential with a partially exact exchange interaction, this suggests that an inappropriate description of the electron–ion interaction may play a role in the density functional theory bandgap problem for CuAlO 2 . Applying Cu hybrid pseudopotentials to CuGaO 2 and CuInO 2 is also effective, yielding optical gaps that are very close to experiment. However, due to the limited experimental data for these two oxides, a comprehensive comparison as that for CuAlO 2 is not possible. Furthermore, our calculations yield large exciton binding energies for delafossite Cu M O 2 , all around 1 eV.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a broadband metamaterial absorber consisting of the doped silicon substrate and the square array of doped silicon covered by a SU-8 layer is presented. The target structure achieves an average absorption of 94.42\% in the studied frequency range (0.5–8 THz). In particular, the structure exceeds 90\% absorption in the frequency range of 1.44–8 THz, which is a significant increase in bandwidth relative to reported devices of the same type. Next, the near-perfect absorption of the target structure is verified by the impedance matching principle. Furthermore, through the analysis of the electric field distribution inside the structure, the physical mechanism of its broadband absorption is investigated and explained. Finally, the impact of fluctuations in the incident angle, polarization angle, and structural parameters on the absorption efficiency is examined at length. The analysis shows that the structure has characteristics, such as polarization insensitivity, wide-angle absorption, and good process tolerance. The proposed structure is advantageous for applications in THz shielding, cloaking, sensing, and energy harvesting.},

  abstract = {Cation exchange is a versatile post-synthetic method to explore a wide range of nanoparticle compositions, phases, and morphologies. Recently, several studies have expanded the scope of cation exchange to magic-size clusters (MSCs). Mechanistic studies indicated that MSC cation exchange undergoes a two-stage reaction pathway instead of the continuous diffusion-controlled mechanism found in nanoparticle cation exchange reactions. The cation exchange intermediate, however, has not been well-identified despite it being the key to understanding the reaction mechanism. Only indirect evidence, such as exciton peak shifts and powder x-ray diffraction, has been used to indicate the formation of the cation exchange intermediate. In this paper, we investigate the unusual nature of cation exchange in nanoclusters using our previously reported CdS MSC. High-resolution mass spectra reveal two cation exchanged reaction intermediates [Ag 2 Cd 32 S 33 (L) and AgCd 33 S 33 (L), L: oleic acid] as well as the fully exchanged Ag 2 S cluster. Crystal and electronic structure characterizations also confirm the two-stage reaction mechanism. Additionally, we investigate the Cu/CdS MSC cation exchange reaction and find a similar two-stage reaction mechanism. Our study shows that the formation of dilutely exchanged intermediate clusters can be generally found in the first stage of the MSC cation exchange reaction. By exchanging different cations, these intermediate clusters can access varying properties compared to their unexchanged counterparts.},

To search for materials with ultralow thermal conductivity and a high power factor, we proposed a set of universal statistical interaction descriptors (SIDs) and developed accurate machine learning models for the prediction of thermoelectric properties. For lattice thermal conductivity prediction, the SID-based model achieved the state-of-the-art results with an average absolute error of 1.76 W m −1 K −1 . The well-performing models predicted that hypervalent triiodides XI 3 (X = Rb, Cs) have ultralow thermal conductivities and high power factors. Combining first-principles calculations, the self-consistent phonon theory, and the Boltzmann transport equation, we obtained the anharmonic lattice thermal conductivities of 0.10 and 0.13 W m −1 K −1 for CsI 3 and RbI 3 in the c-axis direction at 300 K, respectively. Further studies show that the ultralow thermal conductivity of XI 3 arises from the competition of vibrations between alkali metal atoms and halogen atoms. In addition, at 700 K, the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT values of CsI 3 and RbI 3 are 4.10 and 1.52, respectively, at the optimal hole doping level, which indicates hypervalent triiodides are potential high performance thermoelectric materials.},

  abstract = {Hybrid ferromagnet–semiconductor systems possess new outstanding properties, which emerge when bringing magnetic and semiconductor materials into contact. In such structures, the long-range magnetic proximity effect couples the spin systems of the ferromagnet and semiconductor on distances exceeding the carrier wave function overlap. The effect is due to the effective p – d exchange interaction of acceptor-bound holes in the quantum well with d -electrons of the ferromagnet. This indirect interaction is established via the phononic Stark effect mediated by the chiral phonons. Here, we demonstrate that the long-range magnetic proximity effect is universal and observed in hybrid structures with diverse magnetic components and potential barriers of various thicknesses and compositions. We study hybrid structures consisting of a semimetal (magnetite Fe 3 O 4 ) or dielectric (spinel NiFe 2 O 4 ) ferromagnet and a CdTe quantum well separated by a nonmagnetic (Cd,Mg)Te barrier. The proximity effect is manifested in the circular polarization of the photoluminescence corresponding to the recombination of photoexcited electrons with holes bound to shallow acceptors in the quantum well induced by magnetite or spinel itself, in contrast to interface ferromagnet in case of metal-based hybrid systems. A nontrivial dynamics of the proximity effect is observed in the studied structures due to recombination-induced dynamic polarization of electrons in the quantum well. It enables the determination of the exchange constant Δ exch ≈ 70 μ eV in a magnetite-based structure. The universal origin of the long-range exchange interaction along with the possibility of its electrical control offers prospects for the development of low-voltage spintronic devices compatible with existing solid-state electronics.},

  abstract = {Anion exchange is a facile, post-synthetic method to tune the emission wavelength of colloidal cesium lead halide (CsPbX 3 , X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite nanocrystals. While colloidal nanocrystals can exhibit size-dependent phase stability and chemical reactivity, the role of size in the mechanism of anion exchange in CsPbX 3 nanocrystals has not been elucidated. We used single-particle fluorescence microscopy to monitor the transformation of individual CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals to CsPbI 3 . By systematically varying the size of the nanocrystals and the concentration of substitutional iodide, we observed that smaller nanocrystals exhibit longer transition times in their fluorescence trajectories, while larger nanocrystals undergo a more abrupt transition during anion exchange. Monte Carlo simulations were used to rationalize the size-dependent reactivity, in which we varied how each exchange event affects the probability for further exchange. Greater cooperativity for simulated ion exchange leads to shorter transition times to complete the exchange. We propose that size-dependent miscibility between CsPbBr 3 and CsPbI 3 at the nanoscale controls the reaction kinetics. Smaller nanocrystals maintain a homogeneous composition during anion exchange. As the nanocrystal size increases, variations in the octahedral tilting patterns of the perovskite crystals lead to different structures for CsPbBr 3 and CsPbI 3 . Thus, an iodide-rich region must first nucleate within larger CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals, which is followed by rapid transformation to CsPbI 3 . While higher concentrations of substitutional anions can suppress this size-dependent reactivity, the inherent differences in reactivity between nanocrystals of different sizes are important to consider when scaling up this reaction for applications in solid-state lighting and biological imaging.},

In this paper, we extend this technique to enantiopure powders of alanine and camphor by dissolving them in solvents of varying concentrations. We show the differential absorbance of helical light to be an order of magnitude higher relative to conventional resonant linear techniques and is comparable to nonlinear techniques that use circularly polarized light. The origin of helicity dependent absorption is discussed in terms of induced multipole moments in nonlinear light–matter interaction.

The physical stability of the amorphous phase with respect to the crystal is crucial to bring amorphous formulations into the market—however, predicting the timescale involved with the onset of crystallization a priori is a formidably challenging task. Machine learning can help in this context by crafting models capable of predicting the physical stability of any given amorphous drug. In this work, we leverage the outcomes of molecular dynamics simulations to further the state-of-the-art. In particular, we devise, compute, and use “solid state” descriptors that capture the dynamical properties of the amorphous phases, thus complementing the picture offered by the “traditional,” “one-molecule” descriptors used in most quantitative structure–activity relationship models. The results in terms of accuracy are very encouraging and demonstrate the added value of using molecular simulations as a tool to enrich the traditional machine learning paradigm for drug design and discovery.},

  abstract = {Dense or glassy active matter, as a result of its remarkable resemblance to passive glass-forming materials, is enjoying increasing scientific interest. To better grasp the subtle effect of active motion on the process of vitrification, a number of active mode-coupling theories (MCTs) have recently been developed. These have proven capable of qualitatively predicting important parts of the active glassy phenomenology. However, most efforts so far have only considered single-component materials, and their derivations are arguably more complex than the standard MCT case, which might hinder broader usage. Here we present a detailed derivation of a distinct active MCT for mixtures of athermal self-propelled particles that is more transparent than previously introduced versions. The key insight is that we can follow a similar strategy for our overdamped active system as is typically used for passive underdamped MCT. Interestingly, when only considering one particle species, our theory gives the exact same result as the one obtained in previous work, which employed a highly different mode-coupling strategy. Moreover, we assess the quality of the theory and its novel extension to multi-component materials by using it to predict the dynamics of a Kob–Andersen mixture of athermal active Brownian quasi-hard spheres. We demonstrate that our theory is able to capture all qualitative features, most notably the location of the optimum of the dynamics when the persistence length and cage length coincide, for each combination of particle types.},

There is, accordingly, a need to investigate the molecular mechanisms at the root of the advanced performances of these systems in terms of nanofluidic and ionic transport. In this work, we introduce a novel unified methodology for Non-Equilibrium classical Molecular Dynamic simulations (NEMD), allowing to apply likewise pressure, chemical potential, and voltage drops across nanoporous membranes and quantifying the resulting observables characterizing confined liquid transport under such external stimuli. We apply the NEMD methodology to study a new type of synthetic Carbon NanoMembranes (CNM), which have recently shown outstanding performances for desalination, keeping high water permeability while maintaining full salt rejection. The high water permeance of CNM, as measured experimentally, is shown to originate in prominent entrance effects associated with negligible friction inside the nanopore. Beyond, our methodology allows us to fully calculate the symmetric transport matrix and the cross-phenomena, such as electro-osmosis, diffusio-osmosis, and streaming currents. In particular, we predict a large diffusio-osmotic current across the CNM pore under a concentration gradient, despite the absence of surface charges. This suggests that CNMs are outstanding candidates as alternative, scalable membranes for osmotic energy harvesting.},

The Michael addition-cyclization reaction between acrylonitrile and sulfur-containing molecules does not occur due to the weaker acidity of CH bonds in sulfur-containing molecules, which results from their weaker hyperconjugation effect compared to oxygen-containing molecules. The reduced propensity for the proton transfer from the CH bonds hinders the formation of the Michael addition-cyclization product that follows.},

The empirical usefulness of the necessary condition is demonstrated by testing a list of publicly available Lennard-Jones cluster data that have been pooled from 17 sources, covering the interval 2 ≤ N ≤ 1610 without gaps. The data point for N = 447 failed this test, meaning the listed 447-particle Lennard-Jones cluster energy was not optimal. To implement this test for optimality in search algorithms for putatively optimal configurations is an easy task. Publishing only the data that pass the test would increase the odds that these are actually optimal, without guaranteeing it, though.},

  abstract = {The coherent transfer of electron spin polarization to nuclei by means of a microwave pulse sequence is a promising new approach to enhancing the sensitivity of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The development of pulse sequences for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of bulk nuclei is far from complete, as is the understanding of what makes a good DNP sequence. In this context, we introduce a new sequence, termed Two-Pulse Phase Modulation (TPPM) DNP. We provide a general theoretical description for electron–proton polarization transfer by periodic DNP pulse sequences and find it in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. In experiments at 1.2 T, TPPM DNP generates a higher gain in sensitivity than existing sequences XiX (X-inverse-X) and TOP (Time-Optimized Pulsed) DNP but does so at relatively high nutation frequencies. In contrast, we find that the XiX sequence performs very well at nutation frequencies as low as 7 MHz. A combination of theoretical analysis and experimental investigation makes clear that fast electron–proton polarization transfer, due to a well-preserved dipolar coupling in the effective Hamiltonian, correlates with a short build-up time of the dynamic nuclear polarization of the bulk. Experiments further show that the performances of XiX and TOP DNP are affected differently by the concentration of the polarizing agent. These results constitute important reference points for the development of new and better DNP sequences.},

  abstract = {Many approximate solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation can be formulated as exact solutions of a nonlinear Schrödinger equation with an effective Hamiltonian operator depending on the state of the system. We show that Heller’s thawed Gaussian approximation, Coalson and Karplus’s variational Gaussian approximation, and other Gaussian wavepacket dynamics methods fit into this framework if the effective potential is a quadratic polynomial with state-dependent coefficients. We study such a nonlinear Schrödinger equation in full generality: we derive general equations of motion for the Gaussian’s parameters, demonstrate time reversibility and norm conservation, and analyze conservation of energy, effective energy, and symplectic structure. We also describe efficient, high-order geometric integrators for the numerical solution of this nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The general theory is illustrated by examples of this family of Gaussian wavepacket dynamics, including the variational and nonvariational thawed and frozen Gaussian approximations and their special limits based on the global harmonic, local harmonic, single-Hessian, local cubic, and local quartic approximations for the potential energy. We also propose a new method by augmenting the local cubic approximation with a single fourth derivative. Without substantially increasing the cost, the proposed “single-quartic” variational Gaussian approximation improves the accuracy over the local cubic approximation and, at the same time, conserves both the effective energy and symplectic structure, unlike the much more expensive local quartic approximation. Most results are presented in both Heller’s and Hagedorn’s parametrizations of the Gaussian wavepacket.},

  abstract = {A theoretical framework is presented for the computation of the rovibrational polaritonic states of a molecule in a lossless infrared (IR) microcavity. In the proposed approach, the quantum treatment of the rotational and vibrational motions of the molecule can be formulated using arbitrary approximations. The cavity-induced changes in electronic structure are treated perturbatively, which allows using the existing polished tools of standard quantum chemistry for determining electronic molecular properties. As a case study, the rovibrational polaritons and related thermodynamic properties of H 2 O in an IR microcavity are computed for varying cavity parameters, applying various approximations to describe the molecular degrees of freedom. The self-dipole interaction is significant for nearly all light–matter coupling strengths investigated, and the molecular polarizability proved important for the correct qualitative behavior of the energy level shifts induced by the cavity. On the other hand, the magnitude of polarization remains small, justifying the perturbative approach for the cavity-induced changes in electronic structure. Comparing results obtained using a high-accuracy variational molecular model with those obtained utilizing the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximations revealed that as long as the rovibrational model is appropriate for describing the field-free molecule, the computed rovibropolaritonic properties can be expected to be accurate as well. Strong light–matter coupling between the radiation mode of an IR cavity and the rovibrational states of H 2 O leads to minor changes in the thermodynamic properties of the system, and these changes seem to be dominated by non-resonant interactions between the quantum light and matter.},

  abstract = {We introduce an approach for calculating perturbative corrections to the ring-polymer instanton approximation to tunneling splittings (RPI+PC) by computing higher-order terms in the asymptotic expansion in ℏ. The resulting method goes beyond standard instanton theory by using information on the third and fourth derivatives of the potential along the tunneling path to include additional anharmonic effects. This leads to significant improvements both in systems with low barriers and in systems with anharmonic modes. We demonstrate the applicability of RPI+PC to molecular systems by computing the tunneling splitting in full-dimensional malonaldehyde and a deuterated derivative. Comparing to both experiment and recent quantum mechanical benchmark results, we find that our perturbative correction reduces the error from −11\% to 2\% for hydrogen transfer and performs even better for the deuterated case. This makes our approach more accurate than previous calculations using diffusion Monte Carlo and path-integral molecular dynamics while being more computationally efficient.},

However, treating these processes requires a unified and accurate treatment of the fermionic states of the electrode and their coupling to the molecule being oxidized or reduced in the electrochemical processes and, in turn, the way the molecular energy levels are modulated by the bosonic nuclear modes of the molecule and solvent. Here we present a physically transparent quasiclassical scheme to treat these electrochemical electron transfer processes in the presence of molecular vibrations by using an appropriately chosen mapping of the fermionic variables. We demonstrate that this approach, which is exact in the limit of non-interacting fermions in the absence of coupling to vibrations, is able to accurately capture the electron transfer dynamics from the electrode even when the process is coupled to vibrational motions in the regimes of weak coupling. This approach, thus, provides a scalable strategy to explicitly treat electron transfer from electrode interfaces in condensed-phase molecular systems.},

We present a consistent scheme for the computation of the macroscopic Kohn–Sham (KS) density response function connecting an average over snapshot values of charge density perturbations to the averaged values of KS potential variations. This allows us to formulate the LR-TDDFT within the adiabatic (static) approximation for the exchange–correlation (XC) kernel for disordered systems, where the static XC kernel is computed using the direct perturbation method [Moldabekov et al. , J. Chem. Theory Comput. 19 , 1286 (2023)]. The presented approach allows one to compute the macroscopic dynamic density response function as well as the dielectric function with a static XC kernel generated for any available XC functional. The application of the developed workflow is demonstrated for the example of warm dense hydrogen. The presented approach is applicable for various types of extended disordered systems, such as warm dense matter, liquid metals, and dense plasmas.},

Within the unitary coupled cluster framework, we develop a disentangled Ansatz construction protocol that can dynamically tailor an optimal Ansatz using the one- and two-body cluster operators and a selection of rank-two scatterers. The construction of the Ansatz may potentially be performed in parallel over multiple quantum processors through energy sorting and operator commutativity prescreening.

Here, the derivation and implementation of the ISR in third-order perturbation theory for the one-particle operator are presented, enabling, for the first time, the calculation of consistent third-order ADC [ADC(3)] properties. The accuracy of ADC(3) properties is evaluated with respect to high-level reference data and compared to the previously used ADC(2) and ADC(3/2) schemes. Oscillator strengths and excited state dipole moments are computed, and typical response properties are considered: dipole polarizabilities, first-order hyperpolarizabilities, and two-photon absorption strengths. The consistent third-order treatment of the ISR leads to an accuracy similar to that of the mixed-order ADC(3/2) method; the individual performance, however, depends on the property and molecule under investigation. ADC(3) produces slightly improved results in the case of oscillator strengths and two-photon absorption strengths, while excited state dipole moments, dipole polarizabilities, and first-order hyperpolarizabilities exhibit similar accuracy at ADC(3) and ADC(3/2) levels. Taking the significant increase of central processing unit time and memory requirements of the consistent ADC(3) approach into account, the mixed-order ADC(3/2) scheme offers a better compromise between accuracy and efficiency for the properties considered.},

Recently developed two-dimensional (2D) terahertz magnetic resonance (THz-MR) spectroscopy techniques use the magnetic components of laser pulses, and this allows investigation of the details of the ultrafast dynamics of spin systems. For such investigations, quantum treatment—not only of the spin system itself but also of the environment surrounding the spin system—is important. In our method, based on the theory of multidimensional optical spectroscopy, we formulate nonlinear THz-MR spectra using an approach based on the numerically rigorous hierarchical equations of motion. We conduct numerical calculations of both linear (1D) and 2D THz-MR spectra for a linear chiral spin chain. The pitch and direction of chirality (clockwise or anticlockwise) are determined by the strength and sign of the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI).

The utility of FGR has been demonstrated through decades of experimental confirmation. However, there still remain important cases where the evaluation of a FGR rate is ambiguous or ill-defined. Examples are cases where the rate has divergent terms due to the sparsity in the density of final states or time dependent fluctuations of system Hamiltonians. Strictly speaking, assumptions of FGR are no longer valid for such cases. However, it is still possible to define modified FGR rate expressions that are useful as effective rates. The resulting modified FGR rate expressions resolve a long standing ambiguity often encountered in using FGR and offer more reliable ways to model general rate processes.

The molecular mechanisms of single-base discrimination, however, remain poorly understood. Using a recently developed stochastic approach, we theoretically investigated the dynamics of single-base editing. More specifically, transient and mean times to edit “TC” motifs by cytosine BEs are explicitly evaluated for correct (target) and incorrect (bystander) locations on DNA. In addition, the effect of mutations on the dynamics of the single-base edition is also analyzed. It is found that for most ranges of parameters, it is possible to temporarily separate target and bystander products of base editing, supporting the idea of dynamic selectivity as a method of improving the precision of single-base editing. We conclude that to improve the efficiency of single-base editing, selecting the probability or selecting the time requires different strategies. Physical–chemical arguments to explain the observed dynamic properties are presented.

  abstract = {Particle-based and field-theoretic simulations are both widely used methods to predict the properties of polymeric materials. In general, the advantages of each method are complementary. Field-theoretic simulations are preferred for polymers with high molecular weights and can provide direct access to chemical potentials and free energies, which makes them the method-of-choice for calculating phase diagrams. The trade-off is that field-theoretic simulations sacrifice the molecular details present in particle-based simulations, such as the configurations of individual molecules and their dynamics. In this work, we describe a new approach to conduct “multi-representation” simulations that efficiently map between particle-based and field-theoretic simulations. Our approach involves the construction of formally equivalent particle-based and field-based models, which are then simulated subject to the constraint that their spatial density profiles are equal. This constraint provides the ability to directly link particle-based and field-based simulations and enables calculations that can switch between one representation to the other. By switching between particle/field representations during a simulation, we demonstrate that our approach can leverage many of the advantages of each representation while avoiding their respective limitations. Although our method is illustrated in the context of complex sphere phases in linear diblock copolymers, we anticipate that it will be useful whenever free energies, rapid equilibration, molecular configurations, and dynamic information are all simultaneously desired.},

  abstract = {We systematically examine the influence of varying temperature ( T ) over a large range in model poly(vinyl acetate) gels swollen in isopropyl alcohol. The theta temperature Θ , at which the second virial coefficient A 2 vanishes, is found to be equal to within numerical uncertainty to the corresponding high molecular mass polymer solution value without cross-links, and we quantify the swelling and deswelling of our model gels relative to their size at T = Θ , as customary for individual flexible polymer chains in solutions. We also quantify the “solvent quality” dependence of the shear modulus G relative to G ( T = Θ ) and compare to the gel swelling factor, α . We find that all our network swelling and deswelling data can be reduced to a scaling equation of the same general form as derived from renormalization group theory for flexible linear polymer chains in solutions so that it is not necessary to invoke either the Flory–Huggins mean field theory or the Flory–Rehner hypothesis that the elastic and mixing contributions to the free energy of network swelling are separable to describe our data. We also find that changes of G relative to G ( T = Θ ) are directly related to α . At the same time, we find that classical rubber elasticity theory describes many aspects of these semi-dilute solution cross-linked networks, regardless of the solvent quality, although the prefactor clearly reflects the existence of network defects whose concentration depends on the initial polymer concentration of the polymer solution from which the networks were synthesized.},

  abstract = {We have analyzed the effects of the spreads in experimental parameters on the reliability of speeds and angular distributions extracted from a generic surface-scattering experiment based on planar laser-induced fluorescence detection. The numerical model assumes a pulsed beam of projectile molecules is directed at a surface. The spatial distribution of the scattered products is detected by imaging the laser-induced fluorescence excited by a thin, pulsed sheet of laser light. Monte Carlo sampling is used to select from realistic distributions of the experimental parameters. The key parameter is found to be the molecular-beam diameter, expressed as a ratio to the measurement distance from the point of impact. Measured angular distributions are negligibly distorted when this ratio is &lt;∼10\%. Measured most-probable speeds are more tolerant, being undistorted when it is &lt;∼20\%. In contrast, the spread of speeds or of corresponding arrival times in the incident molecular beam has only very minor systematic effects. The thickness of the laser sheet is also unimportant within realistic practical limits. These conclusions are broadly applicable to experiments of this general type. In addition, we have analyzed the specific set of parameters designed to match the experiments on OH scattering from a liquid perfluoropolyether (PFPE) surface in the Paper I [Roman et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 158 , 244704 (2023)]. This reveals that the detailed form of the molecular-beam profile is important, particularly on apparent angular distributions, for geometric reasons that we explain. Empirical factors have been derived to correct for these effects.},

  abstract = {Inelastic collisions of OH with an inert liquid perfluoropolyether (PFPE) surface have been studied experimentally. A pulsed molecular beam of OH with a kinetic energy distribution peaking at 35 kJ mol −1 was directed at a continually refreshed PFPE surface. OH molecules were detected state-selectively with spatial and temporal resolution by pulsed, planar laser-induced fluorescence. The scattered speed distributions were confirmed to be strongly superthermal, regardless of the incidence angle (0° or 45°). Angular scattering distributions were measured for the first time; their reliability was confirmed through extensive Monte Carlo simulations of experimental averaging effects, described in Paper II [A. G. Knight et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 158 , 244705 (2023)]. The distributions depend markedly on the incidence angle and are correlated with scattered OH speed, consistent with predominantly impulsive scattering. For 45° incidence, the angular distributions are distinctly asymmetric to the specular side but peak at sub-specular angles. This, along with the breadth of the distributions, is incompatible with scattering from a surface that is flat on a molecular scale. New molecular dynamics simulations corroborate the roughness of the PFPE surface. A subtle but unexpected systematic dependence of the angular distribution on the OH rotational state was found, which may be dynamical in origin. The OH angular distributions are similar to those for kinematically similar Ne scattering from PFPE and hence not strongly perturbed by OH being a linear rotor. The results here are broadly compatible with prior predictions from independent quasiclassical trajectory simulations of OH scattering from a model-fluorinated self-assembled monolayer surface.},

Our simulations of a sliding spherical asperity reveal the following two friction regimes: at low loads, the films show Amonton&#39;s friction with a friction force that rises linearly with normal load, and at high loads, the friction force is independent of the load as long as no direct solid–solid contact occurs. The transition between these two regimes happens when a single molecular layer is confined in the gap between the sliding bodies. The friction force at high loads on a monolayer rises monotonically with film density and drops slightly with the transition to hemicylindrical aggregates. This monotonous increase of friction force is compatible with a traditional plowing model of sliding friction. At low loads, the friction coefficient reaches a minimum at the intermediate surface concentrations. We attribute this behavior to a competition between adhesive forces, repulsion of the compressed film, and the onset of plowing.},

  abstract = {High pressure has been recognized as an important tool in molecule and materials research, and thus, it is expected to be used to understand the evolution of electronic states and geometric structures in superatoms. In this work, by studying three characteristic axial compressions on a typical endohedral metallofullerene superatom U@C 28 with T d symmetry, we find that the triplet ground electronic state is preserved when the compression moves along the direction that reduces the symmetry to D 2d , but the electronic state of the structure compressed along the direction of symmetry reduction to C 2v or C s is transformed into a singlet. The transition is attributed to the distinction in the response of electron spin to different axial compressions, which results in a change in the electron occupation mode of the system. Furthermore, we also confirm the gradual evolution from stereo to near-plane superatoms and the connection between their electron structures. This is reflected in the fact that the electron density distributions of the superatomic molecular orbitals (SAMOs) with extension along the restricted degrees of freedom ( ⁠ D z 2 ⁠ , F z 3 SAMOs) gradually contract, and the delocalization destruction of special orbitals is associated with this freedom. In addition, Raman and ultraviolet–visible spectra show a hyperchromic effect and redshift of characteristic peaks during axial compression, which are expected to be used for fingerprinting the superatomic planarization. Therefore, our work provides new insights based on high pressure for future research toward the discovery of physical properties and applications of superatoms.},

However, the efficiency of the photovoltaic mode remains modest for useful power conversion and may be challenging to improve without sacrificing performance in electroluminescence. Through a facile on-film partial ligand exchange with benzenethiol integrated into the device fabrication step, we achieve an average of more than threefold increase in power conversion efficiency while maintaining the maximum external quantum efficiency and the maximum luminance in the LED mode. The improved photovoltaic performance is mainly due to the increase in the short circuit current, which we attribute to the enhanced charge separation afforded by the partial ligand exchange. The recovery of the photoluminescence lifetime under the forward bias suggests that the hole traps introduced by benzenethiols are filled prior to reaching the voltage at which light emission begins, allowing LED performance to be maintained and possibly improved.},

  abstract = {Using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the surface properties of lithium, sodium, and potassium silicate glasses containing 25 mol\% of alkali oxide. The comparison of two types of surfaces, a melt-formed surface (MS) and a fracture surface (FS), demonstrates that the influence of the alkali modifier on the surface properties depends strongly on the nature of the surface. The FS exhibits a monotonic increase of modifier concentration with increasing alkali size while the MS shows a saturation of alkali concentration when going from Na to K glasses, indicating the presence of competing mechanisms that influence the properties of a MS. For the FS, we find that larger alkali ions reduce the concentration of under-coordinated Si atoms and increase the fraction of two-membered rings, implying an enhanced chemical reactivity of the surface. For both types of surfaces, the roughness is found to increase with alkali size, with the effect being more pronounced for the FS than for the MS. The height–height correlation functions of the surfaces show a scaling behavior that is independent of the alkali species considered: The ones for the MS are compatible with the prediction of the frozen capillary wave theory while the ones for the FS show a logarithmic growth, i.e., on the nanoscale these surfaces are not self-affine fractals. The influence of the modifier on the surface properties are rationalized in terms of the interplay between multiple factors involving the size of the ions, bond strength, and charge balance on the surface.},

This is much more efficient than existing approaches and also extends previous analyses of (non-dynamic) dipolar networks in terms of site-specific root-sum-square dipolar couplings. The non-local nature of the second moment means that it can discriminate between overall motions that are difficult to discriminate using alternative approaches, such as measurements of NMR relaxation. The value of reviving second moment studies is illustrated on the plastic solids diamantane and triamantane. In the case of triamantane, straightforward measurements of 1 H lineshapes on milligram samples show that the molecules in the higher temperature phase undergo multi-axis jumps, information that is not accessible either to diffraction studies or to alternative NMR approaches. The efficiency of the computational methods means that the second moments can be calculated using a readily extensible and open-source Python code.},

Using the nanoindentation method, the E z = 29.1 ± 0.7 GPa value of the component of Young’s modulus was determined for a struvite single crystal. In addition, the elastic constants C 11 , C 22 , and C 33 were determined using micro-Brillouin spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations of the abovementioned properties have been carried out by employing density functional theory methods. Scaling of the theoretical elastic constants leads to obtaining good agreement with the experimental values. Values of the E x and E y components of the Young’s modulus, not available from the experimental nanoindentation technique, have been determined theoretically as 23 GPa and 27 GPa, respectively. Differences in the values of elastic components and Young’s modulus components are related to the layered crystal structure of struvite and directional character of the hydrogen-bonding pattern.},

  abstract = {The millimeter-wave rotational spectrum of ketene (H 2 C=C=O) has been collected and analyzed from 130 to 750 GHz, providing highly precise spectroscopic constants from a sextic, S-reduced Hamiltonian in the I r representation. The chemical synthesis of deuteriated samples allowed spectroscopic measurements of five previously unstudied ketene isotopologues. Combined with previous work, these data provide a new, highly precise, and accurate semi-experimental ( r e SE ) structure for ketene from 32 independent moments of inertia. This r e SE structure was determined with the experimental rotational constants of each available isotopologue, together with computed vibration–rotation interaction and electron-mass distribution corrections from coupled-cluster calculations with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)/cc-pCVTZ]. The 2σ uncertainties of the r e SE parameters are ≤0.0007 Å and 0.014° for the bond distances and angle, respectively. Only S-reduced spectroscopic constants were used in the structure determination due to a breakdown in the A-reduction of the Hamiltonian for the highly prolate ketene species. All four r e SE structural parameters agree with the “best theoretical estimate” (BTE) values, which are derived from a high-level computed r e structure [CCSD(T)/cc-pCV6Z] with corrections for the use of a finite basis set, the incomplete treatment of electron correlation, relativistic effects, and the diagonal Born–Oppenheimer breakdown. In each case, the computed value of the geometric parameter lies within the statistical experimental uncertainty (2σ) of the corresponding semi-experimental coordinate. The discrepancies between the BTE structure and the r e SE structure are 0.0003, 0.0000, and 0.0004 Å for r C–C , r C–H , and r C–O , respectively, and 0.009° for θ C–C–H .},

  abstract = {This work studies the exhaustive rovibrational state-specific collision-induced dissociation properties of the N 2 +N system by QCT (quasi-classical trajectory) combined with a neural network method based on the ab initio PES recently published by Varga et al. [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 23 , 26273 (2021)]. The QCT combined with a neural network for state-specific dissociation (QCT–NN–SSD) model is developed and used to predict the dissociation cross sections and their energy dependence on the thermal range from a sparsely sampled noisy dataset. It is conservatively estimated that using this method can reduce the cost of the calculation by 96.5\%. The rate coefficient of thermal non-equilibrium between different energy modes is obtained by combining the QCT–NN–SSD model with the multi-temperature model. The results show that, for the equilibrium state, dissociation mainly occurs at high vibrational and moderately low rotational levels. When the system is in non-equilibrium, there is no obvious vibrational level preference and highly rotationally excited molecules play a major role in promoting the dissociation by compensating for the lack of vibrational energy. The use of neural network training to generate complete datasets based on limited and discrete data provides an economical and reliable way to obtain a complete kinetic database needed to accurately simulate non-equilibrium flows.},

  abstract = {The isoelectronic molecules UN and UO + are known to have Ω = 3.5 and Ω = 4.5 ground states, respectively (where Ω is the unsigned projection of the electronic angular momentum along the internuclear axis). A ligand field theory model has been proposed to account for the difference [Matthew and Morse, J. Chem. Phys. 138, 184303 (2013)]. The ground state of UO + arises from the U 3+ (5 f 3 ( 4 I 4.5 ))O 2− configuration. Owing to the higher nominal charge of the N 3− ligand, the U 3+ ion in UN is stabilized by promoting one of the 5 f electrons to the more polarizable 7 s orbital, reducing the repulsive interaction with the ligand and rendering U 3+ (5 f 2 7 s ( 4 H 3.5 ))N 3− the lowest energy configuration. In the present work, we have advanced the characterization of the UN ground state through studies of two electronic transitions, [18.35]4.5- X (1)3.5 and [18.63]4.5- X (1)3.5, using sub-Doppler laser excitation techniques with fluorescence detection. Spectra were recorded under field-free conditions and in the presence of static electric or magnetic fields. The ground state electric dipole moment [ μ = 4.30(2) D] and magnetic g e -factor [2.160(9)] were determined from these data. These values were both consistent with the 5 f 2 7 s configurational assignment. Dispersed fluorescence measurements were used to determine vibrational constants for the ground and first electronically excited states. Electric dipole moments and magnetic g e -factors are also reported for the higher-energy electronically excited states.},

Theory Comput. 18 , 6111–6123 (2022)] used a hybrid procedure, applying a strong-correlation factor derived from the reverse Becke–Roussel machinery of the KP16/B13 and B13 functionals to the nonlocal correlation term of a local hybrid functional. Here, we show that adiabatic-connection factors for strong-correlation-corrected local hybrids (scLHs) can be constructed in a simplified way based on a comparison of semi-local and exact exchange-energy densities only, without recourse to exchange-hole normalization. The simplified procedure is based on a comparative analysis of Becke’s B05 real-space treatment of nondynamical correlation and that in LHs, and it allows us to use, in principle, any semi-local exchange-energy density in the variable used to construct local adiabatic connections. The derivation of competitive scLHs is demonstrated based on either a modified Becke–Roussel or a simpler Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) energy density, leading to the scLH23t-mBR and scLH23t-tPBE functionals, which both exhibit low fractional spin errors while retaining good performance for weakly correlated situations. We also report preliminary attempts toward more detailed modeling of the local adiabatic connection, allowing a reduction of unphysical local maxima in spin-restricted bond-dissociation energy curves (scLH23t-mBR-P form). The simplified derivations of sc-factors reported here provide a basis for future constructions and straightforward implementation of exchange-correlation functionals that escape the zero-sum game between low self-interaction and static-correlation errors.},

Our results indicate that the G4-DNA molecular junctions exhibit pronounced spin-selectivity effect, and the asymmetric contact-induced external chirality, instead of the inherent molecular chirality, dominates their spin filtration efficiency. Furthermore, the spin-selectivity effect is robust against the disorder and hold in a wide range of model parameters. These results could be checked by charge transport measurements and provide an alternative way to improve the spin-selectivity effect of chiral nanodevices.},

  abstract = {Memory effects are ubiquitous in a wide variety of complex physical phenomena, ranging from glassy dynamics and metamaterials to climate models. The Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) provides a rigorous way to describe memory effects via the so-called memory kernel in an integro-differential equation. However, the memory kernel is often unknown, and accurately predicting or measuring it via, e.g., a numerical inverse Laplace transform remains a herculean task. Here, we describe a novel method using deep neural networks (DNNs) to measure memory kernels from dynamical data. As a proof-of-principle, we focus on the notoriously long-lived memory effects of glass-forming systems, which have proved a major challenge to existing methods. In particular, we learn the operator mapping dynamics to memory kernels from a training set generated with the Mode-Coupling Theory (MCT) of hard spheres. Our DNNs are remarkably robust against noise, in contrast to conventional techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a network trained on data generated from analytic theory (hard-sphere MCT) generalizes well to data from simulations of a different system (Brownian Weeks–Chandler–Andersen particles). Finally, we train a network on a set of phenomenological kernels and demonstrate its effectiveness in generalizing to both unseen phenomenological examples and supercooled hard-sphere MCT data. We provide a general pipeline, KernelLearner, for training networks to extract memory kernels from any non-Markovian system described by a GLE. The success of our DNN method applied to noisy glassy systems suggests that deep learning can play an important role in the study of dynamical systems with memory.},

Our system of choice was a 20 nm large spherical nanocluster with 202 617 silicon atoms and 13 836 hydrogen atoms used to passivate the dangling surface bonds. To speed up the convergence of the eigenspace, we utilized Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration, and for sparse matrix–vector multiplications, we used blockwise Hilbert space-filling curves, implemented in the PARSEC code. For this calculation, we also replaced our orthonormalization + Rayleigh–Ritz step with a generalized eigenvalue problem step. We utilized all of the 8192 nodes (458 752 processors) on the Frontera machine at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. We achieved two Chebyshev-filtered subspace iterations, yielding a good approximation of the electronic density of states.

In this work, we evaluate the benefits of using specific vs general potentials for the study of activated mechanisms in solid-state materials. More specifically, we test three machine-learning fitting approaches using the moment-tensor potential to reproduce a reference potential when exploring the energy landscape around a vacancy in Stillinger–Weber silicon crystal and silicon–germanium zincblende structures using the activation-relaxation technique nouveau (ARTn). We find that a targeted on-the-fly approach specific to and integrated into ARTn generates the highest precision on the energetics and geometry of activated barriers while remaining cost-effective.

However, first-principles studies on this material by density functional theory calculations have been challenging as both the symmetry and atomic structure of α-Ag 2 S predicted from such calculations are inconsistent with experimental findings. Here, we propose that a dynamical approach is imperative for correctly describing the structure of α-Ag 2 S. The approach is based on a combination of ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and deliberately chosen density functional considering both proper treatment of the van der Waals interaction and on-site Coulomb interaction. The obtained lattice parameters and atomic site occupations of α-Ag 2 S are in good agreement with experimental data. A stable phonon spectrum at room temperature can be obtained from this structure, which also yields a bandgap in accord with experimental measurements. The dynamical approach thus paves the way for studying this important ductile semiconductor in not only thermoelectric but also optoelectronic applications.},

Empirical Butler–Volmer kinetics based on the transition state theory is often used to model the current–voltage relationship, where charged particles transfer classically over an energy barrier. However, the hydrogen oxidation/water electrolysis reaction H 2(g) + O 2− ⇌ H 2 O (g) + 2e − must be modeled through concerted electron and proton tunneling events, where we unify the theory of the electrostatic surface potential with proton-coupled electron transfer kinetics. We derive a framework for the reaction rate that depends on the electrostatic surface potential, adsorbate dipole moment, the electronic structure of the electron donor/acceptor, and vibronic states of the hydrogen species. This theory was used to study the current–voltage characteristics of the Ni/gadolinium-doped ceria electrode in H 2 /H 2 O(g), where we find excellent validation of this novel model. These results yield the first reported quantification of the solvent reorganization energy for an SOFC material and suggest that the three-phase boundary mechanism is the dominant pathway for charge transfer at cermet electrodes.},

  abstract = {Dimer interaction energies have been well studied in computational chemistry, but they can offer an incomplete understanding of molecular binding depending on the system. In the current study, we present a dataset of focal-point coupled-cluster interaction and deformation energies (summing to binding energies, D e ) of 28 organic molecular dimers. We use these highly accurate energies to evaluate ten density functional approximations for their accuracy. The best performing method (with a double- ζ basis set), B97M-D3BJ, is then used to calculate the binding energies of 104 organic dimers, and we analyze the influence of the nature and strength of interaction on deformation energies. Deformation energies can be as large as 50\% of the dimer interaction energy, especially when hydrogen bonding is present. In most cases, two or more hydrogen bonds present in a dimer correspond to an interaction energy of −10 to −25 kcal mol −1 , allowing a deformation energy above 1 kcal mol −1 (and up to 9.5 kcal mol −1 ). A lack of hydrogen bonding usually restricts the deformation energy to below 1 kcal mol −1 due to the weaker interaction energy.},

  abstract = {This work follows a companion article, which will be referred to as Paper I [Campeggio et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 158 , 244104 (2023)] in which a quantum-stochastic Liouville equation for the description of the quantum–classical dynamics of a molecule in a dissipative bath has been formulated in curvilinear internal coordinates. In such an approach, the coordinates of the system are separated into three subsets: the quantum coordinates, the classical relevant nuclear degrees of freedom, and the classical irrelevant (bath) coordinates. The equation has been derived in natural internal coordinates, which are bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles. The resulting equation needs to be parameterized. In particular, one needs to compute the potential energy surfaces, the friction tensor, and the rate constants for the nonradiative jumps among the quantum states. While standard methods exist for the calculation of energy and dissipative properties, an efficient evaluation of the transition rates needs to be developed. In this paper, an approximated treatment is introduced, which leads to a simple explicit formula with a single adjustable parameter. Such an approximated expression is compared with the exact calculation of transition rates obtained via molecular dynamics simulations. To make such a comparison possible, a simple sandbox system has been used, with two quantum states and a single internal coordinate (together with its conjugate momentum). Results show that the adjustable parameter, which is an effective decoherence time, can be parameterized from the effective relaxation times of the autocorrelation functions of the conjugated momenta of the relevant nuclear coordinates.},

  abstract = {Multiscale methods are powerful tools to describe large and complex systems. They are based on a hierarchical partitioning of the degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) of the system, allowing one to treat each set of d.o.f. in the most computationally efficient way. In the context of coupled nuclear and electronic dynamics, a multiscale approach would offer the opportunity to overcome the computational limits that, at present, do not allow one to treat a complex system (such as a biological macromolecule in explicit solvent) fully at the quantum mechanical level. Based on the pioneering work of Kapral and Ciccotti [R. Kapral and G. Ciccotti, J. Chem. Phys. 110 , 8919 (1999)], this work is intended to present a nonadiabatic theory that describes the evolution of electronic populations coupled with the dynamics of the nuclei of a molecule in a dissipative environment (condensed phases). The two elements of novelty that are here introduced are (i) the casting of the theory in the natural, internal coordinates, that are bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles; (ii) the projection of those nuclear d.o.f. that can be considered at the level of a thermal bath, therefore leading to a quantum- stochastic Liouville equation. Using natural coordinates allows the description of structure and dynamics in the way chemists are used to describe molecular geometry and its changes. The projection of bath coordinates provides an important reduction of complexity and allows us to formulate the approach that can be used directly in the statistical thermodynamics description of chemical systems.},

  abstract = {The correlation discrete variable representation (CDVR) enables (multilayer) multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) calculations with general potentials. The CDVR employs a set of grids corresponding to single-particle functions to efficiently evaluate all potential matrix elements appearing in the MCTDH equations of motion. In standard CDVR approaches, the number of grid points employed is tied to the number of corresponding single-particle functions. This limits the accuracy of the quadrature, which can be achieved for a given single-particle function basis. In this work, an extended CDVR approach that facilitates a numerically exact quadrature of all potential matrix elements is introduced. The number of grid points employed can be increased independent of the number of corresponding single-particle function to achieve any desired quadrature accuracy. The properties of the new scheme are illustrated by numerical calculations studying the photodissociation of NOCl and the vibrational states of CH 3 . Fast convergence with respect to the number of additional quadrature points is observed: Employing a single additional point in each physical or logical coordinate already ensures negligible quadrature errors.},

The latter is coupled to the center of mass orbital motion of the body through a helical tube via wall friction that acts as a dissipative spin–orbit coupling term. As a specific example, we study C 60 molecules that are initially spinning in opposite senses and investigate the effect of various external control parameters on their spatial separation when driven through a rigid helical channel.

  abstract = {In recent times, a variety of hybrid quantum–classical algorithms have been developed that aim to calculate the ground state energies of molecular systems on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Albeit the utilization of shallow depth circuits in these algorithms, the optimization of ansatz parameters necessitates a substantial number of quantum measurements, leading to prolonged runtimes on the scantly available quantum hardware. Through our work, we lay the general foundation for an interdisciplinary approach that can be used to drastically reduce the dependency of these algorithms on quantum infrastructure. We showcase these pertinent concepts within the framework of the recently developed Projective Quantum Eigensolver (PQE) that involves iterative optimization of the nonlinearly coupled parameters through repeated residue measurements on quantum hardware. We demonstrate that one may perceive such a nonlinear optimization problem as a collective dynamic interplay of fast and slow relaxing modes. As such, the synergy among the parameters is exploited using an on-the-fly supervised machine learning protocol that dynamically casts the PQE optimization into a smaller subspace by reducing the effective degrees of freedom. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that our proposed methodology ensures a drastic reduction in the number of quantum measurements necessary for the parameter updates without compromising the characteristic accuracy. Furthermore, the machine learning model may be tuned to capture the noisy data of NISQ devices, and thus the predicted energy is shown to be resilient under a given noise model.},

  abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have widely been conjectured to be ubiquitous in space, as supported by the recent discovery of two isomers of cyanonaphthalene, indene, and 2-cyanoindene in the Taurus molecular cloud-1 using radioastronomy. Here, the photoionization dynamics of 1-cyanonaphthalene (1-CNN) are investigated using synchrotron radiation over the hν = 9.0–19.5 eV range, revealing that prompt autoionization from the plasmon resonance dominates the photophysics for hν = 11.5–16.0 eV. Minimal photo-induced dissociation, whether originating from an excited state impulsive bond rupture or through internal conversion followed by a statistical bond cleavage process, occurs over the microsecond timescale (as limited by the experimental setup). The direct photoionization cross section and photoelectron angular distributions are simulated using an ezDyson model combining Dyson orbitals with Coulomb wave photoejection. When considering these data in conjunction with recent radiative cooling measurements on 1-CNN + , which showed that cations formed with up to 5 eV of internal energy efficiently stabilize through recurrent fluorescence, we conclude that the organic backbone of 1-CNN is resilient to photodestruction by VUV and soft XUV radiation. These dynamics may prove to be a common feature for the survival of small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in space, provided that the cations have a suitable electronic structure to support recurrent fluorescence.},

Phys. 153 , 164903 (2020)], we theoretically analyze how the phonon heat transport along a single polymer chain may be affected by varying the chain configuration. We suggest that phonon scattering controls the phonon heat conduction in strongly compressed (and tangled) chain when multiple random bends act as scattering centers for vibrational phonon modes, which results in the diffusive character of heat transport. As the chain is straightening up, the number of scatterers decreases, and the heat transport acquires nearly ballistic character. To analyze these effects, we introduce a model of a long atomic chain made out of identical atoms where some atoms are put in contact with scatterers and treat the phonon heat transfer through such a system as a multichannel scattering problem. We simulate the changes in the chain configurations by varying the number of the scatterers and mimic a gradual straightening of the chain by a gradual reducing of the number of scatterers attached to the chain atoms. It is demonstrated, in agreement with recently published simulation results, that the phonon thermal conductance shows a threshold-like transition from the limit where nearly all atoms are attached to the scatterers to the opposite limit where the scatterers vanish, which corresponds to a transition from the diffusive to the ballistic phonon transport.},

In this work, we developed a realistic coarse-grained Martini model that was refined against the thermodynamic data extracted from atomistic simulations. This allowed us to explore the aggregation behavior of thousands of asphaltene molecules in liquid paraffin on a microsecond time scale. Our computational findings show that native asphaltenes with aliphatic side groups form small clusters that are uniformly distributed in paraffin. The chemical modification of asphaltenes via cutting off their aliphatic periphery changes their aggregation behavior: modified asphaltenes form extended stacks whose size increases with asphaltene concentration. At a certain large concentration (44 mol.\%), the stacks of modified asphaltenes partly overlap, leading to the formation of large, disordered super-aggregates. Importantly, the size of such super-aggregates increases with the simulation box due to phase separation in the paraffin–asphaltene system. The mobility of native asphaltenes is systematically lower than that of their modified counterparts since the aliphatic side groups mix with paraffin chains, slowing down the diffusion of native asphaltenes. We also show that diffusion coefficients of asphaltenes are not very sensitive to the system size: enlarging the simulation box results in some increase in diffusion coefficients, with the effect being less pronounced at high asphaltene concentrations. Overall, our findings provide valuable insight into the aggregation behavior of asphaltenes on spatial and time scales that are normally beyond the scales accessible for atomistic simulations.},

  abstract = {Formation of base pairs between the nucleotides of a ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence gives rise to a complex and often highly branched RNA structure. While numerous studies have demonstrated the functional importance of the high degree of RNA branching—for instance, for its spatial compactness or interaction with other biological macromolecules—RNA branching topology remains largely unexplored. Here, we use the theory of randomly branching polymers to explore the scaling properties of RNAs by mapping their secondary structures onto planar tree graphs. Focusing on random RNA sequences of varying lengths, we determine the two scaling exponents related to their topology of branching. Our results indicate that ensembles of RNA secondary structures are characterized by annealed random branching and scale similarly to self-avoiding trees in three dimensions. We further show that the obtained scaling exponents are robust upon changes in nucleotide composition, tree topology, and folding energy parameters. Finally, in order to apply the theory of branching polymers to biological RNAs, whose length cannot be arbitrarily varied, we demonstrate how both scaling exponents can be obtained from distributions of the related topological quantities of individual RNA molecules with fixed length. In this way, we establish a framework to study the branching properties of RNA and compare them to other known classes of branched polymers. By understanding the scaling properties of RNA related to its branching structure, we aim to improve our understanding of the underlying principles and open up the possibility to design RNA sequences with desired topological properties.},

The APW and FLAPW (full potential linearized APW) task and data parallelism options and the advanced eigen-system solver provided by SIRIUS can be exploited for performance gains in ground state Kohn–Sham calculations on large systems. This approach is distinct from our prior use of SIRIUS as a library backend to another APW+ lo or FLAPW code. We benchmark the code and demonstrate performance on several magnetic molecule and metal organic framework systems. We show that the SIRIUS package in itself is capable of handling systems as large as a several hundred atoms in the unit cell without having to make technical choices that result in the loss of accuracy with respect to that needed for the study of magnetic systems.},

Herein, a series of Mn 4+ - and Mn 4+ /Ca 2+ -doped double perovskite SrGd 2 Al 2 O 7 red-emitting phosphors with wavelengths centered at about 709 nm were successfully synthesized by means of a traditional high-temperature solid-state method. First-principles calculations were conducted to explore the intrinsic electronic structure of SrGd 2 Al 2 O 7 for a better understanding of the luminescence behavior in this material. Extensive analysis demonstrates that the introduction of Ca 2+ ions into the SrGd 2 Al 2 O 7 :Mn 4+ phosphor has significantly boosted the emission intensity, internal quantum efficiency, and thermal stability by 170\%, 173.4\%, and 113.7\%, respectively, which are superior to those of most other Mn 4+ -based far-red phosphors. The mechanism of the concentration quench effect and the positive effect of co-doping Ca 2+ ions in the phosphor were extensively explored. All studies suggest that the SrGd 2 Al 2 O 7 :0.1\%Mn 4+ , 11\%Ca 2+ phosphor is a novel phosphor that can be used to effectively promote the growth of plants and regulate the flowering cycle. Therefore, promising applications can be anticipated from this new phosphor.},

The liquid–liquid correlation length, defined as the thickness of their interface, is also predicted as the temperature is varied, and it diverges as the temperature becomes close to the critical temperature. These results are compared with recent experiments on lipid membranes and good agreement is obtained. The scaling exponents of the line tension ( μ ) and the spatial correlation length ( ν ) with temperature are extracted, finding that they fulfill the hyperscaling relationship, μ = d − 1 ν ⁠ , where d is the dimension. The scaling of specific heat with temperature of the binary mixture is obtained as well. This is the first report of the successful test of the hyperscaling relation between μ and ν for d = 2 and for the non-trivial case of quasi-two dimensions. This work can help to understand experiments that test properties of nanomaterials using simple scaling laws, without needing to know specific chemical details of those materials.},

  abstract = {We discuss the origin of the breakloose (or static) friction force when an ice block is slid on a hard randomly rough substrate surface. If the substrate has roughness with small enough amplitude (of order a 1 nm or less), the breakloose force may be due to interfacial slip and is determined by the elastic energy per unit area, U el / A 0 , stored at the interface after the block has been displaced a short distance from its original position. The theory assumes complete contact between the solids at the interface and that there is no elastic deformation energy at the interface in the original state before the application of the tangential force. The breakloose force depends on the surface roughness power spectrum of the substrate and is found to be in good agreement with experimental observations. We show that as the temperature decreases, there is a transition from interfacial sliding (mode II crack propagation, where the crack propagation energy G II = U el / A 0 ) to opening crack propagation (mode I crack propagation with G I the energy per unit area to break the ice–substrate bonds in the normal direction).},

However, above a certain wavevector Q , not only transverse collective excitations were found to propagate in the fluid, but a second oscillatory component of unclear origin (therefore called X) must be considered to fully account for the time dependence of the correlation function. Here, we present an extended investigation of the transverse current autocorrelation of liquid Au as obtained by ab initio molecular dynamics in the very wide range of wavevectors 5.7 ≤ Q ≤ 32.8 nm −1 in order to also follow the behavior of the X component, if present, at large Q values. A joint analysis of the transverse current spectrum and its self-portion indicates that the second oscillatory component arises from the longitudinal dynamics, as suggested by its close resemblance with the previously determined component accounting for the longitudinal part of the density of states. We conclude that such a mode, albeit featuring a merely transverse property, fingerprints the effect of longitudinal collective excitations on single-particle dynamics, rather than arising from a possible coupling between transverse and longitudinal acoustic waves.},

The THz absorption spectra of powdered A @C 60 samples ( A = Ar, Ne, Kr) were measured in the energy range from 0.6 to 75 meV for a series of temperatures between 5 and 300 K. The INS measurements were carried out at liquid helium temperature in the energy transfer range from 0.78 to 54.6 meV. The THz spectra are dominated by one line, between 7 and 12 meV, at low temperatures for three noble gas atoms studied. The line shifts to higher energy and broadens as the temperature is increased. Using a spherical oscillator model, with a temperature-independent parameterized potential function and an atom-displacement-induced dipole moment, we show that the change of the THz spectrum shape with temperature is caused by the anharmonicity of the potential function.

The images and corresponding translational energy distributions for the H-atoms produced show three different contributions associated with three reaction pathways. The experimental results are complemented by high-level ab initio calculations. The potential energy curves computed as a function of the N–H and C–H bond distances allow us to draw a picture of the different mechanisms. Major dissociation occurs through N–H bond cleavage and it is triggered by an initial geometrical change, i.e., from a pyramidal configuration of the C–NH 2 with respect to the N atom to a planar geometry. The molecule is then driven into a conical intersection (CI) seam where three outcomes can take place: first, threshold dissociation into the second dissociation limit, associated with the formation of CH 3 NH ( A ̃ ) ⁠ , is observed; second, direct dissociation after passage through the CI leading to the formation of ground state products; and third, internal conversion into the ground state well in advance to dissociation. While the two last pathways were previously reported at a variety of wavelengths in the 203–240 nm range, the former had not been observed before to the best of our knowledge. The role of the CI and the presence of an exit barrier in the excited state, which modify the dynamics leading the two last mechanisms, are discussed considering the different excitation energies used.},

  abstract = {A synchrotron-based vacuum ultraviolet absorption spectrum (VUV) of quadricyclane (QC) is reported with energies up to 10.8 eV. Extensive vibrational structure has been extracted from the broad maxima by fitting short energy ranges of the VUV spectrum to high level polynomial functions and processing the regular residuals. Comparison of these data with our recent high-resolution photoelectron spectral of QC showed that this structure must be attributed to Rydberg states (RS). Several of these appear before the valence states at higher energies. Both types of states have been calculated by configuration interaction, including symmetry-adapted cluster studies (SAC-CI) and time dependent density functional theoretical methods (TDDFT). There is a close correlation between the SAC-CI vertical excitation energies (VEE) and both Becke 3-parameter hybrid functional (B3LYP), especially Coulomb-attenuating method-B3LYP determined ones. The VEE for several low-lying s-, p, d-, and f-RS have been determined by SAC-CI and adiabatic excitation energies by TDDFT methods. Searches for equilibrium structures for 1 1,3 A 2 and 1 1 B 1 states for QC led to rearrangement to a norbornadiene structure. Determination of the experimental 0 0 band positions, which show extremely low cross-sections, has been assisted by matching features in the spectra with Franck–Condon (FC) fits. Herzberg–Teller (HT) vibrational profiles for the RS are more intense than the FC ones, but only at high energy, and are attributed to up to ten quanta. The vibrational fine structure of the RS calculated by both FC and HT procedures gives an easy route to generating HT profiles for ionic states, which usually require non-standard procedures.},

This weak magnetic field effect has been found to arise from the removal of degeneracies in the zero-field spin Hamiltonian. Here, I investigated the anisotropic effect of a weak magnetic field on a model radical pair with an axially symmetric hyperfine interaction. I found that S–T ± and T 0 –T ± interconversions driven by the smaller x and y -components of the hyperfine interaction can be hindered or enhanced by a weak external magnetic field, depending on its direction. Additional isotropically hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins preserve this conclusion, although the S → T ± and T 0 → T ± transitions become asymmetric. These results are supported by simulating reaction yields of a more biologically plausible, flavin-based radical pair.},

Both the permutation invariant polynomial neural network method and the embedded atom neural network (EANN) method, based on ab initio MRCI-F12+Q/AVTZ level points, are used for obtaining globally accurate full-dimensional ground state PES, with the corresponding total root mean square error being only 0.043 and 0.056 kcal/mol, respectively. In addition, this is also the first application of the EANN in a gas-phase bimolecular reaction. The saddle point of this reaction system is confirmed to be nonlinear. In comparison with both the energetics and rate coefficients obtained on both PESs, we find that the EANN is reliable in dynamic calculations. A full-dimensional approximate quantum mechanical method, ring-polymer molecular dynamics with a Cayley propagator, is employed to obtain the thermal rate coefficients and kinetic isotopic effects of the title reaction Cl( 2 P) + XCl→ XCl + Cl( 2 P) (H, D, Mu) on both new PESs, and the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is also obtained. The rate coefficients reproduce the experimental results at high temperatures perfectly but with moderate accuracy at lower temperatures, but the KIE is with high accuracy. The similar kinetic behavior is supported by quantum dynamics using wave packet calculations as well.},

One such possibility is to generate two co-flowing liquid-jet sheets with a common interface in vacuum, with each surface facing the vacuum being representative of one of the solutions, allowing face-sensitive detection by photoelectron spectroscopy. The impingement of two cylindrical jets also enables the application of different bias potentials to each jet with the principal possibility to generate a potential gradient between the two solution phases. This is shown for the case of a flatjet composed of a sodium iodide aqueous solution and neat liquid water. The implications of asymmetric biasing for flatjet photoelectron spectroscopy are discussed. The first photoemission spectra for a sandwich-type flatjet comprised of a water layer encapsulated by two outer layers of an organic solvent (toluene) are also shown.},

  abstract = {Time-resolved spectroscopy is commonly used to study diverse phenomena in chemistry, biology, and physics. Pump–probe experiments and coherent two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy have resolved site-to-site energy transfer, visualized electronic couplings, and much more. In both techniques, the lowest-order signal, in a perturbative expansion of the polarization, is of third order in the electric field, which we call a one-quantum (1Q) signal because in 2D spectroscopy it oscillates in the coherence time with the excitation frequency. There is also a two-quantum (2Q) signal that oscillates in the coherence time at twice the fundamental frequency and is fifth order in the electric field. We demonstrate that the appearance of the 2Q signal guarantees that the 1Q signal is contaminated by non-negligible fifth-order interactions. We derive an analytical connection between an n Q signal and (2 n + 1)th-order contaminations of an r Q (with r &lt; n ) signal by studying Feynman diagrams of all contributions. We demonstrate that by performing partial integrations along the excitation axis in 2D spectra, we can obtain clean r Q signals free of higher-order artifacts. We exemplify the technique using optical 2D spectroscopy on squaraine oligomers, showing clean extraction of the third-order signal. We further demonstrate the analytical connection with higher-order pump–probe spectroscopy and compare both techniques experimentally. Our approach demonstrates the full power of higher-order pump–probe and 2D spectroscopy to investigate multi-particle interactions in coupled systems.},

  abstract = {Molecular magnets have received significant attention because of their potential applications in quantum information and quantum computing. A delicate balance of electron correlation, spin–orbit coupling (SOC), ligand field splitting, and other effects produces a persistent magnetic moment within each molecular magnet unit. The discovery and design of molecular magnets with improved functionalities would be greatly aided by accurate computations. However, the competition among the different effects poses a challenge for theoretical treatments. Electron correlation plays a central role since d - or f -element ions, which provide the magnetic states in molecular magnets, often require explicit many-body treatments. SOC, which expands the dimensionality of the Hilbert space, can also lead to non-perturbative effects in the presence of strong interaction. Furthermore, molecular magnets are large, with tens of atoms in even the smallest systems. We show how an ab initio treatment of molecular magnets can be achieved with auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo, in which electron correlation, SOC, and material specificity are included accurately and on an equal footing. The approach is demonstrated by an application to compute the zero-field splitting of a locally linear Co 2+ complex.},

  abstract = {We present the computational methodology, which for the first time allows rigorous twelve-dimensional (12D) quantum calculations of the coupled intramolecular and intermolecular vibrational states of hydrogen-bonded trimers of flexible diatomic molecules. Its starting point is the approach that we introduced recently for fully coupled 9D quantum calculations of the intermolecular vibrational states of noncovalently bound trimers comprised of diatomics treated as rigid. In this paper, it is extended to include the intramolecular stretching coordinates of the three diatomic monomers. The cornerstone of our 12D methodology is the partitioning of the full vibrational Hamiltonian of the trimer into two reduced-dimension Hamiltonians, one in 9D for the intermolecular degrees of freedom (DOFs) and another in 3D for the intramolecular vibrations of the trimer, and a remainder term. These two Hamiltonians are diagonalized separately, and a fraction of their respective 9D and 3D eigenstates is included in the 12D product contracted basis for both the intra- and intermolecular DOFs, in which the matrix of the full 12D vibrational Hamiltonian of the trimer is diagonalized. This methodology is implemented in the 12D quantum calculations of the coupled intra- and intermolecular vibrational states of the hydrogen-bonded HF trimer on an ab initio calculated potential energy surface (PES). The calculations encompass the one- and two-quanta intramolecular HF-stretch excited vibrational states of the trimer and low-energy intermolecular vibrational states in the intramolecular vibrational manifolds of interest. They reveal several interesting manifestations of significant coupling between the intra- and intermolecular vibrational modes of (HF) 3 . The 12D calculations also show that the frequencies of the v = 1, 2 HF stretching states of the HF trimer are strongly redshifted in comparison to those of the isolated HF monomer. Moreover, the magnitudes of these trimer redshifts are much larger than that of the redshift for the stretching fundamental of the donor-HF moiety in (HF) 2 , most likely due to the cooperative hydrogen bonding in (HF) 3 . The agreement between the 12D results and the limited spectroscopic data for the HF trimer, while satisfactory, leaves room for improvement and points to the need for a more accurate PES.},

This divergence problem has reignited interest in Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory (BWPT), which is regular at all orders but lacks size consistency and extensivity, severely limiting its application to chemistry. In this work, we propose an alternative partitioning of the Hamiltonian that leads to a regular BWPT perturbation series that, through the second order, is size-extensive, size-consistent (provided its Hartree–Fock reference is also), and orbital invariant. Our second-order size-consistent Brillouin-Wigner (BW-s2) approach can describe the exact dissociation limit of H 2 in a minimal basis set, regardless of the spin polarization of the reference orbitals. More broadly, we find that BW-s2 offers improvements relative to MP2 for covalent bond breaking, noncovalent interaction energies, and metal/organic reaction energies, although rivaling coupled-cluster with single and double substitutions for thermochemical properties.},

This results in accelerated basis convergences of ground-state energies to the complete-basis-set limit. In this work, we extend the basis-set correction method to a linear-response formalism for calculating excited-state energies. We give the general linear-response equations as well as the more specific equations for configuration-interaction wave functions. As a proof of concept, we apply this approach to the calculations of excited-state energies in a one-dimensional two-electron model system with harmonic potential and a Dirac-delta electron–electron interaction. The results obtained with full-configuration-interaction wave functions expanded in a basis of Hermite functions and a local-density-approximation basis-set correction functional show that the present approach does not help in accelerating the basis convergence of excitation energies. However, we show that it significantly accelerates basis convergences of excited-state total energies.},

We begin by disputing a recent suggestion that nuclear quantum effects may lead to a broadening of polariton bands, finding instead that they merely result in anharmonic red shifts in the polariton frequencies. We go on to show that our simulated cavity spectra can be reproduced to graphical accuracy with a harmonic model that uses just the cavity-free spectrum and the geometry of the cavity as input. We end by showing that this harmonic model can be combined with the experimental cavity-free spectrum to give results in good agreement with optical cavity measurements. Since the input to our harmonic model is equivalent to the input to the transfer matrix method of applied optics, we conclude that cavity molecular dynamics cannot provide any more insight into the effect of vibrational strong coupling on the absorption spectrum than this transfer matrix method, which is already widely used by experimentalists to corroborate their cavity results.},

While proper formulations have been put forward for both Hartree–Fock and post-Hartree–Fock wavefunctions, this is not the case for the Kohn–Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT). In this work, we critically analyze the performance of two fully additive approaches for the IQA decomposition of the KS-DFT energy, namely, the one from Francisco et al. , which uses atomic scaling factors, and that from Salvador and Mayer based upon the bond order density (SM-IQA). Atomic and diatomic exchange–correlation (xc) energy components are obtained for a molecular test set comprising different bond types and multiplicities and along the reaction coordinate of a Diels–Alder reaction. Both methodologies behave similarly for all systems considered. In general, the SM-IQA diatomic xc components are less negative than the Hartree–Fock ones, which is in good agreement with the known effect of electron correlation upon (most) covalent bonds. In addition, a new general scheme to minimize the numerical error of the sum of two-electron energy contributions (i.e., Coulomb and exact exchange) in the framework of overlapping atoms is described in detail.},

  abstract = {We study the electronic coupling between an adsorbate and a metal surface by calculating tunneling matrix elements H ad directly from first principles. For this, we employ a projection of the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian upon a diabatic basis using a version of the popular projection-operator diabatization approach. An appropriate integration of couplings over the Brillouin zone allows the first calculation of a size-convergent Newns–Anderson chemisorption function, a coupling-weighted density of states measuring the line broadening of an adsorbate frontier state upon adsorption. This broadening corresponds to the experimentally observed lifetime of an electron in the state, which we confirm for core-excited A r * ( 2 p 3 / 2 − 1 4 s ) atoms on a number of transition metal (TM) surfaces. Yet, beyond just lifetimes, the chemisorption function is highly interpretable and encodes rich information on orbital phase interactions on the surface. The model thus captures and elucidates key aspects of the electron transfer process. Finally, a decomposition into angular momentum components reveals the hitherto unresolved role of the hybridized d -character of the TM surface in the resonant electron transfer and elucidates the coupling of the adsorbate to the surface bands over the entire energy scale.},

  abstract = {The many-body expansion (MBE) is promising for the efficient, parallel computation of lattice energies in organic crystals. Very high accuracy should be achievable by employing coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples at the complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS] for the dimers, trimers, and potentially tetramers resulting from the MBE, but such a brute-force approach seems impractical for crystals of all but the smallest molecules. Here, we investigate hybrid or multi-level approaches that employ CCSD(T)/CBS only for the closest dimers and trimers and utilize much faster methods like Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) for more distant dimers and trimers. For trimers, MP2 is supplemented with the Axilrod–Teller–Muto (ATM) model of three-body dispersion. MP2(+ATM) is shown to be a very effective replacement for CCSD(T)/CBS for all but the closest dimers and trimers. A limited investigation of tetramers using CCSD(T)/CBS suggests that the four-body contribution is entirely negligible. The large set of CCSD(T)/CBS dimer and trimer data should be valuable in benchmarking approximate methods for molecular crystals and allows us to see that a literature estimate of the core-valence contribution of the closest dimers to the lattice energy using just MP2 was overbinding by 0.5 kJ mol −1 , and an estimate of the three-body contribution from the closest trimers using the T0 approximation in local CCSD(T) was underbinding by 0.7 kJ mol −1 . Our CCSD(T)/CBS best estimate of the 0 K lattice energy is −54.01 kJ mol −1 , compared to an estimated experimental value of −55.3 ± 2.2 kJ mol −1 .},

  abstract = {Numerical difficulties associated with computing matrix elements of operators between Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov (HFB) wavefunctions have plagued the development of HFB-based many-body theories for decades. The problem arises from divisions by zero in the standard formulation of the nonorthogonal Wick’s theorem in the limit of vanishing HFB overlap. In this Communication, we present a robust formulation of Wick’s theorem that stays well-behaved regardless of whether the HFB states are orthogonal or not. This new formulation ensures cancellation between the zeros of the overlap and the poles of the Pfaffian, which appears naturally in fermionic systems. Our formula explicitly eliminates self-interaction, which otherwise causes additional numerical challenges. A computationally efficient version of our formalism enables robust symmetry-projected HFB calculations with the same computational cost as mean-field theories. Moreover, we avoid potentially diverging normalization factors by introducing a robust normalization procedure. The resulting formalism treats even and odd number of particles on equal footing and reduces to Hartree–Fock as a natural limit. As proof of concept, we present a numerically stable and accurate solution to a Jordan–Wigner-transformed Hamiltonian, whose singularities motivated the present work. Our robust formulation of Wick’s theorem is a most promising development for methods using quasiparticle vacuum states.},

  abstract = {Polariton chemistry has emerged as an appealing branch of synthetic chemistry that promises mode selectivity and a cleaner approach to kinetic control. Of particular interest are the numerous experiments in which reactivity has been modified by virtue of performing the reaction inside infrared optical microcavities in the absence of optical pumping; this effort is known as “vibropolaritonic chemistry.” The optimal conditions for these observations are (1) resonance between cavity and reactive modes at normal incidence ( k = 0) and (2) a monotonic increase of the effect with the concentration of emitters in the sample. Importantly, vibropolaritonic chemistry has only been experimentally demonstrated in the so-called “collective” strong coupling regime, where there is a macroscopic number of molecules (rather than a single molecule) coupled to each photon mode of the microcavity. Strikingly, efforts to understand this phenomenon from a conceptual standpoint have encountered several roadblocks, and no single, unifying theory has surfaced thus far. This Perspective documents the most relevant approaches taken by theorists, laying out the contributions and unresolved challenges from each work. We expect this Perspective to not only serve as a primer for experimentalists and theorists alike but also inform future endeavors in the quest for the ultimate formalism of vibropolaritonic chemical kinetics.},

  abstract = {External flows of energy, entropy, and matter can cause sudden transitions in the stability of biological and industrial systems, fundamentally altering their dynamical function. How might we control and design these transitions in chemical reaction networks? Here, we analyze transitions giving rise to complex behavior in random reaction networks subject to external driving forces. In the absence of driving, we characterize the uniqueness of the steady state and identify the percolation of a giant connected component in these networks as the number of reactions increases. When subject to chemical driving (influx and outflux of chemical species), the steady state can undergo bifurcations, leading to multistability or oscillatory dynamics. By quantifying the prevalence of these bifurcations, we show how chemical driving and network sparsity tend to promote the emergence of these complex dynamics and increased rates of entropy production. We show that catalysis also plays an important role in the emergence of complexity, strongly correlating with the prevalence of bifurcations. Our results suggest that coupling a minimal number of chemical signatures with external driving can lead to features present in biochemical processes and abiogenesis.},

  abstract = {Mesogens, which are typically stiff rodlike or disklike molecules, are able to self-organize into liquid crystal (LC) phases in a certain temperature range. Such mesogens, or LC groups, can be attached to polymer chains in various configurations including within the backbone (main-chain LC polymers) or at the ends of side-chains attached to the backbone in an end-on or side-on configuration (side-chain LC polymers or SCLCPs), which can display synergistic properties arising from both their LC and polymeric character. At lower temperatures, chain conformations may be significantly altered due to the mesoscale LC ordering; thus, when heated from the LC ordered state through the LC to isotropic phase transition, the chains return from a more stretched to a more random coil conformation. This can cause macroscopic shape changes, which depend significantly on the type of LC attachment and other architectural properties of the polymer. Here, to study the structure–property relationships for SCLCPs with a range of different architectures, we develop a coarse-grained model that includes torsional potentials along with LC interactions of a Gay–Berne form. We create systems of different side-chain lengths, chain stiffnesses, and LC attachment types and track their structural properties as a function of temperature. Our modeled systems indeed form a variety of well-organized mesophase structures at low temperatures, and we predict higher LC-to-isotropic transition temperatures for the end-on side-chain systems than for analogous side-on side-chain systems. Understanding these phase transitions and their dependence on polymer architecture can be useful in designing materials with reversible and controllable deformations.},

The package includes two modules, suitable for system–bath problems and extended systems comprising many coupled system–bath units, and is offered in C++ and Fortran implementations. The system–bath module offers the recently developed small matrix path integral (SMatPI) and the well-established iterative quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral (i-QuAPI) method for iteration of the reduced density matrix of the system. In the SMatPI module, the dynamics within the entanglement interval can be computed using QuAPI, the blip sum, time evolving matrix product operators, or the quantum–classical path integral method. These methods have distinct convergence characteristics and their combination allows a user to access a variety of regimes. The extended system module provides the user with two algorithms of the modular path integral method, applicable to quantum spin chains or excitonic molecular aggregates. An overview of the methods and code structure is provided, along with guidance on method selection and representative examples.},

The characteristic uneven, lobed morphology of Zn-based shells is difficult to assess qualitatively and measure through traditional methods. Here, we present a methodological study utilizing quantitative morphological analysis of InP/ZnSe quantum dots to analyze the impact of key shelling parameters on InP core passivation and shell epitaxy. We compare conventional hand-drawn measurements with an open-source semi-automated protocol to showcase the improved precision and speed of this method. Additionally, we find that quantitative morphological assessment can discern morphological trends in morphologies that qualitative methods cannot. In conjunction with ensemble fluorescence measurements, we find that changes to shelling parameters that promote even shell growth often do so at the cost of core homogeneity. These results indicate that the chemistry of passivating the core and promoting shell growth must be balanced carefully to maximize brightness while maintaining emission color-purity.},

Here, we investigate the nanoparticle–water interface of 0.5–10 wt.\% aqueous iron oxide nanoparticle dispersions of 6 nm diameter in the presence of 6 vol.\% ethanol with x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. The absence of surface hydroxyl-groups in XAS spectra is in accordance with the double-difference PDF (dd-PDF) analysis, due to a fully covered surface from the capping agent. The previously observed dd-PDF signal is not stemming from a hydration shell, as postulated in Thomä et al.

We find rising nucleation rates with increasing lateral velocity and a smaller separation gap. The interplay between nucleation rate and lateral velocity is attributed to the entrainment of water molecules into the gap by the combination of lateral motion and collisions of the water molecules with the surfaces of the interface. The capillary volume of the full-grown water bridge increases with the distance between the two surfaces and can be limited by lateral shearing at high velocities. Our experimental results demonstrate a novel method to study in situ how water diffusion and transport impact dynamic interfaces at the nanoscale, ultimately leading to friction and adhesion forces at the macroscale.},

  abstract = {With the development of modern industry, the discharge of dye wastewater is increasing year by year, and the damage caused by this wastewater to the ecosystem is often irreversible. Therefore, the research on the harmless treatment of dyes has attracted much attention in recent years. In this paper, commercial titanium dioxide (anatase nanometer titanium dioxide) was heat treated with anhydrous ethanol to synthesize titanium carbide (C/TiO 2 ). Its maximum adsorption capacity for cationic dyes methylene blue (MB) and Rhodamine B is 27.3 and 124.6 mg g −1 , respectively, which is much higher than that of pure TiO 2 . The adsorption kinetics and isotherm model of C/TiO 2 were studied and characterized by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and other methods. The results show that the carbon layer on the surface of C/TiO 2 promotes the increase in surface hydroxyl groups, which is the main reason for the increase in MB adsorption. Compared with other adsorbents, C/TiO 2 showed excellent reusability. The experimental results of adsorbent regeneration showed that the adsorption rate R\% of MB was almost unchanged after three cycles. During the recovery of C/TiO 2 , the dyes adsorbed on its surface are removed, which solves the problem that the adsorbent cannot degrade dyes simply by adsorption. Additionally, C/TiO 2 has a stable adsorption effect, is insensitive to the pH value, has a simple preparation process, and has relatively low raw material prices, making it suitable for large-scale operation. Therefore, it has good commercial prospects in the organic dye industry wastewater treatment.},

  abstract = {We studied the formation of zinc selenide (ZnSe) from zinc chloride (ZnCl 2 ) and trioctylphosphine selenide (TOP=Se) in oleylamine, a chemistry originally proposed to grow ZnSe shells around InP core quantum dots. By monitoring the formation of ZnSe in reactions with and without InP seeds by quantitative absorbance and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we observe that the ZnSe formation rate is independent of the presence of InP cores. Similar to the seeded growth of CdSe and CdS, this observation supports a ZnSe growth mechanism through the inclusion of reactive ZnSe monomers that form homogeneously in the solution. Furthermore, by combining NMR and mass spectrometry, we identified the dominant reaction products of the ZnSe formation reaction as oleylammonium chloride and amino-substitutions of TOP, i.e., iminophosphoranes (TOP=NR), aminophosphonium chloride salts [TOP(NHR)Cl], and bis(amino)phosphoranes [TOP(NHR) 2 ]. Based on the acquired results, we outline a reaction scheme that involves the complexation of TOP=Se by ZnCl 2 , followed by the nucleophilic addition of oleylamine onto the Lewis acid activated P–Se bond, thereby eliminating ZnSe monomers and forming amino-substitutions of TOP. Our work highlights the central role of oleylamine, acting as both the nucleophile and Brønsted base, in the transformation of metal halides and alkylphosphine chalcogenides into metal chalcogenides.},

  abstract = {The physical aging of supercooled glycerol induced by upward temperature steps of amplitude reaching 45 K was studied by a new method consisting in heating a micrometer-thick liquid film at a rate of up to 60 000 K/s, holding it at a constant high temperature for a controlled duration before letting it quickly cool down to the initial temperature. By monitoring the final slow relaxation of the dielectric loss, we were able to obtain quantitative information on the liquid response to the initial upward step. The so-called TNM (Tool–Narayanaswamy–Moynihan) formalism provided a good description of our observations despite the large distance from equilibrium, provided that different values of the nonlinearity parameter were used for the cooling phase and for the (much further from equilibrium) heating phase. In this form, it allowed to precisely quantify how to design an ideal temperature step, i.e., where no relaxation occurs during the heating phase. It helped bringing a clear physical understanding of how the (kilosecond long) final relaxation is related to the (millisecond long) liquid response to the upward step. Finally, it made possible the reconstruction of the fictive temperature evolution immediately following a step, evidencing the highly non-linear character of the liquid response to such large amplitude temperature steps. This work illustrates both the strengths and limitations of the TNM approach. This new experimental device offers a promising tool to study far-from-equilibrium supercooled liquids through their dielectric response.},

The O − and NO · radicals are initially formed from the dissociation of photoexcited NO 2 − . The O − radical undergoes reversible proton transfer with water to generate · OH. Both · OH and O − oxidize the NO 2 − to · NO 2 radicals. The reactions of · OH occur at solution diffusion limits, which are influenced by the nature of the dissolved cations and anions. Here, we systematically varied the alkali metal cation, spanning the range from strongly to weakly hydrating ions, and measured the production of NO · , · OH, and · NO 2 radicals during UV photolysis of alkaline nitrite solutions using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy with nitromethane spin trapping. Comparing the data for the different alkali cations revealed that the nature of the cation had a significant effect on production of all three radical species. Radical production was inhibited in solutions with high charge density cations, e.g., lithium, and promoted in solutions containing low charge density cations, e.g., cesium. Through complementary investigations with multinuclear single pulse direct excitation nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and pulsed field gradient NMR diffusometry, cation-controlled solution structures and extent of NO 2 − solvation were determined to alter the initial yields of · NO and · OH radicals as well as alter the reactivity of NO 2 − toward · OH, impacting the production of · NO 2 . The implications of these results for the retrieval and processing of low-water, highly alkaline solutions that comprise legacy radioactive waste are discussed.},

The two boundaries separating water and hydrate and hydrate and guest fluid mixtures are estimated, which are extended to the lower temperature and the higher pressure region far distant from the three-phase coexisting conditions. The chemical potentials of individual guest components can be calculated from free energies of cage occupations, which are available from intermolecular interactions between host water and guest molecules. This allows us to derive all thermodynamic properties pertinent to the phase behaviors in the whole space of thermodynamic variables of temperature, pressure, and guest compositions. It is found that the phase boundaries of CH 4 –CO 2 binary hydrates with water and with fluid mixtures locate between simple CH 4 and CO 2 hydrates, but the composition ratios of CH 4 guests in hydrates are disproportional to those in fluid mixtures. Such differences arise from the affinities of each guest species to the large and small cages of CS-I hydrates and significantly affect occupation of each cage type, which results in a deviation of the guest composition in hydrates from that in fluid on the two-phase equilibrium conditions. The present method provides a basis for the evaluation of the efficiency of the guest CH 4 replacement to CO 2 at the thermodynamic limit.},

Remarkably, even in the presence of a heavy metal modifier dominating x-ray scattering, it was possible to extract accurate values for the tetrahedral, sp 3 , boron fraction, N 4 , which declines with increasing temperature, using bond valence-based mapping from the measured mean B–O bond lengths while accounting for vibrational thermal expansion. These are used within a boron-coordination-change model to extract enthalpies, Δ H , and entropies, Δ S , of isomerization between sp 2 and sp 3 boron. The results for BaB 4 O 7 , Δ H = 22(3) kJ mol −1 boron, Δ S = 19(2) J mol −1 boron K −1 , agree quantitatively with those found previously for Na 2 B 4 O 7 . Analytical expressions for N 4 ( J , T ) and associated configurational heat capacity, C P conf ( J , T ), and entropy, S conf ( J , T ), contributions are extended to cover a wide composition range 0 ≤ J = BaO/B 2 O 3 ≤ 3 using a model for Δ H ( J ) and Δ S ( J ) derived empirically for lithium borates. Maxima in the C P conf ( J , T g ) and fragility index contributions are thereby predicted for J ≲ 1, higher than the maximum observed and predicted in N 4 ( J , T g ) at J ≃ 0.6. We discuss the utility of the boron-coordination-change isomerization model in the context of borate liquids containing other modifiers and the prospect of neutron diffraction to aid in empirical determinations of modifier-dependent effects, illustrated by new neutron diffraction data on Ba 11 B 4 O 7 glass, its well-known α-polymorph, and lesser-known δ-phase.},

In case of Mn 2+ pair emission, temperature-dependent studies show a pronounced red shift, followed by a distinct blue shift of the PL energy upon heating. This is related to a spin ladder formation of the ground and excited states due to Mn 2+ –Mn 2+ exchange interaction at cryogenic temperatures, which is assumed to vanish at higher temperatures. In contrast, single Mn 2+ ion PL exhibits a unique redshift with increasing temperature, which can be attributed to a particularly strong coupling to vibronic modes due to the ultimate small size of the MSCs.},

Due to the helium droplets’ high ionization potential, optical transparency, and ability to pick up dopant molecules, the droplets offer a unique modality to probe transient chemical species produced via photo- or electron impact ionization. In this work, helium droplets were doped with acetylene molecules and ionized via electron impact. Ion-molecule reactions within the droplet volume yield larger carbo-cations that were studied via IR laser spectroscopy. This work is focused on cations containing four carbon atoms. The spectra of C 4 H 2 + , C 4 H 3 + , and C 4 H 5 + are dominated by diacetylene, vinylacetylene, and methylcyclopropene cations, respectively, which are the lowest energy isomers. On the other hand, the spectrum of C 4 H 4 + ions hints at the presence of several co-existing isomers, the identity of which remains to be elucidated.},

We calculate the lowest energy structure, total ground-state energy, electron population distribution, binding energy, and dissociation energy as a function of the cluster size of the carbon-doped aluminum clusters compared with the undoped ones. The obtained results show that carbon doping enhances the stability of the clusters mainly due to the electrostatic and exchange interactions from the HF contribution gain. The calculations also indicate that the dissociation energy required to remove the doped carbon atom is much larger than that required to remove an aluminum atom from the doped clusters.

  abstract = {Carbon nanotubes can serve as one-dimensional nanoreactors for the in-tube synthesis of various nanostructures. Experimental observations have shown that chains, inner tubes, or nanoribbons can grow by the thermal decomposition of organic/organometallic molecules encapsulated in carbon nanotubes. The result of the process depends on the temperature, the diameter of the nanotube, and the type and amount of material introduced inside the tube. Nanoribbons are particularly promising materials for nanoelectronics. Motivated by recent experimental results observing the formation of carbon nanoribbons inside carbon nanotubes, molecular dynamics calculations were performed with the open source LAMMPS code to investigate the reactions between carbon atoms confined within a single-walled carbon nanotube. Our results show that the interatomic potentials behave differently in quasi-one-dimensional simulations of nanotube-confined space than in three-dimensional simulations. In particular, the Tersoff potential performs better than the widely used Reactive Force Field potential in describing the formation of carbon nanoribbons inside nanotubes. We also found a temperature window where the nanoribbons were formed with the fewest defects, i.e., with the largest flatness and the most hexagons, which is in agreement with the experimental temperature range.},

The latter predicted highly competitive equilibria for both species, including 14 unique conformers of AEE and 12 for the sulfur analog AES within 14 kJ mol −1 . The experimental rotational spectrum of AEE was dominated by transitions arising from its three lowest energy conformers, which differ in the arrangement of the allyl side chain, while in AES, transitions due to the two most stable forms, distinct in the orientation of the ethyl group, were observed. Splitting patterns attributed to methyl internal rotation were analyzed for AEE conformers I and II, and the corresponding V 3 barriers were determined to be 12.172(55) and 12.373(32) kJ mol −1 , respectively. The experimental ground state geometries of both AEE and AES were derived using the observed rotational spectra of the 13 C and 34 S isotopic species and are highly dependent on the electronic properties of the linking chalcogen (oxygen vs sulfur). The observed structures are consistent with a decrease in hybridization in the bridging atom from oxygen to sulfur. The molecular-level phenomena that drive the conformational preferences are rationalized through natural bond orbital and non-covalent interaction analyses. These show that interactions involving the lone pairs on the chalcogen atom with the organic side chains favor distinct geometries and energy orderings for the conformers of AEE and AES.},

  abstract = {The regulation of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) to influence energy flow within molecular scaffolds provides a way to steer fundamental processes of chemistry, such as chemical reactivity in proteins and design of molecular diodes. Using two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy, changes in the intensity of vibrational cross-peaks are often used to evaluate different energy transfer pathways present in small molecules. Previous 2D IR studies of para -azidobenzonitrile (PAB) demonstrated that several possible energy pathways from the N 3 to the cyano-vibrational reporters were modulated by Fermi resonance, followed by energy relaxation into the solvent [Schmitz et al. , J. Phys. Chem. A 123 , 10571 (2019)]. In this work, the mechanisms of IVR were hindered via the introduction of a heavy atom, selenium, into the molecular scaffold. This effectively eliminated the energy transfer pathway and resulted in the dissipation of the energy into the bath and direct dipole–dipole coupling between the two vibrational reporters. Several structural variations of the aforementioned molecular scaffold were employed to assess how each interrupted the energy transfer pathways, and the evolution of 2D IR cross-peaks was measured to assess the changes in the energy flow. By eliminating the energy transfer pathways through isolation of specific vibrational transitions, through-space vibrational coupling between an azido (N 3 ) and a selenocyanato (SeCN) probe is facilitated and observed for the first time. Thus, the rectification of this molecular circuitry is accomplished through the inhibition of energy flow using heavy atoms to suppress the anharmonic coupling and, instead, favor a vibrational coupling pathway.},

Using a set of assumptions, we have developed a practical calculation methodology that employs multivariate fitting to determine the dependence of 27 different reactions, including tautomerizations, dimerizations, and acid–base dissociations, on solvent polarity. From this approach, we estimated all the contributions to the Gibbs free energy of reaction in the solution phase of some of these processes, including the gas phase Gibbs free energy of reaction, the electrostatic (continuum) contribution to the solvation Gibbs free of the involved solutes and, even, the Gibbs free energy contribution due to specific (intramolecular) solute–solvent interactions, albeit indirectly.},

Strictly referring to ML interatomic potentials, however, a number of modeling applications are out of reach, specifically those that require explicit electronic structure. Hybrid (“gray box”) models based on, e.g., approximate, semi-empirical ab initio electronic structure with the aid of some ML components offer a convenient synthesis that allows us to treat all aspects of a certain physical system on the same footing without targeting a separate ML model for each property. Here, we compare one of these [Density Functional Tight Binding with a Gaussian Process Regression repulsive potential (GPrep-DFTB)] with its fully “black box” counterpart, the Gaussian approximation potential, by evaluating performance in terms of accuracy, extrapolation power, and data efficiency for the metallic Ru and oxide RuO 2 systems, given exactly the same training set. The accuracy with respect to the training set or similar chemical motifs turns out to be comparable. GPrep-DFTB is, however, slightly more data efficient. The robustness of GPRep-DFTB in terms of extrapolation power is much less clear-cut for the binary system than for the pristine system, most likely due to imperfections in the electronic parametrization.},

With regularization, ESMP2 is far less sensitive to π system size and shows a higher overall accuracy on the Thiel set than CC2, equation of motion-coupled cluster with singles and doubles, CC3, and a wide variety of time-dependent density functional approaches. Unsurprisingly, even regularized ESMP2 is less accurate than multi-reference perturbation theory on this test set, which can, in part, be explained by the set’s inclusion of some doubly excited states but none of the strong charge transfer states that often pose challenges for state-averaging. Beyond energetics, we find that the ESMP2 doubles norm offers a relatively low-cost way to test for doubly excited character without the need to define an active space.},

  abstract = {Radial distribution functions (RDFs) are widely used in molecular simulation and beyond. Most approaches to computing RDFs require assembling a histogram over inter-particle separation distances. In turn, these histograms require a specific (and generally arbitrary) choice of discretization for bins. We demonstrate that this arbitrary choice for binning can lead to significant and spurious phenomena in several commonplace molecular-simulation analyses that make use of RDFs, such as identifying phase boundaries and generating excess entropy scaling relationships. We show that a straightforward approach (which we term Kernel-Averaging Method to Eliminate Length-Of-Bin Effects) mitigates these issues. This approach is based on systematic and mass-conserving mollification of RDFs using a Gaussian kernel. This technique has several advantages compared to existing methods, including being useful for cases where the original particle kinematic data have not been retained, and the only available data are the RDFs themselves. We also discuss the optimal implementation of this approach in the context of several application areas.},

  abstract = {In this work, we propose a theoretical finite element description of the ionic profiles of a general mixture of n species of spherical charged particles dissolved in an implicit solvent, with arbitrary size and charge asymmetries, neutralizing a spherical macroion. This approach aims to close the gap between the nano- and the micro-scales in macroion solutions, taking into account the ion correlations and ionic excluded volume effects consistently. When these last two features are neglected, the classical non-linear Poisson–Boltzmann theory for n ionic species—with different ionic closest approach distances to the colloidal surface—is recovered as a limit case. As a proof of concept, we study the electrical double layer of an electroneutral mixture of oppositely charged colloids and small microions, with an asymmetry 1:333 in size and 1:10 in valence, in salt-free and added salt environments. Our theoretical approach displays a good agreement regarding the ionic profiles, the integrated charge, and the mean electrostatic potential obtained from molecular dynamics simulations with explicit-sized microions. Although the non-linear Poisson–Boltzmann colloid–colloid and colloid–microion profiles differ notably from those obtained via molecular dynamics simulations with explicit small-sized ions, the associated mean electrostatic potential agrees well with the corresponding explicit microion simulations.},

  abstract = {Some chemical reactions proceed on multiple potential energy surfaces and are often accompanied by a change in spin multiplicity, being called spin-forbidden reactions, where the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects play a crucial role. In order to efficiently investigate spin-forbidden reactions with two spin states, Yang et al. [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 20 , 4129–4136 (2018)] proposed a two-state spin-mixing (TSSM) model, where the SOC effects between the two spin states are simulated by a geometry-independent constant. Inspired by the TSSM model, we suggest a multiple-state spin-mixing (MSSM) model in this paper for the general case with any number of spin states, and its analytic first and second derivatives have been developed for locating stationary points on the mixed-spin potential energy surface and estimating thermochemical energies. To demonstrate the performance of the MSSM model, some spin-forbidden reactions involving 5 d transition elements are calculated using the density functional theory (DFT), and the results are compared with the two-component relativistic ones. It is found that MSSM DFT and two-component DFT calculations may provide very similar stationary-point information on the lowest mixed-spin/spinor energy surface, including structures, vibrational frequencies, and zero-point energies. For the reactions containing saturated 5 d elements, the reaction energies by MSSM DFT and two-component DFT agree very well within 3 kcal/mol. As for the two reactions OsO + + CH 4 → OOs(CH 2 ) + + H 2 and W + CH 4 → WCH 2 + H 2 involving unsaturated 5 d elements, MSSM DFT may also yield good reaction energies of similar accuracy but with some counterexamples. Nevertheless, the energies may be remarkably improved by a posteriori single point energy calculations using two-component DFT at the MSSM DFT optimized geometries, and the maximum error of about 1 kcal/mol is almost independent of the SOC constant used. The MSSM method as well as the developed computer program provides an effective utility for studying spin-forbidden reactions.},

The method is based on a Floquet classical master equation (FCME) derived from a Floquet quantum master equation (FQME), followed by a Wigner transformation to treat nuclear motion classically. We then propose different trajectory surface hopping algorithms to solve the FCME. We find that a Floquet averaged surface hopping with electron density (FaSH-density) algorithm works the best as benchmarked with the FQME, capturing both the fast oscillations due to the driving and the correct steady-state observables. This method will be very useful to study strong light–matter interactions with a manifold of electronic states.},

Training an ML model requires an efficient method for the generation of training data. Here, we apply an accurate and efficient protocol to collect training data for constructing a neural network-based ML interatomic potential for nanosilicate clusters. Initial training data are taken from normal modes and farthest point sampling. Later on, the set of training data is extended via an active learning strategy in which new data are identified by the disagreement between an ensemble of ML models. The whole process is further accelerated by parallel sampling over structures. We use the ML model to run molecular dynamics simulations of nanosilicate clusters with various sizes, from which infrared spectra with anharmonicity included can be extracted. Such spectroscopic data are needed for understanding the properties of silicate dust grains in the interstellar medium and in circumstellar environments.},

There have been a number of recent advances exploiting the quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework for RET. Here, we extend the QED RET theory to investigate whether real photon exchange can allow for excitation transfer over very long distances if the exchanged photon is waveguided. To study this problem, we consider RET in two spatial dimensions. We derive the RET matrix element using QED in two dimensions, consider an even greater confinement by deriving the RET matrix element for a two-dimensional waveguide using ray theory, and compare the resulting RET elements in 3D and 2D and for the 2D waveguide. We see greatly enhanced RET rates over long distances for both the 2D and 2D waveguide systems and see a great preference for transverse photon mediated transfer in the 2D waveguide system.},

We compute all-electron atomization energies for the challenging first-row molecules C 2 , CN, N 2 , and O 2 and find that the TC method yields chemically accurate results using only the cc-pVTZ basis set, roughly matching the accuracy of non-TC calculations with the much larger cc-pV5Z basis set. We also investigate an approximation in which pure three-body excitations are neglected from the TC-FCIQMC dynamics, saving storage and computational costs, and show that it affects relative energies negligibly. Our results demonstrate that the combination of tailored real-space Jastrow factors with the multi-configurational TC-FCIQMC method provides a route to obtaining chemical accuracy using modest basis sets, obviating the need for basis-set extrapolation and composite techniques.},

The model presents nontrivial features due to the two interacting small macrocycles but is simple enough to be treated analytically in limiting regimes. Among the results obtained, we find a mapping into an equivalent [2]-catenane that reveals the implications of the no-pumping theorem stating that to generate net motion of the small macrocycles, both energies and barriers need to change. In the adiabatic limit (slow driving), we fully characterize the motor’s dynamics and show that the net motion of the small macrocycles is expressed as a surface integral in parameter space, which corrects previous erroneous results. We also analyze the performance of the motor subjected to step-wise driving protocols in the absence and presence of an applied load. Optimization strategies for generating large currents and maximizing free energy transduction are proposed. This simple model provides interesting clues into the working principles of non-autonomous molecular motors and their optimization.},

  abstract = {Understanding photoluminescent mechanisms has become essential for photocatalytic, biological, and electronic applications. Unfortunately, analyzing excited state potential energy surfaces (PESs) in large systems is computationally expensive, and hence limited with electronic structure methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Inspired by the sTDDFT and sTDA methods, time-dependent density functional theory plus tight binding (TDDFT + TB) has been shown to reproduce linear response TDDFT results much faster than TDDFT, particularly in large nanoparticles. For photochemical processes, however, methods must go beyond the calculation of excitation energies. Herein, this work outlines an analytical approach to obtain the derivative of the vertical excitation energy in TDDFT + TB for more efficient excited state PES exploration. The gradient derivation is based on the Z vector method, which utilizes an auxiliary Lagrangian to characterize the excitation energy. The gradient is obtained when the derivatives of the Fock matrix, the coupling matrix, and the overlap matrix are all plugged into the auxiliary Lagrangian, and the Lagrange multipliers are solved. This article outlines the derivation of the analytical gradient, discusses the implementation in Amsterdam Modeling Suite, and provides proof of concept by analyzing the emission energy and optimized excited state geometry calculated by TDDFT and TDDFT + TB for small organic molecules and noble metal nanoclusters.},

  abstract = {Forward flux sampling (FFS) is a path sampling technique widely used in computer simulations of crystal nucleation from the melt. In such studies, the order parameter underpinning the progress of the FFS algorithm is often the size of the largest crystalline nucleus. In this work, we investigate the effects of two computational aspects of FFS simulations, using the prototypical Lennard-Jones liquid as our computational test bed. First, we quantify the impact of the positioning of the liquid basin and first interface in the space of the order parameter. In particular, we demonstrate that these choices are key to ensuring the consistency of the FFS results. Second, we focus on the frequently encountered scenario where the population of crystalline nuclei is such that there are multiple clusters of size comparable to the largest one. We demonstrate the contribution of clusters other than the largest cluster to the initial flux; however, we also show that they can be safely ignored for the purposes of converging a full FFS calculation. We also investigate the impact of different clusters merging, a process that appears to be facilitated by substantial spatial correlations—at least at the supercooling considered here. Importantly, all of our results have been obtained as a function of system size, thus contributing to the ongoing discussion on the impact of finite size effects on simulations of crystal nucleation. Overall, this work either provides or justifies several practical guidelines for performing FFS simulations that can also be applied to more complex and/or computationally expensive models.},

  abstract = {Since the 1920s, the Enskog solutions to the Boltzmann equation have provided a route to predicting the transport properties of dilute gas mixtures. At higher densities, predictions have been limited to gases of hard spheres. In this work, we present a revised Enskog theory for multicomponent mixtures of Mie fluids, where the Barker–Henderson perturbation theory is used to calculate the radial distribution function at contact. With parameters of the Mie-potentials regressed to equilibrium properties, the theory is fully predictive for transport properties. The presented framework offers a link between the Mie potential and transport properties at elevated densities, giving accurate predictions for real fluids. For mixtures of noble gases, diffusion coefficients from experiments are reproduced within ±4\%. For hydrogen, the predicted self-diffusion coefficient is within 10\% of experimental data up to 200 MPa and at temperatures above 171 K. Binary diffusion coefficients of the CO 2 /CH 4 mixture from simulations are reproduced within 20\% at pressures up to 14.7 MPa. Except for xenon in the vicinity of the critical point, the thermal conductivity of noble gases and their mixtures is reproduced within 10\% of the experimental data. For other molecules than noble gases, the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity is under-predicted, while the density dependence appears to be correctly predicted. Predictions of the viscosity are within ±10\% of the experimental data for methane, nitrogen, and argon up to 300 bar, for temperatures ranging from 233 to 523 K. At pressures up to 500 bar and temperatures from 200 to 800 K, the predictions are within ±15\% of the most accurate correlation for the viscosity of air. Comparing the theory to an extensive set of measurements of thermal diffusion ratios, we find that 49\% of the model predictions are within ±20\% of the reported measurements. The predicted thermal diffusion factor differs by less than 15\% from the simulation results of Lennard-Jones mixtures, even at densities well exceeding the critical density.},

  abstract = {Tunneling splittings observed in molecular rovibrational spectra are significant evidence for tunneling motion of hydrogen nuclei in water clusters. Accurate calculations of the splitting sizes from first principles require a combination of high-quality inter-atomic interactions and rigorous methods to treat the nuclei with quantum mechanics. Many theoretical efforts have been made in recent decades. This Perspective focuses on two path-integral based tunneling splitting methods whose computational cost scales well with the system size, namely, the ring-polymer instanton method and the path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method. From a simple derivation, we show that the former is a semiclassical approximation to the latter, despite that the two methods are derived very differently. Currently, the PIMD method is considered to be an ideal route to rigorously compute the ground-state tunneling splitting, while the instanton method sacrifices some accuracy for a significantly smaller computational cost. An application scenario of such a quantitatively rigorous calculation is to test and calibrate the potential energy surfaces of molecular systems by spectroscopic accuracy. Recent progress in water clusters is reviewed, and the current challenges are discussed.},

  abstract = {Many biological processes are regulated by allosteric mechanisms that communicate with distant sites in the protein responsible for functionality. The binding of a small molecule at an allosteric site typically induces conformational changes that propagate through the protein along allosteric pathways regulating enzymatic activity. Elucidating those communication pathways from allosteric sites to orthosteric sites is, therefore, essential to gain insights into biochemical processes. Targeting the allosteric pathways by mutagenesis can allow the engineering of proteins with desired functions. Furthermore, binding small molecule modulators along the allosteric pathways is a viable approach to target reactions using allosteric inhibitors/activators with temporal and spatial selectivity. Methods based on network theory can elucidate protein communication networks through the analysis of pairwise correlations observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using molecular descriptors that serve as proxies for allosteric information. Typically, single atomic descriptors such as α-carbon displacements are used as proxies for allosteric information. Therefore, allosteric networks are based on correlations revealed by that descriptor. Here, we introduce a Python software package that provides a comprehensive toolkit for studying allostery from MD simulations of biochemical systems. MDiGest offers the ability to describe protein dynamics by combining different approaches, such as correlations of atomic displacements or dihedral angles, as well as a novel approach based on the correlation of Kabsch–Sander electrostatic couplings. MDiGest allows for comparisons of networks and community structures that capture physical information relevant to allostery. Multiple complementary tools for studying essential dynamics include principal component analysis, root mean square fluctuation, as well as secondary structure-based analyses.},

  abstract = {SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, initiates cell invasion by deploying a receptor binding domain (RBD) to recognize the host transmembrane peptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Numerous experimental and theoretical studies have adopted high-throughput and structure-guided approaches to (i) understand how the RBD recognizes ACE2, (ii) rationalize, and (iii) predict the effect of viral mutations on the binding affinity. Here, we investigate the allosteric signal triggered by the dissociation of the ACE2-RBD complex. To this end, we construct an Elastic Network Model (ENM), and we use the Structural Perturbation Method (SPM). Our key result is that complex dissociation opens the ACE2 substrate-binding cleft located away from the interface and that fluctuations of the ACE2 binding cleft are facilitated by RBD binding. These and other observations provide a structural and dynamical basis for the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 enzymatic activity. In addition, we identify a conserved glycine (G502 in SARS-CoV-2) as a key participant in complex disassembly.},

  abstract = {Mutations in protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are connected to intellectual disability and cancer. It has been hypothesized that these mutations might disrupt the autoinhibition and phosphorylation-induced activation of PP2A. Since they are located far from both the active and substrate binding sites, it is unclear how they exert their effect. We performed allosteric pathway analysis based on molecular dynamics simulations and combined it with biochemical experiments to investigate the autoinhibition of PP2A. In the wild type (WT), the C-arm of the regulatory subunit B56δ obstructs the active and substrate binding sites exerting a dual autoinhibition effect. We find that the disease mutant, E198K, severely weakens the allosteric pathways that stabilize the C-arm in the WT. Instead, the strongest allosteric pathways in E198K take a different route that promotes exposure of the substrate binding site. To facilitate the allosteric pathway analysis, we introduce a path clustering algorithm for lumping pathways into channels. We reveal remarkable similarities between the allosteric channels of E198K and those in phosphorylation-activated WT, suggesting that the autoinhibition can be alleviated through a conserved mechanism. In contrast, we find that another disease mutant, E200K, which is in spatial proximity of E198, does not repartition the allosteric pathways leading to the substrate binding site; however, it may still induce exposure of the active site. This finding agrees with our biochemical data, allowing us to predict the activity of PP2A with the phosphorylated B56δ and provide insight into how disease mutations in spatial proximity alter the enzymatic activity in surprisingly different mechanisms.},

We consider a variety of concentrations and phase structures, including micellar solutions and liquid crystal phases. It is shown that the viscosity of micellar solutions increases as a function of concentration, in agreement with what is expected from experimental data. We also show that micelles can exhibit shear-thinning behavior when a shear force is applied, which is a result of micelles breaking down into smaller aggregates. Lamellar and hexagonal phases are found to orientate under the application of shear, in agreement with experimental observations. It is normally suggested that lamellar phases under shear can exhibit a transition between orientations as the shear rate is increased, usually as a result of lower viscosity. We calculate the viscosity for different lamellar phase orientations, showing that, although the viscosity of perpendicular orientations is lower than that of parallel orientations, we do not observe a transition to the perpendicular phase at high shear rates. Finally, we show that the choice of Schmidt number has a significant impact on the results, which is important for determining the correct behavior via simulations.},

In this study, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms that control the mobility of cations with different valences in Nafion membranes. Our results indicate structural differences in binding of monovalent and divalent cations, which gives rise to differences in ion diffusion in Nafion. Monovalent cations are shown to be “territorially” bound, i.e., bound while partially hydrated, to the fixed charge groups whereas divalent cations are shown to be “site” bound, i.e., bound while fully dehydrated, to the charge groups on the polymer. This difference in binding structure gives rise to differences in transport characteristics of cations in Nafion.},

  abstract = {Nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) is a popular method for creating polymeric particles with internal microstructure, but many fundamental questions remain surrounding the kinetics of the complex coupled mass transfer and phase separation processes. In this work, we use simulations of a phase-field model to examine how (i) finite domain boundaries of a polymer droplet and (ii) solvent/nonsolvent miscibility affect the NIPS process. To isolate the effects of phase separation kinetics and solvent/nonsolvent mass transfer on the NIPS process, we study two different cases. First, we investigate droplet concentrations that originate inside the two-phase region, where phase separation kinetics alone governs the microstructure. Second, we investigate the effects of solvent/nonsolvent mass transfer by studying droplet concentrations that begin outside the two-phase region, where both phase separation kinetics and mass transfer play a role. In both cases, we find that qualitative NIPS behavior is a strong function of the relative location of the initial droplet composition with respect to the phase diagram. We also find that polymer/nonsolvent miscibility competes with solvent/nonsolvent miscibility in driving NIPS kinetic behavior. Finally, we examine polymer droplets undergoing solvent/nonsolvent exchange and find that the model predicts droplets that shrink with nearly Fickian diffusion kinetics. We conclude with a brief perspective on the state of simulations of NIPS processes and some recommendations for future work.},

  abstract = {In modern electronics and power systems, good-performance dielectric capacitors have an essential function. Polymer-based dielectrics are widely used in the field of dielectric capacitors because of their large dielectric constant, flexibility, low density, and ease of processing. At present, ferroelectric polymers suffer from low breakdown field strength and high dielectric losses. How to improve the performance of dielectric materials in capacitors is still a promising research. This paper chooses the ferroelectric polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) that worked as the matrix, and the linear polymers polyimide, cyanoethyl pullulan (CR-S), polyethersulfone, and cyanoethylated cellulose served as fillers. This all-organic dielectric composite produced as films working in electrostatic energy storage devices is prepared by using a casting method. Analyzing the test results, the composite film exhibited excellent electrical properties when the CR-S doping content was 5 wt.\%. The organic composite dielectric based on CR-S/PVDF has a breakdown field strength of 450 MV/m, a discharge energy storage density ( U e ) of 10.3 J/cm 3 , a high dielectric constant of 10.9, and a low dielectric loss of 0.004 at 1 kHz, which is a significant improvement compared with other dielectric composites. This all-organic dielectric composite strategy offers a new approach to achieve better-performance dielectric energy storage materials.},

For a quantitative analysis of small-angle x-ray scattering on this model system, we complemented the measurements with densitometry, conductimetry, and contrast-variation small-angle neutron scattering. The analysis points to two main findings: first, the vesicles formed to contain a much higher mole fraction (0.61–0.64) of TDMAO than the bulk sample (0.43) and predicted by Regular Solution Theory (RST, 0.46). In consequence, the unimer concentration of LiPFO is more than 5 times higher than predicted by RST. Second, the vesicle bilayer is asymmetric with a higher fraction of LiPFO on the outside. These findings on a model system should be of broader relevance for the understanding of similar mixed surfactant vesicle systems and thereby also be of importance for their use in a number of applications.},

In this study, potential-dependent electrode Sum Frequency Generation (SFG) intensities of polycrystalline gold electrodes in HClO 4 and H 2 SO 4 electrolytes were thoroughly analyzed. The potential of zero charges (PZC) of the electrodes was −0.06 and 0.38 V in HClO 4 and H 2 SO 4 , respectively, determined from differential capacity curves. Without specific adsorption, the total SFG intensity was dominated by the contribution from the Au surface and increased similar to that of the visible (VIS) wavelength scanning, which pushed the SFG process closer to the double resonant condition in HClO 4 . However, the EDL contributed about 30\% SFG signal with specific adsorption in H 2 SO 4 . Below PZC, the total SFG intensity was dominated by the Au surface contribution and increased with potential at a similar slope in these two electrolytes. Around PZC, as the EDL structure became less ordered and the electric field changed direction, there would be no EDL SFG contribution. Above PZC, the total SFG intensity increased much more rapidly with potential in H 2 SO 4 than in HClO 4 , which suggested that the EDL SFG contribution kept increasing with more specific adsorbed surface ions from H 2 SO 4 .},

Here, we investigate the condensation of humid air at low subcooling condition (11 °C), similar to conditions for natural dew capture, and explore how water contact angle and contact angle hysteresis affect the rates of water capture. We compare water collection on three families of surfaces: (i) hydrophilic (polyethylene oxide, MPEO) and hydrophobic (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) molecularly thin coatings grafted on smooth silicon wafers, which produce slippery covalently attached liquid surfaces (SCALSs), with low contact angle hysteresis (CAH = 6°); (ii) the same coatings grafted on rougher glass, with high CAH (20°–25°); (iii) hydrophilic polymer surfaces [poly( N -vinylpyrrolidone), PNVP] with high CAH (30°). Upon exposure to water, the MPEO SCALS swell, which likely further increases their droplet shedding ability. MPEO and PDMS coatings collect similar volume of water (around 5 l m −2 day −1 ), both when they are SCALS and non-slippery. Both MPEO and PDMS layers collect about 20\% more water than PNVP surfaces. We present a basic model showing that, under low heat flux conditions, on all MPEO and PDMS layers, the droplets are so small (600–2000 µ m) that there is no/low heat conduction resistance across the droplets, irrespective of the exact value of contact angle and CAH. As the time to first droplet departure is much faster on MPEO SCALS (28 min) than on PDMS SCALS (90 min), slippery hydrophilic surfaces are preferable in dew collection applications where the collection time frame is limited.},

In this paper, we consider a helical chain of atomic p ± orbitals having the tangential angular momentum l = ±1. We show in this model that the coupling of l and the spin gives rise to spin-velocity locking, i.e., directions of spin and group velocity are parallel or antiparallel depending on the chirality of the helix, and consequently, an almost perfect spin selectivity in a specific energy region in a wide range of the curvature and the torsion of the helix. We find that the present spin-velocity locking originates from the helical symmetry in which the Hamiltonian is invariant with respect to a combined operation of the rotation around the helix axis and the translation along the helix axis. Therefore, we expect that spin-velocity locking occurs in a wide variety of helical structures.},

Here, we demonstrate the surface plasmonic coupling of Au nanoparticles (ANPs) with ultrathin h -BN nanosheets (BNNS) in nonspecific nanocomposites leading to a great enhancement of the Raman signal of E 2g in both experimental and theoretical manner. The nanocomposites were fabricated from liquid-exfoliated atomically thin BNNS and diblock copolymer-based ANPs with excellent dispersion through a self-assembly approach. By precisely varying the size of ANPs from 3 to 9 nm, the Raman signal of BNNS was improved from 1.7 to 71. In addition, the underlying mechanism has been explored from the aspects of electromagnetic field coupling strength between the localized surface plasmons excited from ANPs and the surrounding dielectric h -BN layers, as well as the charge transfer at the BNNS/ANPs interfaces. Moreover, we also demonstrate its capability to detect dye molecules as a surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate. This work provides a basis for the self-assembly of BNNS hierarchical nanocomposites allowing for plasmon-mediated modulation of their optoelectronic properties, thereby showing the great potential not only in the field of SERS but also in large-scale h -BN-based plasmonic devices.},

  abstract = {The rate of CO formation from CO 2 reduction on Pt(111) vicinal surfaces containing (100) steps, Pt(S)[n(111) × (100)], has been investigated using cyclic voltammetry. To obtain further information about the different roles of terrace and step atoms in this reaction, selective modification of step sites with either bismuth or copper has been performed. In this way, two different mechanistic regimes have been differentiated, depending on the potential range. In the high potential region, between 0.2 and 0.4 V RHE, CO 2 is activated on steps and proceeds to the formation of adsorbed CO even when there is no hydrogen adsorbed on the terrace. We suggest that protonation of the activated CO 2 uses protons from the solution. In this potential range, the activity decreases after the selective blockage of step sites with bismuth, while the deposition of copper on steps increases the activity. Contrarily, in the low potential region, below 0.2 V RHE, the presence of copper on the steps does not increase the amount of CO formed from CO 2 reduction. In fact, the amount of CO formed attains the same saturation value with or without copper. In addition, the CO formed in this potential region remains adsorbed near step sites as shown in the voltammetric profile. We rationalize these observations considering that, in this potential region, activated CO 2 reacts with adsorbed hydrogen and the reactions stop when hydrogen near the steps is depleted.},

  abstract = {The calculation of relative energy difference has significant practical applications, such as determining adsorption energy, screening for optimal catalysts with volcano plots, and calculating reaction energies. Although Density Functional Theory (DFT) is effective in calculating relative energies through systematic error cancellation, the accuracy of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in this regard remains uncertain. To address this, we analyzed ∼483 × 10 6 pairs of energy differences predicted by DFT and GNNs using the Open Catalyst 2020-Dense dataset. Our analysis revealed that GNNs exhibit a correlated error that can be reduced through subtraction, challenging the assumption of independent errors in GNN predictions and leading to more precise energy difference predictions. To assess the magnitude of error cancellation in chemically similar pairs, we introduced a new metric, the subgroup error cancellation ratio. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art GNN models can achieve error reduction of up to 77\% in these subgroups, which is comparable to the error cancellation observed with DFT. This significant error cancellation allows GNNs to achieve higher accuracy than individual energy predictions and distinguish subtle energy differences. We propose the marginal correct sign ratio as a metric to evaluate this performance. Additionally, our results show that the similarity in local embeddings is related to the magnitude of error cancellation, indicating the need for a proper training method that can augment the embedding similarity for chemically similar adsorbate–catalyst systems.},

  abstract = {Fluid flow in miniature devices is often characterized by a boundary “slip” at the wall, as opposed to the classical paradigm of a “no-slip” boundary condition. While the traditional mathematical description of fluid flow as expressed by the differential forms of mass and momentum conservation equations may still suffice in explaining the resulting flow physics, one inevitable challenge against a correct quantitative depiction of the flow velocities from such considerations remains in ascertaining the correct slip velocity at the wall in accordance with the complex and convoluted interplay of exclusive interfacial phenomena over molecular scales. Here, we report an analytic engine that applies combined physics-based and data-driven modeling to arrive at a quantitative depiction of the interfacial slip via a molecular-dynamics-trained machine learning algorithm premised on fluid structuration at the wall. The resulting mapping of the system parameters to a single signature data that bridges the molecular and continuum descriptions is envisaged to be a preferred computationally inexpensive route as opposed to expensive multi-scale or molecular simulations that may otherwise be inadequate to resolve the flow features over experimentally tractable physical scales.},

This approach is based on a single component fluid with particles that are artificially grouped into separate species labeled by “colors.” The resulting mobility matrix depends on a single dimensionless parameter, which can be determined efficiently from experimental data or numerical simulations, and includes existing standard forms as special cases. We identify two distinct mobility regimes, corresponding to collective motion and interdiffusion, respectively, and show how they emerge from the microscopic properties of the fluid. As a test scenario, we study the dynamics after a thermal quench, providing a number of general relations and analytical insights from a Gaussian theory. Specifically, for systems with two or three components, analytical results for the time evolution of the equal time correlation function compare well to results of Monte Carlo simulations of a lattice gas. A rich behavior is observed, including the possibility of transient fractionation.},

Bulk solution data have been collected for stearic acid in cyclohexane and in toluene to quantify the extent of self-association of the acid in terms of the dimer self-dissociation constant, K d . Composition and temperature-dependent experimental data have been collected to determine K d , the enthalpy of dissociation, and temperature-dependent infrared molar absorption coefficients. The interaction of stearic acid with small amounts of water present in non-aqueous solvents is also addressed and quantified with a hetero-dissociation (or dehydration) constant, K h . Existing data for acetic acid are also considered. The model connects K d and K h to the vapor-phase association equilibria. Solute dipole–solvent quadrupole interactions are shown to have a major effect on K d in quadrupolar liquids, such as toluene, benzene, and CS 2 . This work provides important background as a prelude to adsorption studies of these additives from non-aqueous solvents to solid surfaces with relevance to commercial fluids, such as oil-based corrosion inhibitors and friction modifiers. Moreover, the presented theory of the solvent effect on K d is a first step to generalization of standard implicit solvent models in computational chemistry (such as the polarizable continuum model) to media of significant quadrupolar strength. This is expected to be particularly important for polar species dissolved in CO 2 relevant for carbon capture and storage where appropriate models do not currently exist.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the physical properties of ionic liquids (ILs), such as the surface tension and speed of sound, is important for both industrial and research applications. Unfortunately, technical challenges and costs limit exhaustive experimental screening efforts of ILs for these critical properties. Previous work has demonstrated that the use of quantum-mechanics-based thermochemical property prediction tools, such as the conductor-like screening model for real solvents, when combined with machine learning (ML) approaches, may provide an alternative pathway to guide the rapid screening and design of ILs for desired physiochemical properties. However, the question of which machine-learning approaches are most appropriate remains. In the present study, we examine how different ML architectures, ranging from tree-based approaches to feed-forward artificial neural networks, perform in generating nonlinear multivariate quantitative structure–property relationship models for the prediction of the temperature- and pressure-dependent surface tension of and speed of sound in ILs over a wide range of surface tensions (16.9–76.2 mN/m) and speeds of sound (1009.7–1992 m/s). The ML models are further interrogated using the powerful interpretation method, shapley additive explanations. We find that several different ML models provide high accuracy, according to traditional statistical metrics. The decision tree-based approaches appear to be the most accurate and precise, with extreme gradient-boosting trees and gradient-boosting trees being the best performers. However, our results also indicate that the promise of using machine-learning to gain deep insights into the underlying physics driving structure–property relationships in ILs may still be somewhat premature.},

  abstract = {In various types of many-particle systems, bidispersity is frequently used to avoid spontaneous ordering in particle configurations. In this study, the relation between bidispersity and disorder degree of particle configurations is investigated. By using magnetic dipole–dipole interaction, magnet particles are dispersed in a two-dimensional cell without any physical contact between them. In this magnetic system, bidispersity is introduced by mixing large and small magnets. Then, the particle system is compressed to produce a uniform particle configuration. The compressed particle configuration is analyzed by using Voronoi tessellation for evaluating the disorder degree, which strongly depends on bidispersity. Specifically, the standard deviation and skewness of the Voronoi cell area distribution are measured. As a result, we find that the peak of standard deviation is observed when the numbers of large and small particles are almost identical. Although the skewness shows a non-monotonic behavior, a zero skewness state (symmetric distribution) can be achieved when the numbers of large and small particles are identical. In this ideally random (disordered) state, the ratio between pentagonal, hexagonal, and heptagonal Voronoi cells becomes roughly identical, while hexagons are dominant under monodisperse (ordered) conditions. The relation between Voronoi cell analysis and the global bond orientational order parameter is also discussed.},

The mode specificity of H 2 O/Ni(100) is very different from that of H 2 O/Ni(111) or H 2 O/Cu(111) whose reactivity enhancement by vibrational excitations is quite efficient. For H 2 O/Ni(100), it is found that the excitation in the symmetric stretching mode is more efficacious than increasing the translational energy in promoting the reaction, while the excitations in the asymmetric stretching mode and bending mode are less efficacious than the translational energy at low collision energies. These interesting observations can be attributed to the near central-barrier reaction for H 2 O/Ni(100), as well as large discrepancies between the site-specific mode specificities at different impact sites. The mode-specific dynamics obtained in this study is different from that obtained with the reaction path Hamiltonian approach, indicating the importance of full-dimensional quantum dynamics for gas–surface reactions.},

  abstract = {The diverse and tunable electronic structures of perylenediimide (PDI), together with its high thermal and chemical stability, make the compound suitable for applications in bioimaging, electrical, and optical devices. However, a large singlet–triplet gap (Δ E S – T ) and almost zero spin–orbit coupling (SOC) between the lowest excited singlet ( S 1 ) and triplet ( T 1 ) restrict intersystem crossing (ISC) in highly fluorescent pristine PDI, yielding a near zero triplet quantum yield (Φ T ). Interestingly, a thione analogs of PDI with varied S content ( m S-PDIs, m = 1–4) was experimentally shown to yield Φ T ∼ 1.0 through efficient ISC. Time-dependent optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid calculations are performed to rationalize the experimentally observed red-shifted optical absorption and also the remarkably high ISC with almost zero radiative fluorescence reported for these m S-PDIs. To this end, the relative energies of low-lying excited singlets S n ( n = 1, 2) and a few triplets T n ( n = 1–3), along with their nature ( nπ * or ππ *), are assessed for each of the m S-PDIs studied in chloroform. To our surprise and contrary to the earlier reports, both S 1 and T 1 are found to be of the same ππ * character, originating from the highest occupied to lowest unoccupied orbital transition, which, therefore, leads to a still large Δ E S – T and vanishingly small SOC, as expected from the identical wavefunction symmetry. Increasing S content lowers S 1 ( ππ *) due to a greater extent of π -delocalization, which well complements and supports the observed red-shift. More importantly, the T 2 (or T 3 ) closely lying to the S 1 is of nπ * and, therefore, produces a relatively smaller Δ E S – T and larger SOC. Detailed kinetics analysis suggests S 1 ( ππ *) → T 2 ( nπ *) is the primary ISC channel for all m S-PDIs, which is responsible for the remarkably high Φ T observed. In addition, comparable SOC and Δ E S – T produce similar ISC rates for all m S-PDIs.},

This is the case, for example, of phase transitions, phase equilibria, nucleation events, and defect propagation, to mention a few. A detailed comprehension of local atomic environments and of their dynamic rearrangements is essential to understand such phenomena and also to draw structure–property relationships useful to unveil how to control complex molecular systems. Considerable progress in the development of advanced structural descriptors [e.g., Smooth Overlap of Atomic Position (SOAP), etc.] has certainly enhanced the representation of atomic-scale simulations data. However, despite such efforts, local dynamic environment rearrangements still remain difficult to elucidate. Here, exploiting the structurally rich description of atomic environments of SOAP and building on the concept of time-dependent local variations, we developed a SOAP-based descriptor, Time SOAP ( τ SOAP), which essentially tracks time variations in local SOAP environments surrounding each molecule (i.e., each SOAP center) along ensemble trajectories. We demonstrate how analysis of the time-series τ SOAP data and of their time derivatives allows us to detect dynamic domains and track instantaneous changes of local atomic arrangements (i.e., local fluctuations) in a variety of molecular systems. The approach is simple and general, and we expect that it will help shed light on a variety of complex dynamical phenomena.},

  abstract = {The rise of machine learning has greatly influenced the field of computational chemistry and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in particular. One of its most exciting prospects is the development of accurate, full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) for molecules and clusters, which, however, often require thousands to tens of thousands of ab initio data points restricting the community to medium sized molecules and/or lower levels of theory (e.g., density functional theory). Transfer learning, which improves a global PES from a lower to a higher level of theory, offers a data efficient alternative requiring only a fraction of the high-level data (on the order of 100 are found to be sufficient for malonaldehyde). This work demonstrates that even with Hartree–Fock theory and a double-zeta basis set as the lower level model, transfer learning yields coupled-cluster single double triple [CCSD(T)]-level quality for H-transfer barrier energies, harmonic frequencies, and H-transfer tunneling splittings. Most importantly, finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations on the sub- μ s time scale in the gas phase are possible and the infrared spectra determined from the transfer-learned PESs are in good agreement with the experiment. It is concluded that routine, long-time atomistic simulations on PESs fulfilling CCSD(T)-standards become possible.},

  abstract = {We describe a novel ultrahigh vacuum state-to-state molecule/surface scattering apparatus with quantum state preparation of the incident molecular beam and angle-resolved quantum state detection of the scattered molecules. State-resolved detection is accomplished using a tunable mid-infrared laser source combined with a cryogenic bolometer detector and is applicable to any molecule with an infrared-active vibrational transition. Results on rotationally inelastic scattering of CH 4 methane from a Ni(111) surface and NiO(111)/Ni(111) oxide film, obtained by the new apparatus, are presented. Molecules scattering from the oxidized surface, compared to those scattering from the bare nickel surface, are more highly excited rotationally and scatter into a broader distribution of angles. The internal alignment of molecular rotation is in addition found to be stronger in molecules scattering from the bare surface. Furthermore, the maxima of the state-resolved angular distributions shift toward and away from surface normal with increasing rotational quantum number J for the oxidized and bare surface, respectively. Finally, the rotational state populations produced in scattering from the oxidized surface are well-described by a Boltzmann distribution, while those produced in scattering from the bare surface exhibit large deviations from their best-fit Boltzmann distributions. These results point toward a marked enhancement in molecule–surface collisional energy exchange induced by oxidation of the nickel surface.},

  abstract = {The application of nonlinear optical effects in optoelectronic devices is still scarce because the irradiance threshold necessary to induce a specific effect is very high. In this context, knowing the frequency-resolved first order molecular hyperpolarizability (β) is essential to identifying regions where this response is intense enough to allow for applications in commercial devices. Thus, herein, we have determined the β spectral dependence of five new push–pull cinnamylidene acetophenone derivatives using femtosecond laser-induced Hyper-Rayleigh Scattering (HRS). A considerable increase in β values was observed in molecules. We found remarkable β values in regions near the two-photon resonance, which are mediated by electron withdrawing and donating groups. This effect was mapped using wavelength-tunable femtosecond Z-scan technique. Furthermore, it was modeled in light of the sum-over-states approach for the second- and third-order nonlinearities. Finally, our outcomes suggest a strategy to obtain large β values mediated by the 2PA transition.},

  abstract = {It has been well-established that the topography around conical intersections between excited electronic states is incorrectly described by coupled cluster and many other single reference theories (the intersections are “defective”). Despite this, we show both analytically and numerically that the geometric phase effect (GPE) is correctly reproduced upon traversing a path around a defective excited-state conical intersection (CI) in coupled cluster theory. The theoretical analysis is carried out by using a non-Hermitian generalization of the linear vibronic coupling approach. Interestingly, the approach qualitatively explains the characteristic (incorrect) shape of the defective CIs and CI seams. Moreover, the validity of the approach and the presence of the GPE indicate that defective CIs are local (and not global) artifacts. This implies that a sufficiently accurate coupled cluster method could predict nuclear dynamics, including geometric phase effects, as long as the nuclear wavepacket never gets too close to the conical intersections.},

We use this scheme to investigate recent α -ketoamide inhibitors targeting the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We assessed the reliability and the coherence of the hybrid scheme, in particular, by checking the ability of MM and DFT to reproduce results from high-end ab initio computations regarding such inhibitors. The DFT approach enables an a posteriori fragmentation of the system and an investigation into the strength of interaction among identified fragment pairs. We show the necessity of accounting for a large set of plausible protease/inhibitor conformations to generate reliable interaction data.

Extensive molecular simulations are performed on a set of RNA tetramers and hexamers and combined with available nucleic-magnetic-resonance data. Within the new framework, the sampled structural dynamics can be reweighted to match experimental data while the error arising from inaccuracies in the forward models can be corrected simultaneously and consequently does not leak into the reweighted ensemble. Carefully crafted cross-validation procedure and regularization terms enable obtaining transferable Karplus parameters. Our approach identifies the optimal regularization strength and new sets of Karplus parameters balancing good agreement between simulations and experiments with minimal changes to the original ensemble.},

While there exists no unique consensus on a rigorous and efficient implementation of coupled electron–nuclear quantum dynamics, it is recognized that these problems scale exponentially with system size on classical processors and, therefore, may benefit from quantum computing implementations. Here, we introduce a methodology for the efficient quantum treatment of the electron–nuclear problem on near-term quantum computers, based upon the Nuclear–Electronic Orbital (NEO) approach. We generalize the electronic two-qubit tapering scheme to include nuclei by exploiting symmetries inherent in the NEO framework, thereby reducing the Hamiltonian dimension, number of qubits, gates, and measurements needed for calculations. We also develop parameter transfer and initialization techniques, which improve convergence behavior relative to conventional initialization. These techniques are applied to H 2 and malonaldehyde for which results agree with NEO full configuration interaction and NEO complete active space configuration interaction benchmarks for ground state energy to within 10 −6 hartree and entanglement entropy to within 10 −4 . These implementations therefore significantly reduce resource requirements for full quantum simulations of molecules on near-term quantum devices while maintaining high accuracy.},

  abstract = {Transient bonds between fast linkers and slower particles are widespread in physical and biological systems. Despite their diverse structure and function, a commonality is that the linkers diffuse on timescales much faster compared to the overall motion of the particles they bind to. This limits numerical and theoretical approaches that need to resolve these diverse timescales with high accuracy. Many models, therefore, resort to effective, yet ad hoc , dynamics, where linker motion is only accounted for when bound. This paper provides a mathematical justification for such coarse-grained dynamics that preserves detailed balance at equilibrium. Our derivation is based on multiscale averaging techniques and is broadly applicable. We verify our results with simulations on a minimal model of fast linker binding to a slow particle. We show how our framework can be applied to various systems, including those with multiple linkers, stiffening linkers upon binding, or slip bonds with force-dependent unbinding. Importantly, the preservation of detailed balance only sets the ratio of the binding to the unbinding rates, but it does not constrain the detailed expression of binding kinetics. We conclude by discussing how various choices of binding kinetics may affect macroscopic dynamics.},

Here, we present the matrix of orthogonalized atomic orbital coefficients (MAOC) as a quantum-inspired molecular and atomic representation containing both structural (composition and geometry) and electronic (charge and spin multiplicity) information. MAOC is based on a cost-effective localization scheme that represents localized orbitals via a predefined set of atomic orbitals. The latter can be constructed from such small atom-centered basis sets as pcseg-0 and STO-3G in conjunction with guess (non-optimized) electronic configuration of the molecule. Importantly, MAOC is suitable for representing monatomic, molecular, and periodic systems and can distinguish compounds with identical compositions and geometries but distinct charges and spin multiplicities. Using principal component analysis, we constructed a more compact but equally powerful version of MAOC—PCX-MAOC. To test the performance of full and reduced MAOC and several other representations (CM, SOAP, SLATM, and SPA H M), we used a kernel ridge regression machine learning model to predict frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ground state single-point energies for chemically diverse neutral and charged, closed- and open-shell molecules from an extended QM7b dataset, as well as two new datasets, N-HPC-1 (N-heteropolycycles) and REDOX (nitroxyl and phenoxyl radicals, carbonyl, and cyano compounds).

In order to circumvent this problem, we use Gaussian process regression to model the energy and use analytical derivatives to produce the specific heat capacity. From there, we also calculate the entropy by numerical integration. We compare our results to cubic splines and finite differences in a variety of molecules in which Hamiltonians can be diagonalized exactly with full configuration interaction.

  abstract = {Recent experiments suggest that mesoscale catalysts are active materials that power their motion with chemical free energy from their environment and also “chemotax” with respect to substrate gradients. In the present work, we explore a thermodynamic framework for relating this chemotaxis to the evolution of a system down the gradient of its free energy. This framework builds upon recent studies that have employed the Wasserstein metric to describe diffusive processes within the Onsager formalism for irreversible thermodynamics. In this work, we modify the Onsager dissipation potential to explicitly couple the reactive flux to the diffusive flux of catalysts. The corresponding gradient flow is a modified reaction-diffusion equation with an advective term that propels the chemotaxis of catalysts with the free energy released by chemical reactions. In order to gain first insights into this framework, we numerically simulate a simplified model for spherical catalysts undergoing artificial chemotaxis in one dimension. These simulations investigate the thermodynamic forces and fluxes that drive this chemotaxis, as well as the resulting dissipation of free energy. Additionally, they demonstrate that chemotaxis can delay the relaxation to equilibrium and, equivalently, prolong the duration of nonequilibrium conditions. Although future simulations should consider a more realistic coupling between reactive and diffusive fluxes, this work may provide insight into the thermodynamics of artificial chemotaxis. More generally, we hope that this work may bring attention to the importance of the Wasserstein metric for relating nonequilibrium relaxation to the thermodynamic free energy and to large deviation principles.},

We show that these differences are a consequence of the poor representation of the linear response within the TFW approximation for the electronic kinetic energy, confirming conjectures in the literature. In so doing, we find that the energy computed from a non-self-consistent Kohn–Sham calculation using the TFW electronic ground state density is in very good agreement with that obtained from the fully self-consistent Kohn–Sham solution.},

  abstract = {We develop a theory of reversible diffusion-controlled reactions with generalized binding/unbinding kinetics. In this framework, a diffusing particle can bind to the reactive substrate after a random number of arrivals onto it, with a given threshold distribution. The particle remains bound to the substrate for a random waiting time drawn from another given distribution and then resumes its bulk diffusion until the next binding and so on. When both distributions are exponential, one retrieves the conventional first-order forward and backward reactions whose reversible kinetics is described by generalized Collins–Kimball’s (or back-reaction) boundary condition. In turn, if either of distributions is not exponential, one deals with generalized (non-Markovian) binding or unbinding kinetics (or both). Combining renewal technique with the encounter-based approach, we derive spectral expansions for the propagator, the concentration of particles, and the diffusive flux on the substrate. We study their long-time behavior and reveal how anomalous rarity of binding or unbinding events due to heavy tails of the threshold and waiting time distributions may affect such reversible diffusion-controlled reactions. Distinctions between time-dependent reactivity, encounter-dependent reactivity, and a convolution-type Robin boundary condition with a memory kernel are elucidated.},

As explained in this work, the DQME supplies a direct approach to investigate the statistical characteristics of dissipatons and, thus, the physically supporting hybrid bath modes. Numerical demonstrations are carried out on the electron transfer model, exhibiting the transient statistical properties of the solvation coordinate.},

  abstract = {The many-body simulation of quantum systems is an active field of research that involves several different methods targeting various computing platforms. Many methods commonly employed, particularly coupled cluster methods, have been adapted to leverage the latest advances in modern high-performance computing. Selected configuration interaction (sCI) methods have seen extensive usage and development in recent years. However, the development of sCI methods targeting massively parallel resources has been explored only in a few research works. Here, we present a parallel, distributed memory implementation of the adaptive sampling configuration interaction approach (ASCI) for sCI. In particular, we will address the key concerns pertaining to the parallelization of the determinant search and selection, Hamiltonian formation, and the variational eigenvalue calculation for the ASCI method. Load balancing in the search step is achieved through the application of memory-efficient determinant constraints originally developed for the ASCI-PT2 method. The presented benchmarks demonstrate near optimal speedup for ASCI calculations of Cr 2 (24e, 30o) with 10 6 , 10 7 , and 3 × 10 8 variational determinants on up to 16 384 CPUs. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the largest variational ASCI calculation to date.},

  abstract = {To advance the foundation of one-particle reduced density matrix functional theory (1RDMFT), we refine and relate some of its fundamental features and underlying concepts. We define by concise means the scope of a 1RDMFT, identify its possible natural variables, and explain how symmetries could be exploited. In particular, for systems with time-reversal symmetry, we explain why there exist six equivalent universal functionals, prove concise relations among them, and conclude that the important notion of v -representability is relative to the scope and choice of variable. All these fundamental concepts are then comprehensively discussed and illustrated for the Hubbard dimer and its generalization to arbitrary pair interactions W . For this, we derive by analytical means the pure and ensemble functionals with respect to both the real- and complex-valued Hilbert space. The comparison of various functionals allows us to solve the underlying v -representability problems analytically, and the dependence of its solution on the pair interaction is demonstrated. Intriguingly, the gradient of each universal functional is found to always diverge repulsively on the boundary of the domain. In that sense, this key finding emphasizes the universal character of the fermionic exchange force, recently discovered and proven in the context of translationally invariant one-band lattice models.},

  abstract = {Many sampling strategies commonly used in molecular dynamics, such as umbrella sampling and alchemical free energy methods, involve sampling from multiple states. The Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) formalism is a widely used way of recombining the resulting data. However, the error of the MBAR estimator is not well-understood: previous error analyses of MBAR assumed independent samples. In this work, we derive a central limit theorem for MBAR estimates in the presence of correlated data, further justifying the use of MBAR in practical applications. Moreover, our central limit theorem yields an estimate of the error that can be decomposed into contributions from the individual Markov chains used to sample the states. This gives additional insight into how sampling in each state affects the overall error. We demonstrate our error estimator on an umbrella sampling calculation of the free energy of isomerization of the alanine dipeptide and an alchemical calculation of the hydration free energy of methane. Our numerical results demonstrate that the time required for the Markov chain to decorrelate in individual states can contribute considerably to the total MBAR error, highlighting the importance of accurately addressing the effect of sample correlation.},

The structures of folded proteins are highly inhomogeneous, giving rise to an anisotropic and non-uniform flow of thermal energy during conformational fluctuations. To illustrate the nature of proteins, we developed a theoretical framework for analyzing local thermal transport properties based on the autocorrelation function formalism, constructed a linear-homopolymer-like model, and applied it to a small α-helical protein, the villin headpiece subdomain (HP36), using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. As a result, the model reproduced the exact value of the protein’s thermal conductivity with an error of less than 1\%. Interestingly, the site-selective analysis of the local, residue-wise, thermal conductivity demonstrated its distinct residue-type dependence, i.e., its magnitude decreased in the order of charged, polar, and hydrophobic residues. In addition, the local density dependence of the residue-wise thermal transport property was also discussed.},

In contrast to closed-shell systems, where G-Int has to be performed only once since the α and β density matrices are the same, spin-unrestricted open-shell systems require G-Int to be performed twice—one for the α spin and another for the β spin density matrix. In this work, we tested the performance of G-Int to the carbon monoxide radical cation CO ●+ and nickelocene complex, which have the doublet and triple ground states, respectively. We found that the Frobenius norm errors associated with the interpolations for the α and β spin density matrices are comparable for a given molecular geometry. These G-Int density matrices, when used as an initial guess for a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation, outperform the conventional SCF guess schemes, such as the superposition of atomic densities, purified superposition of atomic densities, core Hamiltonian, and generalized Wolfsberg–Helmholtz approximation. Depending on the desired accuracy, these G-Int density matrices can be used to directly evaluate the SCF energy without performing SCF iterations. In addition, the spin-unrestricted G-Int density matrices have been used for the first time to directly calculate the atomic charges using the Mulliken and ChElPG population analysis.},

For the water trimer, we discuss the convergence behavior of several properties and show it to be superior when compared to an energy-based truncated basis. It is demonstrated that the optimized basis reduces the necessary number of basis functions by at least an order of magnitude. Finally, the optimization procedure is employed to study larger chains of up to ten water molecules.

An SOP wavefunction can be made more accurate by increasing the number of terms, the rank. When the required rank is large, the runtime of a calculation in CP format is long, although the memory cost is small. To make the method more efficient, we break the full problem into pieces using a contraction tree. The required rank for each of the sub-problems is small.

In ideal nanoscale systems, such as atomically smooth carbon nanotubes, the characteristic lengths reduce to such an extent that the non-equilibrium entrance region comprises a large proportion of the domain. In this regime, the added effective resistance induced by the non-equilibrium entrance region becomes large enough that classical effusion models break down. The mechanisms behind the resistance in this regime are still poorly understood. A stochastic model of interfacial resistance is developed here, which allows for the determination of the effective diffusion coefficient via a novel finite-difference solution. We use this method to model free-molecular gas flow through long nanotubes, showing that such non-equilibrium effects may be present in systems of length scales currently within manufacturing capabilities. Finally, this model is used to discuss gas separation through aligned carbon nanotube arrays, with a focus on the effect of membrane length on the separation of a H 2 –CH 4 mixture.},

  abstract = {The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method is a numerically exact open quantum system dynamics approach. The method is rooted in an exponential expansion of the bath correlation function, which in essence strategically reshapes a continuous environment into a set of effective bath modes that allow for more efficient cutoff at finite temperatures. Based on this understanding, one can map the HEOM method into a Schrödinger-like equation, with a non-Hermitian super-Hamiltonian for an extended wave function being the tensor product of the central system wave function and the Fock state of these effective bath modes. In this work, we explore the possibility of representing the extended wave function as a tree tensor network state (TTNS) and the super-Hamiltonian as a tree tensor network operator of the same structure as the TTNS, as well as the application of a time propagation algorithm using the time-dependent variational principle. Our benchmark calculations based on the spin-boson model with a slow-relaxing bath show that the proposed HEOM+TTNS approach yields consistent results with those of the conventional HEOM method, while the computation is considerably sped up. In addition, the simulation with a genuine TTNS is four times faster than a one-dimensional matrix product state decomposition scheme.},

Below ∼60 K, amorphous water becomes metastable, and the formation of any form of ice I is often implicitly precluded. Using a newly developed low-temperature reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique, we show that crystalline ice with cubic stacking sequences (i.e., ice I c ) formed through Ne sublimation from a solid H 2 O/Ne (1:1000 ratio) matrix at 13 K. The extent of stacking disorder (disordered cubic and hexagonal stacking sequences) in the ice formed by Ne matrix sublimation is smaller than that in vapor-deposited ice I sd prepared at 143 K and below the limit of detection of low-temperature RHEED. Dependence of the resulting ice structures on the thickness of the H 2 O/Ne matrix shows that amorphous water first forms in the early stages of Ne sublimation, and the cubic stacking sequence subsequently takes place. As the cubic ice I c formed here at a much lower temperature (13 K) than previously observed (typically above 78 K), Ne matrix sublimation represents a novel route to the formation of cubic ice I c under low-temperature and low-pressure conditions.},

  abstract = {We develop a theory for the motion of a particle grafted with inhomogeneous bead-spring Rouse chains via the generalized Langevin equation (GLE), where individual grafted polymers are allowed to take different bead friction coefficients, spring constants, and chain lengths. An exact solution of the memory kernel K ( t ) is obtained for the particle in the time ( t ) domain in the GLE, which depends only on the relaxation of the grafted chains. The t -dependent mean square displacement g ( t ) of the polymer-grafted particle is then derived as a function of the friction coefficient γ 0 of the bare particle and K ( t ). Our theory offers a direct way to quantify the contributions of the grafted chain relaxation to the mobility of the particle in terms of K ( t ). This powerful feature enables us to clarify the effect on g ( t ) of dynamical coupling between the particle and grafted chains, leading to the identification of a relaxation time of fundamental importance in polymer-grafted particles, namely, the particle relaxation time. This timescale quantifies the competition between the contributions of the solvent and grafted chains to the friction of the grafted particle and separates g ( t ) into the particle- and chain-dominated regimes. The monomer relaxation time and the grafted chain relaxation time further divide the chain-dominated regime of g ( t ) into subdiffusive and diffusive regimes. Analysis of the asymptotic behaviors of K ( t ) and g ( t ) provides a clear physical picture of the mobility of the particle in different dynamical regimes, shedding light on the complex dynamics of polymer-grafted particles.},

  abstract = {Theories of bulk coacervation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PE) obscure single molecule level thermodynamic details, considered significant for coacervate equilibrium, whereas simulations account for only pairwise Coulomb interaction. Also, studies of effects of asymmetry on PE complexation are rare compared to symmetric PEs. We develop a theoretical model, accounting for all entropic and enthalpic contributions at the molecular level, and the mutual segmental screened Coulomb and excluded volume interactions between two asymmetric PEs, by constructing a Hamiltonian following Edwards and Muthukumar. Assuming maximal ion-pairing in the complex, the system free energy comprising configurational entropy of the polyions and free-ion entropy of the small ions is minimized. The effective charge and size of the complex, larger than sub-Gaussian globules as for symmetric chains, increase with asymmetry in polyion length and charge density. The thermodynamic drive for complexation is found to increase with ionizability of symmetric polyions and with a decrease in asymmetry in length for equally ionizable polyions. The crossover Coulomb strength demarcating the ion-pair enthalpy-driven (low strength) and counterion release entropy-driven (high strength) is marginally dependent on the charge density, because so is the degree of counterion condensation, and strongly dependent on the dielectric environment and salt. The key results match the trends in simulations. The framework may provide a direct way to calculate thermodynamic dependencies of complexation on experimental parameters such as electrostatic strength and salt, thus to better analyze and predict observed phenomena for different sets of polymer pairs.},

In the absence of the EV particles, we extend the previously established universal scaling relations in 2D [Huang et al. , J.

However, unlike in 2D, where the Gaussian regime is absent due to the extreme dominance of the EV interaction, we find that the Gaussian regime is present, albeit very narrow in 3D. The scaled transverse fluctuation in the limit L / ℓ p ≪ 1 is independent of the physical dimension and scales as ⟨ l ⊥ 2 ⟩ / L ∼ ( L / ℓ p ) ζ − 1 ⁠ , where ζ = 1.5 is the roughening exponent. For L / ℓ p ≫ 1, the scaled fluctuation scales as ⟨ l ⊥ 2 ⟩ / L ∼ ( L / ℓ p ) ν − 1 ⁠ , where ν is the Flory exponent for the corresponding spatial dimension ( ν 2 D = 0.75 and ν 3 D = 0.58). When EV particles of different sizes for different area or volume fractions are added into 2D and 3D systems, our results indicate that the crowding density either does not or does only weakly affect the universal scaling relations.

  abstract = {A low-frequency dielectric response of a ferrofluid based on transformer oil and MnZn ferrite nanoparticles is investigated in a gradient magnetic field. Four ferrofluid samples of various nanoparticle concentrations were introduced into planar micro-capacitors located over a magnetized tip. The dielectric spectra were measured in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 200 kHz and in the local magnetic field up to 100 mT. The spectra exhibit a dielectric relaxation ascribed to nanoparticle interfacial polarization. The low-frequency spectrum of each ferrofluid decreases upon application of the magnetic field up to 20 mT. The decrease in dielectric permittivity is caused by a magnetic force acting on larger nanoparticles in the gradient magnetic field. It is assumed that the interfaces of the concentrated nanoparticles in the gradient field do not contribute to the effective dielectric response. This reduces the effective relaxation time and shifts the relaxation toward higher frequencies. The dielectric spectra are well described by a relaxation fit function consisting of one Havriliak–Negami and a conductivity term. The fitting confirms that the only effect of the gradient magnetic field on the dielectric spectra is the shift of the dielectric relaxation and the decrease of the amplitude in the imaginary permittivity. This behavior is evident from a master plot, where all dielectric relaxations are superimposed on a single line. The knowledge of the presented behavior of the ferrofluid may be valuable when applying a ferrofluid to sharply magnetized parts of various electrical equipment (wires, tips, screws, nails, edges) as a liquid dielectric medium.},

Important considerations are correlation with error, overhead during training and inference, and efficient workflows to systematically improve the force field.

Here, we present a generalization of the deep-ensemble design based on multiheaded neural networks and a heteroscedastic loss. It can efficiently deal with uncertainties in both energy and forces and take sources of aleatoric uncertainty affecting the training data into account. We compare uncertainty metrics based on deep ensembles, committees, and bootstrap-aggregation ensembles using data for an ionic liquid and a perovskite surface. We demonstrate an adversarial approach to active learning to efficiently and progressively refine the force fields. That active learning workflow is realistically possible thanks to exceptionally fast training enabled by residual learning and a nonlinear learned optimizer.},

Water vapor’s adsorption and wetting characteristics on a hydroxylated and nano-polished silica substrate were studied in near-equilibrium conditions at temperatures near 298 K. Using a UV–visible interferometer, water vapor adsorbate film thicknesses were measured and converted into amount adsorbed per unit area. The current results show that the wetting transition occurred at an average subcooling value of 0.39 K, less than the predicted value of 0.49 K. All the different experimental observations showed growth of film thickness as a function of subcooling value with a maximum film thickness of 12.6 nm. The analysis of the results further showed that the maximum stable film was in a metastable state that then condensed in a dropwise manner, if perturbed by increasing the subcooling. The study further revealed that the adsorbate is unstable after transitioning. The solid surface energy calculated by including the near-equilibrium observations was comparable and close to that of the equilibrium studies, thus supporting solid surface energy as a material property.},

  abstract = {A photovoltaic device fabricated with conventional zincblende materials can use the Type-II quantum well structure, which spatially separates electrons and holes, to reduce their recombination rate. In order to obtain higher power conversion efficiency, it is desirable to preserve more energetic carriers by engineering a phonon “bottleneck,” a mismatch between the gaps in the well and barrier phonon structure. Such a mismatch leads to poor phonon transport and therefore prevents energy from leaving the system in the form of heat. In this paper, we perform a superlattice phonon calculation to verify the “bottleneck” effect and build on this a model to predict the steady state of the hot electrons under photoexcitation. We describe the electrons and phonons with a coupled Boltzmann equation system and numerically integrate it to get the steady state. We find that inhibited phonon relaxation does lead to a more out-of-equilibrium electron distribution and discuss how this might be enhanced. We examine the different behaviors obtained for various combinations of recombination and relaxation rates and their experimental signatures.},

  abstract = {The effects of a dissolved gas on the behavior of liquid in cylindrical nanopores are investigated in the framework of Gibbsian composite system thermodynamics and classical nucleation theory. An equation is derived relating the phase equilibrium of a mixture of a subcritical solvent and a supercritical gas to the curvature of the liquid–vapor interface. Both the liquid and the vapor phases are treated nonideally, which is shown to be important for the accuracy of the predictions in the case of water with dissolved nitrogen or carbon dioxide. The behavior of water in nanoconfinement is found to be only affected when the gas amount is significantly more than the saturation concentration of these gases at atmospheric conditions. However, such concentrations can be easily reached at high pressures during intrusion if there is sufficient gas present in the system, especially considering gas oversolubility in confinement. By including an adjustable line tension term in the free energy equation (−44 pJ/m for all points), the theory can make predictions in line with the few data points available from recent experimental work. However, we note that such a fitted value empirically accounts for multiple effects and should not be interpreted as the energy of the three-phase contact line. Compared to molecular dynamics simulations, our method is easy to implement, requires minimal computational resources, and is not limited to small pore sizes and/or short simulation times. It provides an efficient path for first-order estimation of the metastability limit of water–gas solutions in nanopores.},

  abstract = {The morphology of dodecane in a nanopore at temperatures typical in exploited or depleted oil reservoirs is investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. The dodecane morphology is found to be determined by interactions between interfacial crystallization and surface wetting of the simplified oil, while “evaporation” only plays a minor role. The morphology changes from an isolated, solidified dodecane droplet to a film with orderly lamellae structures remaining within, and finally to a film containing randomly distributed dodecane molecules, as the system temperature increases. In a nanoslit under the impact of water, since water wins against oil in surface wetting on the silica surface due to electrostatic interaction induced hydrogen bonding between water and the silanol group of silica, the spreading of dodecane molecules over the silica surface is impeded by this water confinement mechanism. Meanwhile, interfacial crystallization is enhanced, leading to always an isolated dodecane “droplet,” with crystallization weakening as the temperature increases. Since dodecane is immiscible to water, there is no mechanism for dodecane to escape the silica surface, and the competition of surface wetting between water and oil determines the morphology of the crystallized dodecane droplet. For the CO 2 –dodecane system in a nanoslit, CO 2 is an efficient solvent for dodecane at all temperatures. Therefore, interfacial crystallization rapidly disappears. The competition of surface adsorption between CO 2 and dodecane is secondary for all cases. The dissolution mechanism is a clear clue for the fact that CO 2 is more effective than water flooding in oil recovery for a depleted oil reservoir.},

  abstract = {Understanding intrusion and extrusion in nanoporous materials is a challenging multiscale problem of utmost importance for applications ranging from energy storage and dissipation to water desalination and hydrophobic gating in ion channels. Including atomistic details in simulations is required to predict the overall behavior of such systems because the statics and dynamics of these processes depend sensitively on microscopic features of the pore, such as the surface hydrophobicity, geometry, and charge distribution, and on the composition of the liquid. On the other hand, the transitions between the filled (intruded) and empty (extruded) states are rare events that often require long simulation times, which are difficult to achieve with standard atomistic simulations. In this work, we explored the intrusion and extrusion processes using a multiscale approach in which the atomistic details of the system, extracted from molecular dynamics simulations, informed a simple Langevin model of water intrusion/extrusion in the pore. We then used the Langevin simulations to compute the transition times at different pressures, validating our coarse-grained model by comparing it with nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The proposed approach reproduces experimentally relevant features such as the time and temperature dependence of the intrusion/extrusion cycles, as well as specific details about the shape of the cycle. This approach also drastically increases the timescales that can be simulated, reducing the gap between simulations and experiments and showing promise for more complex systems.},

The development of novel computational techniques allows us to study this process, which requires long simulations of relatively large systems, with ab initio accuracy. In this work, we use a neural-network potential for water trained on the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional to describe the kinetics of the ice–water interface. We study both ice melting and growth processes. Our results for the ice growth rate are in reasonable agreement with previous experiments and simulations. We find that the kinetics of ice melting presents a different behavior (monotonic) than that of ice growth (non-monotonic). In particular, a maximum ice growth rate of 6.5 Å/ns is found at 14 K of supercooling. The effect of the surface structure is explored by investigating the basal and primary and secondary prismatic facets. We use the Wilson–Frenkel relation to explain these results in terms of the mobility of molecules and the thermodynamic driving force. Moreover, we study the effect of pressure by complementing the standard isobar with simulations at a negative pressure (−1000 bar) and at a high pressure (2000 bar). We find that prismatic facets grow faster than the basal one and that pressure does not play an important role when the speed of the interface is considered as a function of the difference between the melting temperature and the actual one, i.e., to the degree of either supercooling or overheating.},

  abstract = {Quantitative fluorescence quenching is a common analytical approach to studying the mechanism of chemical reactions. The Stern–Volmer (S–V) equation is the most common expression used to analyze the quenching behavior and can be used to extract kinetics in complex environments. However, the approximations underlying the S–V equation are incompatible with Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) acting as the primary quenching mechanism. The nonlinear distance dependence of FRET leads to significant departures from “standard” S–V quenching curves, both by modulating the interaction range of donor species and by increasing the effect of component diffusion. We demonstrate this inadequacy by probing the fluorescence quenching of long-lifetime lead sulfide quantum dots mixed with plasmonic covellite copper sulfide nanodisks (NDs), which serve as perfect fluorescent quenchers. By applying kinetic Monte Carlo methods, which consider particle distributions and diffusion, we are able to quantitatively reproduce experimental data, which show significant quenching at very small concentrations of NDs. The distribution of interparticle distances and diffusion are concluded to play important roles in fluorescence quenching, particularly in the shortwave infrared, where photoluminescent lifetimes are often long relative to diffusion time scales.},

These potentials have then been used to calculate the static and dynamic properties of the mineral. We show that revPBE + vdW is better at reproducing the static properties. However, revPBE + D3 does a better job of reproducing the experimental IR spectrum. We also consider what happens to these properties when a fully quantum treatment of the nuclei is employed. We find that nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) do not make a substantial difference to the static properties. However, when NQEs are included, the dynamic properties of the material change substantially.},

  abstract = {The multifrequency formalism is generalized and exploited to quantify attractive forces, i.e., van der Waals interactions, with small amplitudes or gentle forces in bimodal and trimodal atomic force microscopy (AFM). The multifrequency force spectroscopy formalism with higher modes, including trimodal AFM, can outperform bimodal AFM for material property quantification. Bimodal AFM with the second mode is valid when the drive amplitude of the first mode is approximately an order of magnitude larger than that of the second mode. The error increases in the second mode but decreases in the third mode with a decreasing drive amplitude ratio. Externally driving with higher modes provides a means to extract information from higher force derivatives while enhancing the range of parameter space where the multifrequency formalism holds. Thus, the present approach is compatible with robustly quantifying weak long range forces while extending the number of channels available for high resolution.},

The training set includes bulk elementary metals and intermetallic structures with slab and amorphous configurations. This potential is validated by comparing bulk properties—including lattice constant and elastic constants, surface energies, vacancy formation energies, and stacking fault energies—with their respective density functional theory values. Moreover, our potential could accurately predict the average formation energy and stacking fault energy of γ-TiAl doped with Nb. The tensile properties of γ-TiAl are simulated by our potential and verified by experiments. These results support the applicability of our potential under more practical conditions.},

Here we combined atomic force microscopy, quasi-in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) to study the effect of iodine anions on Cu-catalyzed CO 2 RR in the absence or presence of KI in the KHCO 3 solution. Our results suggested that iodine adsorption caused coarsening of the Cu surface and altered its intrinsic activity for CO 2 RR. As the potential of the Cu catalyst became more negative, there was an increase in surface iodine anion concentration ([I − ]), which could be connected to the reaction-enhanced adsorption of I − ions accompanying the increase in CO 2 RR activity. A linear relationship was observed between [I − ] and current density. SEIRAS results further suggested that the presence of KI in the electrolyte strengthened the Cu–CO bond and facilitated the hydrogenation process, enhancing the production of CH 4 . Our results have thus provided insight into the role of halogen anions and aided in the design of an efficient CO 2 RR process.},

  abstract = {Water is vital for life, and without it, biomolecules and cells cannot maintain their structures and functions. The remarkable properties of water originate from its ability to form hydrogen-bonding networks and dynamics, which the connectivity constantly alters because of the orientation rotation of individual water molecules. Experimental investigation of the dynamics of water, however, has proven challenging due to the strong absorption of water at terahertz frequencies. In response, by employing a high-precision terahertz spectrometer, we have measured and characterized the terahertz dielectric response of water from supercooled liquid to near the boiling point to explore the motions. The response reveals dynamic relaxation processes corresponding to the collective orientation, single-molecule rotation, and structural rearrangements resulting from breaking and reforming hydrogen bonds in water. We have observed the direct relationship between the macroscopic and microscopic relaxation dynamics of water, and the results have provided evidence of two liquid forms in water with different transition temperatures and thermal activation energies. The results reported here thus provide an unprecedented opportunity to directly test microscopic computational models of water dynamics.},

  abstract = {One of the most accepted hypothesis to explain the anomalous behavior of water is the presence of a critical point between two liquids, the liquid–liquid critical point (LLCP), buried within the deep supercooled regime. Unfortunately, such hypothesis is hard to be experimentally confirmed due to fast freezing. Here, we show that the TIP4P/Ice water potential shifted by 400 bar can reproduce with unprecedented accuracy the experimental isothermal compressibility of water and its liquid equation of state for a wide pressure and temperature range. We find, both by extrapolation of response function maxima and by a Maxwell construction, that the location of the model LLCP is consistent with previous calculations. According to the pressure shift needed to recover the experimental behavior of supercooled water, we estimate the experimental LLCP to be located around 1250 bar and 195 K. We use the model to estimate the ice nucleation rate ( J ) in the vicinity of the hypothesized LLCP experimental location and obtain J = 10 24 m −3 s −1 . Thereby, experiments where the ratio between the cooling rate and the sample volume is equal or larger than the estimated nucleation rate could probe liquid–liquid equilibrium before freezing. Such conditions are not accessible in common experiments with microdroplets cooled at a few kelvin per second, but they could be, for instance, using nanodroplets of around 50 nm radius observed in a millisecond timescale.},

Excess entropy is known to scale well the dynamical properties of liquids, but this quasi-universal scaling is known to breakdown in supercooled and glassy regimes. Using numerical simulations, we test whether a local form of the excess entropy can lead to predictions similar to those made by softness, such as the strong correlation with particles’ tendency to rearrange. In addition, we explore leveraging softness to compute excess entropy in the traditional fashion over softness groupings. Our results show that the excess entropy computed over softness-binned groupings is correlated with activation barriers to rearrangement.},

  abstract = {X-ray scattering has been used to characterize the columnar packing and the π stacking in a glass-forming discotic liquid crystal. In the equilibrium liquid state, the intensities of the scattering peaks for π stacking and columnar packing are proportional to each other, indicating concurrent development of the two orders. Upon cooling into the glassy state, the π–π distance shows a kinetic arrest with a change in the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) from 321 to 109 ppm/K, while the intercolumnar spacing exhibits a constant TEC of 113 ppm/K. By changing the cooling rate, it is possible to prepare glasses with a wide range of columnar and π stacking orders, including zero order. For each glass, the columnar order and the π stacking order correspond to a much hotter liquid than its enthalpy and π–π distance, with the difference between the two internal (fictive) temperatures exceeding 100 K. By comparison with the relaxation map obtained by dielectric spectroscopy, we find that the δ mode (disk tumbling within a column) controls the columnar order and the π stacking order trapped in the glass, while the α mode (disk spinning about its axis) controls the enthalpy and the π–π spacing. Our finding is relevant for controlling the different structural features of a molecular glass to optimize its properties.},

To this aim, we introduce and validate a finite-size two-body excess entropy integral equation. Our analytical arguments and simulation results show that s 2 ( L ) exhibits a linear scaling with 1/ L . Since D *( L ) displays a similar behavior, we show that the parameters A ( L ) and α ( L ) are also linearly proportional to 1/ L . By extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit, we report the coefficients A ∞ = 0.048 ± 0.001 and α ∞ = 1.000 ± 0.013 that agree well with the universal values available in the literature [M.

This allows us to capture complete, partial, and pseudo-partial wetting states, demonstrating complex disjoining pressure profiles over the full range of possible contact angles as previously proposed in the literature. Applying the simulation method to study liquid filling on grooved surfaces, we compare the filling transition for the three different classes of wetting states as we vary the pressure difference between the liquid and gas phases. The filling and emptying transitions are reversible for the complete wetting case, while significant hysteresis is observed for the partial and pseudo-partial cases. In agreement with previous studies, we also show that the critical pressure for the filling transition follows the Kelvin equation for the complete and partial wetting scenarios. Finally, we find the filling transition can display a number of distinct morphological pathways for the pseudo-partial wetting cases, as we demonstrate here for varying groove dimensions.},

  abstract = {Molecular qubits are an emerging platform in quantum information science due to the unmatched structural control that chemical design and synthesis provide compared to other leading qubit technologies. This theoretical study investigates pulse sequence protocols for spin-correlated radical pairs, which are important molecular spin qubit pair (SQP) candidates. Here, we introduce improved microwave pulse protocols for enhancing the execution times of quantum logic gates based on SQPs. Significantly, this study demonstrates that the proposed pulse sequences effectively remove certain contributions from nuclear spin effects on spin dynamics, which are a common source of decoherence. Additionally, we have analyzed the factors that control the fidelity of the SQP spin state, following the application of the controlled-NOT gate. It was found that higher magnetic fields introduce a high frequency oscillation in the fidelity. Thereupon, it is suggested that further research should be geared toward executing quantum gates at lower magnetic field values. In addition, an absolute bound of the fidelity outcome due to decoherence is determined, which clearly identifies the important factors that control gate execution. Finally, examples of the application of these pulse sequences to SQPs are described.},

  abstract = {Conical intersections (CIs), which indicate the crossing of two or more adiabatic electronic states, are crucial in the mechanisms of photophysical, photochemical, and photobiological processes. Although various geometries and energy levels have been reported using quantum chemical calculations, the systematic interpretation of the minimum energy CI (MECI) geometries is unclear. A previous study [Nakai et al. , J. Phys. Chem. A 122 , 8905 (2018)] performed frozen orbital analysis (FZOA) based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) at the MECI formed between the ground and first electronic excited states (S 0 /S 1 MECI), thereby inductively clarifying two controlling factors. However, one of the factors that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap became close to the HOMO–LUMO Coulomb integral was not valid in the case of spin-flip TDDFT (SF-TDDFT), which is frequently used as a means of the geometry optimization of MECI [Inamori et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 152 , 144108 (2020)]. This study revisited the controlling factors using FZOA for the SF-TDDFT method. Based on spin-adopted configurations within a minimum active space, the S 0 –S 1 excitation energy is approximately represented by the HOMO and LUMO energy gap Δ ε HL , a contribution from Coulomb integrals J HL ″ and that from the HOMO–LUMO exchange integral K HL ″ ⁠ . Furthermore, numerical applications of the revised formula at the SF-TDDFT method confirmed the control factors of S 0 /S 1 MECI.},

Under the influence of a periodic driving field, phonon coupling may induce peaks in contour plots of the transition probability when the magnitude of the system anisotropy matches the phonon frequency. The 3-LZM coupled to a super-Ohmic phonon bath and driven by a periodic external field exhibits periodic population dynamics in which the period and amplitude of the oscillations decrease with the bath coupling strength.},

New sophisticated methods are regularly being developed with an eye toward moving to larger systems and more complicated descriptions of solvents. Many of these methods, however, are quite difficult to implement and debug. Furthermore, trying to make the individual algorithms work together through a modular application programming interface can be quite difficult as well. We present a new, open-source software framework, QuantumDynamics.jl, designed to address these challenges. It provides implementations of a variety of perturbative and non-perturbative methods for simulating the dynamics of these systems. Most prominently, QuantumDynamics.jl supports hierarchical equations of motion and methods based on path integrals. An effort has been made to ensure maximum compatibility of the interface between the various methods. Additionally, QuantumDynamics.jl, being built on a high-level programming language, brings a host of modern features to explorations of systems, such as the usage of Jupyter notebooks and high level plotting, the possibility of leveraging high-performance machine learning libraries for further development. Thus, while the built-in methods can be used as end-points in themselves, the package provides an integrated platform for experimentation, exploration, and method development.},

However, for the nonequilibrium extension of the Third Law of Thermodynamics, a dynamic condition is needed as well: the low-temperature dynamical activity and accessibility of the dominant state must remain sufficiently high so that relaxation times do not start to dramatically differ between different initial states. It suffices that the relaxation times do not exceed the dissipation time.},

We obtain explicit analytical expressions for the rates, which show that both bulk and geminate recombination rates are retarded appreciably at short times due to the inertial dynamics.

  abstract = {London dispersion is a weak, attractive, intermolecular force that occurs due to interactions between instantaneous dipole moments. While individual dispersion contributions are small, they are the dominating attractive force between nonpolar species and determine many properties of interest. Standard semi-local and hybrid methods in density-functional theory do not account for dispersion contributions, so a correction such as the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) or many-body dispersion (MBD) models must be added. Recent literature has discussed the importance of many-body effects on dispersion, and attention has turned to which methods accurately capture them. By studying systems of interacting quantum harmonic oscillators from first principles, we directly compare computed dispersion coefficients and energies from XDM and MBD and also study the influence of changing oscillator frequency. Additionally, the 3-body energy contributions for both XDM, via the Axilrod–Teller–Muto term, and MBD, via a random-phase approximation formalism, are calculated and compared. Connections are made to interactions between noble gas atoms as well as to the methane and benzene dimers and to two layered materials, graphite and MoS 2 . While XDM and MBD give similar results for large separations, some variants of MBD are found to be susceptible to a polarization catastrophe at short range, and the MBD energy calculation is seen to fail in some chemical systems. Additionally, the self-consistent screening formalism used in MBD is shown to be surprisingly sensitive to the choice of input polarizabilities.},

While energies and analytical gradients for VV10 are already widely available, this study reports the first derivation and efficient implementation of the analytical second derivatives of the VV10 energy. The additional compute cost of the VV10 contributions to analytical frequencies is shown to be small in all but the smallest basis sets for recommended grid sizes. This study also reports the assessment of VV10-containing functionals for predicting harmonic frequencies using the analytical second derivative code. The contribution of VV10 to simulating harmonic frequencies is shown to be small for small molecules but important for systems where weak interactions are important, such as water clusters. In the latter cases, B97M-V, ω B97M-V, and ω B97X-V perform very well. The convergence of frequencies with respect to the grid size and atomic orbital basis set size is studied, and recommendations are reported. Finally, scaling factors to allow comparison of scaled harmonic frequencies with experimental fundamental frequencies and to predict zero-point vibrational energy are presented for some recently developed functionals (including r2SCAN, B97M-V, ω B97X-V, M06-SX, and ω B97M-V).},

It is no for all other networks, implying that their steady-state currents cannot be inverted by controlling the kinetic constants of the reactions.

  abstract = {Simulations of exciton and charge hopping in amorphous organic materials involve numerous physical parameters. Each of these parameters must be computed from costly ab initio calculations before the simulation can commence, resulting in a significant computational overhead for studying exciton diffusion, especially in large and complex material datasets. While the idea of using machine learning to quickly predict these parameters has been explored previously, typical machine learning models require long training times, which ultimately contribute to simulation overheads. In this paper, we present a new machine learning architecture for building predictive models for intermolecular exciton coupling parameters. Our architecture is designed in such a way that the total training time is reduced compared to ordinary Gaussian process regression or kernel ridge regression models. Based on this architecture, we build a predictive model and use it to estimate the coupling parameters which enter into an exciton hopping simulation in amorphous pentacene. We show that this hopping simulation is able to achieve excellent predictions for exciton diffusion tensor elements and other properties as compared to a simulation using coupling parameters computed entirely from density functional theory. This result, along with the short training times afforded by our architecture, shows how machine learning can be used to reduce the high computational overheads associated with exciton and charge diffusion simulations in amorphous organic materials.},

  abstract = {The unique edge states of the zigzag β -SiC 7 nanoribbons aroused our attention, and therefore, based on first-principles calculations, we investigated their spin-dependent electronic transport properties by constructing controllable defects to modulate these special edge states. Interestingly, by introducing rectangular edge defects in the SiSi and SiC edge-terminated systems, not only the spin-unpolarized is successfully converted to completely spin-polarized, but also the direction of polarization can be switched, thus enabling a dual spin filter. The analyses further reveal that the two transmission channels with opposite spins are spatially separated and that the transmission eigenstates are highly concentrated at the relative edges. The specific edge defect introduced only suppresses the transmission channel at the same edge but reserves the transmission channel at the other edge. In addition, for the CSi and CC edge-terminated systems, an additional spin-down band exists due to spin splitting in the spin-up band at E F , so that besides the original spatially separated two spin-opposite channels, an extra spin channel is distributed at the upper edge, resulting in unidirectional fully spin-polarized transport. The peculiar spatially separated edge states and excellent spin filtering properties could open up further possibilities for β -SiC 7 -based electronic devices in spintronics applications.},

The equations are fully bivariational in the sense of the time-dependent bivariational principle and offer an alternative, constraint-free formulation of adaptive basis sets for bivariational wave functions. We simplify the highly non-linear basis set equations using Lie algebraic techniques and show that the computationally intensive parts of the theory are, in fact, identical to those that arise with linearly parameterized basis sets. Thus, our approach offers easy implementation on top of existing code in the context of both nuclear dynamics and time-dependent electronic structure. Computationally tractable working equations are provided for single and double exponential parametrizations of the basis set evolution. The EOMs are generally applicable for any value of the basis set parameters, unlike the approach of transforming the parameters to zero at each evaluation of the EOMs. We show that the basis set equations contain a well-defined set of singularities, which are identified and removed by a simple scheme. The exponential basis set equations are implemented in conjunction with the time-dependent modals vibrational coupled cluster (TDMVCC) method, and we investigate the propagation properties in terms of the average integrator step size. For the systems we test, the exponentially parameterized basis sets yield slightly larger step sizes compared to the linearly parameterized basis set.},

  abstract = {This work reports on the first computational quantum-chemistry implementation of the hyper-Rayleigh scattering optical activity (HRS-OA), a nonlinear chiroptical phenomenon. First, from the basics of the theory, which is based on quantum electrodynamics, and focusing on the electric dipole, magnetic-dipole, and electric-quadrupole interactions, the equations for the simulation of the differential scattering ratios of HRS-OA are re-derived. Then, for the first time, computations of HRS-OA quantities are presented and analyzed. They have been enacted on a prototypical chiral organic molecule (methyloxirane) at the time-dependent density functional theory level using a broad range of atomic orbital basis sets. In particular, (i) we analyze the basis set convergence, demonstrating that converged results require basis sets with both diffuse and polarization functions, (ii) we discuss the relative amplitudes of the five contributions to the differential scattering ratios, and (iii) we study the effects of origin-dependence and derived the expression of the tensor shifts and we prove the origin-independence of the theory for exact wavefunctions. Our computations show the ability of HRS-OA as a nonlinear chiroptical method, able to distinguish between the enantiomers of the same chiral molecule.},

  abstract = {The study of the rare transitions that take place between long lived metastable states is a major challenge in molecular dynamics simulations. Many of the methods suggested to address this problem rely on the identification of the slow modes of the system, which are referred to as collective variables. Recently, machine learning methods have been used to learn the collective variables as functions of a large number of physical descriptors. Among many such methods, Deep Targeted Discriminant Analysis has proven to be useful. This collective variable is built from data harvested from short unbiased simulations in the metastable basins. Here, we enrich the set of data on which the Deep Targeted Discriminant Analysis collective variable is built by adding data from the transition path ensemble. These are collected from a number of reactive trajectories obtained using the On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling flooding method. The collective variables thus trained lead to more accurate sampling and faster convergence. The performance of these new collective variables is tested on a number of representative examples.},

The description of the environment (solvent) has, therefore, a large impact. Implicit solvent representations are efficient but, in many cases, not accurate enough (especially for polar solvents, such as water). More accurate but also computationally more expensive is the explicit treatment of the solvent molecules. Recently, machine learning has been proposed to bridge the gap and simulate, in an implicit manner, explicit solvation effects. However, the current approaches rely on prior knowledge of the entire conformational space, limiting their application in practice. Here, we introduce a graph neural network based implicit solvent that is capable of describing explicit solvent effects for peptides with different compositions than those contained in the training set.},

The temperature dependences of the PL linewidths were mainly determined by the Fröhlich interaction between excitons and longitudinal optical phonons. For FAPbBr 3 NCs, a redshift in the PL peak energy appeared between 100 and 150 K, which was because of the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition.

  abstract = {Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is imperatively countered with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on a conventional Pt counter electrode. Upon focusing on the development of suitable cathode catalysts, it is usually overseen that OER on Pt seeks a significant energy input to overcome the slow reaction kinetics, regardless of the efficiency of the NRR catalyst. Here, we unveil an out-of-the-box concept with state-of-the-art catalysts that, on pursuing OER with RuO 2 in KOH, the NRR process reinforces thermodynamically. In this work, it has been shown how both the electrode and electrolyte simultaneously help to elevate a reaction mechanism in terms of Gibbs’ energy and equilibrium constant. As a proof of concept, we assembled RuO 2 with an NRR catalyst, iron phthalocyanine (FePc), in an electrolyzer, preferably in a two-electrode setup, where the catholyte consisted of 0.5M NaBF 4 . This system achieved selective cathodic conversion of N 2 to NH 3 with 67.6\% Faradaic efficiency at 0.0 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and simultaneous anodic water oxidation to O 2 with a high electricity-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency of 46.7\%. The electrolyzer forecasted a full cell voltage of 2.04 V, which demands only 603 mV overpotential to attain 0.5 mA current to drive forward the chemical equilibrium of the overall cell reaction. This study not only emphasized the importance of electrode–electrolyte improvisation but also provided a wider outlook in terms of different thermodynamic parameters to be considered to determine the efficiency of the overall NRR coupled OER process.},

Our ultrafast spectroscopic results enable a comprehensive mapping of the elementary steps involved in the solution-phase xSF process of photoexcited PTCDA 2− . Along the cascading xSF pathways, the three intermediates including excimer 1 (S 1 S 0 ), spin-correlated triplet pair 1 (T 1 T 1 ), and spatially separated triplet pair 1 (T 1 ·S 0 ·T 1 ) have been identified, with their formation/relaxation time constants being determined. This work demonstrates that the solution-phase xSF materials can be extended to charged radical systems and that the three-step model usually adopted to describe the crystalline-phase xSF can also be valid in describing solution-phase xSF.},

Currently, recent applications are taking advantage of modifications of these descriptors using semiempirical electronic structures to explain enzymatic catalysis reactions, protein-binding processes, and structural analysis in proteins. We have explored these new solutions along with their implementations in the software PRIMoRDiA, discussing their impact on the field and its perspectives. We show the main issues in the analysis of the electronic structure of macromolecules, which are the application of the same calculation protocols used for small molecules without considering particularities in those large systems’ electronic configuration. The major result of our discussions is that the use of semiempirical methods is crucial to obtain such a type of analysis, which can provide a powerful dimension of information and be part of future low-cost predictive tools. We expect semiempirical methods continue playing an important role in the quantum chemistry evaluation of large molecules. As computational resources advance, semiempirical methods might lead us to explore the electronic structure of even larger biological macromolecular entities and sets of structures representing larger timescales.},

  abstract = {In purple bacteria, the fundamental charge-separation step that drives the conversion of radiation energy into chemical energy proceeds along one branch—the A branch—of a heterodimeric pigment–protein complex, the reaction center. Here, we use first principles time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with an optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid functional to investigate the electronic and excited-state structure of the six primary pigments in the reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides . By explicitly including amino-acid residues surrounding these six pigments in our TDDFT calculations, we systematically study the effect of the protein environment on energy and charge-transfer excitations. Our calculations show that a forward charge transfer into the A branch is significantly lower in energy than the first charge transfer into the B branch, in agreement with the unidirectional charge transfer observed experimentally. We further show that the inclusion of the protein environment redshifts this excitation significantly, allowing for energy transfer from the coupled Q x excitations. Through analysis of transition and difference densities, we demonstrate that most of the Q -band excitations are strongly delocalized over several pigments and that both their spatial delocalization and charge-transfer character determine how strongly affected they are by thermally-activated molecular vibrations. Our results suggest a mechanism for charge-transfer in this bacterial reaction center and pave the way for further first-principles investigations of the interplay between delocalized excited states, vibronic coupling, and the role of the protein environment in this and other complex light-harvesting systems.},

In the human FoxP subfamily (FoxP1, FoxP2, FoxP3, and FoxP4) of transcription factors, a 90 residue-long disordered region links a Leucine Zipper (ZIP)—known to form coiled-coil dimers—and a Forkhead (FKH) domain—known to form domain swapping dimers. We used replica exchange discrete molecular dynamics simulations, single-molecule fluorescence experiments, and other biophysical tools to understand how domain tethering in FoxP1 impacts dimerization at ZIP and FKH domains and how DNA binding allosterically regulates their dimerization. We found that domain tethering promotes FoxP1 dimerization but inhibits a FKH domain-swapped structure. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the linker mediates the mutual organization and dynamics of ZIP and FKH domains, forming closed and open states with and without interdomain contacts, thus highlighting the role of the linkers in multidomain proteins. Finally, we found that DNA allosterically promotes structural changes that decrease the dimerization propensity of FoxP1. We postulate that, upon DNA binding, the interdomain linker plays a crucial role in the gene regulatory function of FoxP1.},

Without depletion attraction, the experimental system provides a colloidal analog of the well-known geometrically frustrated Ising antiferromagnet [Y. Han et al. , Nature 456 , 898–903 (2008)]. In this contribution, we show that the added depletion attraction can influence both the magnitude and sign of an Ising spin coupling constant. As a result, the nearest-neighbor Ising “spin” interactions can be made to vary from antiferromagnetic to para- and ferromagnetic. Using a simple theory, we compute an effective Ising nearest-neighbor coupling constant, and we show how competition between entropic effects permits for the modification of the coupling constant. We then experimentally demonstrate depletion-induced modification of the coupling constant, including its sign, and other behaviors. Depletion interactions are induced by rod-like surfactant micelles that change length with temperature and thus offer means for tuning the depletion attraction in situ . Buckled colloidal suspensions exhibit a crossover from an Ising antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase as a function of increasing depletion attraction. Additional dynamical experiments reveal structural arrest in various regimes of the coupling-constant, driven by different mechanisms. In total, this work introduces novel colloidal matter with “magnetic” features and complex dynamics rarely observed in traditional spin systems.},

Here, we expand on and generalize the correspondence between the Hamiltonian hybrid particle–field method and particle–particle pair potentials. Using the spectral procedure suggested by Bore and Cascella, we establish compatibility to any local soft pair potential in the limit of infinitesimal grid spacing. Furthermore, we document how the mean-field regime often observed in hybrid particle–field simulations is due to the systems under consideration, and not an inherent property of the model. Considering the Gaussian filter form, in particular, we demonstrate the ability of the Hamiltonian hybrid particle–field model to recover all structural and dynamical properties of the Gaussian Core model, including solid phases, a first-order phase transition, and anomalous transport properties. We quantify the impact of the grid spacing on the correspondence, as well as the effect of the particle–field filtering length scale on the emergent particle–particle correlations.},

The mean knot size increases significantly and sub-linearly with increasing chain contour length. The knot diffusion in nanochannel-confined DNA molecules is subdiffusive, with the unknotting time scaling with chain contour length with an exponent of 2.64 ± 0.23 to within a 95\% confidence interval. The scaling exponent for the mean unknotting time vs chain contour length, along with visual inspection of the knot conformations, suggests that the knot diffusion mechanism is a combination of self-reptation and knot region breathing for the simulated parameters.},

  abstract = {A new version of the highly parallelized general-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) simulation program MODYLAS with high performance on the Fugaku computer was developed. A benchmark test using Fugaku indicated highly efficient communication, single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) processing, and on-cache arithmetic operations. The system’s performance deteriorated only slightly, even under high parallelization. In particular, a newly developed minimum transferred data method, requiring a significantly lower amount of data transfer compared to conventional communications, showed significantly high performance. The coordinates and forces of 101 810 176 atoms and the multipole coefficients of the subcells could be distributed to the 32 768 nodes (1 572 864 cores) in 2.3 ms during one MD step calculation. The SIMD effective instruction rates for floating-point arithmetic operations in direct force and fast multipole method (FMM) calculations measured on Fugaku were 78.7\% and 31.5\%, respectively. The development of a data reuse algorithm enhanced the on-cache processing; the cache miss rate for direct force and FMM calculations was only 2.74\% and 1.43\%, respectively, on the L1 cache and 0.08\% and 0.60\%, respectively, on the L2 cache. The modified MODYLAS could complete one MD single time-step calculation within 8.5 ms for the aforementioned large system. Additionally, the program contains numerous functions for material research that enable free energy calculations, along with the generation of various ensembles and molecular constraints.},

  abstract = {Silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) is an extensively used material in the automotive, aerospace, and semiconductor industries. However, its widespread use is in contrast to the scarce availability of reliable interatomic potentials that can be employed to study various aspects of this material on an atomistic scale, particularly its amorphous phase. In this work, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential, using an efficient active learning technique, combined with the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) method. Our strategy is based on using an inexpensive empirical potential to generate an initial dataset of atomic configurations, for which energies and forces were recalculated with density functional theory (DFT); thereafter, a GAP was trained on these data and an iterative re-training algorithm was used to improve it by learning on-the-fly. When compared to DFT, our potential yielded a mean absolute error of 8 meV/atom in energy calculations for a variety of liquid and amorphous structures and a speed-up of molecular dynamics simulations by 3–4 orders of magnitude, while achieving a first-rate agreement with experimental results. Our potential is publicly available in an open-access repository.},

The system is then described by an effective temperature-dependent harmonic Hamiltonian, which can be used to estimate its various dynamic and static properties. In this paper, we combine SCP with ab initio (AI) potential energy evaluation in which case the numerical bottleneck of AI-SCP is the evaluation of Gaussian averages of the AI potential energy and its derivatives. These averages are computed efficiently by the quasi-Monte Carlo method utilizing low-discrepancy sequences leading to a fast convergence with respect to the number, S , of the AI energy evaluations. Moreover, a further substantial (an-order-of-magnitude) improvement in efficiency is achieved once a numerically cheap approximation of the AI potential is available. This is based on using a perturbation theory-like (the two-grid) approach in which it is the average of the difference between the AI and the approximate potential that is computed. The corresponding codes and scripts are provided.},

All the NPs were observed to gain mass by carbon addition under conditions that varied with feedstock but with large variations in initial growth rate. Long reaction periods were studied to allow the evolution of growth rates over time to be observed. Diamond NPs were found to passivate against C 2 H 2 addition if heated above ∼1400 K, and the highly variable initial reactivity for carbon nano-onions was found to depend on the presence of non-onion-structure surface carbon. For graphitic and carbon black NPs, three distinct growth modes were observed, correlated with the initial NP mass (M initial ). Smallest graphitic and carbon black NPs, with masses 50 MDa, grew rapidly and continuously, adding up to ∼300\% of M initial with no sign of rate slowing as long as C 2 H 2 was present. The efficiencies for C 2 H 2 addition and etching by O 2 are strongly correlated, but the correlation changes as the NPs passivate. Growth and passivation mechanisms are discussed.},

Yet up to date, there are no quantitative studies on NaCl nucleation that accounts for its stochastic nature. Here, we report the first stochastic treatment of NaCl-water nucleation kinetics. Using a recently developed microfluidic system and evaporation model, our measured interfacial energies extracted from a modified Poisson distribution of nucleation time show an excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, analysis of nucleation parameters in 0.5, 1.5, and 5.5 pl microdroplets reveals an interesting interplay between confinement effects and shifting of nucleation mechanisms. Overall, our findings highlight the need to treat nucleation stochastically rather than deterministically to bridge the gap between theory and experiment.},

In previous works, we have determined the interfacial energy of the hydrate at 400 bars using the TIP4P/Ice and TraPPE molecular models for water and CO 2 , respectively, in combination with two different extensions of the Mold Integration technique [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 623 , 354 (2022) and J. Chem. Phys. 157, 134709 (2022)].

Since the experiments do not allow to obtain the variation of the interfacial energy along the dissociation line of the hydrate, we extend our previous studies to quantify the effect of pressure on the interfacial energy at different pressures. Our results suggest that there exists a correlation between the interfacial free energy values and the pressure, i.e., it decreases with the pressure between 100 and 1000 bars. We expect that the combination of reliable molecular models and advanced simulation techniques could help to improve our knowledge of the thermodynamic parameters that control the interfacial free energy of hydrates from a molecular perspective.},

These PDMS pseudo-brushes exhibit a significantly lower contact angle hysteresis compared to hydrophobic silanized substrates. The effect of different molar masses of the used PDMS on the wetting properties seems negligible. The surface roughness and thickness of the PDMS pseudo-brush are measured by atomic force microscopy and x-ray reflectivity. The outcome shows that these surfaces are extremely smooth (topologically and chemically), which explains the reduction in contact angle hysteresis. These special features make this kind of surfaces very useful for wetting experiments. Here, the dynamics of the four-phase contact point are studied on these surfaces. The four-phase contact point dynamics on PDMS pseudo-brushes deviate substantially from its dynamics on other substrates. These changes depend only a little on the molar mass of the used PDMS. In general, PDMS pseudo-brushes increase the traveling speed of four-phase contact point on the surface and change the associated power law of position vs time.},

We found that water flows through the nanocones when in contact with the liquid reservoir if the nanocone tip presents hydrophilic functionalization. In contact with steam, we observed the formation of droplets at the base of the nanocone only when hydrophilic functionalization is present. Then, water flows through in a linear manner, a process that is more efficient than that in the liquid reservoir regime. The scalability of the process is tested by analyzing the water flow through more than one nanocone. The results suggest that the distance between the nanocones is a fundamental ingredient for the efficiency of water harvesting.},

Our study reveals that all MXene compositions have a linear relationship between current and voltage at lower potentials, indicating their metallic character. However, the magnitude of the current at a given voltage (conductivity) has different trends among different compositions. For example, MXenes without any surface terminations (Ti 3 C 2 ) exhibit higher conductivity compared to MXenes with surface functionalization. Among the MXenes with –O and –OH termination, those with –O surface termination have lower conductivity than the ones with –OH surface terminations. Interestingly, conductivity changes with the ratio of –O and –OH on the MXene surface. Our calculated I – V curves and their conductivities correlate well with transmission functions and the electronic density of states around the Fermi level. The surface composition-dependent conductivity of the MXenes provides a path to tune the in-plane conductivity for enhanced pseudocapacitive performance.},

  abstract = {A large number of force fields have been proposed for describing the behavior of liquid water within classical atomistic simulations, particularly molecular dynamics. In the past two decades, models that incorporate molecular polarizability and even charge transfer have become more prevalent, in attempts to develop more accurate descriptions. These are frequently parameterized to reproduce the measured thermodynamics, phase behavior, and structure of water. On the other hand, the dynamics of water is rarely considered in the construction of these models, despite its importance in their ultimate applications. In this paper, we explore the structure and dynamics of polarizable and charge-transfer water models, with a focus on timescales that directly or indirectly relate to hydrogen bond (H-bond) making and breaking. Moreover, we use the recently developed fluctuation theory for dynamics to determine the temperature dependence of these properties to shed light on the driving forces. This approach provides key insight into the timescale activation energies through a rigorous decomposition into contributions from the different interactions, including polarization and charge transfer. The results show that charge transfer effects have a negligible effect on the activation energies. Furthermore, the same tension between electrostatic and van der Waals interactions that is found in fixed-charge water models also governs the behavior of polarizable models. The models are found to involve significant energy–entropy compensation, pointing to the importance of developing water models that accurately describe the temperature dependence of water structure and dynamics.},

These excess vibrations—a signature of which is a THz peak in the reduced density of states D ( ω )/ D Debye ( ω ), known as the boson peak—have resisted a complete theoretical understanding for decades. Here, we provide direct numerical evidence that vibrations near the boson peak consist of hybridizations of phonons with many quasilocalized excitations ; the latter have recently been shown to generically populate the low-frequency tail of the vibrational spectra of structural glasses quenched from a melt and of disordered crystals. Our results suggest that quasilocalized excitations exist up to and in the vicinity of the boson-peak frequency and, hence, constitute the fundamental building blocks of the excess vibrational modes in glasses.},

The accuracy of the two-body potential is validated by comparison with experimental second virial coefficient data. Experimental pressure–density–temperature data are used to validate the addition of three-body interactions, often yielding very accurate predictions. Classical Monte Carlo simulations that neglect quantum effects are reported for the vapor–liquid equilibria (VLE), critical properties, and the triple point. A comparison with experimental data indicates that the effect of quantum interactions is to narrow the VLE phase envelope and to lower the critical temperature. The three-body interactions have a considerable influence on the phase behavior, resulting in good agreement with the experimental density. The critical properties of the two-body + three-body potential for hydrogen provide an alternative set of input parameters to improve the accuracy of theoretical predictions at temperatures above 100 K. In the vicinity of the critical point, the coexistence densities do not obey the law of rectilinear diameters, which is a feature that has largely been overlooked in both experimental data and reference equations of state.},

The factors that permit such anisotropic energy relaxation are discussed, along with the potential implications on the molecule’s non-equilibrium dynamics. In addition, the energy flux analysis allows us to identify the solvent motions responsible for the uptake of solute energy, confirming the crucial role of water librations.

Quasi-classical trajectory simulations on the new PES reveal that two product channels are open in the collision energy ( E coll ) range of 1–80 kcal/mol, i.e., S N 2 leading to I − + CH 3 Cl and iodine abstraction (above ∼45 kcal/mol) resulting in ICl − + CH 3 . Scattering angle, initial attack angle, product translational energy, and product internal energy distributions show that the S N 2 reaction is indirect at low E coll and becomes direct-rebound–back-side (CH 3 -side) attack-type, as E coll increases. Iodine abstraction mainly proceeds with direct stripping mechanism with side-on/back-side attack preference. Comparison with crossed-beam experiments and previous direct dynamics simulations shows quantitative or qualitative agreement and also highlights possible theoretical and/or experimental issues motivating further research.},

  abstract = {Resonance electron attachment in a series of brominated diphenyl ethers, namely 4-bromodiphenyl ether (BDPE), 4-bromophenyl ether (BPE), and decabromodiphenyl ether (DBDE), was investigated in the gas phase by means of dissociative electron attachment spectroscopy. In addition to channels of dissociation into stable fragments, long-lived molecular negative ions with an average lifetime relative to autodetachment of the order of 60 µ s were found for the last two molecules. In the case of BDPE and BPE, the most intense dissociation channel is the bromine anion, and for DBDE—the [C 6 Br 5 O] − anion. The [C 6 Br 5 O] − anion sequentially decomposes with the elimination of the bromide anion on a microsecond time scale, which is confirmed by the registration of metastable ions with an apparent mass of 12.8 a.m.u. The electron affinity of the studied molecules and the appearance energy of fragment ions were estimated with CAM-B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p).},

Herein, benefitting from state-of-the-art mass spectrometry and by using our newly designed high-temperature reactor, the activity of atomically precise particles of negatively charged vanadium oxide clusters toward hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) from methane, the most stable alkane molecule, has been measured at elevated temperatures up to 873 K. We discovered the positive correlation between the reaction rate and cluster size that larger clusters possessing greater vibrational degrees of freedom can carry more vibrational energies to enhance the HAA reactivity at high temperature, in contrast with the electronic and geometric issues that control the activity at room temperature. This finding opens up a new dimension, vibrational degrees of freedom, for the simulation or design of particle reactions under high-temperature conditions.},

  abstract = {The theory of the magnetic coupling between the localized spins, mediated by the mobile excess electron, is generalized to the case of a trigonal, six-center, four-electron molecule with partial valence delocalization. The combination of the electron transfer occurring within the valence-delocalized subsystem and the interatomic exchange producing coupling of the spin of the mobile electron of valence-delocalized fragment with the three localized spins forming the valence-localized subsystem leads to the appearance of a special kind of double exchange (DE), termed the “external core double exchange” (ECDE), in order to distinguish such DE from the conventional “internal core double exchange” for which the mobile electron is coupled with the spin-cores on the same center via the intra-atomic exchange. The effect of the ECDE on the ground spin state of the considered trigonal molecule is compared with earlier reported effect produced by DE in the four-electron, mixed-valence (MV) trimer. A high diversity of the ground spin states is revealed, depending on the relative magnitudes and signs of the electron transfer and interatomic exchange parameters, with part of these states not appearing to be the ground states in a trigonal trimer exhibiting DE. We briefly discuss some examples of trigonal MV systems from the point of view of the possibility to have different combinations of signs of the transfer and exchange parameters and, accordingly, different ground spin states. The tentative role of the considered systems in molecular electronics and spintronics is also noticed.},

Based on the observed vibrational patterns, eight different excited states could be identified, seven of which are resonances known from absorption spectroscopy. Distinctly different photon energy dependencies of vibrational excitations have been obtained for different excited states, hinting at strongly different photoemission lifetimes. Unexpectedly, some resonances seem to exhibit bimodal distributions of emission lifetimes, possibly due to electronic relaxation processes induced by the excitation of specific vibrational modes.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of gas-phase chemical reactions are typically carried out on a small number of molecules near thermal equilibrium by means of various thermostatting algorithms. Correct equipartitioning of kinetic energy among translations, rotations, and vibrations of the simulated reactants is critical for many processes occurring in the gas phase. As thermalizing collisions are infrequent in gas-phase simulations, the thermostat has to efficiently reach equipartitioning in the system during equilibration and maintain it throughout the actual simulation. Furthermore, in non-equilibrium simulations where heat is released locally, the action of the thermostat should not lead to unphysical changes in the overall dynamics of the system. Here, we explore issues related to both obtaining and maintaining thermal equilibrium in MD simulations of an exemplary ion–molecule dimerization reaction. We first compare the efficiency of global (Nosé–Hoover and Canonical Sampling through Velocity Rescaling) and local (Langevin) thermostats for equilibrating a system of flexible compounds and find that of these three only the Langevin thermostat achieves equipartition in a reasonable simulation time. We then study the effect of the unphysical removal of latent heat released during simulations involving multiple dimerization events. As the Langevin thermostat does not produce the correct dynamics in the free molecular regime, we only consider the commonly used Nosé–Hoover thermostat, which is shown to effectively cool down the reactants, leading to an overestimation of the dimerization rate. Our findings underscore the importance of thermostatting for the proper thermal initialization of gas-phase systems and the consequences of global thermostatting in non-equilibrium simulations.},

Values calculated within the single-mode approximation for frequency shifts agree well with previously reported theoretical values.

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the indispensable techniques in chemistry because it enables us to obtain accurate information on the chemical, electronic, and dynamic properties of molecules. Computational simulation of the NMR spectra requires time-consuming density functional theory (DFT) calculations for an ensemble of molecular conformations. For large flexible molecules, it is considered too high-cost since it requires time-averaging of the instantaneous chemical shifts of each nuclear spin across the conformational space of molecules for NMR timescales. Here, we present a Gaussian process/deep kernel learning-based machine learning (ML) method for enabling us to predict, average in time, and analyze the instantaneous chemical shifts of conformations in the molecular dynamics trajectory. We demonstrate the use of the method by computing the averaged 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts of each nuclear spin of a trefoil knot molecule consisting of 24 para-connected benzene rings (240 atoms). By training ML model with the chemical shift data obtained from DFT calculations, we predicted chemical shifts for each conformation during dynamics. We were able to observe the merging of the time-averaged chemical shifts of each nuclear spin in a singlet 1 H NMR peak and two 13 C NMR peaks for the knot molecule, in agreement with experimental measurements. The unique feature of the presented method is the use of the learned low-dimensional deep kernel representation of local spin environments for comparing and analyzing the local chemical environment histories of spins during dynamics. It allowed us to identify two groups of protons in the knot molecule, which implies that the observed singlet 1 H NMR peak could be composed of the contributions from protons with two distinct local chemical environments.},

Its capability to describe structure, lattice parameters, thermal expansion, elastic constants and amorphization is evaluated. Additionally, the less coarsened models were evaluated for reproducing the swing effect and the host–guest interaction energies were analyzed. We find that MARTINI force fields successfully capture the structure of the Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) for different degrees of coarsening, with the exception of the MARTINI 2.0 models for the less coarse mapping. MARTINI 2.0 models predict more accurate values of C 11 and C 12 , while MARTINI 3.0 has a tendency to underestimate them. Among the possibilities tested, the choice of bead flavors within a particular MARTINI version appears to have a less critical impact in the simulated properties of the empty framework. None of the coarse-grained (CG) models investigated were able to capture the amorphization nor the swing effect within the scope of MD simulations. A perspective on the importance of having a proper Lennard-Jones (LJ) parametrization for modeling guest–MOF and MOF–MOF interactions is highlighted.},

In response theories, the contraction operation, rather than ERI computations, can be the major bottleneck, as its computational demands are proportional to the multiplicatively combined contributions of the number of excited states and the kernel pre-factors. This paper presents several high-performance strategies for METC. Optimal approaches involve either the data layout reformations of interim density and Fock matrices, the introduction of intermediate ERI quartet buffer, and loop-reordering optimization for a higher cache hit rate. The combined strategies remarkably improve the performance of the MRSF (mixed reference spin flip)-TDDFT (time-dependent density functional theory) by nearly 300\%.

In this work, the ML algorithms are tested to calculate the unimolecular dissociation time of benzene–hexachlorobenzene, benzene–trichlorobenzene, and benzene–monochlorobenzene complexes. Three ML algorithms, namely, Decision-Tree-Regression (DTR), Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Support Vector Regression are considered. The algorithms are trained with simulated dissociation times as functions (attributes) of complexes’ intramolecular and intermolecular vibrational energies.

  abstract = {The pathway(s) that a ligand would adopt en route to its trajectory to the native pocket of the receptor protein act as a key determinant of its biological activity. While Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as the method of choice for modeling protein-ligand binding events, the high dimensional nature of the MD-derived trajectories often remains a barrier in the statistical elucidation of distinct ligand binding pathways due to the stochasticity inherent in the ligand’s fluctuation in the solution and around the receptor. Here, we demonstrate that an autoencoder based deep neural network, trained using an objective input feature of a large matrix of residue–ligand distances, can efficiently produce an optimal low-dimensional latent space that stores necessary information on the ligand-binding event. In particular, for a system of L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme interacting with its native ligand, benzene, this deep encoder–decoder framework automatically identifies multiple distinct recognition pathways, without requiring user intervention. The intermediates involve the spatially discrete location of the ligand in different helices of the protein before its eventual recognition of native pose. The compressed subspace derived from the autoencoder provides a quantitatively accurate measure of the free energy and kinetics of ligand binding to the native pocket. The investigation also recommends that while a linear dimensional reduction technique, such as time-structured independent component analysis, can do a decent job of state-space decomposition in cases where the intermediates are long-lived, autoencoder is the method of choice in systems where transient, low-populated intermediates can lead to multiple ligand-binding pathways.},

The computational approach integrates the construction of datasets consisting of the energies calculated from density functional theory, the training of machine learning models to derive the relationship between system energy and structural features, and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations to sample the thermodynamic equilibrium structures of spinel crystals. It is found that the support vector machine model yields excellent performance in energy predictions based on spinel crystal structures. Furthermore, the developed computational approach has been applied to predict the cation distribution in single spinel MgAl 2 O 4 and MgFe 2 O 4 and double spinel MgAl 2-a Fe a O 4 . Agreeing with the available experimental data, the computational approach correctly predicts that the equilibrium degree of inversion of MgAl 2 O 4 increases with temperature, whereas the degree of inversion of MgFe 2 O 4 decreases with temperature. Additionally, it is predicted that the equilibrium occupancy of Mg cations at the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in MgAl 2-a Fe a O 4 could be tuned as a function of chemical composition. Therefore, this study presents a reliable computational approach that can be extended to study the variation of cation distribution with processing temperature and chemical composition in a wide range of complex multi-cation spinel oxides with numerous applications.},

In general, the recombination process is selective only for spin-coherence between singlet and triplet states, and it is not, in general, selective for spin polarization. We find that spin polarization selectivity only arises in hopping-mediated electron transfer. We describe how this effective spin-polarization selectivity is a consequence of spin-polarization generated transiently in the intermediate state. The recombination process also augments the coherent spin dynamics of the charge separated state, which is found to have a significant effect on the recombination dynamics and to destroy any long-lived spin polarization. Although we only consider a simple donor–bridge–acceptor system, the framework we present here can be straightforwardly extended to describe spin-selective recombination processes in more complex systems.},

The method employs two complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor cameras in addition to a standard microchannel plates/phosphor screen imaging detector. The two cameras are timed to measure the decay of luminescence excited by ion hits to extract the time of flight. The achieved time resolution is better than 10 ns, which is mainly limited by camera jitters. A better than 5 ns resolution can be achieved when the jitter is suppressed.},

The independent variable x of these distributions has an obligatory lower bound and, in many cases, also an upper bound. Estimating these bounds from sample data is notoriously difficult, with a recent method involving O ( N 3 ) operations, where N denotes sample size. Here I develop an approach for estimating the lower and upper bounds that involve O ( N ) operations. The approach centers on calculating the mean values, x ̂ min and x ̂ max ⁠ , of the smallest x and the largest x in N -point samples. A fit of x ̂ min or x ̂ max as a function of N yields the estimate for the lower or upper bound. Application to synthetic data demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of this approach.},

In the initial spectra recorded, in addition to the absorption corresponding to the bright ππ* excitation, the fingerprint of a transient state with the electron located on the solvent molecule is identified. We postulate that the latter corresponds to the πσ* state along the N–H bond, whose complete relaxation with a ∼500 ps lifetime results in the formation of the fully solvated electron and cation. This ionization process occurs in parallel with the ππ* photophysical channel that yields the characteristic ∼1 ns fluorescence lifetime. The observed branched pathway is rationalized in terms of the different H-bonds that the water establishes with the amino group. The proposed mechanism could be common for aromatics in water containing N–H or O–H bonds and would allow the formation of separated charges after excitation at the threshold of their electronic absorptions.},

Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we study the self-assembly of a binary mixture of cubic gold nanoparticles, which are functionalized by complementary DNA strands. We observe the spontaneous self-assembly of simple cubic (SC), plastic body-centered tetragonal (pBCT), and compositionally disordered plastic body-centered tetragonal (d-pBCT) phases due to hybridization of the DNA strands. We systematically investigate the effect of length, grafting density, as well as rigidity of the DNA strands on the self-assembly behavior of cubic nanoparticles. We measure the potential of mean force between DNA-functionalized nanocubes for varying rigidity of the DNA strands and DNA lengths. Using free-energy calculations, we find that longer and flexible DNA strands can lead to a phase transformation from SC to the pBCT phase due to a gain in entropy arising from the orientational degrees of freedom of the nanocubes in the pBCT phase. Our results may serve as a guide for self-assembly experiments on DNA-functionalized cubic nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {We generalize a microscopic statistical mechanical theory of the activated dynamics of dilute spherical penetrants in glass-forming liquids to study the influence of crosslinking in polymer networks on the penetrant relaxation time and diffusivity over a wide range of temperature and crosslink fraction ( f n ). Our calculations are relevant to recent experimental studies of a nm-sized molecule diffusing in poly-( n -butyl methacrylate) networks. The theory predicts the penetrant relaxation time increases exponentially with the glass transition temperature, T g ( f n ), which grows roughly linearly with the square root of f n due to the coupling of local hopping to longer-range collective elasticity. Moreover, T g is also found to be proportional to a geometric confinement parameter defined as the ratio of the penetrant diameter to the mean network mesh size. The decoupling ratio of the penetrant and Kuhn segment alpha times displays a complex non-monotonic dependence on f n and temperature that is well collapsed based on the variable T g ( f n )/ T . A model for the penetrant diffusion constant that combines activated relaxation and entropic mesh confinement is proposed, which results in a significantly stronger suppression of mass transport with degree of effective supercooling than predicted for the penetrant alpha time. This behavior corresponds to a new network-based type of “decoupling” of diffusion and relaxation. In contrast to the diffusion of larger nanoparticles in high temperature rubbery networks, our analysis in the supercooled regime suggests that for the penetrants studied the mesh confinement effects are of secondary importance relative to the consequences of crosslink-induced slowing down of activated hopping of glassy physics origin.},

  abstract = {For many computational chemistry packages, being able to efficiently and effectively scale across an exascale cluster is a heroic feat. Collective experience from the Department of Energy’s Exascale Computing Project suggests that achieving exascale performance requires far more planning, design, and optimization than scaling to petascale. In many cases, entire rewrites of software are necessary to address fundamental algorithmic bottlenecks. This in turn requires a tremendous amount of resources and development time, resources that cannot reasonably be afforded by every computational science project. It thus becomes imperative that computational science transition to a more sustainable paradigm. Key to such a paradigm is modular software. While the importance of modular software is widely recognized, what is perhaps not so widely appreciated is the effort still required to leverage modular software in a sustainable manner. The present manuscript introduces PluginPlay, https://github.com/NWChemEx-Project/PluginPlay , an inversion-of-control framework designed to facilitate developing, maintaining, and sustaining modular scientific software packages. This manuscript focuses on the design aspects of PluginPlay and how they specifically influence the performance of the resulting package. Although, PluginPlay serves as the framework for the NWChemEx package, PluginPlay is not tied to NWChemEx or even computational chemistry. We thus anticipate PluginPlay to prove to be a generally useful tool for a number of computational science packages looking to transition to the exascale.},

  abstract = {Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are efficient organic photoredox catalysts due to their high extinction coefficients and easily tunable band edge potentials. Despite the majority of the surface being covered by ligands, our understanding of the effect of the ligand shell on organic photocatalysis is limited to steric effects. We hypothesize that we can increase the activity of QD photocatalysts by designing a ligand shell with targeted electronic properties, namely, redox-mediating ligands. Herein, we functionalize our QDs with hole-mediating ferrocene (Fc) derivative ligands and perform a reaction where the slow step is hole transfer from QD to substrate. Surprisingly, we find that a hole-shuttling Fc inhibits catalysis, but confers much greater stability to the catalyst by preventing a build-up of destructive holes. We also find that dynamically bound Fc ligands can promote catalysis by surface exchange and creation of a more permeable ligand shell. Finally, we find that trapping the electron on a ligand dramatically increases the rate of reaction. These results have major implications for understanding the rate-limiting processes for charge transfer from QDs and the role of the ligand shell in modulating it.},

It is shown that the four-line structure observed around g ∼ 2.00 in the as-grown samples (beside the usual core-defect signal at g ∼ 1.96) arises from surface-located methyl radicals ( • CH 3 ), originating from the acetate capped ZnO molecules. By functionalizing the as-grown zinc oxide NPs with deuterated sodium acetate, the • CH 3 electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal is replaced by trideuteromethyl ( • CD 3 ). For • CH 3 , • CD 3 , and core-defect signals, an electron spin echo is detected below ∼100 K, allowing for the spin–lattice and spin–spin relaxation-time measurements for each of them. Advanced pulse-EPR techniques reveal the proton or deuteron spin-echo modulation for both radicals and give access to small unresolved superhyperfine couplings between adjacent • CH 3 . In addition, electron double resonance techniques show that some correlations exist between the different EPR transitions of • CH 3 . These correlations are discussed as possibly arising from cross-relaxation phenomena between different rotational states of radicals.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the solubility of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in water along the isobar of 400 bar is determined by computer simulations using the well-known TIP4P/Ice force field for water and the TraPPE model for CO 2 . In particular, the solubility of CO 2 in water when in contact with the CO 2 liquid phase and the solubility of CO 2 in water when in contact with the hydrate have been determined. The solubility of CO 2 in a liquid–liquid system decreases as the temperature increases. The solubility of CO 2 in a hydrate–liquid system increases with temperature. The two curves intersect at a certain temperature that determines the dissociation temperature of the hydrate at 400 bar ( T 3 ). We compare the predictions with T 3 obtained using the direct coexistence technique in a previous work. The results of both methods agree, and we suggest 290(2) K as the value of T 3 for this system using the same cutoff distance for dispersive interactions. We also propose a novel and alternative route to evaluate the change in chemical potential for the formation of hydrates along the isobar. The new approach is based on the use of the solubility curve of CO 2 when the aqueous solution is in contact with the hydrate phase. It considers rigorously the non-ideality of the aqueous solution of CO 2 , providing reliable values for the driving force for nucleation of hydrates in good agreement with other thermodynamic routes used. It is shown that the driving force for hydrate nucleation at 400 bar is larger for the methane hydrate than for the carbon dioxide hydrate when compared at the same supercooling. We have also analyzed and discussed the effect of the cutoff distance of dispersive interactions and the occupancy of CO 2 on the driving force for nucleation of the hydrate.},

Under the highest studied frequency (50 GHz) and amplitude (5\%) of the load, the increase of in (mean value) dynamic surface tension could reach ∼5\%. The peak and trough values of the instantaneous dynamic surface tension could reach (up to) 40\% increase and (up to) 20\% decrease compared to the equilibrium surface tension, respectively. The extracted generalized natural frequencies seem to be intimately related to the intrinsic timescales of the atomic temporal–spatial correlation functions of the liquids both in the bulk region and in the outermost surface layers. These insights uncovered could be helpful for quantitative manipulation of the liquid surface using ultrafast shockwaves or laser pulses.},

The method is based on fitting the Helmholtz free energy using artificial neural networks to obtain a closed-form relationship between the thermophysical properties of fluids (FE-ANN EoS). As a proof-of-concept, an FE-ANN EoS is developed for the Mie fluids, starting from a database obtained by classical molecular dynamics simulations. The FE-ANN EoS is trained using first- (pressure and internal energy) and second-order (e.g., heat capacities, Joule–Thomson coefficients) derivative data. Additional constraints ensure that the data-driven model fulfills thermodynamically consistent limits and behavior. The results for the FE-ANN EoS are shown to be as accurate as the best available analytical model while being developed in a fraction of the time. The robustness of the “digital” equation of state is exemplified by computing physical behavior it has not been trained on, for example, fluid phase equilibria. Furthermore, the model’s internal consistency is successfully assessed using Brown’s characteristic curves.},

  abstract = {Computational studies of liquid water and its phase transition into vapor have traditionally been performed using classical water models. Here, we utilize the Deep Potential methodology—a machine learning approach—to study this ubiquitous phase transition, starting from the phase diagram in the liquid–vapor coexistence regime. The machine learning model is trained on ab initio energies and forces based on the SCAN density functional, which has been previously shown to reproduce solid phases and other properties of water. Here, we compute the surface tension, saturation pressure, and enthalpy of vaporization for a range of temperatures spanning from 300 to 600 K and evaluate the Deep Potential model performance against experimental results and the semiempirical TIP4P/2005 classical model. Moreover, by employing the seeding technique, we evaluate the free energy barrier and nucleation rate at negative pressures for the isotherm of 296.4 K. We find that the nucleation rates obtained from the Deep Potential model deviate from those computed for the TIP4P/2005 water model due to an underestimation in the surface tension from the Deep Potential model. From analysis of the seeding simulations, we also evaluate the Tolman length for the Deep Potential water model, which is (0.091 ± 0.008) nm at 296.4 K. Finally, we identify that water molecules display a preferential orientation in the liquid–vapor interface, in which H atoms tend to point toward the vapor phase to maximize the enthalpic gain of interfacial molecules. We find that this behavior is more pronounced for planar interfaces than for the curved interfaces in bubbles. This work represents the first application of Deep Potential models to the study of liquid–vapor coexistence and water cavitation.},

  abstract = {By using dielectric spectroscopy in a broad range of temperatures and frequencies, we have investigated dipolar relaxations, the dc conductivity, and the possible occurrence of polar order in AgCN. The conductivity contributions dominate the dielectric response at elevated temperatures and low frequencies, most likely arising from the mobility of the small silver ions. In addition, we observe the dipolar relaxation dynamics of the dumbbell-shaped CN − ions, whose temperature dependence follows the Arrhenius behavior with a hindering barrier of 0.59 eV (57 kJ/mol). It correlates well with a systematic development of the relaxation dynamics with the cation radius, previously observed in various alkali cyanides. By comparison with the latter, we conclude that AgCN does not exhibit a plastic high-temperature phase with free rotation of the cyanide ions. Instead, our results indicate that a phase with quadrupolar order, revealing dipolar head-to-tail disorder of the CN − ions, exists at elevated temperatures up to the decomposition temperature, which crosses over to long-range polar order of the CN dipole moments below about 475 K. Dipole ordering was also reported for NaCN and KCN, and a comparison with these systems suggests a critical relaxation rate of 10 5 –10 7 Hz, marking the onset of dipolar order in the cyanides. The detected relaxation dynamics in this order–disorder type polar state points to glasslike freezing below about 195 K of a fraction of non-ordered CN dipoles.},

  abstract = {By using time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy with polarization analysis, we have separated coherent and incoherent contributions to the scattering of deuterated tetrahydrofuran in a wide scattering vector ( Q )-range from meso- to inter-molecular length scales. The results are compared with those recently reported for water to address the influence of the nature of inter-molecular interactions (van der Waals vs hydrogen bond) on the dynamics. The phenomenology found is qualitatively similar in both systems. Both collective and self-scattering functions are satisfactorily described in terms of a convolution model that considers vibrations, diffusion, and a Q -independent mode. We observe a crossover in the structural relaxation from being dominated by the Q -independent mode at the mesoscale to being dominated by diffusion at inter-molecular length scales. The characteristic time of the Q -independent mode is the same for collective and self-motions and, contrary to water, faster and with a lower activation energy (≈1.4 Kcal/mol) than the structural relaxation time at inter-molecular length scales. This follows the macroscopic viscosity behavior. The collective diffusive time is well described by the de Gennes narrowing relation proposed for simple monoatomic liquids in a wide Q -range entering the intermediate length scales, in contraposition to the case of water.},

  abstract = {Externally applied electric fields in liquid water can induce a plethora of effects with wide implications in electrochemistry and hydrogen-based technologies. Although some effort has been made to elucidate the thermodynamics associated with the application of electric fields in aqueous systems, to the best of our knowledge, field-induced effects on the total and local entropy of bulk water have never been presented so far. Here, we report on classical TIP4P/2005 and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations measuring entropic contributions carried by diverse field intensities in liquid water at room temperature. We find that strong fields are capable of aligning large fractions of molecular dipoles. Nevertheless, the order-maker action of the field leads to quite modest entropy reductions in classical simulations. Albeit more significant variations are recorded during first-principles simulations, the associated entropy modifications are small compared to the entropy change involved in the freezing phenomenon, even at intense fields slightly beneath the molecular dissociation threshold. This finding further corroborates the idea that electrofreezing (i.e., the electric-field-induced crystallization) cannot take place in bulk water at room temperature. In addition, here, we propose a molecular-dynamics-based analysis (3D-2PT) that spatially resolves the local entropy and the number density of bulk water under an electric field, which enables us to map their field-induced changes in the environment of reference H 2 O molecules. By returning detailed spatial maps of the local order, the proposed approach is capable of establishing a link between entropic and structural modifications with atomistic resolution.},

  abstract = {The structural evolution with pressure of icy mixtures of simple molecules is a poorly explored field despite the fundamental role they play in setting the properties of the crustal icy layer of the outer planets and of their satellites. Water and ammonia are the two major components of these mixtures, and the crystal properties of the two pure systems and of their compounds have been studied at high pressures in a certain detail. On the contrary, the study of their heterogeneous crystalline mixtures whose properties, due to the strong N–H⋯O and O–H⋯N hydrogen bonds, can be substantially altered with respect to the individual species has so far been overlooked. In this work, we performed a comparative Raman study with a high spatial resolution of the lattice phonon spectrum of both pure ammonia and water–ammonia mixtures in a pressure range of great interest for modeling the properties of icy planets’ interiors. Lattice phonon spectra represent the spectroscopic signature of the molecular crystals’ structure. The activation of a phonon mode in plastic NH 3 -III attests to a progressive reduction in the orientational disorder, which corresponds to a site symmetry reduction. This spectroscopic hallmark allowed us to solve the pressure evolution of H 2 O–NH 3 –AHH (ammonia hemihydrate) solid mixtures, which present a remarkably different behavior from the pure crystals likely to be ascribed to the role of the strong H-bonds between water and ammonia molecules characterizing the crystallites’ surface.},

  abstract = {Non-impact effects in the absorption spectra of HCl in various collision-partners are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Fourier transform spectra of HCl broadened by CO 2 , air, and He have been recorded in the 2-0 band region at room temperature and for a wide pressure range, from 1 to up to 11.5 bars. Comparisons between measurements and calculations using Voigt profiles show strong super-Lorentzian absorptions in the troughs between successive lines in the P and R branches for HCl in CO 2 . A weaker effect is observed for HCl in air, while for HCl in He, Lorentzian wings are in very good agreement with measurements. In addition, the line intensities retrieved by fitting the Voigt profile on the measured spectra decrease with the density of the perturber. This perturber-density dependence decreases with the rotational quantum number. For HCl in CO 2 , the decrease in the retrieved line intensity can reach 2.5\% per amagat for the first rotational quantum numbers. This number is about 0.8\% per amagat for HCl in air, while for HCl in He, no density dependence of the retrieved line intensity is observed. Requantized classical molecular dynamics simulations have been performed for HCl–CO 2 and HCl–He in order to simulate the absorption spectra for various perturber-density conditions. The density dependence of the intensities retrieved from the simulated spectra and the predicted super-Lorentzian behavior in the troughs between lines are in good agreement with experimental determinations for both HCl–CO 2 and HCl–He. Our analysis shows that these effects are due to incomplete or ongoing collisions, which govern the dipole auto-correlation function at very short times. The effects of these ongoing collisions strongly depend on the details of the intermolecular potential: they are negligible for HCl–He but significant for HCl–CO 2 for which a line-shape model beyond the impact approximation will be needed to correctly model the absorption spectra from the center to the far wings.},

  abstract = {Solid-state nuclear spin diffusion is the coherent and reversible process through which spin order is transferred via dipolar couplings. With the recent increases in magic-angle spinning (MAS) frequencies and magnetic fields becoming routinely applied in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, understanding how the increased 1 H resolution obtained affects spin diffusion is necessary for interpretation of several common experiments. To investigate the coherent contributions to spin diffusion with fast MAS, we have developed a low-order correlation in Liouville space model based on the work of Dumez et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 33 , 224501, 2010). Specifically, we introduce a new method for basis set selection, which accounts for the resonance-offset dependence at fast MAS. Furthermore, we consider the necessity of including chemical shift, both isotropic and anisotropic, in the modeling of spin diffusion. Using this model, we explore how different experimental factors change the nature of spin diffusion. Then, we show case studies to exemplify the issues that arise in using spin diffusion techniques at fast spinning. We show that the efficiency of polarization transfer via spin diffusion occurring within a deuterated and 100\% back-exchanged protein sample at 60 kHz MAS is almost entirely dependent on resonance offset. We additionally identify temperature-dependent magnetization transfer in beta-aspartyl L-alanine, which could be explained by the influence of an incoherent relaxation-based nuclear Overhauser effect.},

  abstract = {At the limit of an infinite confinement strength ω , the ground state of a system that comprises two fermions or bosons in harmonic confinement interacting through the Fermi–Huang pseudopotential remains strongly correlated. A detailed analysis of the one-particle description of this “contactium” reveals several peculiarities that are not encountered in conventional model systems (such as the two-electron harmonium atom, ballium, and spherium) involving Coulombic interparticle interactions. First of all, none of the natural orbitals (NOs) { ψ n ( ω ; r ) } of the contactium is unoccupied, which implies nonzero collective occupancies for all the angular momenta. Second, the NOs and their non-ascendingly ordered occupation numbers { ν n } turn out to be related to the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a zero-energy Schrödinger equation with an attractive Gaussian potential. This observation enables the derivation of their properties, such as the n − 4 / 3 asymptotic decay of ν n at the n → ∞ limit (which differs from that of n − 8 / 3 in the Coulombic systems), the independence of the confinement energy v n = ⟨ ψ n ( ω ; r ) | 1 2 ω 2 r 2 | ψ n ( ω ; r ) ⟩ of n ⁠ , and the n − 2 / 3 asymptotic decay of the respective contribution ν n t n to the kinetic energy. Upon suitable scaling, the weakly occupied NOs of the contactium turn out to be virtually identical to those of the two-electron harmonium atom at the ω → ∞ limit, despite the entirely different interparticle interactions in these systems.},

In this work, we have performed an extensive benchmark of several approximations with different computational complexity [G 0 W 0 @PBEsol, HSE06, PBEsol, modified Becke-Johnson potential (mBJ), DFT-1/2, and ACBN0] to evaluate and compare their performance in predicting the bandgap of semiconductors. The benchmark is based on 114 binary semiconductors of different compositions and crystal structures, for about half of which experimental band gaps are known. Surprisingly, we find that, compared with G 0 W 0 @PBEsol, which exhibits a noticeable underestimation of the band gaps by about 14\%, the much computationally cheaper pseudohybrid ACBN0 functional shows a competitive performance in reproducing the experimental data. The mBJ functional also performs well relative to the experiment, even slightly better than G 0 W 0 @PBEsol in terms of mean absolute (percentage) error. The HSE06 and DFT-1/2 schemes perform overall worse than ACBN0 and mBJ schemes but much better than PBEsol. Comparing the calculated band gaps on the whole dataset (including the samples with no experimental bandgap), we find that HSE06 and mBJ have excellent agreement with respect to the reference G 0 W 0 @PBEsol band gaps. The linear and monotonic correlations between the selected theoretical schemes and experiment are analyzed in terms of the Pearson and Kendall rank coefficients. Our findings strongly suggest the ACBN0 and mBJ methods as very efficient replacements for the costly G 0 W 0 scheme in high-throughput screening of the semiconductor band gaps.},

  abstract = {Atomistic machine learning focuses on the creation of models that obey fundamental symmetries of atomistic configurations, such as permutation, translation, and rotation invariances. In many of these schemes, translation and rotation invariance are achieved by building on scalar invariants, e.g., distances between atom pairs. There is growing interest in molecular representations that work internally with higher rank rotational tensors, e.g., vector displacements between atoms, and tensor products thereof. Here, we present a framework for extending the Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network (HIP-NN) with Tensor Sensitivity information (HIP-NN-TS) from each local atomic environment. Crucially, the method employs a weight tying strategy that allows direct incorporation of many-body information while adding very few model parameters. We show that HIP-NN-TS is more accurate than HIP-NN, with negligible increase in parameter count, for several datasets and network sizes. As the dataset becomes more complex, tensor sensitivities provide greater improvements to model accuracy. In particular, HIP-NN-TS achieves a record mean absolute error of 0.927 k c a l m o l for conformational energy variation on the challenging COMP6 benchmark, which includes a broad set of organic molecules. We also compare the computational performance of HIP-NN-TS to HIP-NN and other models in the literature.},

We find that the adiabatic kernel can be sufficient in strongly bound covalent systems, yielding similar bond lengths and binding energies. However, for non-covalent systems, the adiabatic kernel introduces significant errors around equilibrium geometry, systematically overestimating the interaction energy. The origin of this behavior is investigated by studying a model dimer composed of one-dimensional, closed-shell atoms, interacting via soft-Coulomb potentials. The kernel is shown to exhibit a strong frequency dependence at small to intermediate atomic separation that affects both the low-energy spectrum and the exchange-correlation hole obtained from the corresponding diagonal of the two-particle density matrix.},

Simulation methods are appealing due to direct availability of atomic coordinates as a function of time. However, direct molecular simulations are challenged by the size of systems and the time scales needed to describe relevant motions. In theory, enhanced sampling algorithms can help to overcome some of the limitations of molecular simulations. Here, we discuss a problem in biochemistry that offers a significant challenge for enhanced sampling methods and that could, therefore, serve as a benchmark for comparing approaches that use machine learning to find suitable collective variables. In particular, we study the transitions LacI undergoes upon moving between being non-specifically and specifically bound to DNA. Many degrees of freedom change during this transition and that the transition does not occur reversibly in simulations if only a subset of these degrees of freedom are biased. We also explain why this problem is so important to biologists and the transformative impact that a simulation of it would have on the understanding of DNA regulation.},

  abstract = {A way to improve the accuracy of the spectral properties in density functional theory (DFT) is to impose constraints on the effective, Kohn–Sham (KS), local potential [J. Chem. Phys. 136 , 224109 (2012)]. As illustrated, a convenient variational quantity in that approach is the “screening” or “electron repulsion” density, ρ rep , corresponding to the local, KS Hartree, exchange and correlation potential through Poisson’s equation. Two constraints, applied to this minimization, largely remove self-interaction errors from the effective potential: (i) ρ rep integrates to N − 1, where N is the number of electrons, and (ii) ρ rep ≥ 0 everywhere. In this work, we introduce an effective “screening” amplitude, f , as the variational quantity, with the screening density being ρ rep = f 2 . In this way, the positivity condition for ρ rep is automatically satisfied, and the minimization problem becomes more efficient and robust. We apply this technique to molecular calculations, employing several approximations in DFT and in reduced density matrix functional theory.

  abstract = {We introduce a semi-classical approximation for calculating generalized multi-time correlation functions based on Matsubara dynamics, a classical dynamics approach that conserves the quantum Boltzmann distribution. This method is exact for the zero time and harmonic limits and reduces to classical dynamics when only one Matsubara mode is considered (i.e., the centroid). Generalized multi-time correlation functions can be expressed as canonical phase-space integrals, involving classically evolved observables coupled through Poisson brackets in a smooth Matsubara space. Numerical tests on a simple potential show that the Matsubara approximation exhibits better agreement with exact results than classical dynamics, providing a bridge between the purely quantum and classical descriptions of multi-time correlation functions. Despite the phase problem that prevents practical applications of Matsubara dynamics, the reported work provides a benchmark theory for the future development of quantum-Boltzmann-preserving semi-classical approximations for studies of chemical dynamics in condensed phase systems.},

  abstract = {In the simulation of x-ray absorption spectroscopy, the validity of the electric-dipole approximation comes into question. Three different schemes exist to go beyond this approximation: the first scheme is based on the full semi-classical light–matter interaction, whereas the latter two schemes, referred to as the generalized length and velocity representation, are based on truncated multipole expansions. Even though these schemes have been successfully implemented in several quantum chemistry codes, their basis set requirements remained largely unknown. Here, we assess basis set requirements of these three schemes. We have considered 1 s 1/2 and 7 s 1/2 → 7 p 1/2 transitions in the radium atom, representative of core and valence excitations, respectively, and carried out calculations with dyall.aeXz (X = 2, 3, 4) basis sets at the four-component relativistic TD-HF level of theory. Our basis set study was greatly facilitated by the generation and visualization of radial distributions of transition moment densities, allowing for a straightforward comparison with equivalent finite-difference calculations. Pertaining to the truncated interaction, we find that the length representation electric multipole is the easiest to converge, requiring the dyall.ae2z basis for low-order multipoles and the dyall.ae4z basis at higher orders. The magnetic multipole moments follow a similar trend although they are more difficult to converge. The velocity representation electric multipoles are the most difficult to converge: at high orders, the dyall.ae3z and dyall.ae4z basis sets introduce artificial peaks and oscillations, which increase the overall error. These artifacts are associated with linear dependence issues in the small component space of larger basis sets. The full interaction operator, however, does not suffer from these problems, and we therefore recommend its use in the simulation of x-ray spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {In this work, we develop a new semiempirical method, dubbed NOTCH (Natural Orbital Tied Constructed Hamiltonian). Compared to existing semiempirical methods, NOTCH is less empirical in its functional form as well as parameterization. Specifically, in NOTCH, (1) the core electrons are treated explicitly; (2) the nuclear–nuclear repulsion term is calculated analytically, without any empirical parameterization; (3) the contraction coefficients of the atomic orbital (AO) basis depend on the coordinates of the neighboring atoms, which allows the size of AOs to depend on the molecular environment, despite the fact that a minimal basis set is used; (4) the one-center integrals of free atoms are derived from scalar relativistic multireference equation-of-motion coupled cluster calculations instead of empirical fitting, drastically reducing the number of necessary empirical parameters; (5) the (AA|AB) and (AB|AB)-type two-center integrals are explicitly included, going beyond the neglect of differential diatomic overlap approximation; and (6) the integrals depend on the atomic charges, effectively mimicking the “breathing” of AOs when the atomic charge varies. For this preliminary report, the model has been parameterized for the elements H–Ne, giving only 8 empirical global parameters. Preliminary results on the ionization potentials, electron affinities, and excitation energies of atoms and diatomic molecules, as well as the equilibrium geometries, vibrational frequencies dipole moments, and bond dissociation energies of diatomic molecules, show that the accuracy of NOTCH rivals or exceeds those of popular semiempirical methods (including PM3, PM7, OM2, OM3, GFN-xTB, and GFN2-xTB) as well as the cost-effective ab initio method Hartree–Fock-3c.},

The recently developed multireference-coupled cluster Monte Carlo (mrCCMC) technique uses the formal simplicity of the Monte Carlo approach to Hilbert space quantum chemistry to avoid some of the complexities of conventional MRCC, but there is room for improvement in terms of accuracy and, particularly, computational cost. In this paper, we explore the potential of incorporating ideas from conventional MRCC—namely, the treatment of the strongly correlated space in a configuration interaction formalism—to the mrCCMC framework, leading to a series of methods with increasing relaxation of the reference space in the presence of external amplitudes. These techniques offer new balances of stability and cost against accuracy, as well as a means to better explore and better understand the structure of solutions to the mrCCMC equations.},

  abstract = {Polymer brush layers are responsive materials that swell in contact with good solvents and their vapors. We deposit drops of an almost completely wetting volatile oil onto an oleophilic polymer brush layer and follow the response of the system upon simultaneous exposure to both liquid and vapor. Interferometric imaging shows that a halo of partly swollen polymer brush layer forms ahead of the moving contact line. The swelling dynamics of this halo is controlled by a subtle balance of direct imbibition from the drop into the brush layer and vapor phase transport and can lead to very long-lived transient swelling profiles as well as nonequilibrium configurations involving thickness gradients in a stationary state. A gradient dynamics model based on a free energy functional with three coupled fields is developed and numerically solved. It describes experimental observations and reveals how local evaporation and condensation conspire to stabilize the inhomogeneous nonequilibrium stationary swelling profiles. A quantitative comparison of experiments and calculations provides access to the solvent diffusion coefficient within the brush layer. Overall, the results highlight the—presumably generally applicable—crucial role of vapor phase transport in dynamic wetting phenomena involving volatile liquids on swelling functional surfaces.},

We also find that the gel exhibits stronger dynamical heterogeneity compared with the glass due to the greater correlated motions in the gel. Moreover, a logarithmic decay in the correlation function is observed as the two nonergodicity origins merge, consistent with the mode coupling theory.},

Results showed that H-bonding dynamics significantly slowed as the water content decreased. Additionally, the diffusion of water molecules and its correlation with H-bond breakage were analyzed. Our findings suggest that when the H-bonds between water molecules and the methoxy oxygen of PMEA are disrupted, those water molecules persist in close proximity and do not diffuse on a picosecond time scale. In contrast, the water molecules H-bonded with the hydroxy oxygen of PHEMA and the methoxy oxygen of PMC1A diffuse concomitantly with the breakage of H-bonds.

Compounds, such as ionic liquids (ILs), have been explored as chemical additives and interface modifiers in perovskite solar cells, contributing to the rapid increase in cell efficiencies. However, due to the small surface area-to-volume ratio of the large grained polycrystalline halide perovskite films, an atomistic understanding of the interaction between ILs and perovskite surfaces is limited. Here, we use quantum dots (QDs) to study the coordinative surface interaction between phosphonium-based ILs and CsPbBr 3 . When native oleylammonium oleate ligands are exchanged off the QD surface with the phosphonium cation as well as the IL anion, a threefold increase in photoluminescent quantum yield of as-synthesized QDs is observed. The CsPbBr 3 QD structure, shape, and size remain unchanged after ligand exchange, indicating only a surface ligand interaction at approximately equimolar additions of the IL. Increased concentrations of the IL lead to a disadvantageous phase change and a concomitant decrease in photoluminescent quantum yields. Valuable information regarding the coordinative interaction between certain ILs and lead halide perovskites has been elucidated and can be used for informed pairing of beneficial combinations of IL cations and anions.},

Effective strategies are highly desired to improve the Na + storage performance of TMOs for applications. In this work, using ZnFe 2 O 4 @xC nanocomposites as model materials for investigation, we found that by manipulating the particle sizes of the inner TMOs core and the features of outer carbon coating, the Na + storage performance can be significantly improved. The ZnFe 2 O 4 @1C with a diameter of the inner ZnFe 2 O 4 core of around 200 nm coated by a thin carbon layer of around 3 nm shows a specific capacity of only 120 mA h g −1 . The ZnFe 2 O 4 @6.5C with a diameter of the inner ZnFe 2 O 4 core of around 110 nm embedding in a porous interconnected carbon matrix displays a significantly improved specific capacity of 420 mA h g −1 at the same specific current. Furthermore, the latter shows an excellent cycling stability of 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 90\% of the initial 220 mA h g −1 specific capacity at 1.0 A g −1 . TEM, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and kinetic analysis show that the inner ZnFe 2 O 4 core with reduced particle size and the outer thicker and interconnected carbon matrix synergistically improve the active reaction sites, integrity, electric conductivity, and pseudocapacitive-controlled contribution of ZnFe 2 O 4 @xC nanocomposites, thus leading to an overall enhanced Na + storage performance.

The dehydrogenation was facilitated by hydroxyl (OH* or OD*) from the dissociation of little co-adsorbed water; a small fraction of CD 2 O* interacted further with OH* (OD*) to form, via intermediate CD 2 OOH* (CD 2 OOD*), formic acid (DCOOH* or DCOOD*). A few surface carbonates were also yielded, likely on the defect sites of Al 2 O 3 /NiAl(100).

  abstract = {The optical properties of non-toxic indium phosphide (InP) quantum dots (QDs) are impinged by the existence of characteristic deep trap states. Several surface engineering strategies have been adopted to improve their optical quality, which has promoted the use of InP QDs for various technological applications. An antithetical approach involves the effective utilization of the deep trap states in InP QDs to modulate back electron transfer rates. Here, we explore the influence of the core-size of InP on their In-to-P stoichiometry and charge transfer dynamics when bound to an acceptor molecule, decyl viologen (DV 2+ ). The mechanism of interaction of InP and DV 2+ based on the quenching sphere model established the presence of (i) a 1:1 complex of DV 2+ bound on InP and (ii) immobile quenchers in the quenching sphere, depending on the concentration of DV 2+ . While the forward electron transfer rates from photoexcited InP to bound DV 2+ does not substantially vary with an increase in core size, the back electron transfer rates are found to be retarded. Findings from inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveal that the In to P ratio is higher for QDs with larger core size, which further brings about increased carrier trapping and a decreased rate of charge recombination. Furthermore, long-lived charge-separated states in DV 2+ bound to InP, extending to hundreds of milliseconds, are obtained by varying the number of DV 2+ in the quenching sphere of the QDs.},

  abstract = {The development of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with high lithium ionic conductivities is critical for the realization of all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. Crystal structure distortions, Li polyhedron volumes, and anion charges in SSEs are reported to affect the energy landscapes, and it is paramount to investigate their correlations. Our works uncover the cooperative effect of lithium site distortions, anion charges, and lattice volumes on Li-ion migration energy barrier in superionic conductors of LiMS 2 (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) and Li 2 MO 3 (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni). Combined with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator analyses, the volume and Continuous symmetrical methods (CSMs) of Li tetrahedral (Tet) sites appear to have a larger effect on the manipulation of E a for Li migration, compared to that of Li octahedral (Oct) sites, which is further confirmed by the results from the face-centered cubic (fcc) anion lattice model. For the Tet–Oct–Tet Li migration path, the CSM (the volume of Li site) has a negative (positive) correlation with E a , while for the Oct–Tet–Oct Li migration paths, opposite correlations have been observed. The understanding of the correlation between site preference, anion charge, lattice volume, and structural distortion as well as the prediction model of E a in terms of these three factors, namely, C–V–D model, could be useful for the design of solid-state electrolytes with lower activation energy.},

  abstract = {Organometallic phosphors are an important class of emissive materials used in high-efficiency organic light-emitting devices. However, problems of low photostability arise for blue-emitting phosphors due to chemical and environmental degradation and triplet quenching processes. Various approaches have been developed to improve the photostability of such phosphors, including the design of new organometallic molecules and control of host-dopant composition in thin films. Here, we demonstrate a different approach for improving the photostability of blue organometallic phosphors that uses localized surface plasmon resonances to increase the triplet recombination rate. The increased recombination rate improves the photostability of the phosphor due to the reduction in triplet quenching pathways. We show that the lifetime of phosphorescence is decreased significantly by nanoparticle-based plasmonic surfaces, which improves the photostability of the blue organometallic phosphor by up to a factor of 3.6. Other plasmonic surfaces are also tested and exhibit less significant photostability improvements due to a reduced spectral overlap of the plasmonic modes with the emitter and lower mode confinement. The use of plasmonic surfaces to improve phosphor photostability at blue wavelengths is distinct from other approaches because it involves modification to the local electromagnetic environment of the phosphor rather than modifications to the phosphor molecular structure or the emitting material composition.},

  abstract = {On homogeneous substrates, droplets can slide due to external driving forces, such as gravity, whereas in the presence of wettability gradients, sliding occurs without external forces since this gradient gives rise to an internal driving force. Here, we study via molecular dynamics simulations the more complex behavior when droplets are driven under the combined influence of an external and internal driving force. For comparison, the limiting cases of a single driving force are studied as well. During a large part of the sliding process over the borderline of both substrates, separating both wettabilities, the velocity is nearly constant. When expressing it as the product of the effective mobility and the effective force, the effective mobility mainly depends on the mobility of the initial substrate, experienced by the receding contact line. This observation can be reconciled with the properties of the flow pattern, indicating that the desorption of particles at the receding contact line is the time-limiting step. The effective force is the sum of the external force and a renormalized internal force. This renormalization can be interpreted as stronger dissipation effects when driving occurs via wettability gradients.},

  abstract = {We study the friction when rectangular blocks made from rubber, polyethylene, and silica glass are sliding on ice surfaces at different temperatures ranging from −40 to 0 °C, and sliding speeds ranging from 3 μ m/s to 1 cm s −1 . We consider a winter tire rubber compound both in the form of a compact block and as a foam with ∼ 10\% void volume. We find that both rubber compounds exhibit a similar friction on ice for all studied temperatures. As in a previous study at low temperatures and low sliding speeds, we propose that an important contribution to the friction force is due to slip between the ice surface and ice fragments attached to the rubber surface. At temperatures around 0 °C (or for high enough sliding speeds), a thin pre-melted water film will occur at the rubber–ice interface, and the contribution to the friction from shearing the area of real contact is small. In this case, the dominant contribution to the friction force is due to viscoelastic deformations of the rubber by the ice asperities. The sliding friction for polyethylene (PE) and silica glass (SG) blocks on ice differs strongly from that of rubber. The friction coefficient for PE is ∼ 0.04 − 0.15 and is relatively weakly velocity dependent except close to the ice melting temperature where the friction coefficient increases toward low sliding speeds. Silica glass exhibits a similarly low friction as PE for T &gt; −10 °C but very large friction coefficients (of order unity) at low temperatures. For both PE and SG, unless the ice track is very smooth, the friction force depends on the position x along the sliding track. This is due to bumps on the ice surface, which are sheared off by the elastically stiff PE and SG blocks, resulting in a plowing-type of contribution to the friction force. This results in friction coefficients, which locally can be very large ∼ 1 ⁠ , and visual inspection of the ice surface after the sliding acts show ice wear particles (white powder) in regions where ice bumps occur. Similar effects can be expected for rubber blocks below the rubber glass transition temperature, and the rubber is in the (elastically stiff) glassy state.},

However, coupling multiple characterization techniques to realize in situ multidimensional analysis of electrochemical interfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we presented a hyphenated differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy analytical method via a specially designed electrochemical cell that enables a simultaneous detection of deposited and volatile interface species under electrochemical reaction conditions, especially suitable for non-aqueous, electrolyte-based energy devices. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the capability of the homemade setup and obtained the valuable reaction mechanisms, by taking the tantalizing reactions in non-aqueous lithium-ion batteries (i.e., oxidation and reduction processes of carbonate-based electrolytes on Li 1+x Ni 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 and graphite surfaces) and lithium-oxygen batteries (i.e., reversibility of the oxygen reaction) as model reactions. Overall, we believe that the coupled and complementary techniques reported here will provide important insights into the interfacial electrochemistry of energy storage materials (i.e., in situ, multi-dimensional information in one single experiment) and generate much interest in the electrochemistry community and beyond.},

  abstract = {Frequency-dependent dielectric relaxation in three deep eutectic solvents (DESs), (acetamide+LiClO 4 /NO 3 /Br), was investigated in the temperature range, 329 ≤ T/K ≤ 358, via molecular dynamics simulations. Subsequently, decomposition of the real and the imaginary components of the simulated dielectric spectra was carried out to separate the rotational (dipole–dipole), translational (ion–ion), and ro-translational (dipole–ion) contributions. The dipolar contribution, as expected, was found to dominate all the frequency-dependent dielectric spectra over the entire frequency regime, while the other two components together made tiny contributions only. The translational (ion–ion) and the cross ro-translational contributions appeared in the THz regime in contrast to the viscosity-dependent dipolar relaxations that dominated the MHz–GHz frequency window. Our simulations predicted, in agreement with experiments, anion-dependent decrement of the static dielectric constant ( ɛ s ∼ 20 to 30) for acetamide ( ɛ s ∼ 66) in these ionic DESs. Simulated dipole-correlations (Kirkwood g factor) indicated significant orientational frustrations. The frustrated orientational structure was found to be associated with the anion-dependent damage of the acetamide H-bond network. Single dipole reorientation time distributions suggested slowed down acetamide rotations but did not indicate presence of any “rotationally frozen” molecule. The dielectric decrement is, therefore, largely static in origin. This provides a new insight into the ion dependence of the dielectric behavior of these ionic DESs. A good agreement between the simulated and the experimental timescales was also noticed.},

The density of states of these non-phononic modes has been observed to follow g ( ω ) ∝ ω 4 , where ω is the frequency. However, in two-dimensional systems, the abundance of phonons makes it difficult to accurately determine this non-phononic density of states because they are strongly coupled to non-phononic modes and yield strong system-size and preparation-protocol dependencies. In this article, we utilize the random pinning method to suppress phonons and disentangle their coupling with non-phononic modes and successfully calculate their density of states as g ( ω ) ∝ ω 4 . We also study their localization properties and confirm that low-frequency non-phononic modes in pinned systems are truly localized without far-field contributions. We finally discuss the excess density of states over the Debye value that results from the hybridization of phonons and non-phononic modes.},

Combining the ultrasound pitch and catch speed of sound measurements with low power harmonically oscillating pressure fields to monitor and control nucleation presents the prospect of entirely new industrially significant methods of process control in crystallization.

  abstract = {Indium nitride (InN) is an interesting material for future electronic and photonic-related applications, as it combines high electron mobility and low-energy band gap for photoabsorption or emission-driven processes. In this context, atomic layer deposition techniques have been previously employed for InN growth at low temperatures (typically &lt;350 °C), reportedly yielding crystals with high quality and purity. In general, this technique is assumed to not involve any gas phase reactions as a result from the time-resolved insertion of volatile molecular sources into the gas chamber. Nonetheless, such temperatures could still favor the precursor decomposition in the gas phase during the In half-cycle, therefore altering the molecular species that undergoes physisorption and, ultimately, driving the reaction mechanism to pursue other pathways. Thence, we herein evaluate the thermal decomposition of relevant In precursors in the gas phase, namely, trimethylindium (TMI) and tris( N , N ′-diisopropyl-2-dimethylamido-guanidinato) indium (III) (ITG), by means of thermodynamic and kinetic modeling. According to the results, at T = 593 K, TMI should exhibit partial decomposition of ∼8\% after 400 s to first generate methylindium and ethane (C 2 H 6 ), a percentage that increases to ∼34\% after 1 h of exposure inside the gas chamber. Therefore, this precursor should be present in an intact form to undergo physisorption during the In half-cycle of the deposition (&lt;10 s). On the other hand, the ITG decomposition starts already at the temperatures used in the bubbler, in which it slowly decomposes as it is evaporated during the deposition process. At T = 300 °C, the decomposition is a fast process that reaches 90\% completeness after 1 s and where equilibrium, at which almost no ITG remains, is achieved before 10 s. In this case, the decomposition pathway is likely to occur via elimination of the carbodiimide ligand. Ultimately, these results should contribute for a better understanding of the reaction mechanism involved in the InN growth from these precursors.},

  abstract = {The structures of magnesium chloride dimer-water clusters, (MgCl 2 ) 2 (H 2 O) n −/0 , were investigated with size-selected anion photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations to understand the dissolution of magnesium chloride in water. The most stable structures were confirmed by comparing vertical detachment energies (VDEs) with the experimental measurements. A dramatic drop of VDE at n = 3 has been observed in the experiment, which is in accordance with the structural change of (MgCl 2 ) 2 (H 2 O) n − . Compared to the neutral clusters, the excess electron induces two significant phenomena in (MgCl 2 ) 2 (H 2 O) n − . First, the planar D 2h geometry can be converted into a C 3 v structure at n = 0, making the Mg–Cl bonds easier to be broken by water molecules. More importantly, a negative charge-transfer-to-solvent process occurs after adding three water molecules (i.e., at n = 3), which leads to an obvious deviation in the evolution of the clusters. Such electron transfer behavior was noticed at n = 1 in monomer MgCl 2 (H 2 O) n − , indicating that the dimerization between two MgCl 2 molecules can make the cluster more capable of binding electron. In neutral (MgCl 2 ) 2 (H 2 O) n , this dimerization provides more sites for the added water molecules, which can stabilize the entire cluster and maintain its initial structure. Specifically, filling the coordination number to be 6 for Mg atoms can be seen as a link between structural preferences in the dissolution of the monomers, dimers, and extended bulk-state of MgCl 2 . This work represents an important step forward into fully understanding the solvation of MgCl 2 crystals and other multivalent salt oligomers.},

  abstract = {Despite their chemical simplicity, the spectroscopic investigation of light hydrides, such as hydrogen sulfide, is challenging due to strong hyperfine interactions and/or anomalous centrifugal-distortion effects. Several hydrides have already been detected in the interstellar medium, and the list includes H 2 S and some of its isotopologues. Astronomical observation of isotopic species and, in particular, those bearing deuterium is important to gain insights into the evolutionary stage of astronomical objects and to shed light on interstellar chemistry. These observations require a very accurate knowledge of the rotational spectrum, which is so far limited for mono-deuterated hydrogen sulfide, HDS. To fill this gap, high-level quantum-chemical calculations and sub-Doppler measurements have been combined for the investigation of the hyperfine structure of the rotational spectrum in the millimeter- and submillimeter-wave region. In addition to the determination of accurate hyperfine parameters, these new measurements together with the available literature data allowed us to extend the centrifugal analysis using a Watson-type Hamiltonian and a Hamiltonian-independent approach based on the Measured Active Ro-Vibrational Energy Levels (MARVEL) procedure. The present study thus permits to model the rotational spectrum of HDS from the microwave to far-infrared region with great accuracy, thereby accounting for the effect of the electric and magnetic interactions due to the deuterium and hydrogen nuclei.},

  abstract = {Understanding vacuum ultraviolet photodissociation dynamics of Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is of considerable importance in the study of atmospheric chemistry. Yet, photodissociation dynamics of the CS(X 1 Σ + ) + O( 3 P j=2,1,0 ) channels following excitation to the 2 1 Σ + (ν 1 ′,1,0) state has not been clearly understood so far. Here, we investigate the O( 3 P j=2,1,0 ) elimination dissociation processes in the resonance-state selective photodissociation of OCS between 147.24 and 156.48 nm by using the time-sliced velocity-mapped ion imaging technique. The total kinetic energy release spectra are found to exhibit highly structured profiles, indicative of the formation of a broad range of vibrational states of CS( 1 Σ + ). The fitted CS( 1 Σ + ) vibrational state distributions differ for the three 3 P j spin–orbit states, but a general trend of the inverted characteristics is observed. Additionally, the wavelength-dependent behaviors are also observed in the vibrational populations for CS( 1 Σ + , v ). The CS(X 1 Σ + , v = 0) has a significantly strong population at several shorter wavelengths, and the most populated CS(X 1 Σ + , v ) is gradually transferred to a higher vibrational state with the decrease in the photolysis wavelength. The measured overall β- values for the three 3 P j spin–orbit channels slightly increase and then abruptly decrease as the photolysis wavelength increases, while the vibrational dependences of β- values show an irregularly decreasing trend with increasing CS( 1 Σ + ) vibrational excitation at all studied photolysis wavelengths. The comparison of the experimental observations for this titled channel and the S( 3 P j ) channel reveals that two different intersystem crossing mechanisms may be involved in the formation of the CS(X 1 Σ + ) + O( 3 P j=2,1,0 ) photoproducts via the 2 1 Σ + state.},

  abstract = {The absorption spectra of congenetic wurtzite (WZ) and zincblende (ZB) CdS magic-sized clusters are investigated. We demonstrate that the exciton peak positions can be tuned by up to 500 meV by varying the strong coupling between X-type ligands and the semiconductor cores, while the addition of L-type ligands primarily affects cluster midgap states. When Z-type ligands are displaced by L-type ligands, red shifts in the absorption spectra are observed, despite the fact there is a small decrease in cluster size. Density functional theory calculations are used to explain these findings and they reveal the importance of Cd and S dangling bonds on the midgap states during the Z- to L-type ligand exchange process. Overall, ZB CdS clusters show higher chemical stability than WZ clusters but their optical properties exhibit greater sensitivity to the solvent. Conversely, WZ CdS clusters are not stable in a Lewis base-rich environment, resulting in various changes in their spectra. Our findings enable researchers to select capping ligands that modulate the optical properties of semiconductor clusters while maintaining precise control over their solvent interactions.},

  abstract = {The realization of single-molecule thermal conductance measurements has driven the need for theoretical tools to describe conduction processes that occur over atomistic length scales. In macroscale systems, the principle that is typically used to understand thermal conductivity is Fourier’s law. At molecular length scales, however, deviations from Fourier’s law are common in part because microscale thermal transport properties typically depend on the complex interplay between multiple heat conduction mechanisms. Here, the thermal transport properties that arise from electron transfer across a thermal gradient in a molecular conduction junction are examined theoretically. We illustrate how transport in a model junction is affected by varying the electronic structure and length of the molecular bridge in the junction as well as the strength of the coupling between the bridge and its surrounding environment. Three findings are of note: First, the transport properties can vary significantly depending on the characteristics of the molecular bridge and its environment; second, the system’s thermal conductance commonly deviates from Fourier’s law; and third, in properly engineered systems, the magnitude of electron hopping thermal conductance is similar to what has been measured in single-molecule devices.},

  abstract = {Naphthalene and azulene are isomeric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and are topical in the context of astrochemistry due to the recent discovery of substituted naphthalenes in the Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1). Here, the thermal- and photo-induced isomerization, dissociation, and radiative cooling dynamics of energized (vibrationally hot) naphthalene (Np + ) and azulene (Az + ) radical cations, occurring over the microsecond to seconds timescale, are investigated using a cryogenic electrostatic ion storage ring, affording “molecular cloud in a box” conditions. Measurement of the cooling dynamics and kinetic energy release distributions for neutrals formed through dissociation, until several seconds after hot ion formation, are consistent with the establishment of a rapid (sub-microsecond) Np + ⇌ Az + quasi-equilibrium. Consequently, dissociation by C 2 H 2 -elimination proceeds predominantly through common Az + decomposition pathways. Simulation of the isomerization, dissociation, recurrent fluorescence, and infrared cooling dynamics using a coupled master equation combined with high-level potential energy surface calculations [CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ], reproduce the trends in the measurements. The data show that radiative cooling via recurrent fluorescence, predominately through the Np + D 0 ← D 2 transition, efficiently quenches dissociation for vibrational energies up to ≈1 eV above dissociation thresholds. Our measurements support the suggestion that small cations, such as naphthalene, may be more abundant in space than previously thought. The strategy presented in this work could be extended to fingerprint the cooling dynamics of other PAH ions for which isomerization is predicted to precede dissociation.},

In the short vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) wavelength region, recent theoretical calculations have predicted many absorption band systems of C 2 , but only few of them have been verified experimentally yet. In this work, we employed a tunable VUV laser radiation source based on the two-photon resonance-enhanced four-wave mixing method and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer to investigate the absorption bands of C 2 in the VUV range of 64 000–66 000 cm −1 .

It is based on a collisional relaxation matrix constructed using the energy-corrected sudden approximation, which improves the previously proposed infinite order sudden one by taking the molecule rotation during collisions into account. The model is tested by comparisons with time-domain measurements of the pressure-induced decays of molecular-axis alignment features (revivals and echoes) for HCl and CO 2 gases, pure and diluted in He. For the Markovian systems HCl–He and CO 2 –He, the comparisons between computed and measured data demonstrate the robustness of our approach, even when the secular approximation largely breaks down. In contrast, significant differences are obtained in the cases of pure HCl and CO 2 , for which the model underestimates the decay rate of the alignment at short times. This result is attributed to the non-Markovianity of HCl–HCl and CO 2 –CO 2 interactions and the important contribution of those collisions that are ongoing at the time when the system is excited by the aligning laser pulse.},

  abstract = {Organic semiconductors (OSCs) are widely used in flexible display, renewable energy, and biosensors, owing to their unique solid-state physical and optoelectronic properties. Among the abundant crystal library of OSCs, asymmetric aryl anthracene derivatives have irreplaceable advantages due to the interplay between their distinct π-conjugated geometry and molecular stacking as well as efficient light emission and charge transport properties that can be simultaneously utilized. However, the poor crystal stacking patterns of most asymmetric molecules limit their utility as excellent OSCs. Thus, it is crucial to clarify the structural features that enable the extremely ordered stacking and favorable electronic structure of asymmetric anthracene derivatives to become high-performance OSCs. This contribution investigates the charge transport properties of a series of asymmetric aryl anthracene derivatives to reveal the modulation factors of the molecular stacking modes and to explore the structural factors, which are beneficial to charge transport. The analysis demonstrated that the vinyl-linker facilitated the injection of hole carriers, and the alkynyl-linker effectively reduces the reorganization energy. Importantly, the linear polarizability and permanent dipole moment of a single molecule play a vital regulation to molecular stacking modes and the transfer integral of the dimer. The “head-to-head stacking” motif shows a compact stacking pattern and the maximum 2D anisotropic mobility more than 10 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . These findings sharpen our understanding of the charge transport properties in asymmetric organic semiconductors and are essential for developing a diverse range of high-performance OSC materials.},

We have developed a Generative Recurrent Neural Network (GRNN) that uses supervised learning to bias the probability distributions of torsions to take advantage of experimental data types such as nuclear magnetic resonance J-couplings, nuclear Overhauser effects, and paramagnetic resonance enhancements. We show that updating the generative model parameters according to the reward feedback on the basis of the agreement between experimental data and probabilistic selection of torsions from learned distributions provides an alternative to existing approaches that simply reweight conformers of a static structural pool for disordered proteins. Instead, the biased GRNN, DynamICE, learns to physically change the conformations of the underlying pool of the disordered protein to those that better agree with experiments.},

The underestimation can be corrected using the ionization potential–electron affinity (IPEA) shift. In this study, analytic first-order derivatives of CASPT2 with the IPEA shift are developed. CASPT2-IPEA is not invariant with respect to rotations among active molecular orbitals, and two additional constraint conditions are necessary in the CASPT2 Lagrangian to formulate analytic derivatives. The method developed here is applied to methylpyrimidine derivatives and cytosine, and minimum energy structures and conical intersections are located. By comparing energies relative to the closed-shell ground state, we find that the agreement with experiments and high-level calculations is indeed improved by the inclusion of the IPEA shift. The agreement of geometrical parameters with high-level calculations may also be improved in some cases.},

Complex resonance energies are obtained from an implicit equation that is developed to compensate for the inaccuracy of the stationary phase approximation underlying the semiclassical transfer matrix applications. Although this treatment requires calculation of transfer matrices for complex energies, an initial value representation method makes it possible to extract such quantities from ordinary real-valued classical trajectories. This treatment is applied to obtain positions and widths for resonances in a model two-dimensional system, and the results are compared to those obtained from accurate quantum mechanical calculations. The semiclassical method successfully captures the irregular energy dependence of resonance widths that vary over a range of more than two orders of magnitude. An explicit semiclassical expression for the width of narrow resonances is also presented and serves as a simpler, useful approximation for many cases.},

In addition, we borrowed ideas from cluster predictions to spread structures better between different compositions, considering that surface models of different atom numbers usually have some building blocks in common.

  abstract = {One of the manifestations of chirality-induced spin selectivity is the appearance of a magnetocurrent. Magnetocurrent is defined as the difference between the charge currents at finite bias in a two terminal device for opposite magnetizations of one of the leads. In experiments on chiral molecules assembled in monolayers the magnetocurrent is dominantly odd in bias voltage, while theory often yields an even one. From theory it is known that the spin–orbit coupling and chirality of the molecule can only generate a finite magnetocurrent in the presence of interactions, either of the electrons with vibrational modes or among themselves, through the Coulomb interaction. Here we analytically show that the magnetocurrent in bipartite-chiral structures mediated through Coulomb interactions is exactly even in the wide band limit and exactly odd for semi-infinite leads due to the bipartite lattice symmetry of the Green’s function. Our numerical results confirm these analytical findings.},

The modified form of the Bigeleisen–Mayer equation consists of a ratio of imaginary mode vibrational frequencies and a contribution arising from the isotopic substitution’s effect on the activation free energy, which can be computed from path integral simulation. In the present study, we describe a practical method for estimating the frequency ratio correction directly from umbrella sampling in a manner that does not require normal mode analysis of many geometry optimized structures. Instead, the method relates the frequency ratio to the change in the mass weighted coordinate representation of the minimum free energy path at the transition state induced by isotopic substitution. The method is applied to the calculation of 16/18 O and 32/34 S primary kinetic isotope effect values for six non-enzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions. We demonstrate that the results are consistent with the analysis of geometry optimized transition state ensembles using the traditional Bigeleisen–Mayer equation. The method thus presents a new practical tool to enable facile calculation of kinetic isotope effect values for complex chemical reactions in the condensed phase.},

The modified response function is further used to evaluate the induced charge density and the electrostatic potential near an electrode. The Gaussian field theory, combined with a two-Yukawa response function, can reproduce the oscillatory decay behavior of the electric potentials in concentrated electrolyte solutions. When the exact sum rules for the bulk electrolyte solutions and the electric double layers are used as constraints to determine the parameters of the response function, the Gaussian field theory could at least partly capture the nonlinear response effect of the surface charge density.

This method combines the adaptive HOPS (adHOPS) framework, which uses locality to improve computational scaling, with the dyadic HOPS method previously developed to calculate linear and nonlinear spectroscopic signals. To construct a local representation of dyadic HOPS, we introduce an initial state decomposition that reconstructs the linear absorption spectra from a sum over locally excited initial conditions. We demonstrate the sum over initial conditions can be efficiently Monte Carlo sampled and that the corresponding calculations achieve size-invariant [i.e., O ( 1 ) ] scaling for sufficiently large aggregates while trivially incorporating static disorder in the Hamiltonian. We present calculations on the photosystem I core complex to explore the behavior of the initial state decomposition in complex molecular aggregates as well as proof-of-concept DadHOPS calculations on an artificial molecular aggregate inspired by perylene bis-imide to demonstrate the size-invariance of the method.},

  abstract = {Real-time (RT) electron density propagation with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) or Hartree–Fock (TDHF) is one of the most popular methods to model the charge transfer in molecules and materials. However, both RT-TDHF and RT-TDDFT within the adiabatic approximation are known to produce inaccurate evolution of the electron density away from the ground state in model systems, leading to large errors in charge transfer and erroneous shifting of peaks in absorption spectra. Given the poor performance of these methods with small model systems and the widespread use of the methods with larger molecular and material systems, here we bridge the gap in our understanding of these methods and examine the size-dependence of errors in RT density propagation. We analyze the performance of RT density propagation for systems of increasing size during the application of a continuous resonant field to induce Rabi-like oscillations, during charge-transfer dynamics, and for peak shifting in simulated absorption spectra. We find that the errors in the electron dynamics are indeed size dependent for these phenomena, with the largest system producing the results most aligned with those expected from linear response theory. The results suggest that although the RT-TDHF and RT-TDDFT methods may produce severe errors for model systems, the errors in charge transfer and resonantly driven electron dynamics may be much less significant for more realistic, large-scale molecules and materials.},

  abstract = {Since its first definition, back in 1990, the electron localization function (ELF) has settled as one of the most commonly employed techniques to characterize the nature of the chemical bond in real space. Although most of the work using the ELF has focused on the study of ground-state chemical reactivity, a growing interest has blossomed to apply these techniques to the nearly unexplored realm of excited states and photochemistry. Since accurate excited electronic states usually require to account appropriately for electron correlation, the standard single-determinant ELF formulation cannot be blindly applied to them, and it is necessary to turn to correlated ELF descriptions based on the two-particle density matrix (2-PDM). The latter requires costly wavefunction approaches, unaffordable for most of the systems of current photochemical interest. Here, we compare the exact, 2-PDM-based ELF results with those of approximate 2-PDM reconstructions taken from reduced density matrix functional theory. Our approach is put to the test in a wide variety of representative scenarios, such as those provided by the lowest-lying excited electronic states of simple diatomic and polyatomic molecules. Altogether, our results suggest that even approximate 2-PDMs are able to accurately reproduce, on a general basis, the topological and statistical features of the ELF scalar field, paving the way toward the application of cost-effective methodologies, such as time-dependent-Hartree–Fock or time-dependent density functional theory, in the accurate description of the chemical bonding in excited states of photochemical relevance.},

The spin separation of the gauge operator gives rise to an additional scalar orbit-orbit interaction in the scalar Breit Hamiltonian. Benchmark calculations of Au n ( n = 2–8) show that the scalar Dirac–Coulomb–Breit Hamiltonian can capture 99.99\% of the total energy with only 10\% of the computational cost when real-valued arithmetic is used, compared to the full Dirac–Coulomb–Breit Hamiltonian.

The conformation of DNA, jammed inside the capsid due to high internal pressure, influences the ejection kinetics of the DNA from the capsid. Therefore, one would expect that the DNA ejection kinetics would be subject to the shape of the viral capsid. The effects of the capsid shape on the ejection, however, remain elusive partly due to a plethora of viral capsid shapes. In this work, we perform Langevin dynamics simulations for the ejection of a polymer chain from three different types of viral capsids: (1) spherical, (2) cubic, and (3) cuboid capsids. We find that the ejection rate of the polymer chain from the spherical capsid is much faster than that from either cubic or cuboid capsids. The polymer chain in the spherical capsid may undergo collective rotational relaxation more readily such that the polymer chain becomes more mobile inside the spherical capsid, which enhances the ejection kinetics. On the other hand, a threading motion is dominant inside cubic and cuboid capsids. We also find that the effects of the collective rotational motion become more significant for a more rigid chain inside a capsid.},

  abstract = {Newton’s third law, action = reaction, is a foundational statement of classical mechanics. However, in natural and living systems, this law appears to be routinely violated for constituents interacting in a nonequilibrium environment. Here, we use computer simulations to explore the macroscopic phase behavior implications of breaking microscopic interaction reciprocity for a simple model system. We consider a binary mixture of attractive particles and introduce a parameter that is a continuous measure of the degree to which interaction reciprocity is broken. In the reciprocal limit, the species are indistinguishable, and the system phase separates into domains with distinct densities and identical compositions. Increasing nonreciprocity is found to drive the system to explore a rich assortment of phases, including phases with strong composition asymmetries and three-phase coexistence. Many of the states induced by these forces, including traveling crystals and liquids, have no equilibrium analogs. By mapping the complete phase diagram for this model system and characterizing these unique phases, our findings offer a concrete path forward toward understanding how nonreciprocity shapes the structures found in living systems and how this might be leveraged in the design of synthetic materials.},

  abstract = {The osmotic second virial coefficient B2 is an important parameter to describe the interactions and phase behavior of protein solutions, including colloidal systems and macromolecular solutions. Another key parameter to describe the driving force of the nucleation of a new phase is the supersaturation, which is used in the classical nucleation theory framework and is connected with the favorable contribution in the Gibbs free energy in the bulk solution. In this article, we establish a connection between B2 calculated from small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) data and the values of B2 obtained from supersaturation measurements using thermodynamics considerations. The values of the second virial coefficient calculated employing this method agree with those determined via SAXS in the region near the liquid–liquid phase separation border for human serum albumin and bovine serum albumin. The general relations adopted are shown to be useful for the estimation of the second virial coefficient B2 for globular proteins, in the proximity of the binodal biphasic coexistent region.},

  abstract = {Desorption of a self-propelling filament from an attractive surface is studied by computer simulations and the influence of activity, chain length, and chain rigidity is explored. For the flexible filament, we find three scaling regimes of desorption time vs activity with various scaling exponents. At low activity, the scaling law results from the spiral-like detachment kinetics. And at high activity, by theoretical analysis, the desorption is reminiscent of the escaping mechanism of a super-diffusive blob from a potential well at a short time scale. Additionally, the desorption time decreases first and then increases with chain length at low activity, since it is hard to form a spiral for short filaments due to the limited volume repulsion. For high activities, the desorption time approximately scales with chain length, with a scaling exponent ∼ 0.5 ⁠ , which can be explained by the theory and numerically fitting scaling law between the end-to-end distance of the “globule-like” filament and chain length. Furthermore, a non-monotonic behavior is observed between the desorption time and the chain stiffness. Desorption time slightly decreases first and then rapidly increases with stiffness due to the opposed effects of increasing rigidity on headiing-up time and leaving-away time. In contrast to traditional polymers, the scaling behavior suggests unique desorption characteristics of active polymers.},

  abstract = {WaveTrain is an open-source software for numerical simulations of chain-like quantum systems with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions only. The Python package is centered around tensor train (TT, or matrix product) format representations of Hamiltonian operators and (stationary or time-evolving) state vectors. It builds on the Python tensor train toolbox Scikit_tt, which provides efficient construction methods and storage schemes for the TT format. Its solvers for eigenvalue problems and linear differential equations are used in WaveTrain for the time-independent and time-dependent Schrödinger equations, respectively. Employing efficient decompositions to construct low-rank representations, the tensor-train ranks of state vectors are often found to depend only marginally on the chain length N. This results in the computational effort growing only slightly more than linearly with N, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. As a complement to the classes for full quantum mechanics, WaveTrain also contains classes for fully classical and mixed quantum–classical (Ehrenfest or mean field) dynamics of bipartite systems. The graphical capabilities allow visualization of quantum dynamics “on the fly,” with a choice of several different representations based on reduced density matrices. Even though developed for treating quasi-one-dimensional excitonic energy transport in molecular solids or conjugated organic polymers, including coupling to phonons, WaveTrain can be used for any kind of chain-like quantum systems, with or without periodic boundary conditions and with NN interactions only. The present work describes version 1.0 of our WaveTrain software, based on version 1.2 of scikit_tt, both of which are freely available from the GitHub platform where they will also be further developed. Moreover, WaveTrain is mirrored at SourceForge, within the framework of the WavePacket project for numerical quantum dynamics. Worked-out demonstration examples with complete input and output, including animated graphics, are available.},

This feature is of interest not only for batteries or storage applications but also for tuning the properties of the silicon clathrate films. The thermal decomposition process can be tuned to obtain Na8Si46 and Na2&lt;x&lt;10Si136 silicon clathrate films on intrinsic and p-type c-Si (001) wafer. Here, from a unique synthesized NaxSi136 film, a range of resistivity of minimum four order of magnitude is possible by using post-synthesis treatments, switching from metallic to semiconductor behavior as the Na content is lowered. Extended exposition to sodium vapor allows us to obtain fully occupied Na24Si136 metallic films, and annealing under iodine vapor is a way to reach the guest-free Si136, a semiconducting metastable form of silicon with a 1.9 eV direct bandgap. Electrical measurements and resistance vs temperature measurements of the silicon clathrate films further discriminate the behavior of the various materials as the Na concentration is changing, additionally shouldered by density functional theory calculations for various guest occupations, further motivating the urge of an innovative pathway toward true guest-free type I and type II silicon clathrates.},

In this study, we developed multinary Cu–In–Ga–S (CIGS) QDs showing a narrow photoluminescence (PL) peak by controlling the Cu fraction, i.e., Cu/(In+Ga), and the ratio of In to Ga composing the QDs. The energy gap of CIGS QDs was enlarged from 1.74 to 2.77 eV with a decrease in the In/(In+Ga) ratio from 1.0 to 0. The PL intensity was remarkably dependent on the Cu fraction, and the PL peak width was dependent on the In/(In+Ga) ratio. The sharpest PL peak at 668 nm with a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 0.23 eV was obtained for CIGS QDs prepared with ratios of Cu/(In+Ga) = 0.3 and In/(In+Ga) = 0.7, being much narrower than those previously reported with CIGS QDs, fwhm of &gt;0.4 eV. The PL quantum yield of CIGS QDs, 8.3\%, was increased to 27\% and 46\% without a PL peak broadening by surface coating with GaSx and Ga–Zn–S shells, respectively. Considering a large Stokes shift of &gt;0.5 eV and the predominant PL decay component of ∼200–400 ns, the narrow PL peak was assignable to the emission from intragap states. QD-LEDs fabricated with CIGS QDs surface-coated with GaSx shells showed a red color with a narrow emission peak at 688 nm with a fwhm of 0.24 eV.},

  abstract = {Organic-cation engineering has recently proven effective in flexibly regulating two-dimensional hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (2D HOIPs) to achieve a diversity of newly emerging applications. There have been many mechanistic studies based on the structural tunability of organic cations; nevertheless, those with an emphasis on the effect solely caused by the organic cations remain lacking. To this end, here we deliberately design a set of 2D HOIPs in which the inorganic layers are kept nearly intact upon cation modification, i.e., the precursor phenethylammonium lead iodide and its four derivatives with the phenyl group’s para-position H being replaced by CH3, F, Cl, and Br. By means of femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy and temperature-dependent/time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we interrogate the subtle impact of cation modification on phonon dynamics, coherent phonon modes, phonon-dressed exciton dynamics, and excitonic emissions. A concerted trend for phonon lifetimes and exciton relaxation lifetimes regulated by cation modification is revealed, evidencing the existence of strong exciton–phonon coupling in this 2D HOIP system. The observed mass effect can be ascribed to the change in moment of inertia of organic cations. In addition, we observe an interesting interplay of exciton kinetics pertinent to population transfers between two emissive states, likely linked to the subtle variation in crystal symmetry induced by cation modification. The mechanistic insights gained from this work would be of value for the 2D HOIPs-based applications.},

Cadmium selenide (CdSe) NPLs are of particular fundamental interest since their thicknesses can be controlled with atomic precision using well-established solution-phase synthetic techniques. Additionally, their large surface area makes them especially susceptible to changes in the identity of the capping ligands and, therefore, good model systems for understanding surface chemistry. In the current work, we explore the role of these ligands in altering the lattice parameters and optical properties of CdSe NPLs. We build on prior research that has employed varying binding groups, including thiols, phosphonic acids, and halides, to demonstrate ligand-dependent optical bandgap changes and concomitant lattice distortions as determined by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD). Our work investigates the correlations between ligand-induced optical and structural changes with a series of ligands that maintain a consistent carboxylic acid binding group, thus allowing us to probe secondary ligand effects. We perform ligand exchanges on oleic acid-capped CdSe NPLs with benzoic acids, cinnamic acids, and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. In all cases, the optical bandgap decreases upon ligand exchange, and a correlated expansion in the thickness of the NPLs is observed via PXRD. We also observe that the benzoic acids produce larger optical and structural distortions than the cinnamic acids. We show that the optical and structural correlation is nearly quantitatively described by quantum confinement effects, with the thicker quantum wells exhibiting smaller energy gaps.},

The phase transition and shape evolution of amorphous germanium (Ge) and Ag@Ge core–shell nanoparticles with average diameters of 10 and 12 nm, respectively, were investigated by high-energy electron beam irradiation and in situ heating within a transmission electron microscope. The transition of a single Ge amorphous nanoparticle to the crystalline diamond cubic structure at the atomic scale was clearly demonstrated. Depending on the heating temperature, a hollow Ge structure can be maintained or transformed into a solid Ge nanocrystal through a diffusive process during the amorphous to crystalline phase transition. Selected area diffraction patterns were obtained to confirm the crystallization process. In addition, the thermal stability of Ag@Ge core–shell nanoparticles with an average core of 7.4 and a 2.1 nm Ge shell was studied by applying the same beam conditions and temperatures. The results show that at a moderate temperature (e.g., 385 °C), the amorphous Ge shell can completely crystallize while maintaining the well-defined core–shell structure, while at a high temperature (e.g., 545 °C), the high thermal energy enables a freely diffusive process of both Ag and Ge atoms on the carbon support film and leads to transformation into a phase segregated Ag–Ge Janus nanoparticle with a clear interface between the Ag and Ge domains. This study provides a protocol as well as insight into the thermal stability and strain relief mechanism of complex nanostructures at the single nanoparticle level with atomic resolution.},

The experimental study has been performed under near ambient conditions, where the presence of water vapor is unavoidable, resulting in a water film on the sample and, thereby, allowing us to mimic the solution–water interface. Both experiment and theory conclude that 2-propanol adsorbs molecularly. The lack of dissociation is attributed to the adsorption geometry of 2-propanol in which the O–H bond does not point toward the surface. Furthermore, the copresent water not only competitively adsorbs on the surface but also inhibits 2-propanol deprotonation. The calculations reveal that the presence of water deactivates the lattice oxygen, thereby reducing the surface activity. This finding sheds light on the multifaceted role of water at the interface for the electrochemical oxidation of 2-propanol in aqueous solution as recently reported [Falk et al. , ChemCatChem 13 , 2942–2951 (2021)]. At higher temperatures, 2-propanol remains molecularly adsorbed on Co 3 O 4 (001) until it desorbs with increasing surface temperature.},

Our approach employs the modified PB equation, which accounts for the finite size of ions and the dependency of the electrolyte’s relative permittivity on the local electric field. In view of the absence of reservoirs, the modified PB equation becomes subject to global algebraic constraints, without prior knowledge of a bulk electrolyte concentration. Equilibrium ion distributions and differential capacitance curves are investigated as functions of electrolyte properties and the surface charge density modulation. This modulation leads to asymmetric differential capacitance curves that can be tuned. More generally, our approach provides a transparent numerical framework for accurately simulating confined nanofluidic systems with new physical properties that may be exploited in novel iontronic circuit elements.},

  abstract = {When heated rapidly, glasses often devitrify heterogeneously, i.e., by a softening front that originates at the surface of an amorphous film. Yet the fundamentals of this devitrification regime are not completely understood; depending on experimental conditions, the reported front propagation distances differ by an order of magnitude. Using a high-resolution fast scanning calorimetry technique, we have investigated the softening of glassy methylbenzene films with thicknesses between 30 and 1400 nm. We confirm first that, in all films, the devitrification process begins with the formation of a softening front that propagates through the films over distances of ∼50 nm and that the front propagation kinetics at this stage follow an Arrhenius law. However, we also show that, in films with thicknesses above 165 nm, the front propagation does not terminate with the onset of bulk softening. Specifically, increasing the films’ thicknesses above 165 nm yields sharp, clearly discernible endotherms that precede the bulk softening endotherms and that are consistent with a two-fold increase in the enthalpic barrier to front propagation at a well-defined critical temperature. We term this phenomenon “Arrhenius discontinuity” and use reaction rate and continuum front dynamics theories to explain its origins and the physical nature of the resulting distinct heterogeneous devitrification processes. Finally, we discuss the findings in the context of recent theoretical, computational, and experimental studies of heterogeneous devitrification by other research groups.},

  abstract = {We develop a physically based equation of state that describes Mie ν-6 fluids with an accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art empirical models. The equation of state is developed within the framework of the uv-theory [T. van Westen and J. Gross, J. Chem. Phys. 155, 244501 (2021)], which is modified by incorporating the third virial coefficient B3 in the low-density description of the model. The new model interpolates between a first-order Weeks–Chandler–Andersen (WCA) perturbation theory at high densities and a modified first-order WCA theory that recovers the virial expansion up to B3 at low densities. A new algebraic equation for the third virial coefficient of Mie ν-6 fluids is developed—other inputs are taken from previous work. Predicted thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria are compared to a comprehensive database of molecular simulation results from the literature, including Mie fluids of repulsive exponents 9 ≤ ν ≤ 48. The new equation of state is applicable to states with densities up to ρ*(T*)⪅1.1+0.12T* and temperatures T* &gt; 0.3. For the Lennard-Jones fluid (ν = 12), the performance of the model is comparable to that of the best empirical equations of state available. As compared to empirical models, the physical basis of the new model provides several advantages, however: (1) the new model is applicable to Mie fluids of repulsive exponents 9 ≤ ν ≤ 48 instead of only ν = 12, (2) the model leads to a better description of the meta-stable and unstable region (which is important for describing interfacial properties by classical density functional theory), and (3) being a first-order perturbation theory, the new model (potentially) allows an easier and more rigorous extension to non-spherical (chain) fluids and mixtures.},

For sufficiently high packing densities in confinement, a carpet-like texture emerges due to the interlocking of L-shaped particles, resembling a distorted smectic liquid crystalline layer pattern. From the positions of either of the two axes of the particles, two different types of layers can be extracted, which form distinct but complementary entangled networks. These coarse-grained network structures are then analyzed from a topological point of view. We propose a global charge conservation law by using an analogy to uniaxial smectics and show that the individual network topology can be steered by both confinement and particle geometry. Our topological analysis provides a general classification framework for applications to other intertwined dual networks.},

Here, we study an alternative zero-parameter prediction based on the isomorph theory, the input of which are properties at a single reference state point on the melting line. The two central assumptions made are that the harmonic-repulsive potential approximates the WCA potential and that pair collisions are uncorrelated. The new approach gives excellent predictions at high temperatures, while the hard-sphere-theory based predictions are better at lower temperatures. Supplementing the WCA investigation, the face-centered-crystal to fluid coexistence line is determined for a system of harmonic-repulsive particles and compared to the zero-parameter theories. The results indicate that the excellent isomorph-theory predictions for the WCA potential at higher temperatures may be partly due to a cancellation of errors between the two above-mentioned assumptions.},

Whether distinct mechanisms govern mobility in the Arrhenian and super-cooled regions, and whether the mobility in these regions can be unified remain open questions. Here, molecular dynamics simulations were used to search for a structural property with a temperature dependence related by a simple functional form to the temperature dependent translational diffusion coefficient, Dtrans. The logarithm of Dtrans was found to be a two-parameter function of F2, where F2 is the mean squared-force per molecule. The relationship is demonstrated for all systems investigated: a three-bead model of ortho-terphenyl, an 80:20 binary mixture of Lennard-Jones spheres, and a system of Lennard-Jones dumbbells. For each system, the relationship holds for the entire range of temperatures under both constant pressure and constant density conditions. The same F2-based expression describes the translational diffusion coefficient in the Arrhenian, crossover, and super-Arrhenian regions.},

We demonstrate that fully flexible chains of hard spheres can be packed as efficiently as monomeric analogs, within a statistical tolerance of less than 1\%. The resulting ordered polymer morphology corresponds to an almost perfect hexagonal triangular (TRI) crystal of the p6m wallpaper group, whose sites are occupied by the chain monomers.

  abstract = {Clathrate hydrates are crystalline inclusion compounds wherein a water framework encages small guest atoms/molecules within its cavities. Among the others, methane clathrates are the largest fossil fuel resource still available. They can also be used to safely transport gases and can also form spontaneously under suitable conditions plugging pipelines. Understanding the crystallization mechanism is very important, and given the impossibility of experimentally identifying the atomistic path, simulations played an important role in this field. Given the large computational cost of these simulations, in addition to all-atom force fields, scientists considered coarse-grained water models. Here, we have investigated the effect of coarse-graining, as implemented in the water model mW, on the crystallization characteristics of methane clathrate in comparison with the all-atom TIP4P force field. Our analyses revealed that although the characteristics directly depending on the energetics of the water models are well reproduced, dynamical properties are off by the orders of magnitude. Being crystallization a non-equilibrium process, the altered kinetics of the process results in different characteristics of crystalline nuclei. Both TIP4P and mW water models produce methane clathrate nuclei with some amount of the less stable (in the given thermodynamic conditions) structure II phase and an excess of pentagonal dodecahedral cages over the tetrakaidecahedral ones regarding the ideal ratio in structure I. However, the dependence of this excess on the methane concentration in solution is higher with the former water model, whereas with the latter, the methane concentration in solution dependence is reduced and within the statistical error.},

Despite this molecule being relatively small, the long-lived molecular anions TCNE− are formed not only at thermal electron energy via a vibrational Feshbach resonance mechanism but also via shape resonances with the occupation of the π4* and π5* molecular orbitals by an incident electron. Dissociative decays of TCNE− are mostly observed at incident electron energy above the π7* temporary anion state predicted to lie at 1.69 eV by means of B3LYP/6-31G(d) calculations combined with the empirical scaling procedure. Electron attachment to the π6* orbital (predicted at 0.85 eV) leads to the generation of long-lived TCNE− species, which can decay via two competing processes: extra electron detachment, which appears in hundreds of microseconds, or elimination of two cyano groups to form the [TCNE − 2(CN)]− negative fragment on a tens of microsecond timescale. The latter is accompanied by the generation of a highly toxic cyanogen molecule as a neutral counterpart. Since the electron transfer to the acceptor molecule TCNE plays a key role in the formation of single-molecule magnets, the present data are of importance to understand the long-term behavior and likely harmful effects produced by cyanide-based prospective materials.},

  abstract = {Systems with weakly bound extra electrons impose great challenges to semilocal density functional approximations (DFAs), which suffer from self-interaction errors. Small ammonia clusters are one such example of weakly bound anions where the extra electron is weakly bound. We applied two self-interaction correction (SIC) schemes, viz., the well-known Perdew–Zunger and the recently developed locally scaled SIC (LSIC) with the local spin density approximation (LSDA), Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and the SCAN meta-GGA functionals to calculate the vertical detachment energies (VDEs) of small ammonia cluster anions (NH3)n−. Our results show that the LSIC significantly reduces the errors in calculations of VDE with LSDA and PBE-GGA functionals leading to better agreement with the reference values calculated with coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)]. Accurate prediction of VDE as an absolute of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is challenging for DFAs. Our results show that VDEs estimated from the negative of HOMO eigenvalues with the LSIC-LSDA and Perdew–Zunger SIC-PBE are within 11 meV of the reference CCSD(T) results. The LSIC method performs consistently well for the VDE estimates, from both the total energy differences and the absolute HOMO eigenvalues.},

For this purpose, we have computed the first 4D potential energy surface (PES) of the C2H−–H2 complex using an explicitly correlated coupled-cluster approach. The PES is characterized by a single deep minimum with a well-depth of 924.96 cm−1.

Compounds 1 – 3 have been investigated experimentally before, but 4 is a theoretical proposal whose photophysical features match those extrapolated from 1 to 3 . They exhibit absorption in the range of 700–970 nm for their Q bands and 500–645 nm for their Soret bands. The rise of thiophene rings placed in front of the DTT unit in the expanded porphyrin ring causes a bathochromic shift of the longest absorption wavelength, leading to near-infrared absorptions, which represent 49\% of the solar energy. All the systems show a thermodynamically favorable process for the electron injection from the dye to TiO 2 and adsorption on a finite TiO 2 model. The electron regeneration of the dye is only thermodynamically feasible for the smallest expanded porphyrins 1 and 2 when I − /I 3 − electrolyte is used. The charge transport study shows that for voltages lower than 0.4 V, junctions featuring pentaphyrin 1 and octaphyrin 4 are more conductive than those containing hexaphyrin 2 or heptaphyrin 3 . The results showed that the four fused core-modified expanded porphyrins investigated are potential dyes for applications in dye-sensitized solar cells, mainly pentaphyrin 1 and hexaphyrin 2 . Moreover, increasing the number of thiophene rings in the macrocycle proved fruitful in favoring absorption in the near-infrared region, which is highly desired for dye-sensitized solar cells.},

The product total kinetic energy releases, angular distributions, and the product state branching ratios were derived from the experimental images. Notably, it is found that the anisotropic parameters change systematically with the photolysis wavelength. The anisotropic parameters and the product state branching ratios are significantly sensitive to the J quantum number of the O (3PJ) products.

The handicap is the large number of coupled quantum states that is needed to describe the system. Progress in quantum chemistry provides the necessary background to the energetics and the coupling. Progress in quantum dynamics takes this as input for the propagation in time. Right now, it seems that we have come of age with potential detailed applications. We here report a demonstration to a coupled electron-nuclear quantum dynamics through a maze of 47 electronic states and with attention to the order in perturbation theory that is indicated using propensity rules for couplings. Close agreement with experimental results for the VUV photodissociation of 14N2 and its isotopomer 14N15N is achieved. We pay special attention to the coupling between two dissociative continua and an optically accessible bound domain. The computations reproduce and interpret the non-monotonic branching between the two exit channels producing N(2D) and N(2P) atoms as a function of excitation energy and its variation with the mass.},

  abstract = {A three-level model of symmetry-breaking charge transfer (SBCT) in excited octupolar molecules is developed. The model describes the joint dynamics of the solvent and the dye in the excited state. For this, a distribution function in the space of two reaction coordinates is introduced. An evolution equation of this function is derived. A strict definition of the reaction coordinates is given, and its dynamic characteristics are determined. The free energy surface in the space of these coordinates is calculated. To quantify the symmetry-breaking degree, a two-dimensional dissymmetry vector is introduced. The model predicts the absence of SBCT in apolar solvents and an abrupt increase in its degree to half the maximum value in weakly polar solvents. The dye dipole moment is revealed to be directed along a molecular arm independently of the direction and the strength of the electric field of the solvent created by its orientational polarization. The conditions for the occurrence and nature of this effect are discussed. The effect of the degeneracy of excited states, which is inherent in octupolar dyes in the excited state, on SBCT is revealed. Degeneracy of energy levels is shown to lead to a significant increase in the symmetry-breaking degree. The effect of SBCT on the dependence of the Stokes on the solvent polarity is calculated and compared with the available experimental data.},

  abstract = {In situ linear optical diffraction is a new method for studies of surface mass transport in electrochemical environments that is based on the equilibration of coverage gratings in an adlayer on the electrode surface. We, here, discuss the temporal evolution of the diffraction intensity on the basis of experimental data for sulfur adsorbates on Pt(111) electrodes in 0.1M H2SO4 and simulations of the time-dependent diffusion profiles. At low and medium sulfur coverage, the decay of the signal exhibits two time scales, which can be explained by the influence of coverage-dependent diffusion rates on the evolution of gratings with large coverage modulation. At high coverage, a further ultra-slow decay process or even a complete termination of the decay is observed, which we attribute to the presence of high-density, ordered, adlayer phases with low sulfur mobility. These results provide insight into the approaches required for extracting quantitative surface transport rates from linear optical diffraction measurements.},

  abstract = {We developed and implemented a method-independent, fully numerical, finite difference approach to calculating nuclear magnetic resonance shieldings, using gauge-including atomic orbitals. The resulting capability can be used to explore non-standard methods, given only the energy as a function of finite-applied magnetic fields and nuclear spins. For example, standard second-order Møller-Plesset theory (MP2) has well-known efficacy for 1H and 13C shieldings and known limitations for other nuclei such as 15N and 17O. It is, therefore, interesting to seek methods that offer good accuracy for 15N and 17O shieldings without greatly increased compute costs, as well as exploring whether such methods can further improve 1H and 13C shieldings. Using a small molecule test set of 28 species, we assessed two alternatives: κ regularized MP2 (κ-MP2), which provides energy-dependent damping of large amplitudes, and MP2.X, which includes a variable fraction, X, of third-order correlation (MP3). The aug-cc-pVTZ basis was used, and coupled cluster with singles and doubles and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] results were taken as reference values. Our κ-MP2 results reveal significant improvements over MP2 for 13C and 15N, with the optimal κ value being element-specific. κ-MP2 with κ = 2 offers a 30\% rms error reduction over MP2. For 15N, κ-MP2 with κ = 1.1 provides a 90\% error reduction vs MP2 and a 60\% error reduction vs CCSD. On the other hand, MP2.X with a scaling factor of 0.6 outperformed CCSD for all heavy nuclei. These results can be understood as providing renormalization of doubles amplitudes to partially account for neglected triple and higher substitutions and offer promising opportunities for future applications.},

First, a new scheme has been proposed to maximize data digestion on GPUs that subsequently linearizes data transfer from central processing units (CPUs) to GPUs. Second, the GAMESS Fortran code has been interfaced with GPU numerical libraries (e.g., NVIDIA cuBLAS and cuSOLVER) for efficient matrix operations (e.g., matrix multiplication, matrix decomposition, and matrix inversion). The standalone GPU RI-MP2 code shows an increasing speedup of up to 7.5× using one NVIDIA V100 GPU with one IBM 42-core P9 CPU for calculations on fullerenes of increasing size from 40 to 260 carbon atoms using the 6-31G(d)/cc-pVDZ-RI basis sets. A single Summit node with six V100s can compute the RI-MP2 correlation energy of a cluster of 175 water molecules using the correlation consistent basis sets cc-pVDZ/cc-pVDZ-RI containing 4375 atomic orbitals and 14 700 auxiliary basis functions in ∼0.85 h. In the EFMO framework, the GPU RI-MP2 component shows near linear scaling for a large number of V100s when computing the energy of an 1800-atom mesoporous silica nanoparticle in a bath of 4000 water molecules.

  abstract = {The rigorous quantum mechanical description of the collective interaction of many molecules with the radiation field is usually considered numerically intractable, and approximation schemes must be employed. Standard spectroscopy usually contains some levels of perturbation theory, but under strong coupling conditions, other approximations are used. A common approximation is the 1-exciton model in which processes involving weak excitations are described using a basis comprising the ground state and singly excited states of the molecule cavity-mode system. In another frequently used approximation in numerical investigations, the electromagnetic field is described classically, and the quantum molecular subsystem is treated in the mean-field Hartree approximation with its wavefunction assumed to be a product of single molecules’ wavefunctions. The former disregards states that take long time to populate and is, therefore, essentially a short time approximation. The latter is not limited in this way, but by its nature, disregards some intermolecular and molecule-field correlations. In this work, we directly compare results obtained from these approximations when applied to several prototype problems involving the optical response of molecules-in-optical cavities systems. In particular, we show that our recent model investigation [J. Chem. Phys. 157, 114108 (2022)] of the interplay between the electronic strong coupling and molecular nuclear dynamics using the truncated 1-exciton approximation agrees very well with the semiclassical mean-field calculation.},

We consider site disorder with nearest-neighbor hopping on one- and two-dimensional systems and show via numerical simulations supported by the analytical study that the short time growth of the particle distribution is faster on the disordered lattice than on the ordered one.

  abstract = {Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm to give access to highly accurate predictions of molecular and material properties. A common short-coming shared by current approaches, however, is that neural networks only give point estimates of their predictions and do not come with predictive uncertainties associated with these estimates. Existing uncertainty quantification efforts have primarily leveraged the standard deviation of predictions across an ensemble of independently trained neural networks. This incurs a large computational overhead in both training and prediction, resulting in order-of-magnitude more expensive predictions. Here, we propose a method to estimate the predictive uncertainty based on a single neural network without the need for an ensemble. This allows us to obtain uncertainty estimates with virtually no additional computational overhead over standard training and inference. We demonstrate that the quality of the uncertainty estimates matches those obtained from deep ensembles. We further examine the uncertainty estimates of our methods and deep ensembles across the configuration space of our test system and compare the uncertainties to the potential energy surface. Finally, we study the efficacy of the method in an active learning setting and find the results to match an ensemble-based strategy at order-of-magnitude reduced computational cost.},

The heteroscedastic GPR models that we introduce automatically weight provided information by its estimated uncertainty, allowing for the incorporation of highly uncertain, high-order derivative information. By the linearity of the derivative operator, GPR models naturally handle derivative information and, with appropriate likelihood models that incorporate heterogeneous uncertainties, are able to identify estimates of functions for which the provided observations and derivatives are inconsistent due to the sampling bias that is common in molecular simulations. Since we utilize kernels that form complete bases on the function space to be learned, the estimated uncertainty in the model takes into account that of the functional form itself, in contrast to polynomial interpolation, which explicitly assumes the functional form to be fixed. We apply GPR models to a variety of data sources and assess various active learning strategies, identifying when specific options will be most useful. Our active-learning data collection based on GPR models incorporating derivative information is finally applied to tracing vapor–liquid equilibrium for a single-component Lennard-Jones fluid, which we show represents a powerful generalization to previous extrapolation strategies and Gibbs–Duhem integration.

  abstract = {The development of novel double-hybrid density functionals offers new levels of accuracy and is leading to fresh insights into the fundamental properties of matter. Hartree–Fock exact exchange and correlated wave function methods, such as second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2) and direct random phase approximation (dRPA), are usually required to build such functionals. Their high computational cost is a concern, and their application to large and periodic systems is, therefore, limited. In this work, low-scaling methods for Hartree–Fock exchange (HFX), SOS-MP2, and direct RPA energy gradients are developed and implemented in the CP2K software package. The use of the resolution-of-the-identity approximation with a short range metric and atom-centered basis functions leads to sparsity, allowing for sparse tensor contractions to take place. These operations are efficiently performed with the newly developed Distributed Block-sparse Tensors (DBT) and Distributed Block-sparse Matrices (DBM) libraries, which scale to hundreds of graphics processing unit (GPU) nodes. The resulting methods, resolution-of-the-identity (RI)-HFX, SOS-MP2, and dRPA, were benchmarked on large supercomputers. They exhibit favorable sub-cubic scaling with system size, good strong scaling performance, and GPU acceleration up to a factor of 3. These developments will allow for double-hybrid level calculations of large and periodic condensed phase systems to take place on a more regular basis.},

A particularly interesting finding is obtained from the observed non-monotonic behavior of the induced change in the interaction energy, which becomes negative for intermediate wave numbers. This effect is strongly dependent on the coupling strength and constitutes further direct evidence for the spatial alignment of electrons introduced in earlier works [T. Dornheim et al., Commun. Phys. 5, 304 (2022)]. The observed quadratic dependence on the perturbation amplitude in the limit of weak perturbations and the quartic dependence of perturbation amplitude corrections are consistent with linear and nonlinear versions of the density stiffness theorem.

  abstract = {We contrast Dirac’s theory of transition probabilities and the theory of nonadiabatic transition probabilities, applied to a perturbed system that is coupled to a bath. In Dirac’s analysis, the presence of an excited state |k0⟩ in the time-dependent wave function constitutes a transition. In the nonadiabatic theory, a transition occurs when the wave function develops a term that is not adiabatically connected to the initial state. Landau and Lifshitz separated Dirac’s excited-state coefficients into a term that follows the adiabatic theorem of Born and Fock and a nonadiabatic term that represents excitation across an energy gap. If the system remains coherent, the two approaches are equivalent. However, differences between the two approaches arise when coupling to a bath causes dephasing, a situation that was not treated by Dirac. For two-level model systems in static electric fields, we add relaxation terms to the Liouville equation for the time derivative of the density matrix. We contrast the results obtained from the two theories. In the analysis based on Dirac’s transition probabilities, the steady state of the system is not an equilibrium state; also, the steady-state population ρkk,s increases with increasing strength of the perturbation and its value depends on the dephasing time T2. In the nonadiabatic theory, the system evolves to the thermal equilibrium with the bath. The difference is not simply due to the choice of basis because the difference remains when the results are transformed to a common basis.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present ænet-PyTorch, a PyTorch-based implementation for training artificial neural network-based machine learning interatomic potentials. Developed as an extension of the atomic energy network (ænet), ænet-PyTorch provides access to all the tools included in ænet for the application and usage of the potentials. The package has been designed as an alternative to the internal training capabilities of ænet, leveraging the power of graphic processing units to facilitate direct training on forces in addition to energies. This leads to a substantial reduction of the training time by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the central processing unit implementation, enabling direct training on forces for systems beyond small molecules. Here, we demonstrate the main features of ænet-PyTorch and show its performance on open databases. Our results show that training on all the force information within a dataset is not necessary, and including between 10\% and 20\% of the force information is sufficient to achieve optimally accurate interatomic potentials with the least computational resources.},

  abstract = {Recent work [Mirth et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 114114 (2021)] has demonstrated that sublevelset persistent homology provides a compact representation of the complex features of an energy landscape in 3 N-dimensions. This includes information about all transition paths between local minima (connected by critical points of index ≥1) and allows for differentiation of energy landscapes that may appear similar when considering only the lowest energy pathways (as tracked by other representations, such as disconnectivity graphs, using index 1 critical points). Using the additive nature of the conformational potential energy landscape of n-alkanes, it became apparent that some topological features—such as the number of sublevelset persistence bars—could be proven. This work expands the notion of predictable energy landscape topology to any additive intramolecular energy function on a product space, including the number of sublevelset persistent bars as well as the birth and death times of these topological features. This amounts to a rigorous methodology to predict the relative energies of all topological features of the conformational energy landscape in 3N dimensions (without the need for dimensionality reduction). This approach is demonstrated for branched alkanes of varying complexity and connectivity patterns. More generally, this result explains how the sublevelset persistent homology of an additive energy landscape can be computed from the individual terms comprising that landscape.},

The deceleration, thermalization, delocalization, and initial hydration of the extremely low-energy electrons ejected by water photolysis are sequentially tracked in the condensed phase. We show herein the calculated results for these sequential phenomena during 300 fs. Our results indicate that the mechanisms heavily depend on the intermolecular vibration and rotation modes peculiar to water and the momentum transfer between the electrons and the water medium. We suggest that using our results for the delocalized electron distribution will reproduce successive chemical reactions measured by photolysis experiments using a chemical reaction code. We expect our approach to become a powerful technique for various scientific fields related to water photolysis and radiolysis.},

Utilizing computational chemistry methods, we present intrinsic bond descriptors for the Diels–Alder reaction, allowing for an automatic bond perception. We show that these bond descriptors are available from localized orbitals and self-interaction correction calculations, e.g., from Fermi-orbital descriptors. The proposed descriptors allow a sparse, simple, and educational inspection of the Diels–Alder reaction from an electronic perspective. We demonstrate that bond descriptors deliver a simple visual representation of the concerted bond formation and bond breaking, which agrees with Lewis’ theory of bonding.},

On the other hand, the Bruce–Vincent method is widely used in the lab to approximately measure transference numbers of polymer electrolytes, which becomes exact in the limit of infinite dilution. Therefore, theoretical formulations to treat the Bruce–Vincent transference number and the true transference number on an equal footing are clearly needed. Here, we show how the Bruce–Vincent transference number for concentrated electrolyte solutions can be derived in terms of the Onsager coefficients, without involving any extrathermodynamic assumptions. By demonstrating it for the case of poly(ethylene oxide)–lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide system, this work opens the door to calibrating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations via reproducing the Bruce–Vincent transference number and using MD simulations as a predictive tool for determining the true transference number.},

In particular, the extent to which CISS influences spin polarization or spin coherence in the initial state of spin-correlated radical pairs following charge transfer through a chiral bridge remains an open question. Here, we introduce a quantum sensing scheme to measure directly the hypothesized spin polarization in radical pairs using shallow nitrogen–vacancy (NV) centers in diamond at the single- to few-molecule level. Importantly, we highlight the perturbative nature of the electron spin–spin dipolar coupling within the radical pair and demonstrate how Lee–Goldburg decoupling can preserve spin polarization in D–B–A molecules for enantioselective detection by a single NV center. The proposed measurements will provide fresh insight into spin selectivity in electron transfer reactions.},

Here, we argue that artificial ionic machines can be designed by harnessing the entire wealth of phenomena available at the nanoscales and exploiting techniques developed in various fields of physics. As they are generally based on solid-state nanopores, rather than soft membranes and proteins, they should, in particular, aim at taking advantage of their specific properties, such as their electronic structure or their ability to interact with light.

Phase and conformational transitions of patterned chains are relevant for understanding liquid–liquid separation of biomolecular condensates, which play a prominent role in cellular biophysics and for surfactant and polymer applications. Previous studies of simple models for multiblock chains have shown that, depending on the sequence pattern and chain length, such systems can fall into one of two categories: displaying either phase separation or aggregation into finite-size clusters. The key new result of this paper is that both formation of finite-size aggregates and phase separation can be observed for certain chain architectures at appropriate conditions of temperature and concentration. For such systems, a bulk dense liquid condenses from a dilute phase that already contains multi-chain finite-size aggregates. The computational approach used in this study involves several distinct steps using histogram-reweighting grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, which are described in some level of detail.},

We show that increasing the auto-similarity level of the hierarchy – called n – does not affect considerably the stable wetting state of the droplet but increases its contact angle. Simulations also explicit the existence of metastable states on this type of surfaces and shows that, when n increases, the metastability becomes more pronounced. Finally we show that the fractal dimension of the surface is not a good predictor of the contact angle of the droplet.},

Being 15 nm in length and twice the Bohr length, these nanocrystals are either weakly confined or bulk-like. In contrast to this expectation of weak confinement, emission from multiexcitons is observed with binding energies consistent with strongly confined quantum dots. In addition to emission from biexcitons, emission from triexcitons is observed. The triexciton emission includes both S and P recombination channels. Excitation with different amounts of excess energy yields the same PL spectral dynamics, indicating that there are no hot carrier effects, and the electronic structure of the absorbing states is the same. The kinetics of the multiexciton populations are presented in two ways. The kinetics are first shown in a spectrally integrated form, showing faster t-PL at higher fluences independent of excitation excess energy. Both excess energies show the same saturation response. In the second way of presenting the kinetics, the multiexciton populations are decomposed and presented as transients and saturation curves. These decomposed spectra into exciton, biexciton, and triexciton populations enable further insight into their kinetics and fluence dependence.},

  abstract = {Colloidal nanorods based on CdS or CdSe, functionalized with metal particles, have proven to be efficient catalysts for light-driven hydrogen evolution. Seeded CdSe@CdS nanorods have shown increasing performance with increasing rod length. This observation was rationalized by the increasing lifetime of the separated charges, as a large distance between holes localized in the CdSe seed and electrons localized at the metal tip decreases their recombination rate. However, the impact of nanorod length on the electron-to-tip localization efficiency or pathway remained an open question. Therefore, we investigated the photo-induced electron transfer to the metal in a series of Ni-tipped CdSe@CdS nanorods with varying length. We find that the transfer processes occurring from the region close to the semiconductor–metal interface, the rod region, and the CdSe seed region depend in different ways on the rods’ length. The rate of the fastest process from excitonic states generated directly at the interface is independent of the rod length, but the relative amplitude decreases with increasing rod length, as the weight of the interface region is decreasing. The transfer of electrons to the metal tip from excitons generated in the CdS rod region depends strongly on the length of the nanorods, which indicates an electron transport-limited process, i.e., electron diffusion toward the interface region, followed by fast interface crossing. The transfer originating from the CdSe excitonic states again shows no significant length dependence in its time constant, as it is probably limited by the rate of overcoming the shallow confinement in the CdSe seed.},

  abstract = {Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has ice binding and ice nucleating properties. Here, we explore the dependence of the molecular size of PVA on its ice nucleation activity. For this purpose, we studied ice nucleation in aqueous solutions of PVA samples with molar masses ranging from 370 to 145 000 g mol−1, with a particular focus on oligomer samples with low molar mass. The experiments employed a novel microfluidic setup that is a follow-up on the previous WeIzmann Supercooled Droplets Observation on a Microarray (WISDOM) design by Reicher et al. The modified setup introduced and characterized here, termed nanoliter Bielefeld Ice Nucleation ARraY (nanoBINARY), uses droplet microfluidics with droplets (96 ± 4) µm in diameter and a fluorinated continuous oil phase and surfactant. A comparison of homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation data obtained with nanoBINARY to those obtained with WISDOM shows very good agreement, underpinning its ability to study low-temperature ice nucleators as well as homogeneous ice nucleation due to the low background of impurities. The experiments on aqueous PVA solutions revealed that the ice nucleation activity of shorter PVA chains strongly decreases with a decrease in molar mass. While the cumulative number of ice nucleating sites per mass nm of polymers with different molar masses is the same, it becomes smaller for oligomers and completely vanishes for dimer and monomer representatives such as 1,3-butanediol, propan-2-ol, and ethanol, most likely because these molecules become too small to effectively stabilize the critical ice embryo. Overall, our results are consistent with PVA polymers and oligomers acting as heterogeneous ice nucleators.},

  abstract = {Nucleation in systems with a metastable liquid–gas critical point is the prototypical example of a two-step nucleation process in which the appearance of the critical nucleus is preceded by the formation of a liquid-like density fluctuation. So far, the majority of studies on colloidal and protein crystallization have focused on one-component systems, and we are lacking a clear description of two-step nucleation processes in multicomponent systems, where critical fluctuations involve coupled density and concentration inhomogeneities. Here, we examine the nucleation process of a binary mixture of patchy particles designed to nucleate into a diamond lattice. By combining Gibbs-ensemble simulations and direct nucleation simulations over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions, we are able to pin down the role of the liquid–gas metastable phase diagram on the nucleation process. In particular, we show that the strongest enhancement of crystallization occurs at an azeotropic point with the same stoichiometric composition of the crystal.},

In the low-pressure regime, the exact third and fourth virial coefficients are obtained, which involve single and double integrals, respectively. Moreover, we show that the standard irreducible diagrams do not provide a complete account of the virial coefficients in confined geometries. The asymptotic equation of state in the high-pressure limit is seen to present a simple pole at the close-packing linear density, as in the hard-rod fluid, but, in contrast to the latter case, the residue is 2. Since, for an arbitrary pressure, the exact transfer-matrix treatment requires the numerical solution of an eigenvalue integral equation, we propose here two simple approximations to the equation of state, with different complexity levels, and carry out an extensive assessment of their validity and practical convenience vs the exact solution and available computer simulations.},

The formation of the anion, Fl − , is directly investigated by photoelectron imaging. The Fl − and Fl–CO 2 − action spectra indicate that, for λ 400 nm, decarboxylation only proceeds following electron loss via a sequential two-photon process. The primary decarboxylation pathway is the ready loss of CO 2 from the relatively short-lived intermediate excited state, Fl − [D 1 ], which is formed by electron loss from the dianion via resonant tunneling through the repulsive Coloumb barrier associated with a high-lying excited dianion state, Fl 2− [S 2 ].},

  abstract = {We study the electron-induced ion-pair dissociation to gas-phase oxygen molecules using a state-of-the-art velocity-map ion-imaging technique. The analysis is entirely based on the conical time-gated wedge-shaped velocity slice images of O−/O2 nascent anionic fragments, and the resulting observations are in favor of Van Brunt et al.’s report [R. J. Van Brunt and L. J. Kieffer, J. Chem. Phys. 60, 3057 (1974)]. A new image reconstruction method, Jacobian over parallel slicing, is introduced to overcome the drawback of ion exaggeration in determining the kinetic energy distribution from the time-gated parallel slicing technique, which offers an alternative approach to the wedge slicing method. Most importantly, the role of the quintet-heavy Rydberg state has been drawn out to the complex ion-pair formalism. The extracted kinetic energy and angular distributions from the wedge slice images reveal a high momentum transfer during the ion-pair dissociation process, which could be the finest rationale to observe the breakdown of dipole Born approximation driven by multipole moment associated with the incident electron beam. Three distinct dissociative momentum bands have been precisely identified for O− dissociation. However, radiationless Rydberg’s predissociation continuum (≥15\%) has become an inherent character of electron-induced ion-pair dissociation, which could be dealt with using the beyond Born–Oppenheimer treatment. The incoherent sum of Σ and Π symmetric-associated ion-pair final states has been precisely identified by modeling the angular distribution of O−/O2 for each of the kinetic energy bands. A negligibly small amount of forward–backward asymmetry is observed in the angular distribution of O−/O2, which might be explained by the dissociative state-specific quantum coherence mechanism as reported [Krishnakumar et al., Nat. Phys. 14, 149 (2018); Kumar et al., arXiv:2206.15024 (2022)] by Prabhudesai et al.},

Our home-built quantum cascade laser (QCL)-based IR spectrometer covers all relevant spectral regions to detect both lipid and protein vibrational modes. QCL-probed transients at single wavenumbers are compared with the previously performed step-scan Fourier-transform IR measurements. The absorbance changes of the lipids could be resolved by QCL-measurements with a much better signal-to-noise ratio and with nanosecond time resolution.

We recently reported the observation of 1H and 2H Overhauser effects in H3C- or D3C-functionalized Blatter radical analogs, which we presumed to be caused by methyl rotation. In this work, we look at the mechanism for methyl-driven Overhauser DNP in greater detail, considering methyl librations and tunneling in addition to classical rotation. We predict the temperature dependence of these mechanisms using density functional theory and spin dynamics simulations. Comparisons with results from ultralow-temperature magic angle spinning-DNP experiments revealed that cross-relaxation at temperatures above 60 K originates from both libration and rotation, while librations dominate at lower temperatures. Due to the zero-point vibrational nature of these motions, they are not quenched by very low temperatures, and methyl-driven Overhauser DNP is expected to increase in efficiency down to 0 K, predominantly due to increases in nuclear relaxation times.},

  abstract = {Semiflexible slender filaments are ubiquitous in nature and cell biology, including in the cytoskeleton, where reorganization of actin filaments allows the cell to move and divide. Most methods for simulating semiflexible inextensible fibers/polymers are based on discrete (bead-link or blob-link) models, which become prohibitively expensive in the slender limit when hydrodynamics is accounted for. In this paper, we develop a novel coarse-grained approach for simulating fluctuating slender filaments with hydrodynamic interactions. Our approach is tailored to relatively stiff fibers whose persistence length is comparable to or larger than their length and is based on three major contributions. First, we discretize the filament centerline using a coarse non-uniform Chebyshev grid, on which we formulate a discrete constrained Gibbs–Boltzmann (GB) equilibrium distribution and overdamped Langevin equation for the evolution of unit-length tangent vectors. Second, we define the hydrodynamic mobility at each point on the filament as an integral of the Rotne–Prager–Yamakawa kernel along the centerline and apply a spectrally accurate “slender-body” quadrature to accurately resolve the hydrodynamics. Third, we propose a novel midpoint temporal integrator, which can correctly capture the Ito drift terms that arise in the overdamped Langevin equation. For two separate examples, we verify that the equilibrium distribution for the Chebyshev grid is a good approximation of the blob-link one and that our temporal integrator for overdamped Langevin dynamics samples the equilibrium GB distribution for sufficiently small time step sizes. We also study the dynamics of relaxation of an initially straight filament and find that as few as 12 Chebyshev nodes provide a good approximation to the dynamics while allowing a time step size two orders of magnitude larger than a resolved blob-link simulation. We conclude by applying our approach to a suspension of cross-linked semiflexible fibers (neglecting hydrodynamic interactions between fibers), where we study how semiflexible fluctuations affect bundling dynamics. We find that semiflexible filaments bundle faster than rigid filaments even when the persistence length is large, but show that semiflexible bending fluctuations only further accelerate agglomeration when the persistence length and fiber length are of the same order.},

  abstract = {A new heteronuclear decoupling sequence for solid-state NMR and magic angle spinning faster than 60 kHz was recently introduced [Simion et al., J. Chem. Phys. 157, 014202 (2022)]. It was dubbed ROtor-Synchronized Phase-Alternated Cycles (ROSPAC), and it offers robustness for a large range of chemical shifts and low radio-frequency (RF) powers and is almost independent of the radio-frequency power. Here, we theoretically explore the robustness of the ROSPAC sequence toward 1H offset and RF field inhomogeneities, as well as the spacing effect of the π pulses on the decoupling efficiency. We use a generalized theoretical framework based on the Floquet theory to assess these parameters. The optimum decoupling conditions, where the magnitude of the second-order cross-terms and first-order resonance conditions are small, were identified.},

  abstract = {We present a hydrodynamic theory describing pair diffusion in systems with periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing earlier work on self-diffusion [B. Dünweg and K. Kremer, J. Chem. Phys. 99 , 6983–6997 (1993) and I.-C. Yeh and G. Hummer, J. Phys. Chem. B 108 , 15873–15879 (2004)]. Its predictions are compared with Molecular Dynamics simulations for a liquid carbonate electrolyte and two ionic liquids, for which we characterize the correlated motion between distinct ions. Overall, we observe good agreement between theory and simulation data, highlighting that hydrodynamic interactions universally dictate ion correlations. However, when summing over all ion pairs in the system to obtain the cross-contributions to the total cationic or anionic conductivity, the hydrodynamic interactions between ions with like and unlike charges largely cancel. Consequently, significant conductivity contributions only arise from deviations from a hydrodynamic flow field of an ideal fluid, which is from the local electrolyte structure as well as the relaxation processes in the subdiffusive regime. In the case of ionic liquids, the momentum-conservation constraint additionally is vital, which we study by employing different ionic masses in the simulations. Our formalism will likely also be helpful to estimate finite-size effects of the conductivity or of Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities in simulations.},

  abstract = {Calculations in Kohn–Sham density functional theory crucially rely on high-quality approximations for the exchange-correlation (xc) functional. Standard local and semi-local approximations fail to predict the ionization potential (IP) and the fundamental gap, departing from the Kohn–Sham orbital energies, due to the deviation of the total energy from piecewise-linearity and the absence of the derivative discontinuity. The ensemble generalization procedure introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 126403 (2013) restores, to a large extent, these features in any approximate xc functional and improves its ability to predict the IP and the fundamental gap with negligible additional computational effort. In this work we perform an extensive study of atoms and first ions across the Periodic Table, generalizing the local spin-density and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof approximations. By applying the ensemble generalization to a variety of systems, with s-, p-, and d-character, we assess the accuracy of the method and identify important trends. In particular, we find that the accuracy of our approach heavily depends on the character of the frontier orbitals: when d-orbitals are involved, the performance is far less accurate. Possible sources of error are discussed and ways for further improvement are outlined.},

  abstract = {Second-order N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2) is an exactly size-consistent and intruder-state-free multi-reference theory. To accelerate the NEVPT2 computation, Guo and Neese combined it with the local pair-natural orbital (PNO) method using the projected atomic orbitals (PAOs) as the underlying local basis [Guo et al., J. Chem. Phys. 144, 094111 (2016)]. In this paper, we report the further development of the PNO-NEVPT2 method using the orthonormal and non-redundant localized virtual molecular orbitals (LVMOs) instead of PAOs. The LVMOs were previously considered to perform relatively poor compared to PAOs because the resulting orbital domains were unacceptably large. Our prior work, however, showed that this drawback can be remedied by re-forming the domain construction scheme using differential overlap integrals [Saitow et al., J. Chem. Phys. 157, 084101 (2022)]. In this work, we develop further refinements to enhance the feasibility of using LVMOs. We first developed a two-level semi-local approach for screening out so-called weak-pairs to select or truncate the pairs for PNO constructions more flexibly. As a refinement specific to the Pipek–Mezey localization for LVMOs, we introduced an iterative scheme to truncate the Givens rotations using varying thresholds. We assessed the LVMO-based PNO-NEVPT2 method through benchmark calculations for linear phenyl alkanes, which demonstrate that it performs comparably well relative to the PAO-based approach. In addition, we evaluated the Co–C bond dissociation energies for the cobalamin derivatives composed of 200 or more atoms, which confirms that the LVMO-based method can recover more than 99.85\% of the canonical NEVPT2 correlation energy.},

We compare our proposed decoherence scheme with a recently proposed parameter-free decoherence scheme by Wang and co-workers. We show that for all model systems investigated here, our scheme is as accurate as the original A-FSSH method while at least 30 times more efficient. The decoherence scheme of Wang is more than ten times more efficient than our scheme although it does not give accurate results in the limit of large diabatic coupling.},

The method combines our previous implementations to model absorption as well as fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra in the framework of excited state dynamics with a new technique to calculate MCD intensities, where molecular orientational averages are treated via semi-numerical quadrature. The implementation relies on a path integral approach that is employed to compute nuclear dynamics under the harmonic oscillator approximation (accounting for the nuclear potential energy surface) together with quasi-degenerate perturbative theory (to include the perturbation of an external magnetic field). We evaluate our implementation with a selected molecular set consisting of five aromatic organic molecules, namely, 1,4-benzoquinone, naphthalene, 2-naphthylamine, 2-naphthaldehyde, and benzene; we also included the MnO4− and the [Co(NH3)6]3+ transition metal complexes. This set is used to validate the ability of the approach to compute MCD A- and B-terms in conjunction with time-dependent density functional theory. The computed intensities are discussed in terms of the overall quality of the electronic structure treatments, vibrational modes, and the quality of the nuclear Hessians. It is shown that in the cases in which the potential energy surface is accurately represented, electric dipole-forbidden transitions are vibrationally activated, producing intensities relative to the dipole-allowed transitions in the same order of magnitude as the experimental measurements.},

In this work, we construct an ML model to correct the density functional approximations, which adopts semilocal descriptors of electron density and density derivative and is trained by accurate reference data of relative and absolute energies. The resulting ML-corrected functional is tested on a comprehensive dataset including various types of energetic properties. Particularly, the ML-corrected Becke’s three parameters and the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation (B3LYP) functional achieves a substantial improvement over the original B3LYP on the prediction of total energies of atoms and molecules and atomization energies, and a marginal improvement on the prediction of ionization potentials, electron affinities, and bond dissociation energies; whereas, it preserves the same level of accuracy for isomerization energies and reaction barrier heights. The ML-corrected functional allows for fully self-consistent-field calculation with similar efficiency to the parent functional. This study highlights the progress of building an ML correction toward achieving a functional that performs uniformly better than B3LYP.},

  abstract = {In Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations based on the density functional theory (DFT), the potential energy and the interatomic forces are calculated from an electronic ground state density that is determined by an iterative self-consistent field optimization procedure, which, in practice, never is fully converged. The calculated energies and forces are, therefore, only approximate, which may lead to an unphysical energy drift and instabilities. Here, we discuss an alternative shadow BOMD approach that is based on backward error analysis. Instead of calculating approximate solutions for an underlying exact regular Born–Oppenheimer potential, we do the opposite. Instead, we calculate the exact electron density, energies, and forces, but for an underlying approximate shadow Born–Oppenheimer potential energy surface. In this way, the calculated forces are conservative with respect to the approximate shadow potential and generate accurate molecular trajectories with long-term energy stabilities. We show how such shadow Born–Oppenheimer potentials can be constructed at different levels of accuracy as a function of the integration time step, δt, from the constrained minimization of a sequence of systematically improvable, but approximate, shadow energy density functionals. For each energy functional, there is a corresponding ground state Born–Oppenheimer potential. These pairs of shadow energy functionals and potentials are higher-level generalizations of the original “zeroth-level” shadow energy functionals and potentials used in extended Lagrangian BOMD [Niklasson, Eur. Phys. J. B 94, 164 (2021)]. The proposed shadow energy functionals and potentials are useful only within this extended dynamical framework, where also the electronic degrees of freedom are propagated as dynamical field variables together with the atomic positions and velocities. The theory is quite general and can be applied to MD simulations using approximate DFT, Hartree–Fock, or semi-empirical methods, as well as to coarse-grained flexible charge models.},

When optimizing the fit of the exchange kernel vW to W, using a stochastic sampling W, the difference W − vW becomes quite small. Then, in the main BSE routine, this small difference is stochastically sampled. The number of stochastic samples needed for an accurate spectrum is then largely independent of system size. While the method is formally cubic in scaling, the scaling prefactor is small due to the constant number of stochastic orbitals needed for sampling W.},

The implementation in the Crystal code is presented, and the considerably improved computational efficiency over the previous implementation is illustrated.

  abstract = {Real-time simulations of laser-driven electron dynamics contain information about molecular optical properties through all orders in response theory. These properties can be extracted by assuming convergence of the power series expansion of induced electric and magnetic multipole moments. However, the accuracy relative to analytical results from response theory quickly deteriorates for higher-order responses due to the presence of high-frequency oscillations in the induced multipole moment in the time domain. This problem has been ascribed to missing higher-order corrections. We here demonstrate that the deviations are caused by nonadiabatic effects arising from the finite-time ramping from zero to full strength of the external laser field. Three different approaches, two using a ramped wave and one using a pulsed wave, for extracting electrical properties from real-time time-dependent electronic-structure simulations are investigated. The standard linear ramp is compared to a quadratic ramp, which is found to yield highly accurate results for polarizabilities, and first and second hyperpolarizabilities, at roughly half the computational cost. Results for the third hyperpolarizability are presented along with a simple, computable measure of reliability.},

Fluid Mech. 649, 205–231 (2010)] for computing hydrodynamic interactions among particles confined to a doubly periodic geometry with either a single bottom wall or two walls (slit channel) in the aperiodic direction. Our spectrally accurate Stokes solver uses the fast Fourier transform in the periodic xy plane and Chebyshev polynomials in the aperiodic z direction normal to the wall(s). We decompose the problem into two problems. The first is a doubly periodic subproblem in the presence of particles (source terms) with free-space boundary conditions in the z direction, which we solve by borrowing ideas from a recent method for rapid evaluation of electrostatic interactions in doubly periodic geometries [Maxian et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 204107 (2021)]. The second is a correction subproblem to impose the boundary conditions on the wall(s). Instead of the traditional Gaussian kernel, we use the exponential of a semicircle kernel to model the source terms (body force) due to the presence of particles and provide optimum values for the kernel parameters that ensure a given hydrodynamic radius with at least two digits of accuracy and rotational and translational invariance. The computation time of our solver, which is implemented in graphical processing units, scales linearly with the number of particles, and allows computations with about a million particles in less than a second for a sedimented layer of colloidal microrollers. We find that in a slit channel, a driven dense suspension of microrollers maintains the same two-layer structure as above a single wall, but moves at a substantially lower collective speed due to increased confinement.},

By applying preoxidation potentials, we made surface Au(III) (hydro-)oxides on a plasmonic Au photoanode. According to the charge of reductively stripping surface oxygenated species before and after PMPEC water-oxidation, we found that a negative shift of an onset potential, increase in photocurrent, and much less growth of surface (hydro-)oxides were correlated with each other as a result of the increase in the coverage of Au (III) (hydro-)oxides. These results suggest that the surface Au(III) (hydro-)oxides kinetically promoted water-oxidation by restricting the growth of surface (hydro-)oxides.},

  abstract = {Carbohydrates constitute one of the four key classes of biomacromolecules but have not been studied by 2D-IR spectroscopy so far. Similarly as for proteins, a lack of native vibrational reporter groups, combined with their huge structural diversity, leads to spectrally congested infrared spectra already for single carbohydrates. Biophysical studies are further impeded by the strong overlap between water modes and carbohydrate modes. Here, we demonstrate the application of the known vibrational reporter group thiocyanate (SCN) as a label in glucose. In this first study, we are able to perform IR and 2D-IR spectroscopy of β-glucose with SCN at the C2 position in chloroform. Upon improved synthesis and the removal of all protecting groups, we successfully performed 2D-IR spectroscopy of β-glucose in H2O. All experimental results are compared to those of methyl-thiocyanate as a reference sample. Overall, we show that the concept of using site-specific vibrational reporter groups can be transferred to carbohydrates. Thus, biophysical studies with 2D-IR spectroscopy can now expand to glycoscience.},

The method of image charges is considered to take into account surface polarization, considering a metallic, an unpolarizable, and a dielectric nano-core. It is observed that, for all cases, a moderate shrinking–swelling effect appears with an increase in the electrostatic coupling parameter. This effect occurs under high Manning ratios. The curves relating the average size of polyelectrolyte brush as a function of coupling show a minimum. The results show that the grafting density of polyelectrolytes on the nano-core surface plays an important role in the polarization effect. We consider a modified Poisson–Boltzmann theory to describe the counterion profiles around the brush in the case of unpolarizable nano-cores and weak electrostatic coupling.},

When the active agent is used as a drug, corrosion inhibitor, or pesticide, it can be released upon a specific stimulus. The efficiency and the sustainability of active agents are determined by the released kinetics. In this work, we study the fast-release kinetics of 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) from a pH-responsive, random copolymer of methyl methacrylate and 8-quinolinyl-sulfide-ethyl acrylate [P(MMA-co-HQSEA)] by hydrolysis of the β-thiopropionate groups. We used contact angle measurements of sliding drops as an elegant way to characterize the release kinetics. Based on the results gained from 1H nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, fluorescent intensity measurement, and velocity-dependent contact angle measurement, we found that both the hydrolysis rate and polymer conformation affect the release kinetics of 8HQ from a P(MMA-co-HQSEA) film. Polymer chains collapse and further suppress the release from the inner layer in acidic conditions, while polymer chains in a stretched condition further facilitate the release from the inner layer. As a result, the cumulative release rate of 8HQ is higher in the basic condition than in the acidic condition.},

  abstract = {Polymer gel electrolytes (PGE) have seen a renewed interest in their development because they have high ionic conductivities but low electrochemical degradation and flammability. PGEs are formed by mixing a liquid lithium-ion electrolyte with a polymer at a sufficiently large concentration to form a gel. PGEs have been extensively studied, but the direct connection between their microscopic structure and macroscopic properties remains controversial. For example, it is still unknown whether the polymer in the PGE acts as an inert, stabilizing scaffold for the electrolyte or it interacts with the ionic components. Here, a PGE composed of a prototypical lithium-carbonate electrolyte and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is pursued at both microscopic and macroscopic levels. Specifically, this study focused on describing the microscopic and macroscopic changes in the PGE at different polymer concentrations. The results indicated that the polymer-ion and polymer–polymer interactions are strongly dependent on the concentration of the polymer and the lithium salt. In particular, the polymer interacts with itself at very high PAN concentrations (10\% weight) resulting in a viscous gel. However, the conductivity and dynamics of the electrolyte liquid components are significantly less affected by the addition of the polymer. The observations are explained in terms of the PGE structure, which transitions from a polymer solution to a gel, containing a polymer matrix and disperse electrolyte, at low and high PAN concentrations, respectively. The results highlight the critical role that the polymer concentration plays in determining both the macroscopic properties of the system and the molecular structure of the PGE.},

The results show that the effect of Ni/Co mixing on the structural property is slight. For the case of the mechanical property, the elastic constant, elastic modulus, such as Young’s modulus (Y), Poisson’s ratio (v), Pugh’s ratio (B/G), and Cauchy pressure (C′) of LNCO have been carefully analyzed based on the strain-energy method. The results demonstrate that the mechanical strength of LNCO materials is weaker than that of pure LiCoO2 (LCO) and LiNiO2 (LNO). However, the B/G ratio and Poisson’s ratio of LNCO are greater than that of the pure LCO and LNO, which means that Ni/Co mixing can improve the ductility of pure LCO and LNO. In addition, Cauchy pressure and anisotropy are also discussed, and as cathode materials, LNCO still exhibits good electrical conductivity. Our results provide a feasible way to realize mechanical property modulation by Ni–Co-based layered transition metal oxides LCO. Furthermore, our study is also helpful to reveal the formation mechanism of intra-lattice microcracks in electrode materials.},

The observed rotational distributions exhibit highly linear (i.e., thermal) Boltzmann plots but notably reflect rotational temperatures (Trot) as much as 30 K lower than the liquid temperature (Tjet). A comparable lack of equilibrium behavior is also noted in the electronic degrees of freedom but with populations corresponding to spin–orbit temperatures (TSO) consistently higher than Trot by ∼15 K. These results unambiguously demonstrate evaporation into a non-equilibrium distribution, which, by detailed-balance considerations, predict quantum-state-dependent sticking coefficients for incident collisions of NO at the gas–liquid interface. Comparison and parallels with previous experimental studies of NO thermal desorption and molecular-beam scattering in other systems are discussed, which suggests the emergence of a self-consistent picture for the non-equilibrium dynamics.},

The apparent association constant (Kapp) obtained for the binding of viologen molecules with PMA-capped CsPbBr3 was 2.3 × 107 M−1, which is an order of magnitude greater than that obtained with oleic acid/oleylamine-capped CsPbBr3. Although the length of the alkyl chain of the viologen molecule did not show any impact on the electron transfer rate constant, it influenced the charge separation efficiency and net electron transfer quantum yield. Viologen moieties with a shorter alkyl chain length exhibited a charge separation efficiency of 72\% compared with 50\% for the longer chain alkyl chain length viologens.

While fixed electrode potential conditions can be simulated with grand canonical ensemble DFT (GCE-DFT), various electrostatic corrections on canonical, constant charge DFT are often applied instead. In this work, we present a systematic derivation and analysis of the different electrostatic corrections on canonical DFT to understand their physical validity, implicit assumptions, and scope of applicability. Our work highlights the need to carefully address the suitability of a given model for the problem under study, especially if physical or chemical insight in addition to reaction energetics is sought. In particular, we analytically show that the different corrections cannot differentiate between electrostatic interactions and covalent or charge-transfer interactions. By numerically testing different models for CO2 adsorption on a single-atom catalyst as a function of the electrode potential, we further show that computed capacitances, dipole moments, and the obtained physical insight depend sensitively on the chosen approximation. These features limit the scope, generality, and physical insight of these corrective schemes despite their proven practicality for specific systems and energetics. Finally, we suggest guidelines for choosing different electrostatic corrections and propose the use of conceptual DFT to develop more general approximations for electrochemical interfaces and reactions using canonical DFT.},

  abstract = {A vast array of phenomena, ranging from chemical reactions to phase transformations, are analyzed in terms of a free energy surface defined with respect to a single or multiple order parameters. Enhanced sampling methods are typically used, especially in the presence of large free energy barriers, to estimate free energies using biasing protocols and sampling of transition paths. Kinetic reconstructions of free energy barriers of intermediate height have been performed, with respect to a single order parameter, employing the steady state properties of unconstrained simulation trajectories when barrier crossing is achievable with reasonable computational effort. Considering such cases, we describe a method to estimate free energy surfaces with respect to multiple order parameters from a steady state ensemble of trajectories. The approach applies to cases where the transition rates between pairs of order parameter values considered is not affected by the presence of an absorbing boundary, whereas the macroscopic fluxes and sampling probabilities are. We demonstrate the applicability of our prescription on different test cases of random walkers executing Brownian motion in order parameter space with an underlying (free) energy landscape and discuss strategies to improve numerical estimates of the fluxes and sampling. We next use this approach to reconstruct the free energy surface for supercooled liquid silicon with respect to the degree of crystallinity and density, from unconstrained molecular dynamics simulations, and obtain results quantitatively consistent with earlier results from umbrella sampling.},

Polarization arises from dipole orientation, which should intuitively decrease with increasing deposition temperature, T. However, it is experimentally found that minimum or maximum values in polarization vs T may be observed for cis-methyl formate, 1-propanol, and ammonia. A continuous analytic form of polarization vs T is developed, which has the property that it is not differentiable at all T. The minima and maxima in polarization vs T are marked by singularities in the differential of this analytic form. This exotic behavior is presently unique to films of dipolar species and has not been reported, for example, in the related magnetic phases of spin glasses.},

  abstract = {The spin-crossover [Fe(bt)(NCS)2]2(bpm) complex is studied using spin-polarized density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation, the Hubbard U and the weak van der Waals interactions in conjunction with the projector augmented wave method in its molecular and periodic arrangements. It is shown that the considered complex has three magnetic configurations [high spin state (HS)–HS, HS–low spin state (LS), and LS–LS] corresponding to those observed experimentally after two transition temperatures Tc(1) of 163 K and Tc(2) of 197 K. For the HS–HS magnetic state, we found that the two Fe centers are antiferromagnetically coupled for both molecular and periodic structures in good agreement with the experimental observations. Our results show that the computed total energy difference between the magnetic state configurations of the considered Fe2 complex is significantly smaller compared to those reported in the literature for other mono- or binuclear compounds.},

  abstract = {While the dissociative recombination (DR) of ground-state molecular ions with low-energy free electrons is generally known to be exothermic, it has been predicted to be endothermic for a class of transition-metal oxide ions. To understand this unusual case, the electron recombination of titanium oxide ions (TiO+) with electrons has been experimentally investigated using the Cryogenic Storage Ring. In its low radiation field, the TiO+ ions relax internally to low rotational excitation (≲100 K). Under controlled collision energies down to ∼2 meV within the merged electron and ion beam configuration, fragment imaging has been applied to determine the kinetic energy released to Ti and O neutral reaction products. Detailed analysis of the fragment imaging data considering the reactant and product excitation channels reveals an endothermicity for the TiO+ dissociative electron recombination of (+4 ± 10) meV. This result improves the accuracy of the energy balance by a factor of 7 compared to that found indirectly from hitherto known molecular properties. Conversely, the present endothermicity yields improved dissociation energy values for D0(TiO) = (6.824 ± 0.010) eV and D0(TiO+) = (6.832 ± 0.010) eV. All thermochemistry values were compared to new coupled-cluster calculations and found to be in good agreement. Moreover, absolute rate coefficients for the electron recombination of rotationally relaxed ions have been measured, yielding an upper limit of 1 × 10−7 cm3 s−1 for typical conditions of cold astrophysical media. Strong variation of the DR rate with the TiO+ internal excitation is predicted. Furthermore, potential energy curves for TiO+ and TiO have been calculated using a multi-reference configuration interaction method to constrain quantum-dynamical paths driving the observed TiO+ electron recombination.},

The nonlinearities are similar to those previously observed with 87Rb and 133Cs and presumed to come from alkali-metal–noble-gas van der Waals molecules. However, the shape of the nonlinearity observed for Xe conflicts with previous theory, and the nonlinearities for Ar and Kr disagree with the expected isotopic scaling of previous 87Rb results. Improving the modeling alleviates most of these discrepancies by treating rotation quantum mechanically and considering additional spin interactions in the molecules. Including the dipolar-hyperfine interaction allows simultaneous fitting of the linear and nonlinear shifts of both 85Rb and 87Rb in either Ar, Kr, or Xe buffer gases with a minimal set of shared, isotope-independent parameters. To the limit of experimental accuracy, the shifts in He and N2 were linear with pressure. The results are of practical interest to vapor-cell atomic clocks and related devices.},

  abstract = {The transition between the gas-, supercritical-, and liquid-phase behavior is a fascinating topic, which still lacks molecular-level understanding. Recent ultrafast two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy experiments suggested that the vibrational spectroscopy of N2O embedded in xenon and SF6 as solvents provides an avenue to characterize the transitions between different phases as the concentration (or density) of the solvent increases. The present work demonstrates that classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations together with accurate interaction potentials allows us to (semi-)quantitatively describe the transition in rotational vibrational infrared spectra from the P-/R-branch line shape for the stretch vibrations of N2O at low solvent densities to the Q-branch-like line shapes at high densities. The results are interpreted within the classical theory of rigid-body rotation in more/less constraining environments at high/low solvent densities or based on phenomenological models for the orientational relaxation of rotational motion. It is concluded that classical MD simulations provide a powerful approach to characterize and interpret the ultrafast motion of solutes in low to high density solvents at a molecular level.},

In this work, we computationally designed a series of aluminum chalcogenide clusters NAl4X4+ (X = S, Se, Te) with a desired planar tetracoordinate nitrogen and meaningfully improved chemical stability, as evidenced by the wide gaps (6.51–7.23 eV) between their highest occupied molecular orbitals and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, high molecular rigidity (dynamically stable up to 1500 K), and exclusively low global energy minima nature (their isomers locate at least 51.2 kcal/mol higher). Remarkably, these clusters are stabilized by peripheral chalcogen atoms, which not only sterically protect the NAl4 core moiety but also electronically compensate for the electron-deficient aluminum atoms via X → Al π back bonds, meeting the description of our recently proposed “electron-compensation” strategy.},

  abstract = {The relative energies of different phases or polymorphs of molecular solids can be small, less than a kilojoule/mol. A reliable description of such energy differences requires high-quality treatment of electron correlations, typically beyond that achievable by routinely applicable density functional theory (DFT) approximations. At the same time, high-level wave function theory is currently too computationally expensive. Methods employing an intermediate level of approximations, such as Møller–Plesset (MP) perturbation theory and the random phase approximation (RPA), are potentially useful. However, their development and application for molecular solids has been impeded by the scarcity of necessary benchmark data for these systems. In this work, we employ the coupled-cluster method with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples to obtain a reference-quality many-body expansion of the binding energy of four crystalline hydrocarbons with a varying π-electron character: ethane, ethene, and cubic and orthorhombic forms of acetylene. The binding energy is resolved into explicit dimer, trimer, and tetramer contributions, which facilitates the analysis of errors in the approximate approaches. With the newly generated benchmark data, we test the accuracy of MP2 and non-self-consistent RPA. We find that both of the methods poorly describe the non-additive many-body interactions in closely packed clusters. Using different DFT input states for RPA leads to similar total binding energies, but the many-body components strongly depend on the choice of the exchange–correlation functional.},

A static approach, which has successfully been used in many applications, and five adaptive schemes based on Gaussian process regression have been investigated with respect to the number of necessary grid points and the accuracy of the fundamental modes for a small set of test molecules. A comparison with a related, more sophisticated, and consistent approach by Christiansen et al. is provided. The impact of the positions of the ab initio grid points is discussed for multilevel PESs, for which the computational effort of the individual electronic structure calculations decreases for increasing orders of the n-mode expansion.

The averaged potential energy change due to the deformation of the four-membered ring during Ag migration agrees well with the activation energy calculated from the conductivity Arrhenius plot.

Some form of quadrature or collocation is necessary when the potential energy surface does not have a simple form that simplifies the calculation of the potential matrix elements required to do a variational calculation. With quadrature, better accuracy is obtained by using more points than basis functions. To achieve the same advantage with collocation, we introduce a collocation method with more points than basis functions. Critically important, the method can be used with a large basis because it is incorporated into an iterative eigensolver. Previous collocation methods with more points than functions were incompatible with iterative eigensolvers. We test the new ideas by computing energy levels of molecules with as many as six atoms. We use pruned bases but expect the new method to be advantageous whenever one uses a basis for which it is not possible to find an accurate quadrature with about as many points as there are basis functions. For our test molecules, accurate energy levels are obtained even using non-optimal, simple, equally spaced points.},

  abstract = {Simulation datasets of proteins (e.g., those generated by molecular dynamics simulations) are filled with information about how a non-covalent interaction network within a protein regulates the conformation and, thus, function of the said protein. Most proteins contain thousands of non-covalent interactions, with most of these being largely irrelevant to any single conformational change. The ability to automatically process any protein simulation dataset to identify non-covalent interactions that are strongly associated with a single, defined conformational change would be a highly valuable tool for the community. Furthermore, the insights generated from this tool could be applied to basic research, in order to improve understanding of a mechanism of action, or for protein engineering, to identify candidate mutations to improve/alter the functionality of any given protein. The open-source Python package Key Interactions Finder (KIF) enables users to identify those non-covalent interactions that are strongly associated with any conformational change of interest for any protein simulated. KIF gives the user full control to define the conformational change of interest as either a continuous variable or categorical variable, and methods from statistics or machine learning can be applied to identify and rank the interactions and residues distributed throughout the protein, which are relevant to the conformational change. Finally, KIF has been applied to three diverse model systems (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, the PDZ3 domain, and the KE07 series of Kemp eliminases) in order to illustrate its power to identify key features that regulate functionally important conformational dynamics.},

  abstract = {Koopmans spectral functionals are a class of orbital-density-dependent functionals designed to accurately predict spectroscopic properties. They do so markedly better than their Kohn–Sham density-functional theory counterparts, as demonstrated in earlier works on benchmarks of molecules and bulk systems. This work is a complementary study where—instead of comparing against real, many-electron systems—we test Koopmans spectral functionals on Hooke’s atom, a toy two-electron system that has analytical solutions for particular strengths of its harmonic confining potential. As these calculations clearly illustrate, Koopmans spectral functionals do an excellent job of describing Hooke’s atom across a range of confining potential strengths. This work also provides broader insights into the features and capabilities of Koopmans spectral functionals more generally.},

  abstract = {Semi-empirical quantum models such as Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) are attractive methods for obtaining quantum simulation data at longer time and length scales than possible with standard approaches. However, application of these models can require lengthy effort due to the lack of a systematic approach for their development. In this work, we discuss the use of the Chebyshev Interaction Model for Efficient Simulation (ChIMES) to create rapidly parameterized DFTB models, which exhibit strong transferability due to the inclusion of many-body interactions that might otherwise be inaccurate. We apply our modeling approach to silicon polymorphs and review previous work on titanium hydride. We also review the creation of a general purpose DFTB/ChIMES model for organic molecules and compounds that approaches hybrid functional and coupled cluster accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than similar neural network approaches. In all cases, DFTB/ChIMES yields similar accuracy to the underlying quantum method with orders of magnitude improvement in computational cost. Our developments provide a way to create computationally efficient and highly accurate simulations over varying extreme thermodynamic conditions, where physical and chemical properties can be difficult to interrogate directly, and there is historically a significant reliance on theoretical approaches for interpretation and validation of experimental results.},

  abstract = {Many processes in chemistry, physics, and biology depend on thermally activated events in which the system changes its state by surmounting an activation barrier. Examples range from chemical reactions to protein folding and nucleation events. Parameterized forms of the mean field potential are often employed in the stochastic modeling of activated processes. In this contribution, we explore the alternative of employing parameterized forms of the equilibrium distribution by means of symmetric linear combination of two Gaussian functions. Such a procedure leads to flexible and convenient models for the landscape and the energy barrier whose features are controlled by the second moments of these Gaussian functions. The rate constants are examined through the solution of the corresponding diffusion problem, that is, the Fokker–Planck–Smoluchowski equation specified according to the parameterized equilibrium distribution. Numerical calculations clearly show that the asymptotic limit of large barriers does not agree with the results of the Kramers theory. The underlying reason is that the linear scaling of the potential, the procedure justifying the Kramers theory, cannot be applied when dealing with parameterized forms of the equilibrium distribution. A different kind of asymptotic analysis is then required and we introduce the appropriate theory when the equilibrium distribution is represented as a symmetric linear combination of two Gaussian functions: first in the one-dimensional case and afterward in the multidimensional diffusion model.},

  abstract = {We present an unsupervised data processing workflow that is specifically designed to obtain a fast conformational clustering of long molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. In this approach, we combine two dimensionality reduction algorithms (cc_analysis and encodermap) with a density-based spatial clustering algorithm (hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise). The proposed scheme benefits from the strengths of the three algorithms while avoiding most of the drawbacks of the individual methods. Here, the cc_analysis algorithm is applied for the first time to molecular simulation data. The encodermap algorithm complements cc_analysis by providing an efficient way to process and assign large amounts of data to clusters. The main goal of the procedure is to maximize the number of assigned frames of a given trajectory while keeping a clear conformational identity of the clusters that are found. In practice, we achieve this by using an iterative clustering approach and a tunable root-mean-square-deviation-based criterion in the final cluster assignment. This allows us to find clusters of different densities and different degrees of structural identity. With the help of four protein systems, we illustrate the capability and performance of this clustering workflow: wild-type and thermostable mutant of the Trp-cage protein (TC5b and TC10b), NTL9, and Protein B. Each of these test systems poses their individual challenges to the scheme, which, in total, give a nice overview of the advantages and potential difficulties that can arise when using the proposed method.},

  abstract = {The generalized Langevin mode analysis (GLMA) is applied to chemical reactions in biomolecules in solution. The theory sees a chemical reaction in solution as a barrier-crossing process, similar to the Marcus theory. The barrier is defined as the crossing point of two free-energy surfaces that are attributed to the reactant and product of the reaction. It is assumed that both free-energy surfaces are quadratic or harmonic. The assumption is based on the Kim-Hirata theory of structural fluctuation of protein, which proves that the fluctuation around an equilibrium structure is quadratic with respect to the structure or atomic coordinates. The quadratic surface is a composite of many harmonic functions with different modes or frequencies. The height of the activation barrier will be dependent on the mode or frequency—the less the frequency, the lower the barrier. Hence, it is essential to decouple the fluctuational modes into a hierarchical order. GLMA is impeccable for this purpose. It is essential for a theoretical study of chemical reactions to choose a reaction coordinate along which the reaction proceeds. We suppose that the mode whose center of coordinate and/or the frequency changes most before and after the reaction is the one relevant to the chemical reaction and choose the coordinate as the reaction coordinate. The rate of reaction along the reaction coordinate is krate=ν⁡exp−ΔF(†)/kBT, which is similar to the Marcus expression for the electron transfer reaction. In the equation, ΔF(†) is the activation barrier defined by ΔF(†)≡F(r)Q†−F(r)(Qeq(r)), where F(r)(Qeq(r)) and F(r)Q† denote the free energies at equilibrium Qeq(r) and the crossing point Q†, respectively, both on the free energy surface of the reactant.},

  abstract = {Some topological features of multisite Hamiltonians consisting of harmonic potential surfaces with constant site-to-site couplings are discussed. Even in the absence of Duschinsky rotation, such a Hamiltonian assumes the system-bath form only if severe constraints exist. The simplest case of a common bath that couples to all sites is realized when the potential minima are collinear. The bath reorganization energy increases quadratically with site distance in this case. Another frequently encountered situation involves exciton-vibration coupling in molecular aggregates, where the intramolecular normal modes of the monomers give rise to local harmonic potentials. In this case, the reorganization energy accompanying excitation transfer is independent of site-to-site separation, thus this situation cannot be described by the usual system-bath Hamiltonian. A vector system-bath representation is introduced, which brings the exciton-vibration Hamiltonian in system-bath form. In this, the system vectors specify the locations of the potential minima, which in the case of identical monomers lie on the vertices of a regular polyhedron. By properly choosing the system vectors, it is possible to couple each bath to one or more sites and to specify the desired initial density. With a collinear choice of system vectors, the coupling reverts to the simple form of a common bath. The compact form of the vector system-bath coupling generalizes the dissipative tight-binding model to account for local, correlated, and common baths. The influence functional for the vector system-bath Hamiltonian is obtained in a compact and simple form.},

The theoretical approach is based on a photonic structure that consists of two orthogonal cavities in which resonance with either the first or second of the two emitted photons is possible, leading to amplification and rerouting of the entangled light. The cavity–QD scheme uses a four-level cascade emitter that involves three levels for each polarization, leading to two spatially entangled photons for each polarization. By solving the Schrodinger equation, we identify the characteristic properties of the system, which can be used in conjunction with optimization techniques to achieve the “best” design relative to a set of prioritized criteria or constraints in our optical system. The theoretical investigations include an analysis of emission spectra in addition to the joint spectral density profile, and the results demonstrate the ability of the cavities to act as frequency filters for the photons that make up the entanglements and to modify entanglement properties. The results provide new opportunities for the experimental design and engineering of on-demand single photon sources.},

The vertex-corrected self-energy is constructed through the proposed separation–propagation–recombination procedure: the electronic Hilbert space is separated into an active space and its orthogonal complement denoted as the “rest;” the active component is propagated by a space-specific effective Hamiltonian different from the rest. The vertex corrections are introduced by a rescaled time-dependent nonlocal exchange interaction. The direct Γ correction to the self-energy is further updated by adjusting the rescaling factor in a self-consistent post-processing cycle. Our embedding method is tested mainly on donor–acceptor charge-transfer systems. The embedded vertex effects consistently and significantly correct the quasiparticle energies of the gap-edge states. The fundamental gap is generally improved by 1–3 eV upon the one-shot GW approximation. Furthermore, we provide an outlook for applications of (embedded) vertex corrections in calculations of extended solids.},

  abstract = {Real time modeling of fluorescence with vibronic resolution entails the representation of the light–matter interaction coupled to a quantum-mechanical description of the phonons and is therefore a challenging problem. In this work, taking advantage of the difference in timescales characterizing internal conversion and radiative relaxation—which allows us to decouple these two phenomena by sequentially modeling one after the other—we simulate the electron dynamics of fluorescence through a master equation derived from the Redfield formalism. Moreover, we explore the use of a recent semiclassical dissipative equation of motion [C. M. Bustamante et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 087401 (2021)], termed coherent electron electric-field dynamics (CEED), to describe the radiative stage. By comparing the results with those from the full quantum-electrodynamics treatment, we find that the semiclassical model does not reproduce the right amplitudes in the emission spectra when the radiative process involves the de-excitation to a manifold of closely lying states. We argue that this flaw is inherent to any mean-field approach and is the case with CEED. This effect is critical for the study of light–matter interaction, and this work is, to our knowledge, the first one to report this problem. We note that CEED reproduces the correct frequencies in agreement with quantum electrodynamics. This is a major asset of the semiclassical model, since the emission peak positions will be predicted correctly without any prior assumption about the nature of the molecular Hamiltonian. This is not so for the quantum electrodynamics approach, where access to the spectral information relies on knowledge of the Hamiltonian eigenvalues.},

  abstract = {The increasingly popular GW method is becoming a convenient tool to determine vertical ionization energies in molecular systems. However, depending on the formalism used and the range of orbitals investigated, it may be hampered by a steep computational scaling. To alleviate this issue, correlated natural virtual orbitals (NVOs) based on second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2) and direct MP2 correlation energies are implemented, and the resulting correlated NVOs are tested on GW quasiparticle energies. Test cases include the popular GW variants G0W0 and evGW0 as well as more elaborate vertex corrections. We find that for increasingly larger molecular systems and basis sets, NVOs considerably improve efficiency. Furthermore, we test the performance of the truncated (frozen) NVO ansatz on the GW100 test set. For the latter, it is demonstrated that, using a carefully chosen truncation threshold, NVOs lead to a negligible loss in accuracy while providing speedups of one order of magnitude. Furthermore, we compare the resulting quasiparticle energies to very accurate vertical ionization energies obtained from coupled-cluster theory with singles, doubles, and noniterative triples [CCSD(T)], confirming that the loss in accuracy introduced by truncating the NVOs is negligible compared to the methodical errors in the GW approximation. It is also demonstrated that the choice of basis set impacts results far more than using a suitably truncated NVO space. Therefore, at the same computational expense, more accurate results can be obtained using NVOs. Finally, we provide improved reference CCSD(T) values for the GW100 test set, which have been obtained using the def2-QZVPP basis set.},

  abstract = {The double quantum coherence (DQC) signal in nonlinear spectroscopy gives information about the many-body correlation effects not easily available by other methods. The signal is short-lived, consequently, a significant part of it is generated during the pulse overlap. Since the signal is at two times the laser frequency, one may intuitively expect that the pulse overlap-related artifacts are filtered out by the Fourier transform. Here, we show that this is not the case. We perform explicit calculations of phase-modulated two-pulse experiments of a two-level system where the DQC is impossible. Still, we obtain a significant signal at the modulation frequency, which corresponds to the DQC, while the Fourier transform over the pulse delay shows a double frequency. We repeat the calculations with a three-level system where the true DQC signal occurs. We conclude that with realistic dephasing times, the pulse-overlap artifact can be significantly stronger than the DQC signal. Our results call for great care when analyzing such experiments. As a rule of thumb, we recommend that only delays larger than 1.5 times the pulse length should be used.},

  abstract = {The effects of atomic mass in terms of its zero-point vibrational energy, on molar volume, glass transition temperature Tg, and viscosity are studied in glassy and supercooled B2O3 liquids using boron isotope substitutions. The molar volume decreases and Tg and isothermal viscosity increase on the substitution of lighter 10B isotopes with the heavier 11B isotopes. These effects are argued to be a manifestation of the higher zero-point vibrational energy of the lighter isotope, which along with the anharmonicity of the potential well, results in a longer equilibrium inter-atomic distance and larger mean-square displacement with respect to that for the heavier isotope. The isotope effect on viscosity is increasingly enhanced as the temperature approaches Tg, which is shown to be consistent with the prediction of the elastic models of viscous flow and shear relaxation.},

  abstract = {Seawater batteries (SWBs) are a key part of the future underwater energy network for maritime safety and resource development due to their high safety, long lifespan, and eco-friendly nature. However, the complicated seawater composition and pollution, such as the S2−, usually poison the catalyst and lead to the degradation of the battery performance. Here, Zn single-atom catalysts (SACs) were demonstrated as effective oxygen reduction reaction catalysts with high anti-poisoning properties by density functional theory calculation and the Zn SACs anchoring on an N, P-doped carbon substrate (Zn-SAC@PNC) was synthesized by a one-pot strategy. Zinc active sites ensure the anti-poisoning property toward S2−, and N, P-doped carbon helps improve the activity. Therefore, Zn-SAC@PNC exhibits superior activity (E1/2: 0.87 V, Tafel slope: 69.5 mV dec−1) compared with Pt/C and shows a lower decay rate of the voltage after discharge in lean-oxygen natural seawater. In the presence of S2−, Zn-SAC@PNC can still maintain its original catalytic activity, which ensures the stable operation of SWBs in the marine environment with sulfur-based pollutants. This study provides a new strategy to design and develop efficient cathode materials for SWBs.},

  abstract = {We here review mostly experimental and some computational work devoted to nucleation in amorphous ices. In fact, there are only a handful of studies in which nucleation and growth in amorphous ices are investigated as two separate processes. In most studies, crystallization temperatures Tx or crystallization rates RJG are accessed for the combined process. Our Review deals with different amorphous ices, namely, vapor-deposited amorphous solid water (ASW) encountered in many astrophysical environments; hyperquenched glassy water (HGW) produced from μm-droplets of liquid water; and low density amorphous (LDA), high density amorphous (HDA), and very high density amorphous (VHDA) ices produced via pressure-induced amorphization of ice I or from high-pressure polymorphs. We cover the pressure range of up to about 6 GPa and the temperature range of up to 270 K, where only the presence of salts allows for the observation of amorphous ices at such high temperatures. In the case of ASW, its microporosity and very high internal surface to volume ratio are the key factors determining its crystallization kinetics. For HGW, the role of interfaces between individual glassy droplets is crucial but mostly neglected in nucleation or crystallization studies. In the case of LDA, HDA, and VHDA, parallel crystallization kinetics to different ice phases is observed, where the fraction of crystallized ices is controlled by the heating rate. A key aspect here is that in different experiments, amorphous ices of different “purities” are obtained, where “purity” here means the “absence of crystalline nuclei.” For this reason, “preseeded amorphous ice” and “nuclei-free amorphous ice” should be distinguished carefully, which has not been done properly in most studies. This makes a direct comparison of results obtained in different laboratories very hard, and even results obtained in the same laboratory are affected by very small changes in the preparation protocol. In terms of mechanism, the results are consistent with amorphous ices turning into an ultraviscous, deeply supercooled liquid prior to nucleation. However, especially in preseeded amorphous ices, crystallization from the preexisting nuclei takes place simultaneously. To separate the time scales of crystallization from the time scale of structure relaxation cleanly, the goal needs to be to produce amorphous ices free from crystalline ice nuclei. Such ices have only been produced in very few studies.},

  abstract = {Approximate solutions to the ab initio electronic structure problem have been a focus of theoretical and computational chemistry research for much of the past century, with the goal of predicting relevant energy differences to within “chemical accuracy” (1 kcal/mol). For small organic molecules, or in general, for weakly correlated main group chemistry, a hierarchy of single-reference wave function methods has been rigorously established, spanning perturbation theory and the coupled cluster (CC) formalism. For these systems, CC with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples is known to achieve chemical accuracy, albeit at O(N7) computational cost. In addition, a hierarchy of density functional approximations of increasing formal sophistication, known as Jacob’s ladder, has been shown to systematically reduce average errors over large datasets representing weakly correlated chemistry. However, the accuracy of such computational models is less clear in the increasingly important frontiers of chemical space including transition metals and f-block compounds, in which strong correlation can play an important role in reactivity. A stochastic method, phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC), has been shown to be capable of producing chemically accurate predictions even for challenging molecular systems beyond the main group, with relatively low O(N3 − N4) cost and near-perfect parallel efficiency. Herein, we present our perspectives on the past, present, and future of the ph-AFQMC method. We focus on its potential in transition metal quantum chemistry to be a highly accurate, systematically improvable method that can reliably probe strongly correlated systems in biology and chemical catalysis and provide reference thermochemical values (for future development of density functionals or interatomic potentials) when experiments are either noisy or absent. Finally, we discuss the present limitations of the method and where we expect near-term development to be most fruitful.},

This result demonstrates the transferability of the map from TIP4P to TIP4P/2005 and TIP4P/Ice, meaning that one can choose an appropriate TIP4P-like model to calculate the vibrational spectra of an aqueous system without rebuilding the map.},

One of the most important challenges is the consideration of the role of amino acid sequence in forming the protein’s allosteric communication, including the mode and strength of the allosteric signal that is communicated to the regulated functional site. Here, we present the network-based model with a sequence dependence added in consideration of allosteric communication by combining the structure-based statistical mechanical model of allostery with the Miyazawa-Jernigan residue–residue potential. Applying the model in the analysis of five classical allosteric proteins, we found that it is necessary to consider the following two major determinants: (i) the free energy exerted by the allosteric site on the regulated one and (ii) the background (average) change in dynamics of the overall structure. We show that working together these two components determine the allosteric modulation, calling one to study their dependence on structures, oligomerization states, and sequence divergence in different proteins.},

  abstract = {A new implementation of the internally contracted multireference coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (icMRCCSD) method is presented. The new code employs an efficient tensor contraction kernel and can also avoid full four-external integral transformations, which significantly extends the scope of the applicability of icMRCCSD. The new implementation is currently restricted to the simple case of two active electrons in two orbitals and also supports the computation of spin-adapted doublet and triplet coupled-cluster wavefunctions. This contribution describes the basic approach for the automated derivation of working equations and benchmarks the current code against efficient implementations of standard methods, such as single-reference coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) and internally contracted multireference configuration interaction (icMRCI). Run times for linearized variants of icMRCCSD are only twice as long as comparable CCSD runs and similar to those of the icMRCI implementation, while non-linear terms of more complete variants of icMRCCSD lead to an order of magnitude longer computation times. Nevertheless, the new code allows for computations at larger scales than it was possible previously, with less demands on memory and disk-space resources. This is exemplified by numerical structure optimizations and harmonic force field determinations of NC2H5 isomers and the singlet and triplet states of m-benzyne. In addition, the exchange coupling of a dinuclear copper complex is determined. This work also defines a new commutator approximation for icMRCCSD, which includes all terms that are also present in the single-reference CCSD method, thus yielding a consistent pair of single-reference and multireference coupled-cluster methods.},

Conventional H2 detectors are based on the changes of physical properties of H2 probes induced by subsurface H-atoms to a material such as electrical conductivity. Herein, we report on highly reactive gasochromic H2 detectors based on the adsorption of H2 on the material surface. We prepared supraparticles (SPs) containing different types of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), silica NPs, and the dye resazurin by spray-drying and tested their performance for H2 detection. The material undergoes a distinct color change due to the hydrogenation of the purple resazurin to pink resorufin and, finally, colorless hydroresorufin. The stepwise transition is fast and visible to the naked eye. To further improve the performance of the sensor, we tested the reactivity of SPs with different catalytically active NPs by means of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). We show that the choice of the NP catalyst has a pronounced effect on the response of the H2 indicator. In addition, we demonstrate that the performance depends on the size of the NPs. These effects are attributed to the availability of reactive H-atoms on the NP surface. Among the materials studied, Pt-containing SPs gave the best results for H2 detection.},

Some of these possibilities include evaporative heat exchange systems using drops of saline water and new strategies for handling/processing waste brines. However, the practical limits of this effect using realistic, non-ideal source waters have yet to be explored. Here, we explore how the presence of various model aquatic contaminants (colloids, surfactants, and calcium salt) influences the self-ejection phenomena. Counterintuitively, we find that the addition of “contaminant” chemistries can enable ejection under conditions where ejection was not observed for waters containing only sodium chloride salt (e.g., from smooth hydrophobic surfaces), and that increased concentrations of both surfactants and colloids lead to longer ejection lengths. This result can be attributed to decreased crystallization nucleation time caused by the presence of other species in water.},

In this work, n-ZnO/β-InxGa2−xO3/p-GaN heterojunctions have been successfully formed using atomic layer deposition methods. We show that the doping of In can effectively tune the band edges of the heterojunctions. First-principle calculations reveal that the bandgap of bulk β-InxGa2−xO3 shrinks linearly with the increase in In contents, accompanied by an upward movement of the valence band maximum and a downward movement of the conduction band minimum. As the indium concentrations increase, the valence band offsets show an upward movement at both the InxGa2−xO3/GaN and ZnO/InxGa2−xO3 interfaces, while the conduction band offsets present different trends. A broad, reddish yellow-green emission appears after In doping, which verifies the effect of band alignment. What is more, we show that the amorphization of InxGa2−xO3 can play an important role in tuning the band edge. This work provides access to a series of band offsets tunable heterojunctions and can be used for the further design of direct white light-emitting diodes without any phosphors, based on this structure.},

  abstract = {In this study, near- and off-resonance Raman spectra of cadmium sulfide (CdS) quantum rods (NRs) and 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) adsorbed CdS NRs are reported. The envelopes of characteristic optical phonon modes in the near-resonance Raman spectrum of CdS NRs are deconvoluted by following the phonon confinement model. As compared with off-resonant Raman spectra, optical phonon modes scattering cross section is amplified significantly in near-resonance Raman spectra through the Fröhlich interaction. The Huang–Rhys factor defining the strength of the Fröhlich interaction is estimated (∼0.468). Moreover, the adsorption of different concentrations of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) onto CdS NRs produces surface strain in CdS NRs originating due to surface reconstruction and consequently blue and red shifts in off-resonance (514.5 nm) Raman spectra depending on the concentration of 4-MBA. These consequences are attributed to compressive and tensile strains, respectively. Relative to bulk CdS powder as the reference, strain in CdS NRs increases with decreasing 4-MBA concentrations. In off-resonance Raman spectra of 4-MBA adsorbed CdS NRs, the full width at half maxima of phonon modes (1-LO and 2-LO) and intensity ratio I2-LO/I1-LO increase with decreasing 4-MBA concentration.},

  abstract = {The electrochemically active lead dioxide (β-PbO2) contains the hydrogen (H) species inside the bulk and on the surface. The loss of the surface H species is proposed to be one of the factors in lead-acid battery failure. In this study, water adsorption on β-PbO2 has been investigated using theoretical approaches to reveal the chemical forms of the surface H species and identify a probable cause of H loss mechanisms. For the single water–β-PbO2, density functional theory (DFT) calculations present intact water molecular adsorption on β-PbO2 (100) and dissociative water adsorption on β-PbO2 (110), (101), and (001) surfaces. The geometric distances and the number of hydrogen bonds contribute to the adsorption energy reduction of single water adsorption. For the liquid water–β-PbO2 slab models, DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations observe that the surface lead sites are fully occupied by a hydroxyl group or intact water molecule, and some of the surface oxygens are protonated at 300 K. On the β-PbO2 (110) termination, dissociative water adsorption and intact molecular water adsorption occur competitively, leading to about 50\% dissociation of adsorbed water molecules. On the β-PbO2 (100), (101), and (001) terminations, the water molecules adsorb preferably in the dissociative form. The surface dependence of water dissociation is explored in terms of hydrogen bonding interactions relevant to adsorbed aqueous species. It is indicated through the Wulff crystal shape that the increase in the β-PbO2 crystallite size may be one of the H loss mechanisms associated with the electrochemically inactive β-PbO2.},

  abstract = {The present investigation assesses a variety of parameters available in the literature to model gold–water interfaces using molecular dynamics simulations. The study elucidates the challenges of characterizing the solid–liquid affinity of highly hydrophilic gold–water interfaces via wettability. As an alternative, the local pairwise interaction energy was used to describe the solid–liquid affinity of flat and curved surfaces, where for the latter, the calculation of a contact angle becomes virtually impossible. Regarding the heat transfer properties of different interface models (flat and curved), partly conclusive trends were observed between the total pairwise interaction energy and the thermal boundary conductance. It was observed that the solid surface structure, interfacial force field type, and force field parameters created a characteristic bias in the interfacial water molecules (liquid structuring). Consequently, a study of the liquid depletion layer provided better insight into the interfacial heat transfer among different interfaces. By computing the density depletion length, which describes the deficit or surplus of energy carries (water molecules) near the interface, a proper characterization of the thermal boundary conductance was obtained for the different gold–water interfaces. It was observed that the interfacial heat transfer is favored when the water molecules organize in cluster-like structures near the interface, by a surplus of water molecules at the interface, i.e., lower density depletion length, and by the closeness of water to the solid atoms.},

Dielectric saturation reminiscent of the bulk phase behavior is prevalent at very strong fields, whereas we observe a nonmonotonic permittivity dependence on the electric field at intermediate strengths where field-alignment and spontaneous polarization of interfacial water are of comparable magnitude. The coupling between the two effects results in distinct dielectric responses at opposite confinement walls. The normal component of both the differential dielectric constant and dielectric difference constant tensors averaged over the region closer to the wall under an incoming electric field (field pointing from the liquid to the solid phase) initially increases with the strength of the imposed field. The differential permittivity peaks at a field strength previously shown to offset the surface-induced orientation bias of hydration molecules at this wall. Further strengthening of the field results in a conventional saturation behavior. At the opposite wall (subject to outgoing field) and in the central region of the water slab, the nonlinear dielectric response resembles bulklike saturation. The conditions at the permittivity extremum coincide with the window of accelerated reorientation rates of interfacial water molecules under an incoming field we uncovered in earlier molecular dynamics analyses.},

  abstract = {Solvent extraction of trivalent rare earth metal ions by organophosphorus extractants proceeds via binding of phosphoric acid headgroups to the metal ion. Water molecules in the tightly bound first hydration shell of the metal ions must be displaced by oxygen atoms from phosphoric acid headgroups. Here, we use classical molecular dynamics simulations to explore the event in which a fully hydrated Er3+ binds to its first phosphoric acid headgroup. Approach of the headgroup into the region between the first and second hydration shells leads to a fast ejection of a water molecule that is accompanied by reordering of the hydration water molecules, including discretization of their angular positions and collective rotation about the metal ion. The water molecule ejected from the first shell is located diametrically opposite from the binding oxygen. Headgroup binding places a headgroup oxygen closer to Er3+ than its first hydration shell and creates a loosely bound water that subsequently exchanges between the first shell and its environment. This second exchange of water also occurs at discrete angular positions. This geometrical aspect of binding may be of relevance to understanding the binding and transport of ion–extractant complexes that are expected to occur at the organic–aqueous liquid–liquid interface used in solvent extraction processes.},

The resulting CμQMMD model was then applied to three ionic solutions (LiCl, NaCl, and KCl in water) at bulk solution concentrations ranging from 0.5 M to 6 M in contact with a charged graphene electrode. The new approach we are describing here provides a simulation protocol to control the concentration of electrolyte solutions while including the effects of a fully polarizable electrode surface. Thanks to this coupling, we are able to accurately model both the electrode and solution side of the double layer and provide a thorough analysis of the properties of electrolytes at charged interfaces, such as the screening ability of the electrolyte and the electrostatic potential profile. We also report the calculation of the integral electrochemical double layer capacitance in the whole range of concentrations analyzed for each ionic species, while the quantum mechanical simulations provide access to the differential and integral quantum capacitance. We highlight how subtle features, such as the adsorption of potassium graphene or the tendency of the ions to form clusters contribute to the ability of graphene to store charge, and suggest implications for desalination.},

The overpotential was reduced by all the BNNS modifications, and the smaller the size, the smaller the overpotential for ORR, i.e., the larger the ORR activity, in this size range. The overpotential was reduced by as much as ∼330 mV compared to a bare Au electrode by modifying the Au surface by the BNNS of the smallest size range (0.1–0.22 µm). The overpotential at this electrode was only 80 mV more than that at the Pt electrode. Both the rotation disk electrode experiments with Koutecky–Levich analysis and rotating ring disk electrode measurements showed that more than 80\% of oxygen is reduced to water via the four-electron process at this electrode. These results strongly suggest and theoretical density functional theory calculations support that the ORR active sites are located at the edges of BNNS islands adsorbed on Au(111). The decrease in size of BNNS islands results in an effective increase in the number of the catalytically active sites and, hence, in the increase in the catalytic activity of the BNNS/Au(111) system for ORR.},

In this study, we synthesize CdSe/CdS DIR nanocrystals, in which the position of the CdSe core particle can be controlled by using different ligand compositions during the CdS growth. Varying the core position within the DIR structure, e.g., from the center to the end of the DIR particles, results in a change in the degree of linear polarization. When the core is positioned at the center of the nanorod, the linear polarization turns out to be higher compared with tip-core DIRs. Time-resolved photoluminescence analysis reveals that the center-core DIRs have higher electron–hole interaction than tip-core DIRs because of weak uniaxial strain in center-core DIR that arises from lattice dislocations at the interface to relieve accumulated strain.},

  abstract = {As an important phase-change material, GeTe has many high-pressure phases as well, but its phase transitions under pressure are still lack of clarity. It is challenging to identify high-pressure GeTe crystal structures owing to the phase coexistence in a wide pressure range and the reversibility of phase transitions. Hence, first-principles calculations are required to provide further information in addition to limited experimental characterizations. In this work, a new orthorhombic Cmca GeTe high-pressure phase has been predicted via the CALYPSO method as the most energetically favorable phase in the pressure range between ∼30 and ∼38.5 GPa, which would update the GeTe high-pressure phase transition sequence. The crystal structure of the Cmca phase is composed of alternate stacking puckered layers of Ge six-membered rings and Te four-membered rings along the b direction. The high density of states near the Fermi level and delocalization of electrons from the two-dimensional electron localization function indicate a strong metallic property of the Cmca phase. Electron–phonon coupling calculations indicate that the Cmca phase is superconductive below ∼4.2 K at 35 GPa. The simulated x-ray diffraction pattern of the Cmca phase implies that this phase might coexist with the Pnma-boat phase under high pressure. These results offer further understanding on the high-pressure structural evolution and physical properties in GeTe and other IV–VI semiconductors.},

Surprisingly, the purely macroscopic theory is found to be in quantitative accord with the microscopic data, even for plate distances as small as 2 nm, whereas in extreme confinement (&lt;1.5 nm), the CNT approximations proved to be unsatisfactory.

  abstract = {Room temperature ionic liquids (RT-ILs) are promising electrolytes for electrocatalysis. Understanding the effects of the electrode–electrolyte interface structure on electrocatalysis in RT-ILs is important. Ultrafast mass transport of redox species in N-methyl-N-ethyl-pyrrolidinium polybromide (MEPBr2n+1) enabled evaluation of the reorganization energy (λ), which reflects the solvation structure in the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). λ was achieved by fitting the electron transfer rate-limited voltammogram at a Pt ultramicroelectrode (UME) to the Marcus–Hush–Chidsey model for heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics. However, it is time-consuming or even impossible to prepare electrode materials, including alloys of numerous compositions in the form of UME, for each experiment. Herein, we report a method to evaluate the λ of MEPBr2n+1 by scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), which allows high throughput electrochemical measurements using a single electrode with high spatial resolution. Fast mass transport in the nanosized SECCM tip is critical for achieving heterogeneous electron transfer-limited voltammograms. Furthermore, investigating λ on a high-entropy alloy materials library composed of Pt, Pd, Ru, Ir, and Ag suggests a negative correlation between λ and the work function. Given that the potential of zero charge correlates with the work function of electrodes, this can be attributed to the surface-charge sensitive ionic structure in the IHP of MEPBr2n+1, modulating the solvation energy of the redox-active species in the IHP.},

  abstract = {In recent years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting more and more attention. Although perovskite materials have high defect tolerance, defects remain the main factor that seriously affects the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Herein, the ionic liquid of 1-butyl, 3-methylimidazolium acetate ([BMIM][ACO]) was introduced into the SnO2/perovskite interface for the first time. Thanks to the dipoles formed by ILs spontaneously, the work function of SnO2 was reduced and the transport ability of carriers was improved as well. Moreover, the Lewis acidity and lone pair electrons of [BMIM][ACO] contribute to the passivation of I– defects, Pb2+ defects, or Pb-I anti site defects. In addition, the presence of dipoles will repel the approach of photogenerated holes and the reverse transport of electrons, reducing the recombination of defect sites through field-effect passivation. The solar cell with efficiency of 19.43\% was obtained under such a dual passivation effect, and the best device maintained 75.21\% of the initial efficiency after 80 h of continuous illumination.},

In this work, we investigated the thermally driven phase transition of perovskite (CsPbIxBr3−x), which was confirmed by electron diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy results. CsPbIxBr3−x transitioned from δ phase to α phase when heated, and the γ phase was obtained when the sample was cooled down. The γ phase was stable as long as it was isolated from humidity and air. A template matching-based data analysis method enabled visualization of the thermally driven phase evolution of perovskite during heating. We also proposed a possible atomic movement in the process of phase transition based on our in situ heating experimental data. The results presented here may improve our understanding of the thermally driven phase transition of perovskite as well as provide a protocol for big-data analysis of in situ experiments.},

  abstract = {In an oxidizing environment, the oxide formed on plutonium (Pu) metal is composed of a plutonium dioxide (PuO2) top layer and a thin cubic plutonium sesquioxide (Pu2O3) middle layer. In a reducing environment, the PuO2 layer auto-reduces to cubic Pu2O3. The speed and extent of this conversion depend on the combination of temperature and time. While PuO2 provides a strong diffusion barrier against unwanted Pu corrosion by gaseous species (like hydrogen), Pu2O3 does not, since its crystal structure has chains of oxygen vacancies. The kinetics of the PuO2 reduction are, therefore, of fundamental interest and enable researchers to better protect Pu from corrosion. In this report, the oxygen-diffusion-limited kinetics of the dioxide to sesquioxide conversion were obtained by dynamically heating a PuO2-covered Pu sample from 294 to 418 K in a high-vacuum vessel equipped with an in situ spectroscopic ellipsometer. The physical/chemical constraints in the conversion process were combined with the ellipsometry method of multi-sample analysis to track the percentage of PuO2 and to compute the extent of Pu2O3 formation. The resulting diffusion coefficients were compared against and then combined with complementary literature data to produce a comprehensive set of kinetic parameters for reliably modeling oxide conversion over a larger temperature range than spanned by prior studies. The extracted thermal activation energy barrier (43.7 kJ/mol) and pre-exponential factor (5.0 × 10−10 cm2/s) for the oxygen-diffusion-limited process can be used to accurately model the PuO2 to Pu2O3 transformation in vacuum and/or inert gas applications.},

When the phase switches from left-handed to right-handed chiral space group, more pronounced orbital angular momentum effects will be generated, where magneto-responsive optics are the opposite for chiral enantiomers. Moreover, circularly polarized light could enhance the chiral orbit of the crystal with the same spiral orientation to let spin have a better ability to resist external magnetic field. Thus, the magnetic field dependence of transmission and photoluminescence of chiral crystals are strongly dependent on the polarized state of incident light. Furthermore, by studying the coupling among spin, orbit, and circular photon, we obtained that the chiral orbit plays a key role in the coupling between the spin and circular photon. It is expected that this work could promote further exploration of organic chiral magneto-optical crystals in potential applications of sensing.},

  abstract = {The relationship between structure and dynamics in glassy fluids remains an intriguing open question. Recent work has shown impressive advances in our ability to predict local dynamics using structural features, most notably due to the use of advanced machine learning techniques. Here, we explore whether a simple linear regression algorithm combined with intelligently chosen structural order parameters can reach the accuracy of the current, most advanced machine learning approaches for predicting dynamic propensity. To achieve this, we introduce a method to pinpoint the cage state of the initial configuration—i.e., the configuration consisting of the average particle positions when particle rearrangement is forbidden. We find that, in comparison to both the initial state and the inherent state, the structure of the cage state is highly predictive of the long-time dynamics of the system. Moreover, by combining the cage state information with the initial state, we are able to predict dynamic propensities with unprecedentedly high accuracy over a broad regime of time scales, including the caging regime.},

  abstract = {The origin of β-relaxation in metallic glasses is still not fully understood, and the guidance of slow atoms for caged dynamics and β-relaxation is rarely mentioned. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal the bridging role of slow atoms on unusual caged dynamics and β-relaxation. In the stage of unusual caged dynamics, slow atoms are bounded by neighboring atoms. It is difficult for the slow atoms to break the cage, producing more high-frequency vibration, which causes more atoms to jump out of the cage randomly in the next stage. Precisely, the movement of the slow atoms changes from individual atoms vibrating inside the cage and gradually breaking out of the cage into a string-like pattern. The string-like collective atomic jumps cause decay of the cages, inducing β-relaxation. This situation generally exists in binary systems with the large atomic mass difference. This work offers valuable insights for understanding the role of slow atoms in unusual caged dynamics and β-relaxation, complementing studies on the origin of β-relaxation in metallic glasses and their glass-forming liquids.},

  abstract = {The vibrational dynamics of the NO stretching mode of [RuCl5(NO)]2− in D2O were investigated by nonlinear infrared (IR) spectroscopy. We performed IR pump–probe measurements to obtain the vibrational lifetime of this molecule. The lifetime is 31 ps, which is sufficiently long enough to study the vibrational frequency fluctuation on a slower time scale with high precision. By two-dimensional IR spectroscopy, the frequency–frequency time correlation function (FFTCF) of the NO stretching mode was characterized with a delta function plus a double-exponential function. The time constant of the slower component was ∼10 ps. We also found that the time constant does not strongly depend on temperature. In order to investigate the microscopic origin of this component, we performed classical molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that the hydration structure around the NO group was influenced by the negatively charged Cl ligands. To calculate the FFTCF decay, we employed an approximate theoretical model based on the vibrational solvatochromism theory. It was demonstrated that water fluctuations around the Cl ligands projected on the NO group correspond to the 10 ps decay component in the FFTCF. The fluctuation is related to the orientational dynamics of the water molecules attracted by the Cl ligands. By comparing the FFTCF parameters of the present solute with those of previously reported metal complexes and SCN− in D2O, we conclude that the presence of different electrostatic environments around the vibrational probe and the other interaction sites of the solute is important for understanding the slow decay component in the FFTCFs.},

Water represents an ideal investigation case to unfold these general aspects, and, across the decades, it has been the focus of thorough scrutiny. Despite this investigative effort, the spectrum of terahertz density fluctuations of water largely remains a puzzle for condensed matter physicists. To unravel it, we compare previous scattering measurements of water spectra with new ones on ice. Owing to the unique asset of Bayesian inference, we draw a more detailed portrayal of the phonon response of ice.

The rigid model can assume the Model’s Geometry (MG) as if the molecule is not interacting with any other molecules or the ensemble averaged geometry (EG) under a particular thermodynamic condition. Although the MG model is more straightforward to create, it leads to relatively poor performance. The EG model behaves similarly to the corresponding flexible model (the FL model) and, in some cases, agrees even better with experiments. While the difference between the EG and the FL models is mostly a result of flexibility, the MG and EG models have different dipole moments as a result of an effective induction in the condensed phase. For the three water models studied, the property that shows the most difference is the temperature dependence of density. The MG version of the water model by adaptive force matching for ice and liquid does not possess a temperature of maximum density, which is attributed to a downshift of the putative liquid–liquid phase transition line, leading to the hypothesized second critical point of liquid water to manifest at negative pressure. A new three-phase coexistence method for determining the melting temperature of ice is also presented.},

  abstract = {Computational predictions of the polymorphic outcomes of a crystallization process, referred to as polymorph selection, can accelerate the process development for manufacturing solid products with targeted properties. Polymorph selection requires understanding the interplay between the thermodynamic and kinetic factors that drive nucleation. Moreover, post-nucleation events, such as crystal growth and polymorphic transformation, can affect the resulting crystal structures. Here, the nucleation kinetics of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid from the melt is investigated with a focus on the competition between FCC and HCP crystal structures. Both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and 2D free energy calculations reveal that polymorph selection occurs not during nucleation but when the cluster sizes exceed the critical cluster size. This result contrasts with the classical nucleation mechanism, where each polymorph is assumed to nucleate independently as an ideal bulk-like cluster, comprised only of its given structure. Using the 2D free energy surface and the MD simulation-derived diffusion coefficients, a structure-dependent nucleation rate is estimated, which agrees with the rate obtained from brute force MD simulations. Furthermore, a comprehensive population balance modeling (PBM) approach for polymorph selection is proposed. The PBM combines the calculated nucleation rate with post-nucleation kinetics while accounting for the structural changes of the clusters after nucleation. When applied to the LJ system, the PBM predicts with high accuracy the polymorphic distribution found in a population of crystals generated from MD simulations. Due to the non-classical nucleation mechanism of the LJ system, post-nucleation kinetic events are crucial in determining the structures of the grown crystals.},

A CO2 laser was used for heating the H2O sample directly in order to reduce the risk of chemical reactions. The melting was identified based on the appearance of the Brillouin peaks derived from the liquid phase. The longitudinal wave velocity (Vp) of the liquid phase along the melting curve exhibits a smooth increase with pressure. The melting temperature of H2O shows no kink previously reported but a monotonic increase between 26 and 54 GPa. Present melting data suggest that the melting occurs from body-centered-cubic superionic phase in the pressure-temperature range investigated.},

  abstract = {Shear and bulk viscosities of liquid water and argon are evaluated from first-principles in the density functional theory (DFT) framework, by performing molecular dynamics simulations in the NVE ensemble and using the Kubo–Greenwood equilibrium approach. The standard DFT functional is corrected in such a way to allow for a reasonable description of van der Waals effects. For liquid argon, the thermal conductivity has been also calculated. Concerning liquid water, to our knowledge, this is the first estimate of the bulk viscosity and of the shear-viscosity/bulk-viscosity ratio from first-principles. By analyzing our results, we can conclude that our first-principles simulations, performed at a nominal average temperature of 366 to guarantee that the systems are liquid-like, actually describe the basic dynamical properties of liquid water at about 330 K. In comparison with liquid water, the normal, monatomic liquid Ar is characterized by a much smaller bulk-viscosity/shear-viscosity ratio (close to unity) and this feature is well reproduced by our first-principles approach, which predicts a value of the ratio in better agreement with experimental reference data than that obtained using the empirical Lennard-Jones potential. The computed thermal conductivity of liquid argon is also in good agreement with the experimental value.},

  abstract = {Isomorphs are lines on a fluid or solid phase diagram along which the microstructure is invariant on affine density scaling of the molecular coordinates. Only inverse power (IP) and hard sphere potential systems are perfectly isomorphic. This work provides new theoretical tools and criteria to determine the extent of deviation from perfect isomorphicity for other pair potentials using the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system as a test case. A simple prescription for predicting isomorphs in the fluid range using the freezing line as a reference is shown to be quite accurate for the LJ system. The shear viscosity and self-diffusion coefficient scale well are calculated using this method, which enables comments on the physical significance of the correlations found previously in the literature to be made. The virial–potential energy fluctuation and the concept of an effective IPL system and exponent, n′, are investigated, particularly with reference to the LJ freezing and melting lines. It is shown that the exponent, n′, converges to the value 12 at a high temperature as ∼T−1/2, where T is the temperature. Analytic expressions are derived for the density, temperature, and radius derivatives of the radial distribution function along an isomorph that can be used in molecular simulation. The variance of the radial distribution function and radial fluctuation function are shown to be isomorph invariant.},

  abstract = {The most accepted origin for the water anomalous behavior is the phase transition between two liquids (LLPT) in the supercooled regime connected to the glassy first order phase transition at lower temperatures. Two length scale potentials are an effective approach that has long been employed to understand the properties of fluids with waterlike anomalies and, more recently, the behavior of colloids and nanoparticles. These potentials can be parameterized to have distinct shapes, as a pure repulsive ramp, such as the model proposed by de Oliveira et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 124, 64901 (2006)]. This model has waterlike anomalies despite the absence of LLPT. To unravel how the waterlike anomalies are connected to the solid phases, we employ molecular dynamics simulations. We have analyzed the fluid–solid transition under cooling, with two solid crystalline phases, BCC and HCP, and two amorphous regions being observed. We show how the competition between the scales creates an amorphous cluster in the BCC crystal that leads to amorphization at low temperatures. A similar mechanism is found in the fluid phase, with the system changing from a BCC-like to an amorphous-like structure in the point where a maxima in kT is observed. With this, we can relate the competition between two fluid structures with the amorphous clusterization in the BCC phase. These findings help to understand the origins of waterlike behavior in systems without the liquid–liquid critical point.},

The comparison of our simulated magnetic-dipole spectrum with available laboratory taken data also requires the knowledge of line intensities in the quadrupole band, which partially overlaps with that magnetic-dipole. Quadrupole intensities, once reconsidered, are permitted to correct previously reported values of the integrated intensity as well as the intensity of selected branches.

It has been estimated to be competitive with environment-independent photorecombination, but its general relevance has yet to be established. Here, we evaluate the capability of alkali and alkaline earth metal cations to capture a free electron by assistance from a nearby water molecule. We introduce a characteristic distance rIC for this energy transfer mechanism in equivalence to the Förster radius. Our results show that water-assisted electron capture dominates over photorecombination beyond the second hydration shell of each cation for electron energies above a threshold. The assisted capture reaches distances equivalent to a fifth to seventh solvation shell for the studied cations. The far reach of the assisted electron capture is of significant general interest to the broad spectrum of research fields dealing with low-energy electrons, in particular radiation-induced damage of biomolecules. The here introduced distance measure will enable quantification of the role of the environment for assisted electron attachment.},

We have identified a large number of Feshbach resonances, some of them previously unknown, in the region between 12.2 and 18.7 eV, for which we provide energy positions and widths. Many of these resonances lead to pronounced peaks in the photoionization spectra, some of them remarkably wide (up to 0.2 eV, for resonances converging to the third ionization threshold), which should be observable in high-energy resolution experiments. We show that, in the vicinity of these peaks, both asymmetry parameters and MFPADs vary very rapidly with photoelectron energy, which, as in atoms and simpler molecules, reflects the interference between direct ionization and autoionization, which is mostly driven by electron correlation.},

  abstract = {Characterization of the inner-shell decay processes in molecules containing heavy elements is key to understanding x-ray damage of molecules and materials and for medical applications with Auger-electron-emitting radionuclides. The 1s hole states of heavy atoms can be produced by absorption of tunable x rays and the resulting vacancy decays characterized by recording emitted photons, electrons, and ions. The 1s hole states in heavy elements have large x-ray fluorescence yields that transfer the hole to intermediate electron shells that then decay by sequential Auger-electron transitions that increase the ion’s charge state until the final state is reached. In molecules, the charge is spread across the atomic sites, resulting in dissociation to energetic atomic ions. We have used x-ray/ion coincidence spectroscopy to measure charge states and energies of Iq+ and Brq′+ atomic ions following 1s ionization at the I and Br K-edges of IBr. We present the charge states and kinetic energies of the two correlated fragment ions associated with core-excited states produced during the various steps of the cascades. To understand the dynamics leading to the ion data, we develop a computational model that combines Monte-Carlo/Molecular-Dynamics (MC/MD) simulations with a classical over-the-barrier model to track inner-shell cascades and redistribution of electrons in valence orbitals and nuclear motion of fragments.},

The molecule is of interest to astrochemistry and astrobiology as a potential precursor of prebiotic molecules. Synchrotron radiation was used as the photon source. Dispersive photoelectron spectra were recorded from 10 to 22 eV, covering four band systems in the HCNO cation, and an ionization energy of 10.83 eV was determined. Transitions into the Renner–Teller distorted X+2Π state of the cation were simulated using wavepacket dynamics based on a vibronic coupling Hamiltonian. Very good agreement between experiment and theory is obtained. While the first excited state of the cation shows only a broad and unstructured spectrum, the next two higher states exhibit a well-resolved vibrational progression. Transitions into the excited electronic states of HCNO+ were not simulated due to the large number of electronic states that contribute to these transitions. Nevertheless, a qualitative assignment is given, based on the character of the orbitals involved in the transitions. The dissociative photoionization was investigated by photoelectron–photoion coincidence spectroscopy. The breakdown diagram shows evidence for isomerization from HCNO+ to HNCO+ on the cationic potential energy surface. Zero Kelvin appearance energies for the daughter ions HCO+ and NCO+ have been derived.},

By using the adiabatic hyperspherical method, we have considered not only total angular momentum J = 0 but also J &gt; 0 in the ultracold collision energies (E = 0.01 − 100 mK × kB). It is found that 4He2 (l = 0) is the major product after the TBR process in the ultracold limit (E ≤ 0.1 mK × kB). The TBR rate into 4He2 (l = 0) is nearly one order of magnitude larger than the sum of the other three products, 4He20Ne (l = 0, 1, 2). Moreover, the CID rates for the three 4He20Ne (l = 0, 1, 2) + 4He initial states are close to each other and are smaller than that for the 4He2 (l = 0) + 20Ne initial state. Additionally, we have, for the first time, performed the channel-resolved scattering calculation that can explain the above-mentioned findings quantitatively.},

We reveal the quasiparticle properties, such as energies, quasiparticle weights, and spectral functions, and show that our ansatz yields a persistent decrease in the impurity’s rotational constant due to many-body dressing, which is consistent with experimental observations. From our study, a picture of the angulon emerges as an effective spin interacting with a magnetic field that is self-consistently generated by the molecule’s rotation. Moreover, we discuss rotational spectroscopy, which focuses on the response of rotating molecules to a laser perturbation in the linear response regime. Importantly, we take into account initial-state interactions that have been neglected in prior studies and reveal their impact on the excitation spectrum. To examine the angulon instability regime, we use a single-excitation ansatz and obtain results consistent with experiments, in which a broadening of spectral lines is observed while phonon wings remain highly suppressed due to initial-state interactions.},

  abstract = {Allostery in proteins involves, broadly speaking, ligand-induced conformational transitions that modulate function at active sites distal to where the ligand binds. In contrast, the concept of cooperativity (in the sense used in phase transition theory) is often invoked to understand protein folding and, therefore, function. The modern view on allostery is one based on dynamics and hinges on the time-dependent interactions between key residues in a complex network, interactions that determine the free-energy profile for the reaction at the distal site. Here, we merge allostery and cooperativity, and we discuss a joint model with features of both. In our model, the active-site reaction is replaced by the reaction pathway that leads to protein folding, and the presence or absence of the effector is replaced by mutant-vs-wild type changes in key residues. To this end, we employ our recently introduced time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) correlation approach [Ray et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 118(43) (2021), e2100943118] to identify the allosteric role of distant residues in the folded-state dynamics of a large protein. In this work, we apply the technique to identify key residues that have a significant role in the folding of a small, fast folding-protein, chignolin. Using extensive enhanced sampling simulations, we critically evaluate the accuracy of the predictions by mutating each residue one at a time and studying how the mutations change the underlying free energy landscape of the folding process. We observe that mutations in those residues whose associated backbone torsion angles have a high correlation score can indeed lead to loss of stability of the folded configuration. We also provide a rationale based on interaction energies between individual residues with the rest of the protein to explain this effect. From these observations, we conclude that the tICA correlation score metric is a useful tool for predicting the role of individual residues in the correlated dynamics of proteins and can find application to the problem of identifying regions of protein that are either most vulnerable to mutations or—mutatis mutandis—to binding events that affect their functionality.},

  abstract = {Iterative diagonalization of large matrices to search for a subset of eigenvalues that may be of interest has become routine throughout the field of quantum chemistry. Lanczos and Davidson algorithms hold a monopoly, in particular, owing to their excellent performance on diagonally dominant matrices. However, if the eigenvalues happen to be clustered inside overlapping Gershgorin disks, the convergence rate of both strategies can be noticeably degraded. In this work, we show how Davidson, Jacobi–Davidson, Lanczos, and preconditioned Lanczos correction vectors can be formulated using the reduced partitioning procedure, which takes advantage of the inherent flexibility promoted by Brillouin–Wigner perturbation (BW-PT) theory’s resolvent operator. In doing so, we establish a connection between various preconditioning definitions and the BW-PT resolvent operator. Using Natural Localized Molecular Orbitals (NLMOs) to construct Configuration Interaction Singles (CIS) matrices, we study the impact the preconditioner choice has on the convergence rate for these comparatively dense matrices. We find that an attractive by-product of preconditioning the Lanczos algorithm is that the preconditioned variant only needs 21\%–35\% and 54\%–61\% of matrix-vector operations to extract the lowest energy solution of several Hartree–Fock- and NLMO-based CIS matrices, respectively. On the other hand, the standard Davidson preconditioning definition seems to be generally optimal in terms of requisite matrix-vector operations.},

  abstract = {The adaptively compressed exchange (ACE) operator combined with interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) decomposition has been utilized to accelerate plane-wave hybrid functional calculations for restricted Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT), but the neglect of spin degree of freedom has limited its application in the exploration of systems where the spin property of the electron is critical. Herein, we derive the ACE-ISDF formulation for hybrid functional calculations in both unrestricted and noncollinear spin DFT with plane waves and periodic boundary conditions. We proposed an improved ISDF algorithm for the sum of Kohn–Sham orbital pairs to further reduce the computational cost for the spin-noncollinear case. Numerical results demonstrate that these improved ACE-ISDF low-rank approximations can not only significantly reduce the computational time by two orders of magnitude compared with conventional plane-wave hybrid functional calculations but also lead to a good convergence behavior when a moderate rank parameter is set, even for complex periodic magnetic systems. By using these ACE-ISDF approximations, we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of two-dimensional periodic ferromagnetic semiconductors consisting of triangular zigzag graphene quantum dots and transition metal atoms. Our computational results showcase that hybrid functional calculations in spin DFT can provide not only accurate electronic structures but also accurate magnetic order temperature of ferromagnetic semiconductors compared to local or semilocal functional calculations.},

To locate the minimum of the Rayleigh quotient, each iteration is to seek the lowest eigenpairs in a subspace spanned by the current wave function and its gradient of the Rayleigh-quotient as well as the upcoming higher-order residual. Consequently, as the upcoming errors can be introduced and circumvented with the search in the higher-order residual, a concomitant improved performance in terms of number of iterations, convergence rate, and total elapsed time is very significant. The correlation energy components obtained with the original residual are corrected with the higher-order residual application, satisfying the correlation virial theorem with much improved accuracy. The comparison with the original residual, the higher-order residual significantly improves the electron binding, favoring the localization of electrons’ distribution, revealed with the increasing peak of the distribution and correlation function and the reduced interelectron distance and its angle.},

  abstract = {This work presents an extension of the projector operator embedding scheme of Manby et al. [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 8, 2564 (2012)] in a multicomponent (MC) framework. Here, a molecular system containing electrons and other types of quantum species is divided into a wavefunction (WF) subsystem of interest and a density functional theory (DFT) environment. The WF-in-DFT partition decreases computational costs by partially truncating the WF subsystem basis set at the cost of introducing a controllable embedding error. To explore the applicability of the MC extension, third-order propagator-in-DFT calculations were performed for positron–anion complexes for alkoxides and carboxylates with carbon chains of different sizes. For these systems, it was found that selecting a WF subsystem with the positron and only the oxygen atoms caused an error of 0.1 eV or lower in positron-binding energies, while reducing between 33\% and 55\% the basis set size. The reduction of computational costs achieved with the embedding scheme allowed us to improve molecular positron-binding energy predictions by performing complete basis set limit extrapolations. Combining the WF-in-DFT embedding and the complete basis set extrapolation, positronium aliphatic alkoxides were predicted to be energetically stable by 0.3 eV with respect to Ps emission. Similarly, positronium carboxylates, both aromatic and aliphatic, were predicted to be stable by 1.3 eV.},

  abstract = {In this work, we derive a multi-fragment real-time extension of the projected density matrix embedding theory (pDMET) designed to treat non-equilibrium electron dynamics in strongly correlated systems. As in the previously developed static pDMET, the real time pDMET partitions the total system into many fragments; the coupling between each fragment and the rest of the system is treated through a compact representation of the environment in terms of a quantum bath. The real-time pDMET involves simultaneously propagating the wavefunctions for each separate fragment–bath embedding system along with an auxiliary mean-field wavefunction of the total system. The equations of motion are derived by (i) projecting the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in the fragment and bath space associated with each separate fragment and by (ii) enforcing the pDMET matching conditions between the global 1-particle reduced density matrix (1-RDM) obtained from the fragment calculations and the mean-field 1-RDM at all points in time. The accuracy of the method is benchmarked through comparisons to time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group and time-dependent Hartree–Fock (TDHF) theory; the methods were applied to a one- and two-dimensional single-impurity Anderson model and multi-impurity Anderson models with ordered and disordered distributions of the impurities. The results demonstrate a large improvement over TDHF and rapid convergence to the exact dynamics with an increase in fragment size. Our results demonstrate that the real-time pDMET is a promising and flexible method that balances accuracy and efficiency to simulate the non-equilibrium electron dynamics in heterogeneous systems of large size.},

  abstract = {The operational stability is a current bottleneck facing the quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). In particular, the device working around turn-on voltage suffers from unbalanced charge injection and heavy power loss. Here, we investigate the operational stability of red emissive CdSe QLEDs operated at different applied voltages. Compared to the rising luminance at higher voltages, the device luminance quickly decreases when loaded around the turn-on voltage, but recovers after unloading or slight heat treatment, which is termed fatigue effects of operational QLED. The electroluminescence and photoluminescence spectra before and after a period of operation at low voltages show that the abrupt decrease in device luminance derives from the reduction of quantum yield in quantum dots. Combined with transient photoluminescence and electroluminescence measurements, as well as equivalent circuit model analysis, the electron accumulation in quantum dots mainly accounts for the observed fatigue effects of a QLED during the operation around turn-on voltage. The underlying mechanisms at the low-voltage working regime will be very helpful for the industrialization of QLED.},

One well studied feature is the excess low-frequency density of states over the Debye model prediction. Here, we examine the system size dependence of the density of states for two-dimensional glasses. For systems of fewer than 100 particles, the density of states scales with the system size as if all the modes were plane-wave-like. However, for systems greater than 100 particles, we find a different system-size scaling of the cumulative density of states below the first transverse sound mode frequency, which can be derived from the assumption that these modes are quasi-localized. Moreover, for systems greater than 100 particles, we find that the cumulative density of states scales with the frequency as a power law with the exponent that leads to the exponent β = 3.5 for the density of states. For systems whose sizes were investigated, we do not see a size-dependence of exponent β .},

For Mb, several internal cavities (Xe1 through Xe4) were observed experimentally and they were linked to ligand storage. The present work determines barriers for xenon diffusion and relative stabilization energies for the ligand in the initial and final pocket, linking a transition depending on the occupancy state of the remaining pockets from both biased and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the energetics of a particular ligand migration pathway may depend on the direction in which the transition is followed and the occupancy state of the other cavities. Furthermore, the barrier height for a particular transition can depend in a non-additive fashion on the occupancy of either cavity A or B or simultaneous population of both cavities, A and B. Multiple repeats for the Xe1 → Xe2 transition reveal that the activation barrier is a distribution of barrier heights rather than one single value, which is confirmed by a distribution of transition times for the same transition from unbiased simulations. Dynamic cross correlation maps demonstrate that correlated motions occur between adjacent residues or through space, residue Phe138 is found to be a gate for the Xe1 → Xe2 transition, and the volumes of the internal cavities vary along the diffusion pathway, indicating that there is dynamic communication between the ligand and the protein. These findings suggest that Mb is an allosteric protein.},

  abstract = {The nanomachine from the ATPases associated with various cellular activities superfamily, called spastin, severs microtubules during cellular processes. To characterize the functionally important allostery in spastin, we employed methods from evolutionary information, to graph-based networks, to machine learning applied to atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of spastin in its monomeric and the functional hexameric forms, in the presence or absence of ligands. Feature selection, using machine learning approaches, for transitions between spastin states recognizes all the regions that have been proposed as allosteric or functional in the literature. The analysis of the composition of the Markov State Model macrostates in the spastin monomer, and the analysis of the direction of change in the top machine learning features for the transitions, indicate that the monomer favors the binding of ATP, which primes the regions involved in the formation of the inter-protomer interfaces for binding to other protomer(s). Allosteric path analysis of graph networks, built based on the cross-correlations between residues in simulations, shows that perturbations to a hub specific for the pre-hydrolysis hexamer propagate throughout the structure by passing through two obligatory regions: the ATP binding pocket, and pore loop 3, which connects the substrate binding site to the ATP binding site. Our findings support a model where the changes in the terminal protomers due to the binding of ligands play an active role in the force generation in spastin. The secondary structures in spastin, which are found to be highly degenerative within the network paths, are also critical for feature transitions of the classification models, which can guide the design of allosteric effectors to enhance or block allosteric signaling.},

  abstract = {Proteolysis is essential for the control of metabolic pathways and the cell cycle. Bacterial caseinolytic proteases (Clp) use peptidase components, such as ClpP, to degrade defective substrate proteins and to regulate cellular levels of stress-response proteins. To ensure selective degradation, access to the proteolytic chamber of the double–ring ClpP tetradecamer is controlled by a critical gating mechanism of the two axial pores. The binding of conserved loops of the Clp ATPase component of the protease or small molecules, such as acyldepsipeptide (ADEP), at peripheral ClpP ring sites, triggers axial pore opening through dramatic conformational transitions of flexible N-terminal loops between disordered conformations in the “closed” pore state and ordered hairpins in the “open” pore state. In this study, we probe the allosteric communication underlying these conformational changes by comparing residue–residue couplings in molecular dynamics simulations of each configuration. Both principal component and normal mode analyses highlight large-scale conformational changes in the N-terminal loop regions and smaller amplitude motions of the peptidase core. Community network analysis reveals a switch between intra- and inter-protomer coupling in the open–closed pore transition. Allosteric pathways that connect the ADEP binding sites to N-terminal loops are rewired in this transition, with shorter network paths in the open pore configuration supporting stronger intra- and inter-ring coupling. Structural perturbations, either through the removal of ADEP molecules or point mutations, alter the allosteric network to weaken the coupling.},

Due to its coarse-grained nature, the BFM is employed to understand the universal properties of polymers. Solvent effects are often mediated by explicit solvent particles, while implicit solvent models have had limited use as they may lead to frozen states and, thus, ergodicity-related problems. In simulation setups, such as coagulated multiple homopolymers chains, explicit solvent models are computationally expensive because the region of interest can be localized in a small space compared to the dimension of the periodic box. We introduce an implicit solvent model based on an artificial neural network (NN) that was trained with BFM simulation data for single homopolymers in an explicit solvent. We demonstrate that NN-based simulations that take into account only the information of the local environment of monomers reproduce the expected universal macroscopic properties of the polymer under varying solvent conditions. The homopolymer chains simulated using the NN reproduce the coil–globule transition, the static and dynamic bond autocorrelation, and the mean square displacement of chain monomers. We show that the learned parameters from a single chain system can be transferred to a system containing multiple homopolymers, indicating that the learned parameters are transferable to considerably different systems.},

  abstract = {Micro- and nano-swimmers, moving in a fluid solvent confined by structures that produce entropic barriers, are often described by overdamped active Brownian particle dynamics, where viscous effects are large and inertia plays no role. However, inertial effects should be considered for confined swimmers moving in media where viscous effects are no longer dominant. Here, we study how inertia affects the rectification and diffusion of self-propelled particles in a two-dimensional, asymmetric channel. We show that most of the particles accumulate at the channel walls as the masses of the particles increase. Furthermore, the average particle velocity has a maximum as a function of the mass, indicating that particles with an optimal mass M op * can be sorted from a mixture with particles of other masses. In particular, we find that the effective diffusion coefficient exhibits an enhanced diffusion peak as a function of the mass, which is a signature of the accumulation of most of the particles at the channel walls. The dependence of M op * on the rotational diffusion rate, self-propulsion force, aspect ratio of the channel, and active torque is also determined. The results of this study could stimulate the development of strategies for controlling the diffusion of self-propelled particles in entropic ratchet systems.},

  abstract = {Predicting the mechanical response of soft gel materials under external deformation is of paramount importance in many areas, such as foods, pharmaceuticals, solid–liquid separations, cosmetics, aerogels, and drug delivery. Most of the understanding of the elasticity of gel materials is based on the concept of fractal scaling with very few microscopic insights. Previous experimental observations strongly suggest that the gel material loses the fractal correlations upon deformation and the range of packing fraction up to which the fractal scaling can be applied is very limited. In addition, correctly implementing the fractal modeling requires identifying the elastic backbone, which is a formidable task. So far, there is no clear understanding of the gel’s elasticity at high packing fractions or the correct length scale that governs its mechanical response. In this work, we undertake extensive numerical simulations to elucidate the different aspects of stress transmission in gel materials. We observe the existence of two percolating networks of compressive and tensile normal forces close to the gel point. We also find that the probability distribution for the compressive and tensile parts normalized by their respective mean shows a universal behavior irrespective of various values of interaction potential and thermal energy and different particle size distributions. Interestingly, there are also a large number of contacts with zero normal force, and, consequently, a peak in the normal force distribution is observed at f n ≈ 0 even at higher pressures. We also identify the critical internal state parameters, such as the mean normal force, force anisotropies, and the average coordination number, and propose simple constitutive relations that relate different components of stress to internal state parameters. The agreement between our model prediction and the simulation observation is excellent. It is shown that the anisotropy in the force networks gives rise to the normal stress difference in soft gel materials. Our results strongly demonstrate that the mechanical response of the gel system is governed mainly by the particle length scale phenomena, with a complex interplay between the compressive and tensile forces at the particle contact.},

Although the interface’s structure changed depending on the magnitude of the interfacial tension, the interface was stable even under conditions where the interfacial tension was virtually zero. The Fourier spectrum of the fluctuations of the surface structure showed a crossover from q 2 to q 4 when the interfacial tension was almost zero, where q is the wavenumber. This crossover means that the bending rigidity is dominant for the restoring force when the surfactant molecules are sufficiently absorbed on the interface and the interfacial tension is almost zero, whereas the interfacial tension is dominant when the interfacial tension is a finite value.},

Physics engines supporting automatic differentiation have simpler code, accelerating the development process and reducing the maintenance burden. Furthermore, fully differentiable simulation tools enable direct evaluation of challenging derivatives—including those directly related to properties measurable by experiment—that are conventionally computed with finite difference methods. Here, we investigate automatic differentiation in the context of orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) simulations of materials, introducing PROFESS-AD. Its automatic evaluation of properties derived from first derivatives, including functional potentials, forces, and stresses, facilitates the development and testing of new density functionals, while its direct evaluation of properties requiring higher-order derivatives, such as bulk moduli, elastic constants, and force constants, offers more concise implementations than conventional finite difference methods. For these reasons, PROFESS-AD serves as an excellent prototyping tool and provides new opportunities for OFDFT.},

We then extended the calculation to investigate how graphene oxide alters the dynamical and relaxation properties of water in different conditions and concentrations. We show that, despite the diamagnetic nature of the graphene oxide, the confining effects of the bilayers strongly affect the longitudinal relaxation properties of interfacial water, which presents a reduced dynamics due to hydrogen bonds with oxygen groups on graphene oxide. This property makes graphene oxide an interesting platform to investigate water dynamics in confined geometries and an alternative contrast-agent for magnetic resonance imaging applications, especially in view of the possibility to functionalize graphene oxide from theranostic perspectives.},

  abstract = {For sessile droplets of pure liquid on a surface, evaporation depends on surface wettability, the surrounding environment, contact angle hysteresis, and surface roughness. For non-pure liquids, the evaporation characteristics are further complicated by the constituents and impurities within the droplet. For saline solutions, this complication takes the form of a modified partial vapor pressure/water activity caused by the increasing salt concentration as the aqueous solvent evaporates. It is generally thought that droplets on surfaces will crystallize when the saturation concentration is reached, i.e., 26.3\% for NaCl in water. This crystallization is initiated by contact with the surface and is thus due to surface roughness and heterogeneities. Recently, smooth, low contact angle hysteresis surfaces have been created by molecular grafting of polymer chains. In this work, we hypothesize that by using these very smooth surfaces to evaporate saline droplets, we can suppress the crystallization caused by the surface interactions and thus achieve constant volume droplets above the saturation concentration. In our experiments, we used several different surfaces to examine the possibility of crystallization suppression. We show that on polymer grafted surfaces, i.e., Slippery Omniphobic Covalently Attached Liquid-like (SOCAL) and polyethyleneglycol(PEGylated) surfaces, we can achieve stable droplets as low as 55\% relative humidity at 25 °C with high reproducibility using NaCl in water solutions. We also show that it is possible to achieve stable droplets above the saturation concentration on other surfaces, including superhydrophobic surfaces. We present an analytical model, based on water activity, which accurately describes the final stable volume as a function of the initial salt concentration. These findings are important for heat and mass transfer in relatively low humidity environments.},

After modification with AZB, the surface of the Ti-MOF film became rough and evolved from a hemispherical structure to a petal-like structure; a large pore size and small specific surface area accompanied the evolution of the surface morphology. The AZB@Ti-MOF film COWG exhibited a positive response to EDA gas co-existing with the same concentration (1000 ppm) of benzenes, amines, and acidic gases. It is postulated that charge transfer occurs when the AZB@Ti-MOF film COWG adsorbs EDA gas, leading to significant strengthening of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds as EDA works as an electron donor. Incomplete or prolonged EDA desorption from the film surface at room temperature resulted in a decrease in the surface sensitivity of the COWG AZB@Ti-MOF film. The kinetics of EDA adsorption were examined using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic models. The EDA adsorption kinetics fit well with the PSO model. As measured at room temperature, the adsorption capacity (q e ) per unit surface of the AZB@Ti-MOF films was 46.50 × 10 −2 µ g·cm −2 .},

However, they still suffer from critical issues such as polysulfide shuttling, which inhibit them from commercialization. In this work, using first-principles methods, we investigated the cluster formation of soluble Na 2 S 8 molecules, the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC), and the role of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive in the solid electrolyte interphase formation on the Na anode. The clustering of Na 2 S 8 in an EC solvent is found to be more favorable than in a PC solvent. In the presence of an electron-rich Na (001) surface, EC decomposition undergoes a two-electron transfer reaction with a barrier of 0.19 eV for a ring-opening process, whereas PC decomposition is difficult on the same surface. Although the reaction kinetics of an FEC ring opening in the EC and PC solvents are quite similar, the reaction mechanisms of the open FEC are found to be different in each solvent, although both lead to the production of NaF on the surface. The thick NaF layers reduce the extent of charge transfer to Na 2 S 8 at the anode/electrolyte interface, thus decelerating the Na 2 S 8 decomposition reaction. Our results provide an atomistic insight into the interfacial phenomena between the Na-metal anode surface and electrolyte media.},

Herein, by using surface Pourbaix analysis, we show that many electrocatalytically active transition metal X-ides (e.g., oxides, nitrides, carbides, and hydroxides) tend to possess the surface states different from their pristine stoichiometric forms under the pH and potential of interest due to water dissociation or generation. Summarizing the density functional theory calculated surface Pourbaix diagrams of 14 conditionally stable transition metal X-ide materials, we found that some of these surfaces tend to be covered by O-containing adsorbates at a moderate or high potential, while vacancies or H-covered surfaces may form at a low potential. These results suggest the possibility of poisoning or creation of surface sites beyond the pristine surface, implying that the surface state under reaction conditions (pH and potentials) needs to be considered before the identification and analysis of active sites of a transition metal X-ide catalyst. In addition, we provide an explanation of the observed theory and experiment discrepancy that some transition metal X-ides are “more stable in experiment than in theory.” Based on our findings, we conclude that analyzing the surface state of transition metal X-ide electrocatalysts by theoretical calculations (e.g., surface Pourbaix diagram analysis), in situ / operando and post-reaction experiments are indispensable to accurately understand the underlying catalytic mechanisms.},

Nucleation delay is often observed in many CVD processes, which is known as the incubation period ( τ i ). In this study, the effects of concentration ( C ) and sticking probability ( η ) of film-forming species on τ i were formulated based on our kinetic model. To discuss the kinetics, τ i − 1 with the rate dimension was used and formulated using C and η . Because η onto heterogeneous surfaces ( η hetero ) is difficult to evaluate, the study was initiated with η onto homogeneous surfaces ( η homo ), followed by a discussion on its reasonability. The formulation was validated using the experimental dataset for SiC-CVD from CH 3 SiCl 3 /H 2 onto BN underlayers because CVD involves multiple film-forming species with different η homo ranging from 10 −6 to 10 −2 and thus is a suitable system for studying the effect of η homo . High-aspect-ratio (1000:1) parallel-plate microchannels consisting of τ i -involving BN and a τ i -free Si surface were utilized to separate these film-forming species along the microchannel depth. τ i was exceptionally long, up to several hours, depending on the CVD conditions. τ i − 1 was found to be proportional to C n , where n is the reaction order. n was quantified as ≈1.6, suggesting the initial nucleation was triggered by the impingement of two adspecies in the second order and lowered possibly by the discrepancy between C in the gas-phase and that actually producing adspecies on the surface. τ i − 1 was also found to be proportional to η homo . The exceptionally long τ i was likely originated from the significantly lower η hetero than η homo and the higher activation energy for η hetero than that for η homo .},

It is generally assumed that the ion concentration in a nanoscale channel is equal to the ion concentration in the macroscopic reservoirs it connects to, with deviations arising only in the presence of surface charges on the channel walls. Here, we show that this assumption may break down even in a neutral channel due to electrostatic correlations between the ions arising in the regime of interaction confinement, where Coulomb interactions are reinforced due to the presence of the channel walls. We focus on a one-dimensional channel geometry, where an exact evaluation of the electrolyte’s partition function is possible with a transfer operator approach. Our exact solution reveals that in nanometer-scale channels, the ion concentration is generally lower than in reservoirs and depends continuously on the bulk salt concentration, in contrast to the conventional mean-field theory that predicts an abrupt filling transition. We develop a modified mean-field theory taking into account the presence of ion pairs that agrees quantitatively with the exact solution and provides predictions for experimentally relevant observables, such as the ionic conductivity. Our results will guide the interpretation of nanoscale ion transport measurements.},

Although their electrochemical properties have been extensively studied, the structural and magnetic properties of LiNiO 2 are still under considerable debate, and the magnetic properties of monoclinic LiMnO 2 are seldom reported. In this work, a detailed study of LiNiO 2 , LiMnO 2 , and a half-doped material LiNi 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 is performed via both first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations based on the effective spin Hamiltonian model. Through considering different structures, it is verified that a structure with a zigzag-type pattern is the most stable one of LiNiO 2 . Moreover, in order to figure out the magnetic properties, the spin exchange interactions are calculated, and then magnetic ground states are predicted in these three systems. The results show that LiNiO 2 forms a spiral order that is caused by the competition from both the short-range and long-range spin exchange interactions, whereas the magnetic ground state of LiMnO 2 is collinearly antiferromagnetic due to its nearest and next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic spin exchange interactions. However, LiNi 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 is collinearly ferrimagnetic because of the ferromagnetic nearest neighbor Ni–Ni and Mn–Mn exchange interactions. Our work demonstrates the competition between the different exchange interactions in these cathode materials, which may be relevant to the performance of the lithium–ion battery.},

  abstract = {Metals are traditionally considered hard matter. However, it is well known that their atomic lattices may become dynamic and undergo reconfigurations even well below the melting temperature. The innate atomic dynamics of metals is directly related to their bulk and surface properties. Understanding their complex structural dynamics is, thus, important for many applications but is not easy. Here, we report deep-potential molecular dynamics simulations allowing to resolve at an atomic resolution the complex dynamics of various types of copper (Cu) surfaces, used as an example, near the Hüttig ( ⁠ ∼ 1 / 3 of melting) temperature. The development of deep neural network potential trained on density functional theory calculations provides a dynamically accurate force field that we use to simulate large atomistic models of different Cu surface types. A combination of high-dimensional structural descriptors and unsupervized machine learning allows identifying and tracking all the atomic environments (AEs) emerging in the surfaces at finite temperatures. We can directly observe how AEs that are non-native in a specific (ideal) surface, but that are, instead, typical of other surface types, continuously emerge/disappear in that surface in relevant regimes in dynamic equilibrium with the native ones. Our analyses allow estimating the lifetime of all the AEs populating these Cu surfaces and to reconstruct their dynamic interconversions networks. This reveals the elusive identity of these metal surfaces, which preserve their identity only in part and in part transform into something else under relevant conditions. This also proposes a concept of “statistical identity” for metal surfaces, which is key to understanding their behaviors and properties.},

  abstract = {The formation of vapor bubbles in a metastable liquid, cavitation, is an activated process due to the free energy cost of having both phases at contact. Such an energetic penalty enables the existence of the liquid beyond its thermodynamic borders. Establishing the stability limits of a liquid as ubiquitous as water has important practical implications and has thereby attracted a lot of attention. Different experimental strategies and theoretical analyses have been employed to measure and predict the cavitation line, or the pressure–temperature kinetic stability border of liquid water. Understanding the location of the cavitation line requires knowing the cavitation rate dependence on pressure and temperature. Such dependency is difficult to obtain in experiments, and we use molecular simulations with the TIP4P/2005 model to fill this gap. By deeply overstretching liquid water below the saturation pressure, we are able to observe and quantify spontaneous cavitation. To deal with a lower overstretching regime, we resort to the Seeding technique, which consists of analyzing simulations of a liquid containing a vapor bubble under the theoretical framework of Classical Nucleation Theory. Combining spontaneous cavitation with Seeding, we get a wide overview of the cavitation rate. We study two different temperatures (450 and 550 K) and complement our perspective with the results previously obtained at 296.4 K [Menzl et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 113 , 13582 (2016)] to establish a broad simulation-experiment comparison. We find a good agreement between simulations and both isobaric heating and isochoric cooling experiments using quartz inclusions. We are, however, unable to reconcile simulations with other experimental techniques. Our results predict a decrease in the solid–liquid interfacial free energy as the liquid becomes increasingly overstretched with a temperature independent Tolman length of 0.1 nm. Therefore, the capillarity approximation underestimates the nucleation rate. Nonetheless, it provides a fair indication of the location of the cavitation line given the steep rate vs pressure dependence. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive view of the water cavitation phenomenon and sets an efficient strategy to investigate it with molecular simulations.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of ice nucleation, this process has been barely explored at negative pressures. Here, we study homogeneous ice nucleation in stretched water by means of molecular dynamics seeding simulations using the TIP4P/Ice model. We observe that the critical nucleus size, interfacial free energy, free energy barrier, and nucleation rate barely change between isobars from −2600 to 500 bars when they are represented as a function of supercooling. This allows us to identify universal empirical expressions for homogeneous ice nucleation in the pressure range from −2600 to 500 bars. We show that this universal behavior arises from the pressure dependence of the interfacial free energy, which we compute by means of the mold integration technique, finding a shallow minimum around −2000 bars. Likewise, we show that the change in the interfacial free energy with pressure is proportional to the excess entropy and the slope of the melting line, exhibiting in the latter a reentrant behavior also at the same negative pressure. Finally, we estimate the excess internal energy and the excess entropy of the ice Ih–water interface.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous ice nucleation is ubiquitous but its microscopic mechanisms can be extraordinarily complex even on a simple surface. Such complexity poses a challenge in modeling nucleation using advanced sampling methods. Here, we investigate heterogeneous ice nucleation on an FCC (211) surface by a forward flux sampling (FFS) method to understand how the complexity in nucleation pathways affects the accuracy of FFS. We first show the commonly adopted, size-based order parameter fails to describe heterogeneous ice nucleation on the FCC (211) surface. Inclusion of geometric anisotropy of ice nucleus as an additional descriptor is found to significantly improve the quality of the size-based order parameter for the current system. Subsequent application of this new order parameter in FFS identifies two competing ice nucleation pathways in the system: a primary-prism-planed (PPP) path and a secondary-prism-planed (SPP) path, both leading to the formation of hexagonal ice but with different crystalline orientations. Although the PPP pathway dominates ice nucleation on the FCC (211) surface, the occurrence of the less efficient SPP pathway, particularly its strong presence at the early stage of FFS, is found to yield a significant statistical uncertainty in the calculated FFS rate constant. We develop a two-path model that enables gaining a general, quantitative understanding of the impact of initial finite sampling on the reliability of FFS calculations in the presence of multiple nucleation pathways. Our study also suggests a few general strategies for improving the accuracy of FFS when exploring unknown but complex systems.},

Different from 3D bulk materials, the dielectric response is, however, ambiguous for the small-sized 0D dots in which the effect of outer atoms on the inner atoms is usually described qualitatively. Based on the first-principles calculated electron density, the polarizability of the core–shell CdSe@ZnS wurtzite quantum dots is decomposed into the distributional contributions among which the dipole polarizability of the core is proposed to measure the shell effect on the dielectric properties of core–shell quantum dots. The shell thickness dependence on the shell effect is then studied, which is significant for the outermost shell but decays rapidly in the additional shells. Moreover, this model gives explicit physical origins of the core dipole polarizability in the core–shell QDs, which is determined by the intra-shell polarization and inter-core-shell charge transfer. Our study proposes a new approach for studying the dielectric properties of core–shell quantum dots, which is effective and extendable for other low-dimensional structures.},

  abstract = {Positive ion desorption following electron impact dissociative ionization of ethane adsorbed on Ar, Kr, and Xe multilayers has been studied as a function of incident electron energy from threshold to 100 eV. Based on the dependence of ion yields on the identity of the rare gas, it is likely that the majority of ethane molecules undergo indirect ionization following hole transfer from the ionized underlying rare gas. This has also been corroborated by density of states calculations showing the energetic alignment of the outer valence states of ethane and the condensed rare gas ionization energies. Due to the near-resonant nature of charge transfer for single-hole states, the ethane molecular ion is excited to different final ionic states on different rare gases, which leads to differences in ion desorption yields and branching ratios. The quantitative yields increase with increasing ionization energy gap between the rare gas and ethane, in the order Ar &gt; Kr &gt; Xe. The large increase in yields from 25 eV onwards for all rare gases is likely due to the formation and decay of two-hole states on neighboring rare gas and ethane molecules due to interatomic and intermolecular Coulomb decay (ICD) and not electron transfer mediated decay (ETMD). The ICD and ETMD pathways become accessible when the incoming electron has sufficient energy to excite the inner valence ns level of the rare gas to a Rydberg state or ionize it. The experimental findings are supported by calculations of thresholds, density of states for the final configurations of these processes, and coupling strengths for hole transfer between ethane and rare gases. The fragment ion branching ratios vary with energy from threshold to about 35 eV, showing the fragmentation pattern changes with the mode of hole transfer and availability of excess energy. Sigma C–C bonds are more likely to break than C–H bonds in the mid-20 eV range, and this effect is most pronounced for Xe, followed by Kr, and then Ar.},

We suggest that this is due to the molecules attaching to the oxygen atoms forming the beryl structural voids by a hydrogen bond. Our analysis shows that the molecules perform two types of movement: (i) rapid librations around the axis of the hydrogen bond and (ii) less frequent orientational jumps among the 12 possible binding sites in the beryl voids. The frequencies of the librational motions are evaluated from a simple thermodynamic model, providing good quantitative agreement with the frequencies of librations from optical experiments reported earlier.},

  abstract = {We detail several interesting features in the dynamics of an equilaterally shaped electronic excitation-transfer (EET) trimer with distance-dependent intermonomer excitation-transfer couplings. In the absence of electronic-vibrational coupling, symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of two single-monomer excitations are shown to exhibit purely constructive, oscillatory, and purely destructive interference in the EET to the third monomer, respectively. In the former case, the transfer is modulated by motion in the symmetrical framework-expansion vibration induced by the Franck–Condon excitation. Distortions in the shape of the triangular framework degrade that coherent EET while activating excitation transfer in the latter case of an antisymmetric initial state. In its symmetrical configuration, two of the three single-exciton states of the trimer are degenerate. This degeneracy is broken by the Jahn–Teller-active framework distortions. The calculations illustrate closed, approximately circular pseudo-rotational wave-packet dynamics on both the lower and the upper adiabatic potential energy surfaces of the degenerate manifold, which lead to the acquisition after one cycle of physically meaningful geometric (Berry) phases of π . Another manifestation of Berry-phase development is seen in the evolution of the vibrational probability density of a wave packet on the lower Jahn–Teller adiabatic potential comprising a superposition of clockwise and counterclockwise circular motions. The circular pseudo-rotation on the upper cone is shown to stabilize the adiabatic electronic state against non-adiabatic internal conversion via the conical intersection, a dynamical process analogous to Slonczewski resonance. Strategies for initiating and monitoring these various dynamical processes experimentally using pre-resonant impulsive Raman excitation, short-pulse absorption, and multi-dimensional wave-packet interferometry are outlined in brief.},

Recently, saturated molecules have also been reported to exhibit destructive quantum interference effects; however, the very different σ -orbital character in these molecules means that it is not clear how orbital contributions manifest. Herein, we demonstrate that the quantum interference effects in conjugated molecules are quite different from those observed in saturated molecules, as demonstrated by the quantum interference map. While destructive interference at the Fermi energy in the π -system of benzene arises from interference terms between paired occupied and virtual orbitals, this is not the case at the Fermi energy in saturated systems. Instead, destructive interference is evident when contributions from a larger number of non-paired orbitals cancel, leading to more subtle and varied manifestations of destructive interference in saturated systems.},

This is notably larger than the typical 2.0–2.5 D associated with such behavior. Similar computational analysis on deprotonated purine derivatives also conducted herein only requires the more traditional 2.5 D dipole moment, implying that the single six-membered azabenzene rings have additional factors at play in binding diffuse electrons. The present study also shows that the use of coupled cluster singles and doubles with a double-zeta correlation consistent basis set and additional diffuse functions originating from the center-of-charge for all aspects of the computations decreases the error in predicting DBXSs to less than 0.006 eV at worst and likely less than 0.003 eV for most cases. These results can influence the modeling of molecular spectra beyond fundamental chemical curiosity with application to astrochemistry, solar energy harvesting, and combustion chemistry among others.},

  abstract = {Experimental results for homogeneous nucleation of water droplets in the presence of argon, nitrogen, and, for the first time, nitrous oxide as carrier gases are reported. The main objective of the study was to investigate the effects of different carrier gases on the nucleation rate. These gases differ in the number of atoms comprising the molecule, which affects the expansion ratio required to reach the target nucleation temperature. The experiments cover nucleation temperatures from 220 to 260 K, nucleation pressures from 40 to 73 kPa, supersaturations of 6.5–20, and nucleation rates ranging from about 4 × 10 5 to 4 × 10 9 cm –3 s –1 . The new data obtained with a modernized expansion chamber utilizing the nucleation pulse method show good agreement with the available literature data. Another important point of our work is the application of real gas corrections to calculate the nucleation temperature and supersaturation. The results show that the influence of carrier gases on nucleation rate in the investigated pressure range is modest (less than a factor of 7), while without the real gas correction, the apparent effect of carrier gas is significant, with differences as high as a factor of 90.},

We introduce a new method for engineering effective zero-quantum Hamiltonians with an arbitrary phase in the transverse plane. We use this method to generate a variety of cyclic zero-quantum paths, enabling direct study of the geometric Aharonov–Anandan phase to probe the rotational characteristics of the zero-quantum subspace. We show that the geometric Aharonov–Anandan phase may be used for efficient double-quantum excitation in strongly coupled spin pairs.

Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the reaction conditions that would ensure the absence of external (film) and internal mass transfer resistances. The kinetic experiments were subsequently carried out at 420–500 °C under conditions where mass transfer limitations were absent. A detailed reaction network was proposed for the MTP process based on the experimental product distribution and various reported kinetic models in the literature. According to the first series of experiments (without C 4 and C 5 /C 6 recycle streams) conducted at various temperatures, the best yield for propylene production was achieved at 480 °C with a water to methanol ratio of 0.7. Subsequently, kinetic experiments were performed at 480 °C and a water to methanol ratio of 0.7 using feeds with different amounts of C 4 and C 5 /C 6 hydrocarbons as recycle streams. Species material balances for the integral tubular reactor along with power-law rate functions and the Arrhenius equation for rate constants were employed in an optimization algorithm to obtain the kinetic parameters. The predictive ability of the model was checked against experimental data, and the kinetic parameters were validated by additional experiments.},

  abstract = {Conventional and two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy are well suited to study amyloid aggregates, because the amide I mode is a sensitive probe of the aggregate structure. However, these methods are not so useful to study mixtures of aggregates and monomers, which generally have overlapping amide I spectra. Here, we show that IR-Diffusion-Ordered Spectroscopy can disentangle the contributions of protein monomers and aggregates (amyloids) in FTIR and 2D-IR spectra by separating the spectral contributions based on molecular size. We rely on the fact that the diffusion coefficient of a molecule is determined by its size through the Stokes–Einstein relation, and achieve sensitivity to the diffusion coefficient by creating a concentration gradient inside an IR sample cell and tracking its equilibration in an IR-frequency-resolved manner. The amyloid diffusion is too slow to be experimentally observable, so instead of tracking the arrival of molecular species diffusing into the initially empty region of the sample cell, we track the depletion of the more rapidly diffusing species as they leave the sample-filled region. This way, we can still obtain the spectrum of very slowly diffusing species, although we cannot determine their diffusion coefficient. We first demonstrate this depletion method on a mixture of two small organic molecules and then show how it can be used to separate the spectrum of a mixture of bovine-serum-albumin amyloids and monomers into its component spectra, both in the FTIR and 2D-IR case.},

  abstract = {The water electrolysis reaction involves a large kinetic overvoltage, and considerable research efforts are currently devoted to the search for better electrocatalysts. It is commonly expected that, at least, in principle, an ideal electrocatalyst would enable significant reaction rates close to the equilibrium voltage. In the present work, we question this expectation. For reactions, such as water electrolysis, which involve a significant change in the concentration between the reactant and product states, the position of the equilibrium voltage generally becomes decoupled from the onset of macroscopic kinetic currents. The reason is the dependence of the equilibrium voltage on the concentrations of both reactant and product species, whereas the forward rate of the reaction does not, in general, depend on the latter. Based on a new ideal gas reference for association/dissociation reactions, we develop a formalism to decompose the equilibrium voltage of electrolysis reactions into two distinct contributions: first, a contribution due to unbalanced relative concentrations between reactants and products second, a contribution due to the (mis)alignment of reactant and product states within the potential energy surface. The latter defines an intrinsic “kinetic reference voltage” that agrees remarkably well with the experimentally observed onset of water electrolysis, providing a new perspective on the origin of a significant fraction of the respective overvoltage. We expect the concept of kinetic reference voltages/potentials to be also useful in the context of other reactions involving significant concentration changes from the reactant to the product.},

Despite the complexity of conformational changes associated with ligand binding, we previously showed that simply sampling along each of the lowest 30 modes can adequately restructure cryptic sites so they are detectable by pocket finding programs like Concavity. Here, we applied this method to study four classical examples of allosteric regulation (GluR2 receptor, GroEL chaperonin, GPCR, and myosin). Our method along with alternative methods has been utilized to locate known allosteric sites and predict new promising allosteric sites. Compared with other sampling methods based on extensive molecular dynamics simulation, our method is both faster (1–2 h for an average-size protein of ∼400 residues) and more flexible (it can be easily integrated with any structure-based pocket finding methods), so it is suitable for high-throughput screening of large datasets of protein structures at the genome scale.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained models are a core computational tool in theoretical chemistry and biophysics. A judicious choice of a coarse-grained model can yield physical insights by isolating the essential degrees of freedom that dictate the thermodynamic properties of a complex, condensed-phase system. The reduced complexity of the model typically leads to lower computational costs and more efficient sampling compared with atomistic models. Designing “good” coarse-grained models is an art. Generally, the mapping from fine-grained configurations to coarse-grained configurations itself is not optimized in any way; instead, the energy function associated with the mapped configurations is. In this work, we explore the consequences of optimizing the coarse-grained representation alongside its potential energy function. We use a graph machine learning framework to embed atomic configurations into a low-dimensional space to produce efficient representations of the original molecular system. Because the representation we obtain is no longer directly interpretable as a real-space representation of the atomic coordinates, we also introduce an inversion process and an associated thermodynamic consistency relation that allows us to rigorously sample fine-grained configurations conditioned on the coarse-grained sampling. We show that this technique is robust, recovering the first two moments of the distribution of several observables in proteins such as chignolin and alanine dipeptide.},

The tungsten nitride (WN x ) film, as a by-product on the divertor surface in the fusion reactor after nitrogen seeding, has rich H retention, and much attention should be given to hydrogen removal from WN x . In this paper, by using density functional theory calculations, we predicted a novel W 24 N 48 crystal, which possesses nanoscale cavities and channels inside, and studied the interaction between it and hydrogen. We found that the N atoms inside the crystal are favorable for the adsorption of atomic hydrogen. When more hydrogen atoms are injected, the hydrogen atoms adsorbed in the crystal react with the newly entered hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen molecules. These newly formed H 2 molecules can easily move through the nanochannels in W 24 N 48 and serve to remove hydrogen. Our calculations suggest that when this new W 24 N 48 material is embedded in the WN x film on the surface of the PFMs, the nanochannels will be helpful in removing and recycling hydrogen isotopes in the PFMs.},

The theory is first developed using Newtonian mechanics and we provide a simple quantification of the coupling between these types of modes. We also discuss the mathematical structure of the problem, which turns out to be a quadratic eigenvalue problem rather than a standard eigenvalue problem. The theory is then re-derived using the Hamiltonian formalism, which brings additional insight, including a close analogy to the quantum-mechanical treatment of the problem.

  abstract = {A novel local approach for the quantum-chemical computation of excited states is presented, where the concept of the atomic-orbital formulation of the second-order Møller–Plesset energy expression is extended to the second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme by virtue of the Laplace transform. The scaled opposite-spin second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction method with Cholesky decomposed densities and density-fitting, or CDD-DF-SOS-ADC(2) for short, exploits the sparsity of the two-electron repulsion integrals, the atomic ground-state density matrix, and the atomic transition density matrix to drastically reduce the computational effort. By using a local density-fitting approximation, it is shown that asymptotically linear scaling can be achieved for linear carboxylic acids. For electron-dense systems, sub-cubic scaling can be achieved if the excitation is local, and hence the transition density is sparse. Furthermore, the memory footprint and accuracy of the CDD-DF-SOS-ADC(2) method are explored in detail.},

By using the idea of a domain-based local pair natural orbital (DLPNO), computational scaling of the conventional NEVPT2-F12 is reduced to near-linear scaling. For low-lying excited states of organic molecules, the excitation energies predicted by DLPNO-NEVPT2-F12 are as accurate as the exact NEVPT2-F12 results.

  abstract = {We argue that one can associate a pseudo-time with sequences of configurations generated in the course of classical Monte Carlo simulations for a single-minimum bound state if the sampling is optimal. Hereby, the sampling rates can be, under special circumstances, calibrated against the relaxation rate and frequency of motion of an actual physical system. The latter possibility is linked to the optimal sampling regime being a universal crossover separating two distinct suboptimal sampling regimes analogous to the physical phenomena of diffusion and effusion, respectively. Bound states break symmetry; one may thus regard the pseudo-time as a quantity emerging together with the bound state. Conversely, when transport among distinct bound states takes place—thus restoring symmetry—a pseudo-time can no longer be defined. One can still quantify activation barriers if the latter barriers are smooth, but simulation becomes impractically slow and pertains to overdamped transport only. Specially designed Monte Carlo moves that bypass activation barriers—so as to accelerate sampling of the thermodynamics—amount to effusive transport and lead to severe under-sampling of transition-state configurations that separate distinct bound states while destroying the said universality. Implications of the present findings for simulations of glassy liquids are discussed.},

The standard SOPPA method, although cheaper in terms of computational cost, offers less accurate results than the ones obtained with coupled cluster methods. A new method, named SOPPA+A3-3, was therefore developed by adding the terms of the third-order A matrix that rely on the second-order double amplitudes. The performance of this third-order contribution was studied using the coupled cluster singles and doubles method as a reference, calculating the spin–spin couplings of molecules of diverse sizes and compositions, and comparing them to the SOPPA method. The results show that inclusion of this third-order contribution gives more accurate results than the standard SOPPA method with a level of accuracy close to that of the coupled cluster method with only a small increase in the computational cost of the response calculation that dominates the computational cost for small- to medium-sized molecules. The implementation of the first contributions to the third-order polarization propagator approximation in the Dalton program, thus, already shows a significant change in these molecular properties over those obtained with the standard SOPPA method.},

For the calculation of the solvation free energies in water, toluene, and 1-octanol, we used an efficient MD-based nonequilibrium alchemical technique relying on the GAFF2 non-polarizable force field. The method is based on the fast-growth of an initially decoupled solute. Canonical sampling of the associated end-state is efficiently obtained by performing a Hamiltonian replica exchange simulation of the gas-phase solute molecule alone, combined with equilibrium configurations of the solvent. Before submitting the prediction, a pre-assessment of the method and of the force field was made by comparing with the known experimental counterpart the calculated octanol–water partition coefficients using different set of atomic charges. The analysis allowed to optimize our blind prediction for the toluene–water partition coefficients, providing at the same time valid clues for improving the performance and reliability of the non-polarizable force field in free energy calculations of drug-receptor systems.},

According to the physical meanings of their definitions, the EDA terms in the three methods can be grouped into four categories: electrostatics, exchange–repulsion/Pauli/exchange, polarization/orbital/induction, and CD (correlation/dispersion/dispersion) terms. Test examples include 1092 non-covalent interaction complexes in the standard sets (S66, PNICO23, HAL59, IL16, S66 × 8, and X40 × 10). It is concluded that despite the different basis sets and different running platforms (programs), the results of the three EDA methods are comparable. In general, except the dispersion term, all the EDA terms in the three methods are in excellent agreement. The CD term in GKS-EDA is comparable with the dispersion term in the DFT-SAPT. GKS-EDA provides another way to explore the role of electronic correlations from DFT calculations.},

We show that in cases where there are two (or more) possible pathways that the system can take, the time available for the transition to occur is crucially important. The well-known results of the reaction rate theory for determining the rates of transitions apply in the long-time limit. However, at short times, the system can, instead, choose to pass over higher energy barriers with a much higher probability, as long as the distance to travel in phase space is shorter. We construct two simple models to illustrate this general phenomenon. We also apply a version of the geometric minimum action method algorithm of Vanden-Eijnden and Heymann [J. Chem. Phys. 128 , 061103 (2008)] to determine the most likely path at both short and long times.},

Absolute excitation energies and intensities computed with the GAS-DSRG truncated to second-order in perturbation theory are found to systematically underestimate experimental and reference theoretical values. Third-order perturbative corrections significantly improve the accuracy of GAS-DSRG absolute excitation energies, bringing the mean absolute deviation from experimental values down to 0.32 eV.

  abstract = {Existing semiempirical molecular orbital methods suffer from the usually minimal atomic-orbital (AO) basis set used to simplify the calculations. Here, a completely new and consistently parameterized tight-binding electronic structure Hamiltonian evaluated in a deeply contracted, properly polarized valence double-zeta basis set (vDZP) is described. The inner-shell electrons are accounted for by standard, large-core effective potentials and approximations to them. The primary target of this so-called density matrix tight-binding method is to reproduce the one-particle density matrix P of a molecular ω B97X-V range-separated hybrid density functional theory (DFT) calculation in exactly the same basis set. Additional properties considered are orbital energies, dipole polarizabilities and dipole moments, and dipole polarizability derivatives. The key features of the method are as follows: (a) it is non-self-consistent with an overall fixed number of only three required matrix diagonalizations; (b) only AO overlap integrals are needed to construct the effective Hamiltonian matrix; (c) new P -dependent terms emulating non-local exchange are included; and (d) only element-specific empirical parameters (about 50 per element) need to be determined. The method globally achieves a high accuracy for the target properties at a speedup compared to the ω B97X-V/vDZP reference of about 3–4 orders of magnitude. It performs robustly for difficult transition metal complexes, for highly charged or zwitterionic systems, and for chemically unusual bonding situations, indicating a generally robust approximation of the (self-consistent) Kohn–Sham potential. As an example application, the vibrational Raman spectrum of an entire protein with 327 atoms with respect to the DFT reference calculation is shown. This method may be used out-of-the-box to generate molecular/atomic features for machine learning applications or as the basis for accurate high-speed DFT methods.},

Finally, we examine the acid/base chemistry relevant for RNA cleavage reactions catalyzed by small nucleolytic ribozymes, DNAzymes, and ribonucleases. Overall, the hybrid quantum mechanical/machine learning potentials appear to be the most robust for these datasets, and the recently developed QD π model performs exceptionally well, having especially high accuracy for tautomers and protonation states relevant to drug discovery.},

  abstract = {The liquid–vapor transition starts with the formation of a sufficiently large bubble in the metastable liquid to trigger the phase transition. Understanding this process is of fundamental and practical interest, but its study is challenging because it occurs over timescales that are too short for experiments but too long for simulations. The seeding method estimates cavitation rates by simulating a liquid in which a bubble is inserted, thus avoiding the long times needed for its formation. In one-component systems, in the NpT ensemble, the bubble grows or redissolves depending on whether its size is larger or smaller than the critical size, whereas in the NVT ensemble (i.e., at constant number of particles, volume, and temperature), the critical bubble can remain in equilibrium. Provided that a good criterion is used to determine the bubble size, this method, combined with the Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT), gives cavitation rates consistent with those obtained by methods independent of the CNT. In this work, the applicability of NVT seeding to homogeneous cavitation in mixtures is demonstrated, focusing on a partially miscible symmetrical binary Lennard-Jones (LJ) liquid at a temperature within the mixing regime. At the same stretching pressure, cavitation rates are higher in the binary mixture than in the pure liquid due to the lower interfacial free energy of the mixture. Curiously, the cost of creating a bubble is similar in the pure and binary LJ liquids at the same metastability, Δ μ /Δ μ spin , with Δ μ being the difference in chemical potential between the metastable liquid and coexistence, and Δ μ spin between the spinodal and coexistence.},

The algorithm has been tested for the photodeactivation dynamics of trans -4-dimethylamino-4′-cyanostilbene (DCS). By treating on equal footing the radiative and non-radiative processes, our method allows us to attain a complete molecular movie of the excited-state deactivation. Our dynamics rely on a semi-empirical quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical Hamiltonian and have been run for hundreds of picoseconds, both in the gas phase and in isopropyl ether. The proposed approach successfully captures the first fluorescence processes occurring in DCS, and it succeeds in reproducing the experimental fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield, especially in the polar solvent. The analysis of the geometrical features of the emissive species during the dynamics discards the hypothesis of a twisted intramolecular charge transfer state to be responsible for the dual emission observed experimentally in some polar solvents. In a nutshell, our method opens the way for theoretical studies on early fluorescence events occurring up to hundreds of picoseconds in molecular systems.},

  abstract = {We show how to construct an effective Hamiltonian whose dimension scales linearly with system size, and whose eigenvalues systematically approximate the excitation energies of GW theory. This is achieved by rigorously expanding the self-energy in order to exactly conserve a desired number of frequency-independent moments of the self-energy dynamics. Recasting GW in this way admits a low-scaling O [ N 4 ] approach to build and solve this Hamiltonian, with a proposal to reduce this further to O [ N 3 ] ⁠ . This relies on exposing a novel recursive framework for the density response moments of the random phase approximation, where the efficient calculation of its starting point mirrors the low-scaling approaches to compute RPA correlation energies. The frequency integration of GW , which distinguishes so many different GW variants, can be performed without approximation directly in this moment representation. Furthermore, the solution to the Dyson equation can be performed exactly, avoiding analytic continuation, diagonal approximations, or iterative solutions to the quasiparticle equation, with the full-frequency spectrum obtained from the complete solution of this effective static Hamiltonian. We show how this approach converges rapidly with respect to the order of the conserved self-energy moments and is applied across the GW 100 benchmark dataset to obtain accurate GW spectra in comparison to traditional implementations. We also show the ability to systematically converge all-electron full-frequency spectra and high-energy features beyond frontier excitations, as well as avoiding discontinuities in the spectrum, which afflict many other GW approaches.},

  abstract = {Protein kinase G (PKG) is an essential regulator of eukaryotic cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent intracellular signaling, controlling pathways that are often distinct from those regulated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Specifically, the C-terminal cyclic-nucleotide-binding domain (CNB-B) of PKG has emerged as a critical module to control allostery and cGMP-selectivity in PKG. While key contributions to the cGMP-versus-cAMP selectivity of CNB-B were previously assessed, only limited knowledge is currently available on how cyclic nucleotide binding rewires the network of hydrogen bonds in CNB-B, and how such rewiring contributes to allostery and cGMP selectivity. To address this gap, we extend the comparative analysis of apo, cAMP- and cGMP-bound CNB-B to H/D fractionation factors (FFs), which are well-suited for assessing backbone hydrogen-bond strengths within proteins. Apo-vs-bound comparisons inform of perturbations arising from both binding and allostery, while cGMP-bound vs cAMP-bound comparisons inform of perturbations that are purely allosteric. The comparative FF analyses of the bound states revealed mixed patterns of hydrogen-bond strengthening and weakening, pointing to inherent frustration, whereby not all hydrogen bonds can be simultaneously stabilized. Interestingly, contrary to expectations, these patterns include a weakening of hydrogen bonds not only within critical recognition and allosteric elements of CNB-B, but also within elements known to undergo rigid-body movement upon cyclic nucleotide binding. These results suggest that frustration may contribute to the reversibility of allosteric conformational shifts by avoiding over-rigidification that may otherwise trap CNB-B in its active state. Considering that PKG CNB-B serves as a prototype for allosteric conformational switches, similar concepts may be applicable to allosteric domains in general.},

  abstract = {Tryptophan synthase (TRPS) is a bifunctional enzyme consisting of α- and β-subunits that catalyzes the last two steps of L-tryptophan (L-Trp) biosynthesis. The first stage of the reaction at the β-subunit is called β-reaction stage I, which converts the β-ligand from an internal aldimine [E(Ain)] to an α-aminoacrylate [E(A-A)] intermediate. The activity is known to increase 3–10-fold upon the binding of 3-indole-D-glycerol-3′-phosphate (IGP) at the α-subunit. The effect of α-ligand binding on β-reaction stage I at the distal β-active site is not well understood despite the abundant structural information available for TRPS. Here, we investigate the β-reaction stage I by carrying out minimum-energy pathway searches based on a hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) model. The free-energy differences along the pathway are also examined using QM/MM umbrella sampling simulations with QM calculations at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. Our simulations suggest that the sidechain orientation of βD305 near the β-ligand likely plays an essential role in the allosteric regulation: a hydrogen bond is formed between βD305 and the β-ligand in the absence of the α-ligand, prohibiting a smooth rotation of the hydroxyl group in the quinonoid intermediate, whereas the dihedral angle rotates smoothly after the hydrogen bond is switched from βD305-β-ligand to βD305-βR141. This switch could occur upon the IGP-binding at the α-subunit, as evidenced by the existing TRPS crystal structures.},

  abstract = {In this contribution, gravitational effects in gel-forming patchy colloidal systems are studied. We focus on how the gel structure is modified by gravity. Through Monte Carlo computer simulations of gel-like states recently identified by the rigidity percolation criterion [J. A. S. Gallegos et al. , Phys. Rev. E 104 , 064606 (2021)], the influence of the gravitational field, characterized by the gravitational Péclet number, Pe , on patchy colloids is studied in terms of the patchy coverage, χ . Our findings point out that there exists a threshold Péclet number, Pe g , that depends on χ above which the gravitational field enhances the particle bonding and, in consequence, promotes the aggregation or clustering of particles; the smaller the χ value, the higher the Pe g . Interestingly, when χ ∼ 1 (near the isotropic limit), our results are consistent with an experimentally determined threshold Pe value where gravity affects the gel formation in short-range attractive colloids. In addition, our results show that the cluster size distribution and the density profile undergo variations that lead to changes in the percolating cluster, i.e., gravity is able to modify the structure of the gel-like states. These changes have an important impact on the structural rigidity of the patchy colloidal dispersion; the percolating cluster goes from a uniform spatially network to a heterogeneous percolated structure, where an interesting structural scenario emerges, namely, depending on the Pe value, the new heterogeneous gel-like states can coexist with both diluted and dense phases or they simply reach a crystalline-like state. In the isotropic case, the increase in the Pe number can shift the critical temperature to higher temperatures; however, when Pe &gt; 0.01, the binodal disappears and the particles fully sediment at the bottom of the sample cell. Furthermore, gravity moves the rigidity percolation threshold to lower densities. Finally, we also note that within the values of the Péclet number here explored, the cluster morphology is barely altered.},

  abstract = {By performing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we study the effect of crosslinking and chain uncrossability on the microphase behaviors and mechanical properties of the double-network gels. The double-network systems can be viewed as two separate networks interpenetrating each other uniformly, and the crosslinks in each network are generated, forming a regular cubic lattice. The chain uncrossability is confirmed by appropriately choosing the bonded and nonbonded interaction potentials. Our simulations reveal a close relation between the phase and mechanical properties of the double-network systems and their network topological structures. Depending on the lattice size and the solvent affinity, we have observed two different microphases: one is the aggregation of solvophobic beads around the crosslinking points, which leads to locally polymer-rich domains, and the other is the bunching of polymer strands, which thickens the network edges and thus changes the network periodicity. The former is a representation of the interfacial effect, while the latter is determined by the chain uncrossability. The coalescence of network edges is demonstrated to be responsible for the large relative increase in the shear modulus. Compressing and stretching induced phase transitions are observed in the current double-network systems, and the sharp discontinuous change in the stress that appears at the transition point is found to be related to the bunching or debunching of the network edges. The results suggest that the regulation of network edges has a strong influence on the network mechanical properties.},

By means of Brownian dynamics simulations, we perform a comparative study for the conformational change and diffusion dynamics of an active chain in pure solvents and in crowded media. Our result shows a robust compaction-to-swelling conformational change with the augment of the Péclet number. The presence of crowding facilitates self-trapping of monomers and, thus, reinforces the activity mediated compaction. In addition, the efficient collisions between the self-propelled monomers and crowders induce a coil-to-globulelike transition, indicated by a marked change of the Flory scaling exponent of the gyration radius. Moreover, the diffusion dynamics of the active chain in crowded solutions demonstrates activity-enhanced subdiffusion. The center of mass diffusion manifests rather new scaling relations with respect to both the chain length and Péclet number. The interplay of chain activity and medium crowding provides a new mechanism to understand the non-trivial properties of active filaments in complex environments.},

  abstract = {DNA toroids are compact torus-shaped bundles formed by one or multiple DNA molecules being condensed from the solution due to various condensing agents. It has been shown that the DNA toroidal bundles are twisted. However, the global conformations of DNA inside these bundles are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate this issue by solving different models for the toroidal bundles and performing replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations for self-attractive stiff polymers of various chain lengths. We find that a moderate degree of twisting is energetically favorable for toroidal bundles, yielding optimal configurations of lower energies than for other bundles corresponding to spool-like and constant radius of curvature arrangements. The REMD simulations show that the ground states of the stiff polymers are twisted toroidal bundles with the average twist degrees close to those predicted by the theoretical model. Constant-temperature simulations show that twisted toroidal bundles can be formed through successive processes of nucleation, growth, quick tightening, and slow tightening of the toroid, with the two last processes facilitating the polymer threading through the toroid’s hole. A relatively long chain of 512 beads has an increased dynamical difficulty to access the twisted bundle states due to the polymer’s topological constraint. Interestingly, we also observed significantly twisted toroidal bundles with a sharp U-shaped region in the polymer conformation. It is suggested that this U-shaped region makes the formation of twisted bundles easier by effectively reducing the polymer length. This effect can be equivalent to having multiple chains in the toroid.},

  abstract = {Extensive coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the conformational phase diagram of a neutral polymer in the presence of attractive crowders. We show that, for low crowder densities, the polymer predominantly shows three phases as a function of both intra-polymer and polymer–crowder interactions: (1) weak intra-polymer and weak polymer–crowder attractive interactions induce extended or coil polymer conformations (phase E), (2) strong intra-polymer and relatively weak polymer–crowder attractive interactions induce collapsed or globular conformations (phase CI), and (3) strong polymer–crowder attractive interactions, regardless of intra-polymer interactions, induce a second collapsed or globular conformation that encloses bridging crowders (phase CB). The detailed phase diagram is obtained by determining the phase boundaries delineating the different phases based on an analysis of the radius of gyration as well as bridging crowders. The dependence of the phase diagram on strength of crowder–crowder attractive interactions and crowder density is clarified. We also show that when the crowder density is increased, a third collapsed phase of the polymer emerges for weak intra-polymer attractive interactions. This crowder density-induced compaction is shown to be enhanced by stronger crowder–crowder attraction and is different from the depletion-induced collapse mechanism, which is primarily driven by repulsive interactions. We also provide a unified explanation of the observed re-entrant swollen/extended conformations of the earlier simulations of weak and strongly self-interacting polymers in terms of crowder–crowder attractive interactions.},

The typical phase obtained by solidification from a homogeneous shear-melt is a substitutional alloy with a body centered cubic structure. In strictly gas-tight vials, the polycrystalline solid is stable against melting and further phase transformation for extended times. For comparison, we also prepare the same samples by slow, mechanically undisturbed deionization in commercial slit cells. These cells feature a complex but well reproducible sequence of global and local gradients in salt concentration, number density, and composition as induced by successive deionization, phoretic transport, and differential settling of the components, respectively. Moreover, they provide an extended bottom surface suitable for heterogeneous nucleation of the β-phase. We give a detailed qualitative characterization of the crystallization processes using imaging and optical microscopy. By contrast to the bulk samples, the initial alloy formation is not volume-filling, and we now observe also α- and β-phases with low solubility of the odd component. In addition to the initial homogeneous nucleation route, the interplay of gradients opens various further crystallization and transformation pathways leading to a great diversity of microstructures. Upon a subsequent increase in salt concentration, the crystals melt again. Wall-based, pebble-shaped β-phase crystals and facetted α-crystals melt last. Our observations suggest that the substitutional alloys formed in bulk experiments by homogeneous nucleation and subsequent growth are mechanically stable in the absence of solid–fluid interfaces but thermodynamically metastable.},

Light absorption in a molecule involves a coupled lower set of states receiving light energy that causes a transition into an upper set of states. In the reverse process, some energy source, such as an x-ray beam, populates the upper set of molecular states, which then radiates light as it returns to the lower “ground” set of states.

  abstract = {The time-of-flight method is a fundamental approach for characterizing the transport properties of semiconductors. Recently, the transient photocurrent and optical absorption kinetics have been simultaneously measured for thin films; pulsed-light excitation of thin films should give rise to non-negligible in-depth carrier injection. Yet, the effects of in-depth carrier injection on the transient currents and optical absorption have not yet been elucidated theoretically. Here, by considering the in-depth carrier injection in simulations, we found a 1/ t 1− α /2 initial time ( t ) dependence rather than the conventional 1/ t 1− α dependence under a weak external electric field, where α &lt; 1 is the index of dispersive diffusion. The asymptotic transient currents are not influenced by the initial in-depth carrier injection and follow the conventional 1/ t 1+ α time dependence. We also present the relation between the field-dependent mobility coefficient and the diffusion coefficient when the transport is dispersive. The field dependence of the transport coefficients influences the transit time in the photocurrent kinetics dividing two power-law decay regimes. The classical Scher–Montroll theory predicts that a 1 + a 2 = 2 when the initial photocurrent decay is given by 1 / t a 1 and the asymptotic photocurrent decay is given by 1 / t a 2 ⁠ . The results shed light on the interpretation of the power-law exponent of 1 / t a 1 when a 1 + a 2 ≠ 2.},

However, the oxygen release and the transition metals (TMs) dissolution during the (dis)charging process lead to serious safety issues and capacity loss, which highly prevent its application. In this work, we systematically explored the stability of lattice oxygen and TM sites in LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 (NCM811) cathode via investigating various vacancy formations during lithiation/delithiation, and properties such as the number of unpaired spins (NUS), net charges, and d band center were comprehensively studied. In the process of delithiation (x = 1 → 0.75 → 0), the vacancy formation energy of lattice oxygen [E vac (O)] has been identified to follow the order of E vac (O–Mn) &gt; E vac (O–Co) &gt; E vac (O–Ni), and E vac (TMs) shows a consistent trend with the sequence of E vac (Mn) &gt; E vac (Co) &gt; E vac (Ni), demonstrating the importance of Mn to stabilize the structural skeleton. Furthermore, the |NUS| and net charge are proved to be good descriptors for measuring E vac (O/TMs), which show linear correlations with E vac (O) and E vac (TMs), respectively. Li vacancy plays a pivotal role on E vac (O/TMs). E vac (O/TMs) at x = 0.75 vary extremely between the NiCoMnO layer (NCM layer) and the NiO layer (Ni layer), which correlates well with |NUS| and net charge in the NCM layer but aggregates in a small region in the Ni layer due to the effect of Li vacancies. In general, this work provides an in-depth understanding of the instability of lattice oxygen and transition metal sites on the (104) surface of Ni-rich NCM811, which might give new insights into oxygen release and transition metal dissolution in this system.},

  abstract = {Diarylethene (DAE) is one of the most widely used functional units for electrochromic or photochromic materials. To better understand the molecular modification effects on the electrochromic and photochromic properties of DAE, two modification strategies, substitution with functional groups or heteroatoms, were investigated theoretically by density functional theory calculations. It is found that red-shifted absorption spectra caused by a decreased highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap and S 0 → S 1 transition energy during the ring-closing reaction become more significant by adding different functional substituents. In addition, for two isomers, the energy gap and S 0 → S 1 transition energy decreased by heteroatom substitution of S atoms with O or NH, while they increased by replacing two S atoms with CH 2 . For intramolecular isomerization, one-electron excitation is the most effective way to trigger the closed-ring (O → C) reaction, while the open-ring (C → O) reaction occurs most readily in the presence of one-electron reduction. Moreover, it is confirmed that substitution with strong electron donating groups (–OCH 3 /–NH 2 ) or with one O/two CH 2 heteroatoms leads to a more favorable closed-ring (O → C) reaction. Functionalized with strong electron-withdrawing groups (–NO 2 and –COOH) or one/two NH heteroatom substitutions, the open-ring (C → O) reaction is easier. Our results confirmed that the photochromic and electrochromic properties of DAE can be tuned effectively by molecular modifications, which provides theoretical guidance for the design of new DAE-based photochromic/electrochromic materials.},

The TIP4P/ICE model and a Lennard-Jones center were used for water and methane, respectively. To estimate the nucleation rate, the seeding technique was employed. Clusters of the methane hydrate of different sizes were inserted into the aqueous phase of a two-phase gas–liquid equilibrium system at 260 K and 400 bars. Using these systems, we determined the size at which the cluster of the hydrate is critical (i.e., it has 50\% probability of either growing or melting). Since nucleation rates estimated from the seeding technique are sensitive to the choice of the order parameter used to determine the size of the cluster of the solid, we considered several possibilities. We performed brute force simulations of an aqueous solution of methane in water in which the concentration of methane was several times higher than the equilibrium concentration (i.e., the solution was supersaturated). From brute force runs, we infer the value of the nucleation rate for this system rigorously. Subsequently, seeding runs were carried out for this system, and it was found that only two of the considered order parameters were able to reproduce the value of the nucleation rate obtained from brute force simulations. By using these two order parameters, we estimated the nucleation rate under experimental conditions (400 bars and 260 K) to be of the order of log 10 ( J /(m 3 s)) = −7(5).},

The node is a H 2 O defect in CHs that is supposed to be composed of four unsaturated hydrogen bonds. Since CHs are porous crystals that possess cavities that can accommodate small guest molecules, we expect that these guest molecules can be used to tailor the electronic structure of the e − aq @node, and it leads to experimentally observed optical absorption spectra of CHs.

  abstract = {The slow relaxation of interface water (IW) across three primary phases of membranes is relevant to understand the influence of IW on membrane functions at supercooled conditions. To this objective, a total of ∼ 16.26 μ s all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine lipid membranes are carried out. A supercooling-driven drastic slow-down in heterogeneity time scales of the IW is found at the fluid to the ripple to the gel phase transitions of the membranes. At both fluid-to-ripple-to-gel phase transitions, the IW undergoes two dynamic crossovers in Arrhenius behavior with the highest activation energy at the gel phase due to the highest number of hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, the Stokes–Einstein (SE) relation is conserved for the IW near all three phases of the membranes for the time scales derived from the diffusion exponents and the non-Gaussian parameters. However, the SE relation breaks for the time scale obtained from the self-intermediate scattering functions. The behavioral difference in different time scales is universal and found to be an intrinsic property of glass. The first dynamical transition in the α relaxation time of the IW is associated with an increase in the Gibbs energy of activation of hydrogen bond breaking with locally distorted tetrahedral structures, unlike the bulk water. Thus, our analyses unveil the nature of the relaxation time scales of the IW across membrane phase transitions in comparison with the bulk water. The results will be useful to understand the activities and survival of complex biomembranes under supercooled conditions in the future.},

  abstract = {A salient feature of supercooled liquids consists in the dramatic dynamical slowdown they undergo as temperature decreases while no significant structural change is evident. These systems also present dynamical heterogeneities (DH): certain molecules, spatially arranged in clusters, relax various orders of magnitude faster than the others. However, again, no static quantity (such as structural or energetic measures) shows strong direct correlations with such fast-moving molecules. In turn, the dynamic propensity approach, an indirect measure that quantifies the tendency of the molecules to move in a given structural configuration, has revealed that dynamical constraints, indeed, originate from the initial structure. Nevertheless, this approach is not able to elicit which structural quantity is, in fact, responsible for such a behavior. In an effort to remove dynamics from its definition in favor of a static quantity, an energy-based propensity has also been developed for supercooled water, but it could only find positive correlations between the lowest-energy and the least-mobile molecules, while no correlations could be found for those more relevant mobile molecules involved in the DH clusters responsible for the system’s structural relaxation. Thus, in this work, we shall define a defect propensity measure based on a recently introduced structural index that accurately characterizes water structural defects. We shall show that this defect propensity measure provides positive correlations with dynamic propensity, being also able to account for the fast-moving molecules responsible for the structural relaxation. Moreover, time dependent correlations will show that defect propensity represents an appropriate early-time predictor of the long-time dynamical heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {We report a molecular dynamics study of the heterogeneous crystallization of high-pressure glassy water using (plastic) ice VII as a substrate. We focus on the thermodynamic conditions P ∈ [6–8] GPa and T ∈ [100–500] K, at which (plastic) ice VII and glassy water are supposed to coexist in several (exo)planets and icy moons. We find that (plastic) ice VII undergoes a martensitic phase transition to a (plastic) fcc crystal. Depending on the molecular rotational lifetime τ , we identify three rotational regimes: for τ &gt; 20 ps, crystallization does not occur; for τ ∼ 15 ps, we observe a very sluggish crystallization and the formation of a considerable amount of icosahedral environments trapped in a highly defective crystal or in the residual glassy matrix; and for τ &lt; 10 ps, crystallization takes place smoothly, resulting in an almost defect-free plastic fcc solid. The presence of icosahedral environments at intermediate τ is of particular interest as it shows that such a geometry, otherwise ephemeral at lower pressures, is, indeed, present in water. We justify the presence of icosahedral structures based on geometrical arguments. Our results represent the first study of heterogeneous crystallization occurring at thermodynamic conditions of relevance for planetary science and unveil the role of molecular rotations in achieving it. Our findings (i) show that the stability of plastic ice VII, widely reported in the literature, should be reconsidered in favor of plastic fcc, (ii) provide a rationale for the role of molecular rotations in achieving heterogeneous crystallization, and (iii) represent the first evidence of long-living icosahedral structures in water. Therefore, our work pushes forward our understanding of the properties of water.},

  abstract = {The nucleation and growth of calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) is of fundamental importance for the strength development and durability of the concrete. However, the nucleation process of C–S–H is still not fully understood. The present work investigates how C–S–H nucleates by analyzing the aqueous phase of hydrating tricalcium silicate (C 3 S) by applying inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy as well as analytical ultracentrifugation. The results show that the C–S–H formation follows non-classical nucleation pathways associated with the formation of prenucleation clusters (PNCs) of two types. Those PNCs are detected with high accuracy and reproducibility and are two species of the 10 in total, from which the ions (with associated water molecules) are the majority of the species. The evaluation of the density and molar mass of the species shows that the PNCs are much larger than ions, but the nucleation of C–S–H starts with the formation of liquid precursor C–S–H (droplets) with low density and high water content. The growth of these C–S–H droplets is associated with a release of water molecules and a reduction in size. The study gives experimental data on the size, density, molecular mass, and shape and outlines possible aggregation processes of the detected species.},

In this work, we perform global explorations of the potential energy landscapes of neutral clusters made of two pyrene units and one to ten water molecules using a density-functional-based tight-binding (DFTB) potential followed by local optimizations at the density-functional theory level. We discuss the binding energies with respect to various dissociation channels. It shows that cohesion energies of the water clusters interacting with a pyrene dimer are larger than those of the pure water clusters, reaching for the largest clusters an asymptotic limit similar to that of pure water clusters and that, although the hexamer and octamer can be considered magic numbers for isolated water clusters, it is not the case anymore when they are interacting with a pyrene dimer. Ionization potentials are also computed by making use of the configuration interaction extension of DFTB, and we show that in cations, the charge is mostly carried by the pyrene molecules.},

  abstract = {Two isomers of a complex formed between thiazole and two water molecules, thi⋯(H 2 O) 2 , have been identified through Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy between 7.0 and 18.5 GHz. The complex was generated by the co-expansion of a gas sample containing trace amounts of thiazole and water in an inert buffer gas. For each isomer, rotational constants, A 0 , B 0 , and C 0 ; centrifugal distortion constants, D J , D JK , d 1 , and d 2 ; and nuclear quadrupole coupling constants, χ aa (N) and [ χ bb (N) − χ cc (N)], have been determined through fitting of a rotational Hamiltonian to the frequencies of observed transitions. The molecular geometry, energy, and components of the dipole moment of each isomer have been calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The experimental results for four isotopologues of isomer I allow for accurate determinations of atomic coordinates of oxygen atoms by r 0 and r s methods. Isomer II has been assigned as the carrier of an observed spectrum on the basis of very good agreement between DFT-calculated results and a set of spectroscopic parameters (including A 0 , B 0 , and C 0 rotational constants) determined by fitting to measured transition frequencies. Non-covalent interaction and natural bond orbital analyses reveal that two strong hydrogen bonding interactions are present within each of the identified isomers of thi⋯(H 2 O) 2 . The first of these binds H 2 O to the nitrogen of thiazole (OH⋯N), and the second binds the two water molecules (OH⋯O). A third, weaker interaction binds the H 2 O sub-unit to the hydrogen atom that is attached to C2 (for isomer I ) or C4 (for isomer II ) of the thiazole ring (CH⋯O).},

  abstract = {Magic clusters are metastable faceted nanoparticles that are thought to be important and, sometimes, observable intermediates in the nucleation of certain faceted crystallites. This work develops a broken bond model for spheres with a face-centered-cubic packing that form tetrahedral magic clusters. With just one bond strength parameter, statistical thermodynamics yield a chemical potential driving force, an interfacial free energy, and free energy vs magic cluster size. These properties exactly correspond to those from a previous model by Mule et al. [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 143 , 2037 (2021)]. Interestingly, a Tolman length emerges (for both models) when the interfacial area, density, and volume are treated consistently. To describe the kinetic barriers between magic cluster sizes, Mule et al. invoked an energy parameter to penalize the two-dimensional nucleation and growth of new layers in each facet of the tetrahedra. According to the broken bond model, barriers between magic clusters are insignificant without the additional edge energy penalty. We estimate the overall nucleation rate without predicting the rates of formation for intermediate magic clusters by using the Becker–Döring equations. Our results provide a blueprint for constructing free energy models and rate theories for nucleation via magic clusters starting from only atomic-scale interactions and geometric considerations.},

Extracting the ionization energies (IEs) and appearance energy was achieved by measuring the photoionization and photodissociation efficiency curves of the PEA parent and photofragment ions, together with velocity and kinetic energy-broadened spatial map images of photoelectrons. We obtained coinciding upper bounds for the IEs for PEA and PEA-H 2 O of 8.63 ± 0.03 and 8.62 ± 0.04 eV, within the range predicted by quantum calculations. The computed electrostatic potential maps show charge separation, corresponding to a negative charge on phenyl and a positive charge on the ethylamino side chain in the neutral PEA and its monohydrate; in the cations, the charge distributions naturally become positive. The significant changes in geometries upon ionization include switching of the amino group orientation from pyramidal to nearly planar in the monomer but not in the monohydrate, lengthening of the N–H⋯ π hydrogen bond (HB) in both species, C α –C β bond in the side chain of the PEA + monomer, and the intermolecular O–H⋯N HB in PEA-H 2 O cations, leading to distinct exit channels.},

  abstract = {We study the rotational dynamics induced by the recoil effect in diatomic molecules using time-resolved two-color x-ray pump-probe spectroscopy. A short pump x-ray pulse ionizes a valence electron inducing the molecular rotational wave packet, whereas the second time-delayed x-ray pulse probes the dynamics. An accurate theoretical description is used for analytical discussions and numerical simulations. Our main attention is paid to the following two interference effects that influence the recoil-induced dynamics: (i) Cohen–Fano (CF) two-center interference between partial ionization channels in diatomics and (ii) interference between the recoil-excited rotational levels manifesting as the rotational revival structures in the time-dependent absorption of the probe pulse. The time-dependent x-ray absorption is computed for the heteronuclear CO and homonuclear N 2 molecules as showcases. It is found that the effect of CF interference is comparable with the contribution from independent partial ionization channels, especially for the low photoelectron kinetic energy case. The amplitude of the recoil-induced revival structures for the individual ionization decreases monotonously with a decrease in the photoelectron energy, whereas the amplitude of the CF contribution remains sufficient even at the photoelectron kinetic energy below 1 eV. The profile and intensity of the CF interference depend on the phase difference between the individual ionization channels related to the parity of the molecular orbital emitting the photoelectron. This phenomenon provides a sensitive tool for the symmetry analysis of molecular orbitals.},

  abstract = {We present the first-principles determination of the three-body polarizability and the third dielectric virial coefficient of helium. Coupled-cluster and full configuration interaction methods were used to perform electronic structure calculations. The mean absolute relative uncertainty of the trace of the polarizability tensor, resulting from the incompleteness of the orbital basis set, was found to be 4.7\%. Additional uncertainty due to the approximate treatment of triple and the neglect of higher excitations was estimated at 5.7\%. An analytic function was developed to describe the short-range behavior of the polarizability and its asymptotics in all fragmentation channels. We calculated the third dielectric virial coefficient and its uncertainty using the classical and semiclassical Feynman–Hibbs approaches. The results of our calculations were compared with experimental data and with recent Path-Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) calculations [Garberoglio et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 234103 (2021)] employing the so-called superposition approximation of the three-body polarizability. For temperatures above 200 K, we observed a significant discrepancy between the classical results obtained using superposition approximation and the ab initio computed polarizability. For temperatures from 10 K up to 200 K, the differences between PIMC and semiclassical calculations are several times smaller than the uncertainties of our results. Except at low temperatures, our results agree very well with the available experimental data but have much smaller uncertainties. The data reported in this work eliminate the main accuracy bottleneck in the optical pressure standard [Gaiser et al. , Ann.

These results are compared with theoretical predictions. The more readily assigned CO 2 –Ar n species tend to be those with symmetric structures, and CO 2 –Ar 17 represents completion of a highly symmetric (D 5h ) solvation shell. Those not assigned (e.g., n = 7 and 13) are probably also present in the observed spectra but with band structures that are not well-resolved and, thus, are not recognizable. The spectra of CO 2 –Ar 9 , CO 2 –Ar 15 , and CO 2 –Ar 17 suggest the presence of sequences involving very low frequency (≈2 cm −1 ) cluster vibrational modes, an interpretation which should be amenable to theoretical confirmation (or rejection).},

  abstract = {The valence ionization of uracil and mixed water–uracil clusters has been studied experimentally and by ab initio calculations. In both measurements, the spectrum onset shows a red shift with respect to the uracil molecule, with the mixed cluster characterized by peculiar features unexplained by the sum of independent contributions of the water or uracil aggregation. To interpret and assign all the contributions, we performed a series of multi-level calculations, starting from an exploration of several cluster structures using automated conformer-search algorithms based on a tight-binding approach. Ionization energies have been assessed on smaller clusters via a comparison between accurate wavefunction-based approaches and cost-effective DFT-based simulations, the latter of which were applied to clusters up to 12 uracil and 36 water molecules. The results confirm that ( i ) the bottom-up approach based on a multilevel method [Mattioli et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 23 , 1859 (2021)] to the structure of neutral clusters of unknown experimental composition converges to precise structure–property relationships and ( ii ) the coexistence of pure and mixed clusters in the water–uracil samples. A natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis performed on a subset of clusters highlighted the special role of H-bonds in the formation of the aggregates. The NBO analysis yields second-order perturbative energy between the H-bond donor and acceptor orbitals correlated with the calculated ionization energies. This sheds light on the role of the oxygen lone-pairs of the uracil CO group in the formation of strong H-bonds, with a stronger directionality in mixed clusters, giving a quantitative explanation for the formation of core–shell structures.},

Our results show that although the time-averaged solvent structures around a dissolved solute are comparable across compositions, both the solvent fluctuations and solute reorientation dynamics show distinct differences.

The obtained 2D CIR spectra reveal that underneath the broad absorption line shape of ∼500 cm −1 , the transitions exhibit surprisingly narrow intrinsic linewidths with a homogeneous broadening of 175–250 cm −1 . Furthermore, the 2D IR spectra are remarkably invariant, with no sign of spectral diffusion dynamics at waiting times up to 50 ps. Accordingly, we attribute the large static inhomogeneous broadening to the distribution of size and doping level of the QDs. In addition, the two higher-lying P-states of the QDs can be clearly identified in the 2D IR spectra along the diagonal with a cross-peak. However, there is no indication of cross-peak dynamics indicating that, despite the strong spin–orbit coupling in HgSe, transitions between the P-states must be longer than our maximum waiting time of 50 ps. This study illustrates a new frontier of 2D IR spectroscopy enabling the study of intra-band carrier dynamics in nanocrystalline materials across the entire mid-infrared spectrum.},

  abstract = {Solid, powdered samples are often prepared for infrared (IR) spectroscopy analysis in the form of compressed pellets. The intense scattering of incident light by such samples inhibits applications of more advanced IR spectroscopic techniques, such as two-dimensional (2D)-IR spectroscopy. We describe here an experimental approach that enables the measurement of high-quality 2D-IR spectra from scattering pellets of zeolites, titania, and fumed silica in the OD-stretching region of the spectrum under flowing gas and variable temperature up to ∼500 ◦ C. In addition to known scatter suppression techniques, such as phase cycling and polarization control, we demonstrate how a bright probe laser beam comparable in strength with the pump beam provides effective scatter suppression. The possible nonlinear signals arising from this approach are discussed and shown to be limited in consequence. In the intense focus of 2D-IR laser beams, a free-standing solid pellet may become elevated in temperature compared with its surroundings. The effects of steady state and transient laser heating effects on practical applications are discussed.},

  abstract = {We report further investigations to aid the development of a Laplace MP2 (second-order Møller Plesset) method with a range separated Coulomb potential partitioned into short- and long-range parts. The implementation of the method extensively uses sparse matrix algebra, density fitting techniques for the short-range part, and a Fourier transformation in spherical coordinates for the long-range part of the potential. Localized molecular orbitals are employed for the occupied space, whereas virtual space is described by orbital specific virtual orbitals (OSVs) associated with localized molecular orbitals. The Fourier transform is deficient for very large distances between localized occupied orbitals, and a multipole expansion for widely separated pairs is introduced for the direct MP2 contribution, which is applicable also to non-Coulombic potentials that do not satisfy the Laplace equation. For the exchange contribution, an efficient screening of contributing localized occupied pairs is employed, which is discussed more completely here. To mitigate errors due to the truncation of OSVs, a simple and efficient extrapolation procedure is used to obtain results close to MP2 for the full basis set of atomic orbitals Using a suitable set of default parameters, the accuracy of the approach is demonstrated. The current implementation of the approach is not very efficient, and the aim of this paper is to introduce and critically discuss ideas that can have more general applicability beyond MP2 calculations for large molecules.},

  abstract = {Within the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) framework, the real-time NEO time-dependent density functional theory (RT-NEO-TDDFT) approach enables the simulation of coupled electronic-nuclear dynamics. In this approach, the electrons and quantum nuclei are propagated in time on the same footing. A relatively small time step is required to propagate the much faster electronic dynamics, thereby prohibiting the simulation of long-time nuclear quantum dynamics. Herein, the electronic Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation within the NEO framework is presented. In this approach, the electronic density is quenched to the ground state at each time step, and the real-time nuclear quantum dynamics is propagated on an instantaneous electronic ground state defined by both the classical nuclear geometry and the nonequilibrium quantum nuclear density. Because the electronic dynamics is no longer propagated, this approximation enables the use of an order-of-magnitude larger time step, thus greatly reducing the computational cost. Moreover, invoking the electronic BO approximation also fixes the unphysical asymmetric Rabi splitting observed in previous semiclassical RT-NEO-TDDFT simulations of vibrational polaritons even for small Rabi splitting, instead yielding a stable, symmetric Rabi splitting. For the intramolecular proton transfer in malonaldehyde, both RT-NEO-Ehrenfest dynamics and its BO counterpart can describe proton delocalization during the real-time nuclear quantum dynamics. Thus, the BO RT-NEO approach provides the foundation for a wide range of chemical and biological applications.},

These algorithms are known as the Leimkuhler–Matthews (the BAOAB-limited) method and the BAOAB method. Furthermore, the FTS allows for an improved MC algorithm based on the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process (OU MC), which is 2× more efficient than SMC. The system-size dependence of the efficiency for the sampling algorithms is presented, and it is shown that the aforementioned MC algorithms do not scale well with system sizes.

  abstract = {The coupled cluster method is considered a gold standard in quantum chemistry, reliably giving energies that are exact within chemical accuracy (1.6 mhartree). However, even in the coupled cluster single-double (CCSD) approximation, where the cluster operator is truncated to include only single and double excitations, the method scales as O ( N 6 ) in the number of electrons, and the cluster operator needs to be solved for iteratively, increasing the computation time. Inspired by eigenvector continuation, we present here an algorithm making use of the Gaussian processes that provides an improved initial guess for the coupled cluster amplitudes. The cluster operator is written as a linear combination of sample cluster operators that are obtained at particular sample geometries. By reusing the cluster operators from previous calculations in that way, it is possible to obtain a start guess for the amplitudes that surpasses both MP2 guesses and “previous geometry”-guesses in terms of the number of necessary iterations. As this improved guess is very close to the exact cluster operator, it can be used directly to calculate the CCSD energy to chemical accuracy, giving approximate CCSD energies scaling as O ( N 5 ).},

Within the Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, for example, frequent (near) crossings of electronic energy surfaces are induced by the field, suggesting that nonadiabatic phenomena and processes may play a more important role in this mixed-field regime than in the weak-field regime on Earth. To understand the chemistry in the mixed regime, it therefore becomes important to explore non-BO methods. In this work, the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) method is employed to study protonic vibrational excitation energies in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The NEO generalized Hartree–Fock theory and time-dependent Hartree–Fock (TDHF) theory are derived and implemented, accounting for all terms that result as a consequence of the nonperturbative treatment of molecular systems in a magnetic field. The NEO results for HCN and FHF − with clamped heavy nuclei are compared against the quadratic eigenvalue problem. Each molecule has three semi-classical modes owing to the hydrogen—two precession modes that are degenerate in the absence of a field and one stretching mode. The NEO-TDHF model is found to perform well; in particular, it automatically captures the screening effects of the electrons on the nuclei, which are quantified through the difference in energy of the precession modes.},

Although classical response functions (based on Newtonian dynamics) have shown promise in computational 2D IR modeling studies, a simple diagrammatic description has so far been lacking. Recently, we introduced a diagrammatic representation for the 2D IR response functions of a single, weakly anharmonic oscillator and showed that the classical and quantum 2D IR response functions for this system are identical. Here, we extend this result to systems with an arbitrary number of bilinearly coupled, weakly anharmonic oscillators. As in the single-oscillator case, quantum and classical response functions are found to be identical in the weakly anharmonic limit or, in experimental terms, when the anharmonicity is small relative to the optical linewidth. The final form of the weakly anharmonic response function is surprisingly simple and offers potential computational advantages for application to large, multi-oscillator systems.},

For stochastic reaction networks described using the Chemical Master Equation, commonly used methods include time-scale separation, Linear Mapping Approximation, and state-space lumping. Despite the success of these techniques, they appear to be rather disparate, and at present, no general-purpose approach to model reduction for stochastic reaction networks is known. In this paper, we show that most common model reduction approaches for the Chemical Master Equation can be seen as minimizing a well-known information-theoretic quantity between the full model and its reduction, the Kullback–Leibler divergence defined on the space of trajectories. This allows us to recast the task of model reduction as a variational problem that can be tackled using standard numerical optimization approaches. In addition, we derive general expressions for propensities of a reduced system that generalize those found using classical methods. We show that the Kullback–Leibler divergence is a useful metric to assess model discrepancy and to compare different model reduction techniques using three examples from the literature: an autoregulatory feedback loop, the Michaelis–Menten enzyme system, and a genetic oscillator.},

  abstract = {As shown by W. H. Miller in a seminal article [J. Chem. Phys. 53 , 3578 (1970)], the most convenient and accurate semiclassical (SC) theory of molecular scattering in action-angle coordinates is based on the initial value representation (IVR) and the use of shifted angles, which are different from the natural angles usually used in the quantum and classical treatments. Here, we show for an inelastic molecular collision that the initial and final shifted angles define three-segment classical paths that are exactly those involved in the classical-limit of Tannor–Weeks quantum scattering theory [J. Chem. Phys. 98 , 3884 (1993)], provided that the translational wave packets | g + ⟩ and | g − ⟩ into play in this theory are both taken at |0⟩. Assuming this to be the case, using van Vleck propagators, and applying the stationary phase approximation, Miller’s SCIVR expression of S -matrix elements is found, with an additional cut-off factor canceling the energetically forbidden transition probabilities. This factor, however, is close to unity in most practical cases. Furthermore, these developments show that the Møller operators underlie Miller’s formulation, thus confirming, for molecular collisions, the results recently established in the simpler case of light-induced rotational transitions [L. Bonnet, J. Chem. Phys. 153 , 174102 (2020)]. Last but not least, we show, based on the previous results, that for processes involving long-range anisotropic forces, implementing the Skinner–Miller method [Chem. Phys. Lett. 300 , 20 (1999)] in shifted coordinates makes its predictions both easier and more accurate than in natural coordinates.},

  abstract = {In the present work, we introduce a simple means of obtaining an analytical (i.e., grid-free) canonical polyadic (CP) representation of a multidimensional function that is expressed in terms of a set of discrete data. For this, we make use of an initial CP guess, even not fully converged, and a set of auxiliary basis functions [finite basis representation (FBR)]. The resulting CP-FBR expression constitutes the CP counterpart of our previous Tucker sum-of-products-FBR approach. However, as is well-known, CP expressions are much more compact. This has obvious advantages in high-dimensional quantum dynamics. The power of CP-FBR lies in the fact that it requires a grid much coarser than the one needed for the dynamics. In a subsequent step, the basis functions can be interpolated to any desired density of grid points. This is useful, for instance, when different initial conditions (e.g., energy content) of a system are to be considered. We show the application of the method to bound systems of increased dimensionality: H 2 (3D), HONO (6D), and CH 4 (9D).},

  abstract = {Arguably, the main challenge of nucleation theory is to accurately evaluate the work of formation of a critical embryo in the new phase, which governs the nucleation rate. In Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT), this work of formation is estimated using the capillarity approximation, which relies on the value of the planar surface tension. This approximation has been blamed for the large discrepancies between predictions from CNT and experiments. In this work, we present a study of the free energy of formation of critical clusters of the Lennard-Jones fluid truncated and shifted at 2.5 σ using Monte Carlo simulations, density gradient theory, and density functional theory. We find that density gradient theory and density functional theory accurately reproduce molecular simulation results for critical droplet sizes and their free energies. The capillarity approximation grossly overestimates the free energy of small droplets. The incorporation of curvature corrections up to the second order with the Helfrich expansion greatly remedies this and performs very well for most of the experimentally accessible regions. However, it is imprecise for the smallest droplets and largest metastabilities since it does not account for a vanishing nucleation barrier at the spinodal. To remedy this, we propose a scaling function that uses all relevant ingredients without adding fitting parameters. The scaling function reproduces accurately the free energy of the formation of critical droplets for the entire metastability range and all temperatures examined and deviates from density gradient theory by less than one k B T .},

  abstract = {Surfactants are commonly used as disinfection agents in personal care products against bacteria and viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. However, there is a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the inactivation of viruses by surfactants. Here, we employ coarse grain (CG) and all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction between general families of surfactants and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. To this end, we considered a CG model of a full virion. Overall, we found that surfactants have only a small impact on the virus envelope, being inserted into the envelope without dissolving it or generating pores, at the conditions considered here. However, we found that surfactants may induce a deep impact on the spike protein of the virus (responsible for its infectivity), easily covering it and inducing its collapse over the envelope surface of the virus. AA simulations confirmed that both negatively and positively charged surfactants are able to extensively adsorb over the spike protein and get inserted into the virus envelope. Our results suggest that the best strategy for the design of surfactants as virucidal agents will be to focus on those strongly interacting with the spike protein.},

  abstract = {We report the first numerical calculations in which converged Matsubara dynamics is compared directly with exact quantum dynamics with no artificial damping of the time-correlation functions (TCFs). The system treated is a Morse oscillator coupled to a harmonic bath. We show that, when the system–bath coupling is sufficiently strong, the Matsubara calculations can be converged by explicitly including up to M = 200 Matsubara modes, with the remaining modes included as a harmonic “tail” correction. The resulting Matsubara TCFs are in near-perfect agreement with the exact quantum TCFs, for non-linear as well as linear operators, at a temperature at which the TCFs are dominated by quantum thermal fluctuations. These results provide compelling evidence that incoherent classical dynamics can arise in the condensed phase at temperatures at which the statistics are dominated by quantum (Boltzmann) effects, as a result of smoothing of imaginary-time Feynman paths. The techniques developed here may also lead to efficient methods for benchmarking system–bath dynamics in the overdamped regime.},

Experiments have shown that a peptoid sequence with a helical secondary structure assembles into microspheres that are stable under various conditions. The conformation and organization of the peptoids within the assemblies remains unknown and is elucidated in this study via a hybrid, bottom-up coarse-graining approach. The resultant coarse-grained (CG) model preserves the chemical and structural details that are critical for capturing the secondary structure of the peptoid. The CG model accurately captures the overall conformation and solvation of the peptoids in an aqueous solution. Furthermore, the model resolves the assembly of multiple peptoids into a hemispherical aggregate that is in qualitative agreement with the corresponding results from experiments. The mildly hydrophilic peptoid residues are placed along the curved interface of the aggregate. The composition of the residues on the exterior of the aggregate is determined by two conformations adopted by the peptoid chains. Hence, the CG model simultaneously captures sequence-specific features and the assembly of a large number of peptoids. This multiscale, multiresolution coarse-graining approach could help in predicting the organization and packing of other tunable oligomeric sequences of relevance to biomedicine and electronics.},

We use a recently developed theoretical framework predicting the analytical form of stress–stress correlations in amorphous assemblies of athermal grains that acquire rigidity under an external load. These correlations exhibit a pinch-point singularity in Fourier space. This leads to long-range correlations and strong anisotropy in real space, which are at the origin of force-chains in granular solids. Our analysis of the model particulate gels at low particle volume fractions demonstrates that stress–stress correlations in these soft materials have characteristics very similar to those in granular solids and can be used to identify force chains. We show that the stress–stress correlations can distinguish floppy from rigid gel networks and that the intensity patterns reflect changes in shear moduli and network topology, due to the emergence of rigid structures during solidification.},

Phys. 154 , 094103 (2021)]. Such huge fluctuating states are sampled from the highly excited states of clusters of 12 boron atoms (B 12 ), which have densely quasi-degenerate electronic excited-state manifold, each adiabatic state of which gets promptly mixed with other states through the frequent and enduring nonadiabatic interactions within the manifold. Yet, the wavepacket states are expected to be of very long lifetimes. This excited-state electronic wavepacket dynamics is extremely interesting but very hard to analyze since they are usually represented in large time-dependent configuration interaction wavefunctions and/or in some other complicated forms. We have found that ENO gives an invariant energy orbital picture to characterize not only the static highly correlated electronic wavefunctions but also those time-dependent electronic wavefunctions. Hence, we first demonstrate how the ENO representation works for some general cases, choosing proton transfer in water dimer and electron-deficient multicenter chemical bonding in diborane in the ground state. We then penetrate with ENO deep into the analysis of the essential nature of nonadiabatic electron wavepacket dynamics in the excited states and show the mechanism of the coexistence of huge electronic fluctuation and rather strong chemical bonds under very random electron flows within the molecule. To quantify the intra-molecular energy flow associated with the huge electronic-state fluctuation, we define and numerically demonstrate what we call the electronic energy flux.},

  abstract = {Tungsten (W) is a material of choice for the divertor material due to its high melting temperature, thermal conductivity, and sputtering threshold. However, W has a very high brittle-to-ductile transition temperature, and at fusion reactor temperatures (≥1000 K), it may undergo recrystallization and grain growth. Dispersion-strengthening W with zirconium carbide (ZrC) can improve ductility and limit grain growth, but much of the effects of the dispersoids on microstructural evolution and thermomechanical properties at high temperatures are still unknown. We present a machine learned Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential for W–ZrC that can now be used to study these materials. In order to construct a potential suitable for large-scale atomistic simulations at fusion reactor temperatures, it is necessary to train on ab initio data generated for a diverse set of structures, chemical environments, and temperatures. Further accuracy and stability tests of the potential were achieved using objective functions for both material properties and high temperature stability. Validation of lattice parameters, surface energies, bulk moduli, and thermal expansion is confirmed on the optimized potential. Tensile tests of W/ZrC bicrystals show that although the W(110)–ZrC(111) C-terminated bicrystal has the highest ultimate tensile strength (UTS) at room temperature, observed strength decreases with increasing temperature. At 2500 K, the terminating C layer diffuses into the W, resulting in a weaker W–Zr interface. Meanwhile, the W(110)–ZrC(111) Zr-terminated bicrystal has the highest UTS at 2500 K.},

We show that, when a diffusive trajectory x t is sampled at finite time intervals δt , the resulting error in measuring the first passage time to a given domain can exceed the time resolution of the measurement by more than an order of magnitude. Such surprisingly large errors originate from the fact that the trajectory may enter and exit the domain while being unobserved, thereby lengthening the apparent first passage time by an amount that is larger than δt . Such systematic errors are particularly important in single-molecule studies of barrier crossing dynamics. We show that the correct first passage times, as well as other properties of the trajectories such as splitting probabilities, can be recovered via a stochastic algorithm that reintroduces unobserved first passage events probabilistically.},

Given the current urgent concerns regarding climate change, research into renewable energy solutions is crucially important. In this perspective article, we highlight several key aspects of organic photovoltaics, ranging from fundamental understanding to implementation, that need to be addressed to ensure the success of this promising technology. We cover the intriguing ability of some acceptors to undergo efficient charge photogeneration in the absence of an energetic driving force and the effects of the resulting state hybridization. We explore one of the primary loss mechanisms of organic photovoltaics—non-radiative voltage losses—and the influence of the energy gap law. Triplet states are becoming increasingly relevant owing to their presence in even the most efficient non-fullerene blends, and we assess their role as both a loss mechanism and a potential strategy to enhance efficiency. Finally, two ways in which the implementation of organic photovoltaics can be simplified are addressed. The standard bulk heterojunction architecture could be superseded by either single material photovoltaics or sequentially deposited heterojunctions, and the attributes of both are considered. While several important challenges still lie ahead for organic photovoltaics, their future is, indeed, bright.},

  abstract = {Allostery is an important regulatory mechanism of protein functions. Among allosteric proteins, certain protein structure types are more observed. However, how allosteric regulation depends on protein topology remains elusive. In this study, we extracted protein topology graphs at the fold level and found that known allosteric proteins mainly contain multiple domains or subunits and allosteric sites reside more often between two or more domains of the same fold type. Only a small fraction of fold–fold combinations are observed in allosteric proteins, and homo-fold–fold combinations dominate. These analyses imply that the locations of allosteric sites including cryptic ones depend on protein topology. We further developed TopoAlloSite, a novel method that uses the kernel support vector machine to predict the location of allosteric sites on the overall protein topology based on the subgraph-matching kernel. TopoAlloSite successfully predicted known cryptic allosteric sites in several allosteric proteins like phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase, spermidine synthase, and sirtuin 6, demonstrating its power in identifying cryptic allosteric sites without performing long molecular dynamics simulations or large-scale experimental screening. Our study demonstrates that protein topology largely determines how its function can be allosterically regulated, which can be used to find new druggable targets and locate potential binding sites for rational allosteric drug design.},

We consider different arrangements of the obstacles. In particular, we consider two particular situations corresponding to experimentally realizable settings. First, we model pinning particles in (non-overlapping) random positions and, second, in a percolating gel structure and provide an extensive characterization of the structure and dynamics of ABPs in these complex environments. We find that the confinement increases the heterogeneity of the dynamics, with new populations of absorbed and localized particles appearing close to the obstacles. This heterogeneity has a profound impact on the motility induced phase separation exhibited by the particles at high activity, ranging from nucleation and growth in random disorder to a complex phase separation in porous environments.},

To date, the analysis of the most general models of this class has necessitated simulation. We present a general method for analyzing such processes without resorting to simulation. Our method can be applied to models with an arbitrary network of sub-steps prior to addition or removal of a monomer, including non-equilibrium kinetic proofreading cycles. Moreover, the approach allows for a dependency of addition and removal reactions on the neighboring site in the copolymer and thermodynamically self-consistent models in which all steps are assumed to be microscopically reversible. Using our approach, thermodynamic quantities such as chemical work; kinetic quantities such as time taken to grow; and statistical quantities such as the distribution of monomer types in the growing copolymer can be directly derived either analytically or numerically from the model definition.},

For this purpose, the film is illuminated with a light pattern of alternating bright and dark stripes in both cases. The simulations use a molecular mechanics switching potential to explicitly describe the photoisomerization dynamics between the E and Z isomers of the azo-units and take into account the orientation of the transition dipole moment with respect to the light polarization. Local heating and elevation of the illuminated regions with the subsequent movement of molecules into the neighboring dark regions are observed. This leads to the formation of valleys in the bright areas after re-cooling and is independent of the polarization direction. To verify these observations experimentally, the azopolymer film is illuminated with bright stripes of varying width using a spatial light modulator. Atomic force microscopy images confirm that the elevated areas correspond to the previously dark areas.

  abstract = {The steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic (SEAQT) framework is used to explore the influence of heating and cooling on polymer chain folding kinetics. The framework predicts how a chain moves from an initial non-equilibrium state to stable equilibrium along a unique thermodynamic path. The thermodynamic state is expressed by occupation probabilities corresponding to the levels of a discrete energy landscape. The landscape is generated using the Replica Exchange Wang–Landau method applied to a polymer chain represented by a sequence of hydrophobic and polar monomers with a simple hydrophobic-polar amino acid model. The chain conformation evolves as energy shifts among the levels of the energy landscape according to the principle of steepest entropy ascent. This principle is implemented via the SEAQT equation of motion. The SEAQT framework has the benefit of providing insight into structural properties under non-equilibrium conditions. Chain conformations during heating and cooling change continuously without sharp transitions in morphology. The changes are more drastic along non-equilibrium paths than along quasi-equilibrium paths. The SEAQT-predicted kinetics are fitted to rates associated with the experimental intensity profiles of cytochrome c protein folding with Rouse dynamics.},

  abstract = {Polymer membranes are typically assumed to be inert and nonresponsive to the flux and density of the permeating particles in transport processes. Here, we theoretically study the consequences of membrane responsiveness and feedback on the steady-state force–flux relations and membrane permeability using a nonlinear-feedback solution–diffusion model of transport through a slab-like membrane. Therein, the solute concentration inside the membrane depends on the bulk concentration, c 0 , the driving force, f , and the polymer volume fraction, ϕ . In our model, the solute accumulation in the membrane causes a sigmoidal volume phase transition of the polymer, changing its permeability, which, in return, affects the membrane’s solute uptake. This feedback leads to nonlinear force–flux relations, j ( f ), which we quantify in terms of the system’s differential permeability, P sys Δ ∝ d j / d f ⁠ . We find that the membrane feedback can increase or decrease the solute flux by orders of magnitude, triggered by a small change in the driving force and largely tunable by attractive vs repulsive solute–membrane interactions. Moreover, controlling the inputs, c 0 and f , can lead to the steady-state bistability of ϕ and hysteresis in the force–flux relations. This work advocates that the fine-tuning of the membrane’s chemo-responsiveness will enhance the nonlinear transport control features, providing great potential for future (self-)regulating membrane devices.},

  abstract = {Normally, defects in two-dimensional, circular, confined liquid crystals can be classified into four types based on the position of singularities formed by liquid crystal molecules, i.e., the singularities located inside the circle, at the boundary, outside the circle, and outside the circle at infinity. However, it is considered difficult for small aspect ratio liquid crystals to generate all these four types of defects. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the defect formed in Gay–Berne, ellipsoidal liquid crystals, with small aspect ratios confined in a circular cavity. As expected, we only find two types of defects (inside the circle and at the boundary) in circular, confined, Gay–Berne ellipsoids under static conditions at various densities, aspect ratios, and interactions between the wall and liquid crystals. However, when introducing an external field to the system, four types of defects can be observed. With increasing the strength of the external field, the singularities in the circular, confined system change from the inside to the boundary and the outside, and the farthest position that the singularities can reach depends on the strength of the external field. We further introduce an alternating, triangular wave, external field to the system to check if we can observe the transformation of different defects within an oscillating period. We find that the position of the singularities greatly depends on the oscillating intensity and oscillating period. By changing the oscillating intensity and oscillating period of the external field, the defect types can be adjusted, and the transformation between different defects can be easily observed. This provides a feasible way to modulate liquid crystal defects and investigate the transformation between different defects.},

Using the Bawendi–Freed approach to model semi-flexible chains, an expression for the Landau free energy is derived in the weak segregation regime, which includes density and orientation order-parameters. The orientation order-parameter is described in the smectic phase and in more complicated structures, such as the hexagonal phase. The Landau free energy contains contributions of two kinds of interactions. The first kind is the Flory–Huggins interaction, which describes the incompatibility of chemically different blocks and may induce microphase separation. The second kind is the Maier–Saupe interaction, which may induce nematic ordering. In the framework of the weak segregation limit, the Landau theory allows us to predict phase structures in the melt as a function of the composition, persistence length, and the strength of the Flory–Huggins and Maier–Saupe interaction. The general theory is applied to a simple system of monodisperse semi-flexible diblock copolymers. In several phase diagrams, a number of possible phase structures are predicted, such as the bcc, hexagonal, smectic-A, smectic-C, and nematic phase. The influence of the Maier–Saupe interaction on the microphase structure is thoroughly discussed.},

The corresponding Watson Hamiltonian can be written using angular momentum cylindrical ladder operators ( J z , J ± = J x ∓ iJ y ) possessing the Lie algebra su (2) commutation relations [ J + , J − ] = 2 J z , [ J z , J ± ] = ± J ± . The reduced effective Hamiltonians suitable for fitting to observed spectra are traditionally based on Hermitian basis sets, e.g., ( J 2 ) l J z n , ( J + m + J − m ) + ⁠ . It is beneficial to re-express such Hamiltonians using sums of normal ordered products of ladder operators J z a J + b J − c ⁠ . For instance, in the CPT, the unitary transformations reduce to the normal ordering problem. Similarly, the dipole moment transition probabilities can be evaluated using Wigner functions, D 0 , ε 1 ( ε = 0 , ± 1 ) ⁠ , possessing complex commutation relations with J α -operators. The related line strengths are proportional to the squared matrix elements of the unitary transformed dipole moment operator given by a polynomial in normal ordered products D 0 , ε 1 J z a J + b J − c ⁠ . We have applied the technique of combinatorial calculations associated with the classical representation theory and obtained compact formulas for normal ordering of the typical raw products J z a J + b J − c J z d J + e J − f and J z a J + b J − c D 0 , ε 1 ⁠ . The theory of universal enveloping Lie algebras and representation theory show that the resulting formulas cannot be further improved from the mathematical point of view. The results have a wide scope of applications in other fields of physics, including other operators with the same commutation properties. The resulting expressions for normal orderings and routines for evaluation of matrix elements, as well as the systematic tests of working formulas, were coded in Fortran and the software is available through the GitHub hosting service.},

In this work, we implemented a Hückel program using differentiable programming with the JAX framework based on limited modifications of a pre-existing NumPy version. The auto-differentiable Hückel code enabled efficient gradient-based optimization of model parameters tuned for excitation energies and molecular polarizabilities, respectively, based on as few as 100 data points from density functional theory simulations. In particular, the facile computation of the polarizability, a second-order derivative, via auto-differentiation shows the potential of differentiable programming to bypass the need for numeric differentiation or derivation of analytical expressions. Finally, we employ gradient-based optimization of atom identity for inverse design of organic electronic materials with targeted orbital energy gaps and polarizabilities. Optimized structures are obtained after as little as 15 iterations using standard gradient-based optimization algorithms.},

However, the underlying reaction mechanism between this HC dual-salt electrolyte and the lithium metal anode surface remains unknown.

Furthermore, after extending the simulation to 1.1 ns via the HAIR scheme, the decomposition reactions of DME solvent molecules were also observed, producing LiOCH 3 , C 2 H 4 , and precursors of organic oligomers.

Here, we demonstrate a vertically aligned Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene based micro-supercapacitor with an excellent electrochemical performance by a liquid nitrogen-assisted freeze-drying method. The vertical arrangement of the 2D MXene sheets allows for directional ion transport, enabling the vertical-MXene based MSCs to exhibit thickness-independent electrochemical properties even in thick films. In addition, the MSCs displayed a high areal capacitance of 87 mF cm −2 at 10 mV s −1 along with an excellent stability of ∼87.4\% after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles. Furthermore, the vertical-MXene approach proposed here is scalable and can be extended to other systems involving directional transport.},

Single pulse irradiation experiments were conducted to study the oxygen content of the laser-affected zone through energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry. The results show that laser-induced thermal oxidation is a complex dynamic process with the interactions among H, C, O, and Si atoms. The oxidation zone includes an oxide layer, a graphite layer, and a C-rich layer. With an increase in oxygen concentration, the amorphous oxide layer changes from silicon oxide to silicon dioxide. In addition, the formation of carbon clusters at the interface between SiO x and C-rich layers promotes the desorption of the oxide layer. The mechanism revealed in this study provides theoretical guidance for high-quality processing of 4H–SiC at atomic and close-to-atomic scales.},

Here, we systematically investigated the coaction effect of radiative and non-radiative damping on the lifetime of the super-radiant and sub-radiant LSPR modes of gold nanorods using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (TR-PEEM). The results show that the lifetime of the LSPR mode depends on the length of the gold nanorod, and the different variation behavior of an LSPR mode lifetime exists between the super-radiative mode and the sub-radiative one with the increase of nanorod length (volume). Surprisingly, it is found that the lifetime of the super-radiant LSPR mode can be comparable to or even longer than that of the sub-radiant LSPR mode, instead of the usual claim that a sub-radiant LSPR mode has a longer life than the super-radiant mode. Those TR-PEEM experimental results are supported by finite-difference time-domain simulations and are well explained by the coaction effect with the calculation of the radiative and non-radiative damping rate with the increase of the nanorod volume. We believe that this study is beneficial to build a low-threshold nano-laser and ultrasensitive molecular spectroscopy system.},

In the present study, we examine the microscopic structure and dynamics of pure 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium fluorosulfonyl(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (Pyrr 1,3 FTA) IL using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. How the addition of the sodium salt (NaFTA) having the same anion changes the structural landscape and transport properties of the pure IL has also been explored. The simulated x-ray scattering structure functions reveal that the gradual addition of NaFTA salt (up to 1.2 molal) suppresses the charge alternating feature of the pure IL because of the replacement of the Pyrr + cations with the Na + ions. The Na + ions are majorly found near the oxygen atoms of the anions, but the probability of finding the Na + ions near these atoms slightly decreases with increasing salt concentration. As expected, the Na + ions stay away from the Pyrr + cations. However, the probability of finding the anions around anions increases with increasing salt concentration. The simulated self-diffusion coefficients of the ions in the pure IL reveal slightly faster diffusion of the Pyrr + cations as compared to the FTA − anions. Interestingly, in the salt solution, despite having smaller size, the diffusion of the Na + ions is found to be lesser than the Pyrr + cations and the FTA − anions. The analysis of the ionic conductivity and transport numbers reveals that the fractional contribution of the FTA − anion to the overall conductivity remains nearly constant with increasing salt concentration, but the contribution of Pyrr + cation decreases and Na + ion increases.},

In addition to simplifying the selection of the atomic fingerprints, this strategy can also considerably increase the overall accuracy of the network representation. To tackle the simultaneous training of the atomic fingerprint parameters and NN weights, we adopt an annealing protocol that progressively cycles the learning rate, significantly improving the accuracy of the NN potential. We test the performance of the network potential against the mW model of water, which is a classical three-body potential that well captures the anomalies of the liquid phase. Trained on just three state points, the NN potential is able to reproduce the mW model in a very wide range of densities and temperatures, from negative pressures to several GPa, capturing the transition from an open random tetrahedral network to a dense interpenetrated network. The NN potential also reproduces very well properties for which it was not explicitly trained, such as dynamical properties and the structure of the stable crystalline phases of mW.},

  abstract = {Due to the electron correlation, the fast removal of an electron from a molecule may create a coherent superposition of cationic states and in this way initiate pure electronic dynamics in which the hole-charge left by the ionization migrates throughout the system on an ultrashort time scale. The coupling to the nuclear motion introduces a decoherence that eventually traps the charge, and crucial questions in the field of attochemistry include how long the electronic coherence lasts and which nuclear degrees of freedom are mostly responsible for the decoherence. Here, we report full-dimensional quantum calculations of the concerted electron-nuclear dynamics following outer-valence ionization of propynamide, which reveal that the pure electronic coherences last only 2–3 fs before being destroyed by the nuclear motion. Our analysis shows that the normal modes that are mostly responsible for the fast electronic decoherence are the symmetric in-plane modes. All other modes have little or no effect on the charge migration. This information can be useful to guide the development of reduced dimensionality models for larger systems or the search for molecules with long coherence times.},

  abstract = {Recently, Ma et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118 , 027402 (2017)] have suggested that water molecules encapsulated in (6,5) single-wall carbon nanotube experience a temperature-induced quasiphase transition around 150 K interpreted as changes in the water dipoles orientation. We discuss further this temperature-driven quasiphase transition performing quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations and, most importantly, suggesting a simple lattice model to reproduce the properties of the one-dimensional confined finite arrays of water molecules. The lattice model takes into account not only the short-range and long-range interactions but also the rotations in a narrow tube, and both ingredients provide an explanation for a temperature-driven orientational ordering of the water molecules, which persists within a relatively wide temperature range.},

  abstract = {The trade-off of stiffness and ductility of metals has long plagued materials scientists. To address this issue, atomic structure designs of short-range ordering (SRO) to sub-nanometer and nanometer scales have received much interest in tailoring the atomic environment and electronic interaction between solute and solvent atoms. Taking an example of Al–Li alloy with high specific stiffness and reverse correlation of Young’s modulus and melting point, in this work, we investigate the SRO-dependent stiffness and intrinsic ductile–brittle properties by performing a full-configuration strategy containing various structural ordering features. It suggests that the short-range ordered arrangement of Li atoms can effectively enhance the stiffness while keeping ductility, playing a hydrostatic pressure-like role. Our findings present fundamental knowledge to enable high stiffness and ductility for solvent phases with low modulus through designing local short-range ordered cluster structures.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns the representation of angular momentum operators in the Born–Oppenheimer theory of polyatomic molecules and the various forms of the associated conservation laws. Topics addressed include the question of whether these conservation laws are exactly equivalent or only to some order of the Born–Oppenheimer parameter κ = ( m / M ) 1/4 and what the correlation is between angular momentum quantum numbers in the various representations. These questions are addressed in both problems involving a single potential energy surface and those with multiple, strongly coupled surfaces and in both the electrostatic model and those for which fine structure and electron spin are important. The analysis leads to an examination of the transformation laws under rotations of the electronic Hamiltonian; of the basis states, both adiabatic and diabatic, along with their phase conventions; of the potential energy matrix; and of the derivative couplings. These transformation laws are placed in the geometrical context of the structures in the nuclear configuration space that are induced by rotations, which include the rotational orbits or fibers, the surfaces upon which the orientation of the molecule changes but not its shape, and the section, an initial value surface that cuts transversally through the fibers. Finally, it is suggested that the usual Born–Oppenheimer approximation can be replaced by a dressing transformation, that is, a sequence of unitary transformations that block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian. When the dressing transformation is carried out, we find that the angular momentum operator does not change. This is a part of a system of exact equivalences among various representations of angular momentum operators in Born–Oppenheimer theory. Our analysis accommodates large-amplitude motions and is not dependent on small-amplitude expansions about an equilibrium position. Our analysis applies to noncollinear configurations of a polyatomic molecule; this covers all but a subset of measure zero (the collinear configurations) in the nuclear configuration space.},

  abstract = {Mode-dependent H atom tunneling dynamics of the O–H bond predissociation of the S 1 phenol has been theoretically analyzed. As the tunneling is governed by the complicated multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces that are dynamically shaped by the upper-lying S 1 (ππ*)/S 2 (πσ*) conical intersection, the mode-specific tunneling dynamics of phenol (S 1 ) has been quite formidable to be understood. Herein, we have examined the topography of the potential energy surface along the particular S 1 vibrational mode of interest at the nuclear configurations of the S 1 minimum and S 1 /S 2 conical intersection. The effective adiabatic tunneling barrier experienced by the reactive flux at the particular S 1 vibrational mode excitation is then uniquely determined by the topographic shape of the potential energy surface extended along the conical intersection seam coordinate associated with the particular vibrational mode. The resultant multi-dimensional coupling of the specific vibrational mode to the tunneling coordinate is then reflected in the mode-dependent tunneling rate as well as nonadiabatic transition probability. Remarkably, the mode-specific experimental result of the S 1 phenol tunneling reaction [K. C. Woo and S. K. Kim, J. Phys. Chem. A 123 , 1529–1537 (2019)] (in terms of the qualitative and relative mode-dependent dynamic behavior) could be well rationalized by semi-classical calculations based on the mode-specific topography of the effective tunneling barrier, providing the clear conceptual insight that the skewed potential energy surfaces along the conical intersection seam (strongly or weakly coupled to the tunneling reaction coordinate) may dictate the tunneling dynamics in the proximity of the conical intersection.},

Here, we focus on the optimal clustering using variational kinetic parameters, linked to Markov processes defined on the underlying networks, namely, the slowest relaxation time and the Kemeny constant. We derive novel relations in terms of mean first passage times for optimizing clustering via the Kemeny constant and show that the optimal clustering boundaries have equal round-trip times to the clusters they separate. We also propose an efficient method that first projects the network nodes onto a 1D reaction coordinate and subsequently performs a variational boundary search using a parallel tempering algorithm, where the variational kinetic parameters act as an energy function to be extremized. We find that maximization of the Kemeny constant is effective in detecting communities, while the slowest relaxation time allows for detection of transition nodes. We demonstrate the validity of our method on several test systems, including synthetic networks generated from the stochastic block model and real world networks (Santa Fe Institute collaboration network, a network of co-purchased political books, and a street network of multiple cities in Luxembourg). Our approach is compared with existing clustering algorithms based on modularity and the robust Perron cluster analysis, and the identified transition nodes are compared with different notions of node centrality.},

  abstract = {We present a nonadiabatic classical-trajectory approach that offers the best of both worlds between fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) and quasiclassical mapping dynamics. This mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) propagates the nuclei on the active adiabatic potential-energy surface, such as in FSSH. However, unlike in FSSH, transitions between active surfaces are deterministic and occur when the electronic mapping variables evolve between specified regions of the electronic phase space. This guarantees internal consistency between the active surface and the electronic degrees of freedom throughout the dynamics. MASH is rigorously derivable from exact quantum mechanics as a limit of the quantum–classical Liouville equation (QCLE), leading to a unique prescription for momentum rescaling and frustrated hops. Hence, a quantum-jump procedure can, in principle, be used to systematically converge the accuracy of the results to that of the QCLE. This jump procedure also provides a rigorous framework for deriving approximate decoherence corrections similar to those proposed for FSSH. We apply MASH to simulate the nonadiabatic dynamics in various model systems and show that it consistently produces more accurate results than FSSH at a comparable computational cost.},

In order to better learn and estimate the battery SOC, MKRVM is used to establish a model to estimate lithium–ion battery SOC. WOA is used to automatically adjust and optimize weights and kernel parameters of MKRVM to improve estimation accuracy. The proposed model is validated with three lithium–ion batteries under different operating conditions. In contrast to other optimization algorithms, WOA has a better optimization effect and can estimate the SOC more accurately. In contrast to the single kernel function, the proposed multi-kernel function greatly improves the precision of the SOC estimation model. In contrast to the traditional method, the WOA-MKRVM has a higher precision of SOC estimation.},

  abstract = {Functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) are complex objects present in a variety of systems ranging from synthetic grafted nanoparticles to viruses. The morphology and number of the decorating groups can vary widely between systems. Thus, the modeling of functionalized NPs typically considers simplified spherical objects as a first-order approximation. At the nanoscale label, complex hydrodynamic interactions are expected to emerge as the morphological features of the particles change, and they can be further amplified when the NPs are confined or near walls. Direct estimation of these variations can be inferred via diffusion coefficients of the NPs. However, the evaluation of the coefficients requires an improved representation of the NPs morphology to reproduce important features hidden by simplified spherical models. Here, we characterize the passive transport of free and confined functionalized nanoparticles using the Rigid Multi-Blob (RMB) method. The main advantage of RMB is its versatility to approximate the mobility of complex structures at the nanoscale with significant accuracy and reduced computational cost. In particular, we investigate the effect of functional groups’ distribution, size, and morphology over nanoparticle translational and rotational diffusion. We identify that the presence of functional groups significantly affects the rotational diffusion of the nanoparticles; moreover, the morphology of the groups and number induce characteristic mobility reduction compared to non-functionalized nanoparticles. Confined NPs also evidenced important alterations in their diffusivity, with distinctive signatures in the off-diagonal contributions of the rotational diffusion. These results can be exploited in various applications, including biomedical, polymer nanocomposite fabrication, drug delivery, and imaging.},

The DFT is developed to study the interfacial properties of hydrogen, helium, neon, deuterium, and their mixtures, i.e., fluids that are strongly influenced by quantum effects at low temperatures. White Bear fundamental measure theory is used for the hard-sphere contribution of the Helmholtz energy functional, and a weighted density approximation is used for the dispersion contribution. For mixtures, a contribution is included to account for non-additivity in the Lorentz–Berthelot combination rule. Predictions of the radial distribution function from DFT are in excellent agreement with results from molecular simulations, both for pure components and mixtures. Above the normal boiling point and 5\% below the critical temperature, the DFT yields surface tensions of neon, hydrogen, and deuterium with average deviations from experiments of 7.5\%, 4.4\%, and 1.8\%, respectively. The surface tensions of hydrogen/deuterium, para -hydrogen/helium, deuterium/helium, and hydrogen/neon mixtures are reproduced with a mean absolute error of 5.4\%, 8.1\%, 1.3\%, and 7.5\%, respectively. The surface tensions are predicted with an excellent accuracy at temperatures above 20 K. The poor accuracy below 20 K is due to the inability of Feynman–Hibbs-corrected Mie potentials to represent the real fluid behavior at these conditions, motivating the development of new intermolecular potentials. This DFT can be leveraged in the future to study confined fluids and assess the performance of porous materials for hydrogen storage and transport.},

In the quantum limit, MQC reproduces the semiclassical Double Herman–Kluk IVR results, accurately capturing nuclear quantum coherences and conserving zero-point energy. However, in the classical limit, although MQC mimics the Husimi-IVR for real-time correlation functions with linear operators, it is significantly less accurate for non-linear correlation functions with errors even at time zero. Here, we identify the origin of this discrepancy in the MQC formulation and propose a modification. We analytically show that the modified MQC approach is exact for all correlation functions at time zero, and in a study of zero-point energy (ZPE) flow, we numerically demonstrate that it correctly obtains the quantum and classical limits as a function of time. Interestingly, although classical-limit MQC simulations show the expected, unphysical ZPE leakage, we find that it is possible to predict and even modify the direction of ZPE flow through selective quantization of the system, with the quantum-limit modes accepting energy but preserving the minimum quantum mechanically required energy.},

  abstract = {In polaritons, the properties of matter are modified by mixing the molecular transitions with light modes inside a cavity. Resultant hybrid light–matter states exhibit energy level shifts, are delocalized over many molecular units, and have a different excited-state potential energy landscape, which leads to modified exciton dynamics. Previously, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians have been derived to describe the excited states of molecules coupled to surface plasmons (i.e., plexcitons), and these operators have been successfully used in the description of linear and third order optical response. In this article, we rigorously derive non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in the response function formalism of nonlinear spectroscopy by means of Feshbach operators and apply them to explore spectroscopic signatures of plexcitons. In particular, we analyze the optical response below and above the exceptional point that arises for matching transition energies for plasmon and molecular components and study their decomposition using double-sided Feynman diagrams. We find a clear distinction between interference and Rabi splitting in linear spectroscopy and a qualitative change in the symmetry of the line shape of the nonlinear signal when crossing the exceptional point. This change corresponds to one in the symmetry of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. Our work presents an approach for simulating the optical response of sublevels within an electronic system and opens new applications of nonlinear spectroscopy to examine the different regimes of the spectrum of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.},

  abstract = {Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the effects of confinement, adsorption on surfaces, and ion–ion interactions on the response of confined electrolyte solutions to oscillating electric fields in the direction perpendicular to the confining walls. Nonequilibrium simulations allows to characterize the transitions between linear and nonlinear regimes when varying the magnitude and frequency of the applied field, but the linear response, characterized by the frequency-dependent conductivity, is more efficiently predicted from the equilibrium current fluctuations. To that end, we (rederive and) use the Green–Kubo relation appropriate for overdamped dynamics, which differs from the standard one for Newtonian or underdamped Langevin dynamics. This expression highlights the contributions of the underlying Brownian fluctuations and of the interactions of the particles between them and with external potentials. Although already known in the literature, this relation has rarely been used to date, beyond the static limit to determine the effective diffusion coefficient or the DC conductivity. The frequency-dependent conductivity always decays from a bulk-like behavior at high frequency to a vanishing conductivity at low frequency due to the confinement of the charge carriers by the walls. We discuss the characteristic features of the crossover between the two regimes, most importantly how the crossover frequency depends on the confining distance and the salt concentration, and the fact that adsorption on the walls may lead to significant changes both at high and low frequencies. Conversely, our results illustrate the possibility to obtain information on diffusion between walls, charge relaxation, and adsorption by analyzing the frequency-dependent conductivity.},

  abstract = {Shape stability is key to avoiding degradation of performance for metallic nanocrystals synthesized with facetted non-equilibrium shapes to optimize properties for catalysis, plasmonics, and so on. Reshaping of facetted nanocrystals is controlled by the surface diffusion-mediated nucleation and growth of new outer layers of atoms. Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation of a realistic stochastic atomistic-level model is applied to precisely track the reshaping of Pd octahedra and nanocubes. Unexpectedly, separate constrained equilibrium Monte Carlo analysis of the free energy profile during reshaping reveals a fundamental failure of the classical nucleation theory (CNT) prediction for the reshaping barrier and rate. Why? Nucleation barriers can be relatively low for these processes, so the system is not locally equilibrated before crossing the barrier, as assumed in CNT. This claim is supported by an analysis of a first-passage problem for reshaping within a master equation framework for the model that reasonably captures the behavior in KMC simulations.},

  abstract = {The probability per unit time for a thermally activated Brownian particle to escape over a potential well is, in general, well-described by Kramers’s theory. Kramers showed that the escape time decreases exponentially with increasing barrier height. The dynamics slow down when the particle is charged and subjected to a Lorentz force due to an external magnetic field. This is evident via a rescaling of the diffusion coefficient entering as a prefactor in the Kramers’s escape rate without any impact on the barrier-height-dependent exponent. Here, we show that the barrier height can be effectively changed when the charged particle is subjected to a vortex flow. While the vortex alone does not affect the mean escape time of the particle, when combined with a magnetic field, it effectively pushes the fluctuating particle either radially outside or inside depending on its sign relative to that of the magnetic field. In particular, the effective potential over which the particle escapes can be changed to a flat, a stable, and an unstable potential by tuning the signs and magnitudes of the vortex and the applied magnetic field. Notably, the last case corresponds to enhanced escape dynamics.},

This mechanism is based on the collective beating motion of cilia at the surface of epithelial cells. Impaired clearance, either caused by malfunctioning or absent cilia, or mucus defects, is a symptom of many respiratory diseases. Here, by exploiting the lattice Boltzmann particle dynamics technique, we develop a model to simulate the dynamics of multiciliated cells in a two-layer fluid. First, we tuned our model to reproduce the characteristic length- and time-scales of the cilia beating. We then check for the emergence of the metachronal wave as a consequence of hydrodynamic mediated correlations between beating cilia. Finally, we tune the viscosity of the top fluid layer to simulate the mucus flow upon cilia beating, and evaluate the pushing efficiency of a carpet of cilia. With this work, we build a realistic framework that can be used to explore several important physiological aspects of mucociliary clearance.},

  abstract = {Pressure-induced perturbation of a protein structure leading to its folding–unfolding mechanism is an important yet not fully understood phenomenon. The key point here is the role of water and its coupling with protein conformations as a function of pressure. In the current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation at 298 K, we systematically examine the coupling between protein conformations and water structures of pressures of 0.001, 5, 10, 15, 20 kbar, starting from (partially) unfolded structures of the protein Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI). We also calculate localized thermodynamics at those pressures as a function of protein–water distance. Our findings show that both protein-specific and generic effects of pressure are operating. In particular, we found that (1) the amount of increase in water density near the protein depends on the protein structural heterogeneity; (2) the intra-protein hydrogen bond decreases with pressure, while the water–water hydrogen bond per water in the first solvation shell (FSS) increases; protein–water hydrogen bonds also found to increase with pressure, (3) with pressure hydrogen bonds of waters in the FSS getting twisted; and (4) water’s tetrahedrality in the FSS decreases with pressure, but it is dependent on the local environment. Thermodynamically, at higher pressure, the structural perturbation of BPTI is due to the pressure–volume work, while the entropy decreases with the increase of pressure due to the higher translational and rotational rigidity of waters in the FSS. The local and subtle effects of pressure, found in this work, are likely to be typical of pressure-induced protein structure perturbation.},

In this study, we designed photoswitchable versions of MCL-1/PUMA and MCL-1/NOXA, and investigated the protein response after an ultrafast photo-perturbation with transient infrared spectroscopy. We observed partial α -helical unfolding in all cases, albeit on strongly varying timescales (1.6 ns for PUMA, 9.7 ns for the previously studied BIM, and 85 ns for NOXA). These differences are interpreted as a BH3-only-specific “structural resilience” to defy the perturbation while remaining in MCL-1’s binding pocket. Thus, the presented insights could help to better understand the differences between PUMA, BIM, and NOXA, the promiscuity of MCL-1, in general, and the role of the proteins in the apoptotic network.},

Our simulation approach allows us to determine the density of states of our systems and, from those, their thermodynamics for all temperatures. All systems show a first order aggregation transition followed by a low-temperature ordering transition. For a few chain aggregates of intermediate lengths (up to N = 40), we show that these ordering transitions resemble the quaternary structure formation in peptides. In an earlier publication, we have already shown that single alkane chains fold into low-temperature structures, best described as secondary and tertiary structure formation, thus completing this analogy here. The aggregation transition in the thermodynamic limit can be extrapolated in pressure to the ambient pressure for which it agrees well with experimentally known boiling points of short alkanes. Similarly, the chain length dependence of the crystallization transition agrees with known experimental results for alkanes. For small aggregates, for which volume and surface effects are not yet well separated, our method allows us to identify the crystallization in the core of the aggregate and at its surface, individually.},

Because of their non-volatile property, these solvents have a high recovery rate, and, hence, they are considered as environment-friendly green solvents. It is necessary to study the detailed physicochemical properties of these liquids for designing and processing techniques and find suitable operating conditions for IL-based systems. In the present work, the flow behavior of aqueous solutions of an imidazolium-based IL, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium chloride, is investigated, where the dynamic viscosity measurements indicate non-Newtonian shear thickening behavior in the solutions. Polarizing optical microscopy shows that the pristine samples are isotropic and transform into anisotropic after shear. These shear thickened liquid crystalline samples change into an isotropic phase upon heating, which is quantified by the differential scanning calorimetry. The small angle x-ray scattering study revealed that the pristine isotropic cubic phase of spherical micelles distort into non-spherical micelles. This has provided the detailed structural evolution of mesoscopic aggregates of the IL in an aqueous solution and the corresponding viscoelastic property of the solution.},

The potential mechanisms of how temperature affects dsDNA elasticity and coupling were investigated by using the trajectories from atomistic simulation, in which thermal fluctuations in structural parameters were analyzed in detail.

In all cases, the surface evolution of the as-deposited films and the rejuvenated films is enhanced compared to bulk and is not easily distinguishable from each other.

Comparisons to numerical solutions of the glassy thin film equation provide quantitative estimates of the surface mobility.

  abstract = {Ionic liquids have generated interest in applications as lubricants and as additives to conventional lubricants due to their unique physical properties. In these applications, the liquid thin film can be subjected simultaneously to extremely high shear and loads in addition to nanoconfinement effects. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations with a coarse-grained model to study a nanometric film of an ionic liquid confined between two planar solid surfaces both at equilibrium and at several shear rates. The strength of the interaction between the solid surface and the ions was changed by simulating three different surfaces with enhanced interactions with different ions. The increase in the interaction with either the cation or the anion leads to the formation of a solid-like layer that moves alongside the substrates; however, this layer can exhibit different structures and stability. An increase in the interaction with the high symmetry anion produces a more regular structure that is more resistant to the effects of shear and viscous heating. Two definitions were proposed and used for the calculation of the viscosity: a local definition based on the microscopic characteristics of the liquid and an engineering definition based on the forces measured at the solid surfaces, with the former displaying a correlation with the layered structure induced by the surfaces. Because of the shear thinning behavior of the ionic liquids as well as the temperature rise brought on by viscous heating, both the engineering and the local viscosities decrease as the shear rate increases.},

  abstract = {Polarimetric angle-resolved second-harmonic scattering (AR-SHS) is an all-optical tool enabling the study of unlabeled interfaces of nano-sized particles in an aqueous solution. As the second harmonic signal is modulated by interference between nonlinear contributions originating at the particle’s surface and those originating in the bulk electrolyte solution due to the presence of a surface electrostatic field, the AR-SHS patterns give insight into the structure of the electrical double layer. The mathematical framework of AR-SHS has been previously established, in particular regarding changes in probing depth with ionic strength. However, other experimental factors may influence the AR-SHS patterns. Here, we calculate the size dependence of the surface and electrostatic geometric form factors for nonlinear scattering, together with their relative contribution to the AR-SHS patterns. We show that the electrostatic term is stronger in the forward scattering direction for smaller particle sizes, while the ratio of the electrostatic to surface terms decreases with increasing size. Besides this competing effect, the total AR-SHS signal intensity is also weighted by the particle’s surface characteristics, given by the surface potential Φ 0 and the second-order surface susceptibility χ s , 2 2 ⁠ . The weighting effect is experimentally demonstrated by comparing SiO 2 particles of different sizes in NaCl and NaOH solutions of varying ionic strengths. For NaOH, the larger χ s , 2 2 values generated by deprotonation of surface silanol groups prevail over the electrostatic screening occurring at high ionic strengths; however, only for larger particle sizes. This study establishes a better connection between the AR-SHS patterns and surface properties and predicts trends for arbitrarily-sized particles.},

  abstract = {The effects of interfacial molecular mobility on the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) across graphene–water and graphene–perfluorohexane interfaces were investigated using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular mobility was varied by equilibrating nanoconfined water and perfluorohexane at different temperatures. The long-chain molecules of perfluorohexane exhibited a prominent layered structure, indicating a low molecular mobility, over a wide temperature range between 200 and 450 K. Alternatively, water increased its mobility at high temperatures, resulting in an enhanced molecular diffusion that significantly contributed to the interfacial thermal transport, in addition to the increasing vibrational carrier population at high temperatures. Furthermore, the TBC across the graphene–water interface exhibited a quadratic relationship with the rise in temperature, whereas for the graphene–perfluorohexane interface, a linear relationship was observed. The high rate of diffusion in interfacial water facilitated additional low-frequency modes, and a spectral decomposition of the TBC also indicated an enhancement in the same frequency range. Thus, the enhanced spectral transmission and higher molecular mobility of water with respect to perfluorohexane explained the difference in the thermal transport across the interfaces considered herein.},

  abstract = {Understanding the surface properties of glass during the hydrogen fluoride (HF)-based vapor etching process is essential to optimize treatment processes in semiconductor and glass industries. In this work, we investigate an etching process of fused glassy silica by HF gas with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. Detailed pathways of surface reactions between gas molecules and the silica surface with activation energy sets are explicitly implemented in the KMC algorithm for both dry and humid conditions. The KMC model successfully describes the etching of the silica surface with the evolution of surface morphology up to the micron regime. The simulation results show that the calculated etch rate and surface roughness are in good agreement with the experimental results, and the effect of humidity on the etch rate is also confirmed. Development of roughness is theoretically analyzed in terms of surface roughening phenomena, and it is predicted that the values of growth and roughening exponents are 0.19 and 0.33, respectively, suggesting that our model belongs to the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang universality class. Furthermore, the temporal evolution of surface chemistry, specifically surface hydroxyls and fluorine groups, is monitored. The surface density of fluorine moieties is 2.5 times higher than that of the hydroxyl groups, implying that the surface is well fluorinated during vapor etching.},

In this paper, we address the water dissociation reaction on a Pd(111) electrode surface, modeled as a slab embedded in an external electric field. We aim at unraveling the relationship between surface charge and zero-point energy in aiding or hindering this reaction. We calculate the energy barriers with dispersion-corrected density-functional theory and an efficient parallel implementation of the nudged-elastic-band method. We show that the lowest dissociation barrier and consequently the highest reaction rate take place when the field reaches a strength where two different geometries of the water molecule in the reactant state are equally stable. The zero-point energy contributions to this reaction, on the other hand, remain nearly constant across a wide range of electric field strengths, despite significant changes in the reactant state. Interestingly, we show that the application of electric fields that induce a negative charge on the surface can make nuclear tunneling more significant for these reactions.},

This work comprehensively investigates the reaction kinetics and reactivity of Ni/Al clad particle composites under shock loading with molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the reaction acceleration in a small particle system or the reaction propagation in a large particle system breaks down the heterogeneous nucleation and continuous growth of B 2 phase at the Ni/Al interface. This makes the generation and dissolution of B 2-NiAl show a staged pattern consistent with chemical evolution. Importantly, the crystallization processes are appropriately described by the well-established Johnson–Mehl–Avrami kinetics model. With the increase in Al particle size, the maximum crystallinity and growth rate of B 2 phase decrease and the value of the fitted Avrami exponent decreases from 0.55 to 0.39, showing a good agreement with the solid-state reaction experiment. In addition, the calculations of reactivity reveal that the reaction initiation and propagation will be retarded, but the adiabatic reaction temperature can be elevated when Al particle size increases. An exponential decay relationship is found between the propagation velocity of the chemical front and the particle size. As expected, the shock simulations at non-ambient conditions indicate that elevating the initial temperature significantly enhances the reactivity of large particle systems and results in a power-law decrease in the ignition delay time and a linear-law increase in the propagation velocity.},

A range of formic acid concentrations has been used to obtain a deeper insight into the mechanism of the reaction. The experiments have allowed us to confirm that the potential dependence of the rate of dehydration has a bell shape, going through a maximum around the potential of zero total charge (pztc) of the most active site. The analysis of the integrated intensity and frequency of the bands corresponding to CO L and CO B/M shows a progressive population of the active sites on the surface. The observed potential dependence of the rate of formation of CO ad is consistent with a mechanism in which the reversible electroadsorption of HCOO ad is followed by its rate-determining reduction to CO ad .},

However, the rate performance for storing large cations is restricted by the small interlayer distance of LDH. Herein, the interlayer distance of NiCo-LDH is expanded by replacing the interlayer nitrate ions with 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic anions (BDC), leading to the enhanced rate performance for storing large cations (Na + , Mg 2+ , and Zn 2+ ), whereas almost the unchanged one for storing small-radius Li + ions. The improved rate performance of the BDC-pillared LDH (LDH-BDC) stems from the reduced charge-transfer and Warburg resistances during charge/discharge due to the increased interlayer distance, as revealed by in situ electrochemical impedance spectra. The asymmetric zinc-ion supercapacitor assembled with LDH-BDC and activated carbon presents high energy density and cycling stability. This study demonstrates an effective strategy to improve the large cation storage performance of LDH electrodes by increasing the interlayer distance.},

Here, we investigate the potential of sensitizing InGaAs in the mid-wave infrared throughout the intraband transition of self-doped HgSe NCs. Our device geometry enables the design of a photodiode remaining mostly unreported for intraband-absorbing NCs.

  abstract = {Porous solid films that promote large apparent contact angles are interesting systems since their wetting properties are dependent on both the surface structure and water penetration into the film. In this study, a parahydrophobic coating is made by sequential dip coating of titanium dioxide nanoparticles and stearic acid on polished copper substrates. The apparent contact angles are determined using the tilted plate method, and it is found that the liquid–vapor interaction decreases and water droplets are more likely to move off the film when the number of coated layers increases. Interestingly, it is found that under some conditions, the front contact angle can be smaller than the back contact angle. Scanning electron microscopy observations demonstrate that the coating process led to the formation of hydrophilic TiO 2 nanoparticle domains and hydrophobic stearic acid flakes that allows heterogeneous wetting. By monitoring the electrical current through the water droplet to the copper substrate, it is found that the water drops penetrate the coating layer to make direct contact with the copper surface with a time delay and magnitude that depends on the coating thickness. This additional penetration of water into the porous film enhances the adhesion of the droplet to the film and provides a clue to understand the contact angle hysteresis.},

In this endeavor, determining nucleation mechanisms and rates for phase separation requires an appropriately defined reaction coordinate to describe the transformation of an out-of-equilibrium parent phase for which myriad options are available to the simulator. In this article, we describe the application of the variational approach to Markov processes to quantify the suitability of reaction coordinates to study crystallization from supersaturated colloid suspensions. Our analysis indicates that collective variables (CVs) that correlate with the number of particles in the condensed phase, the system potential energy, and approximate configurational entropy often feature as the most appropriate order parameters to quantitatively describe the crystallization process. We apply time-lagged independent component analysis to reduce high-dimensional reaction coordinates constructed from these CVs to build Markov State Models (MSMs), which indicate that two barriers separate a supersaturated fluid phase from crystals in the simulated environment. The MSMs provide consistent estimates for crystal nucleation rates, regardless of the dimensionality of the order parameter space adopted; however, the two-step mechanism is only consistently evident from spectral clustering of the MSMs in higher dimensions. As the method is general and easily transferable, the variational approach we adopt could provide a useful framework to study controls for crystal nucleation.},

Each adsorbed AFP locally pins the ice surface, resulting in a metastable dimple for which the interfacial forces counteract the driving force for growth. As supercooling increases, these metastable dimples become deeper, until metastability is lost in an engulfment event where the ice irreversibly swallows the AFP. Engulfment resembles nucleation in some respects, and this paper develops a model for the “critical profile” and free energy barrier for the engulfment process. Specifically, we variationally optimize the ice–water interface and estimate the free energy barrier as a function of the supercooling, the AFP footprint size, and the distance to neighboring AFPs on the ice surface. Finally, we use symbolic regression to derive a simple closed-form expression for the free energy barrier as a function of two physically interpretable, dimensionless parameters.},

According to four-component relativistic calculations, the electronic spin–orbit effects are the most significant ones for the isotropic values of σ PV and M PV in the H 2 X 2 series of molecules (with X = O, S, Se, Te, and Po). When only scalar relativistic effects are taken into account, the non-relativistic relationship between σ PV and M PV does hold.

  abstract = {The spin-forbidden O( 3 P 2 ) + CO(X 1 Σ + , v ) channel formed from the photodissociation of CO 2 in the low energy band centered at 148 nm is investigated by using the time-sliced velocity-mapped ion imaging technique. The vibrational-resolved images of the O( 3 P 2 ) photoproducts measured in the photolysis wavelength range of 144.62–150.45 nm are analyzed to give the total kinetic energy releases (TKER) spectra, CO(X 1 Σ + ) vibrational state distributions, and anisotropy parameters ( β ). The TKER spectra reveal the formation of correlated CO(X 1 Σ + ) with well resolved v = 0–10 (or 11) vibrational bands. Several high vibrational bands that were observed in the low TKER region for each studied photolysis wavelength exhibit a bimodal structure. The CO(X 1 Σ + , v ) vibrational distributions all present inverted characteristics, and the most populated vibrational state changes from a low vibrational state to a relatively higher vibrational state with a change in the photolysis wavelength from 150.45 to 144.62 nm. However, the vibrational-state specific β- values for different photolysis wavelengths present a similar variation trend. The measured β- values show a significant bulge at the higher vibrational levels, in addition to the overall slow decreasing trend. The observed bimodal structures with mutational β- values for the high vibrational excited state CO( 1 Σ + ) photoproducts suggest the existence of more than one nonadiabatic pathway with different anisotropies in the formation of O( 3 P 2 ) + CO(X 1 Σ + , v ) photoproducts across the low energy band.},

  abstract = {Information about molecular collisions is encoded in the shapes of collision-perturbed molecular resonances. This connection between molecular interactions and line shapes is most clearly seen in simple systems, such as the molecular hydrogen perturbed by a noble gas atom. We study the H 2 –Ar system by means of highly accurate absorption spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. On the one hand, we use the cavity-ring-down-spectroscopy technique to record the shapes of the S(1) 3-0 line of molecular hydrogen perturbed by argon. On the other hand, we simulate the shapes of this line using ab initio quantum-scattering calculations performed on our accurate H 2 –Ar potential energy surface (PES). In order to validate the PES and the methodology of quantum-scattering calculations separately from the model of velocity-changing collisions, we measured the spectra in experimental conditions in which the influence of the latter is relatively minor. In these conditions, our theoretical collision-perturbed line shapes reproduce the raw experimental spectra at the percent level. However, the collisional shift, δ 0 , differs from the experimental value by 20\%. Compared to other line-shape parameters, collisional shift displays much higher sensitivity to various technical aspects of the computational methodology. We identify the contributors to this large error and find the inaccuracies of the PES to be the dominant factor. With regard to the quantum scattering methodology, we demonstrate that treating the centrifugal distortion in a simple, approximate manner is sufficient to obtain the percent-level accuracy of collisional spectra.},

The three-dimensional momentum vectors of correlated fragmental ions were measured in coincidence for each fragmentation event. A novel comet-like structure was observed in the Newton diagram of the quadruple-ionization-induced breakup channel of ArKr 2 4 + → Ar + + Kr + + Kr 2+ . The concentrated head part of the structure mainly originates from the direct Coulomb explosion process, while the broader tail part of the structure stems from a three-body fragmentation process involving electron transfer between the distant Kr + and Kr 2+ ion fragments. Due to the field-driven electron transfer, the Coulomb repulsive force of the Kr 2+ and Kr + ions with respect to the Ar + ion undergoes exchange, leading to changes in the ion emission geometry in the Newton plot. An energy sharing among the separating Kr 2+ and Kr + entities was observed. Our study indicates a promising approach for investigating the strong-field-driven intersystem electron transfer dynamics by using the Coulomb explosion imaging of an isosceles triangle van der Waals cluster system.},

  abstract = {While short-range noncovalent interactions (NCIs) are proving to be of importance in many chemical and biological systems, these atypical bindings happen within the so-called van der Waals envelope and pose an enormous challenge for current computational methods. We introduce SNCIAA, a database of 723 benchmark interaction energies of short-range noncovalent interactions between neutral/charged amino acids originated from protein x-ray crystal structures at the “gold standard” coupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples/complete basis set [CCSD(T)/CBS] level of theory with a mean absolute binding uncertainty less than 0.1 kcal/mol. Subsequently, a systematic assessment of commonly used computational methods, such as the second-order Møller−Plesset theory (MP2), density functional theory (DFT), symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), composite electronic-structure methods, semiempirical approaches, and the physical-based potentials with machine learning (IPML) on SNCIAA is carried out. It is shown that the inclusion of dispersion corrections is essential even though these dimers are dominated by electrostatics, such as hydrogen bondings and salt bridges. Overall, MP2, ω B97M-V, and B3LYP+D4 turned out to be the most reliable methods for the description of short-range NCIs even in strongly attractive/repulsive complexes. SAPT is also recommended in describing short-range NCIs only if the δ MP2 correction has been included. The good performance of IPML for dimers at close-equilibrium and long-range conditions is not transferable to the short-range. We expect that SNCIAA will assist the development/improvement/validation of computational methods, such as DFT, force-fields, and ML models, in describing NCIs across entire potential energy surfaces (short-, intermediate-, and long-range NCIs) on the same footing.},

Ultrabroadband femtosecond/picosecond (fs/ps) CRS is performed in the molecular fingerprint region from 1100 to 2000 cm −1 , employing fs laser-induced filamentation as the supercontinuum generation mechanism to provide the ultrabroadband excitation pulses. We introduce a time-domain model of the CH 4 ν 2 CRS spectrum, including all five ro-vibrational branches allowed by the selection rules Δv = 1, Δ J = 0, ±1, ±2; the model includes collisional linewidths, computed according to a modified exponential gap scaling law and validated experimentally. The use of ultrabroadband CRS for in situ monitoring of the CH 4 chemistry is demonstrated in a laboratory CH 4 /air diffusion flame: CRS measurements in the fingerprint region, performed across the laminar flame front, allow the simultaneous detection of molecular oxygen (O 2 ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and molecular hydrogen (H 2 ), along with CH 4 . Fundamental physicochemical processes, such as H 2 production via CH 4 pyrolysis, are observed through the Raman spectra of these chemical species. In addition, we demonstrate ro-vibrational CH 4 v 2 CRS thermometry, and we validate it against CO 2 CRS measurements. The present technique offers an interesting diagnostics approach to in situ measurement of CH 4 -rich environments, e.g., in plasma reactors for CH 4 pyrolysis and H 2 production.},

Here, we derive the set of conditions under which fermionic operators can be exactly replaced by bosonic operators that render the problem amenable to a large toolbox of dynamical methods while still capturing the correct dynamics of n -body operators. Importantly, our analysis offers a simple guide on how one can exploit these simple maps to calculate nonequilibrium and equilibrium single- and multi-time correlation functions essential in describing transport and spectroscopy. We use this to rigorously analyze and delineate the applicability of simple yet effective Cartesian maps that have been shown to correctly capture the correct fermionic dynamics in select models of nanoscopic transport. We illustrate our analytical results with exact simulations of the resonant level model. Our work provides new insights as to when one can leverage the simplicity of bosonic maps to simulate the dynamics of many-electron systems, especially those where an atomistic representation of nuclear interactions becomes essential.},

  abstract = {Methods for computing core-level ionization energies using self-consistent field (SCF) calculations are evaluated and benchmarked. These include a “full core hole” (or “ΔSCF”) approach that fully accounts for orbital relaxation upon ionization, but also methods based on Slater’s transition concept in which the binding energy is estimated from an orbital energy level that is obtained from a fractional-occupancy SCF calculation. A generalization that uses two different fractional-occupancy SCF calculations is also considered. The best of the Slater-type methods afford mean errors of 0.3–0.4 eV with respect to experiment for a dataset of K-shell ionization energies, a level of accuracy that is competitive with more expensive many-body techniques. An empirical shifting procedure with one adjustable parameter reduces the average error below 0.2 eV. This shifted Slater transition method is a simple and practical way to compute core-level binding energies using only initial-state Kohn–Sham eigenvalues. It requires no more computational effort than ΔSCF and may be especially useful for simulating transient x-ray experiments where core-level spectroscopy is used to probe an excited electronic state, for which the ΔSCF approach requires a tedious state-by-state calculation of the spectrum. As an example, we use Slater-type methods to model x-ray emission spectroscopy.},

We show that these contributions converge quickly as the intermolecular distances between the monomers grow. In particular, the smallest value among the three pairwise intermonomer closest-contact distances, R min , shows a strong correlation with the three-body contribution to the lattice energy, and, here, the largest of the closest-contact distances, R max , serves as a cutoff criterion to limit the number of trimers to be considered. We considered all trimers up to R max = 15 A ̊ ⁠ . The trimers with R min 4 A ̊ ⁠ , the second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) supplemented with the Axilrod–Teller–Muto (ATM) three-body dispersion correction reproduces the CCSD(T) values for the cumulative three-body contributions with errors of less than 0.1 kJ mol −1 . Moreover, three-body contributions are converged within 0.15 kJ mol −1 by R max = 10 A ̊ ⁠ . From these results, it appears that in molecular crystals where dispersion dominates the three-body contribution to the lattice energy, the trimers with R min &gt; 4 A ̊ can be computed with the MP2+ATM method to reduce the computational cost, and those with R max &gt; 10 A ̊ appear to be basically negligible.},

The macroscopic theory of adsorption dates back more than a century and is now well-established. Yet, despite recent advancements, a detailed and self-contained theory of single-particle adsorption is still lacking. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a microscopic theory of adsorption kinetics, from which the macroscopic properties follow directly. One of our central achievements is the derivation of the microscopic version of the seminal Ward–Tordai relation, which connects the surface and subsurface adsorbate concentrations via a universal equation that holds for arbitrary adsorption dynamics. Furthermore, we present a microscopic interpretation of the Ward–Tordai relation that, in turn, allows us to generalize it to arbitrary dimension, geometry, and initial conditions. The power of our approach is showcased on a set of hitherto unsolved adsorption problems to which we present exact analytical solutions. The framework developed herein sheds fresh light on the fundamentals of adsorption kinetics, which opens new research avenues in surface science with applications to artificial and biological sensing and to the design of nano-scale devices.},

For PSB3, the accuracy of 2PA strengths increases in the following order: CC2 &lt; CCSD &lt; CC3, with the CC2 deviation from both higher-level methods exceeding 10\% at 6-31+G* basis sets and 2\% at aug-cc-pVDZ basis set.

In the case of a weak perturbation, we report the static linear density response function and the static XC kernel at a metallic density for both the degenerate ground-state limit and for partial degeneracy at the electronic Fermi temperature. Overall, we observe an improvement in the density response when the PBE0, PBE0-1/3, HSE06, and HSE03 functionals are used, compared with the previously reported results for the PBE, PBEsol, local-density approximation, and AM05 functionals; B3LYP, on the other hand, does not perform well for the considered system.

  abstract = {Trapping diffusive particles at surfaces is a key step in many systems in chemical and biological physics. Trapping often occurs via reactive patches on the surface and/or the particle. The theory of boundary homogenization has been used in many prior works to estimate the effective trapping rate for such a system in the case that either (i) the surface is patchy and the particle is uniformly reactive or (ii) the particle is patchy and the surface is uniformly reactive. In this paper, we estimate the trapping rate for the case that the surface and the particle are both patchy. In particular, the particle diffuses translationally and rotationally and reacts with the surface when a patch on the particle contacts a patch on the surface. We first formulate a stochastic model and derive a five-dimensional partial differential equation describing the reaction time. We then use matched asymptotic analysis to derive the effective trapping rate, assuming that the patches are roughly evenly distributed and occupy a small fraction of the surface and the particle. This trapping rate involves the electrostatic capacitance of a four-dimensional duocylinder, which we compute using a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. We further use Brownian local time theory to derive a simple heuristic estimate of the trapping rate and show that it is remarkably close to the asymptotic estimate. Finally, we develop a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate the full stochastic system and then use these simulations to confirm the accuracy of our trapping rate estimates and homogenization theory.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT)-1/2 is an efficient bandgap rectification method for DFT under local density approximation (LDA) or generalized gradient approximation. It was suggested that non-self-consistent DFT-1/2 should be used for highly ionic insulators like LiF, whereas self-consistent DFT-1/2 should still be used for other compounds. Nevertheless, there is no quantitative criterion prescribed for which implementation should work for an arbitrary insulator, which leads to severe ambiguity in this method. In this work, we analyze the impact of self-consistency in DFT-1/2 and shell DFT-1/2 calculations in insulators or semiconductors with ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and intermediate cases and show that self-consistency is required even for highly ionic insulators for globally better electronic structure details. The self-energy correction renders electrons more localized around the anions in self-consistent LDA-1/2. The well-known delocalization error of LDA is rectified, but with strong overcorrection, due to the presence of additional self-energy potential. However, in non-self-consistent LDA-1/2 calculations, the electron wave functions indicate that such localization is much more severe and beyond a reasonable range because the strong Coulomb repulsion is not counted in the Hamiltonian. Another common drawback of non-self-consistent LDA-1/2 is that the ionicity of the bonding gets substantially enhanced, and the bandgap can be enormously high in mixed ionic-covalent compounds like TiO 2 .},

The quantum chemical calculation of transfer integrals for all the molecular pairs in organic materials is usually an unaffordable task; fortunately, it can be accelerated by the data-driven machine learning method now. In this work, we develop machine learning models based on artificial neutral networks to predict transfer integrals accurately and efficiently for four typical organic semiconductor molecules: quadruple thiophene (QT), pentacene, rubrene, and dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DNTT). We test various forms of features and labels and evaluate the accuracy of different models. With the implementation of a data augmentation scheme, we have achieved a very high accuracy with the determination coefficient of 0.97 and mean absolute error of 4.5 meV for QT, and similar accuracy for the other three molecules. We apply these models to studying charge transport in organic crystals with dynamic disorders at 300 K and obtain the charge mobility and anisotropy in perfect agreement with the brutal force quantum chemical calculation. If more molecular packings representing the amorphous phase of organic solids are supplemented to the dataset, the current models can be refined to study charge transport in organic thin films with polymorphs and static disorders.},

The formulation provides a general formalism that exploits the symmetry of path integrals with respect to permutations in imaginary time, expressing correlations as products of imaginary-time-translation-invariant phase-space functions coupled through Poisson bracket operators. The method naturally recovers the classical limit of multi-time correlation functions and provides an interpretation of quantum dynamics in terms of “interfering trajectories” of the ring-polymer in phase space.

  abstract = {Allosteric regulation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is still vastly understudied compared to the counterpart of structured proteins. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the regulation of the IDP N-WASP by the binding of its basic region with inter- and intramolecular ligands (PIP 2 and an acidic motif, respectively). The intramolecular interactions keep N-WASP in an autoinhibited state; PIP 2 binding frees the acidic motif for interacting with Arp2/3 and thereby initiating actin polymerization. We show that PIP 2 and the acidic motif compete in binding with the basic region. However, even when PIP 2 is present at 30\% in the membrane, the acidic motif is free of contact with the basic region (“open” state) in only 8.5\% of the population. The very C-terminal three residues of the A motif are crucial for Arp2/3 binding; conformations where only the A tail is free are present at a much higher population than the open state (40- to 6-fold, depending on the PIP 2 level). Thus, N-WASP is competent for Arp2/3 binding before it is fully freed from autoinhibition.},

  abstract = {Classifying reliably active and inactive molecular conformations of wildtype (WT) and mutated oncogenic proteins is a key, ongoing challenge in molecular cancer studies. Here, we probe the GTP-bound K-Ras4B conformational dynamics using long-time atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We extract and analyze the detailed underlying free energy landscape of WT K-Ras4B. We use two key reaction coordinates, labeled d 1 and d 2 (i.e., distances coordinating the P β atom of the GTP ligand with two key residues, T35 and G60), shown to correlate closely with activities of WT and mutated K-Ras4B. However, our new K-Ras4B conformational kinetics study reveals a more complex network of equilibrium Markovian states. We show that a new reaction coordinate is required to account for the orientation of acidic K-Ras4B sidechains such as D38 with respect to the interface with binding effector RAF1 and rationalize the activation/inactivation propensities and the corresponding molecular binding mechanisms. We use this understanding to unveil how a relatively conservative mutation (i.e., D33E, in the switch I region) can lead to significantly different activation propensities compared with WT K-Ras4B. Our study sheds new light on the ability of residues near the K-Ras4B—RAF1 interface to modulate the network of salt bridges at the binding interface with the RAF1 downstream effector and, thus, to influence the underlying GTP-dependent activation/inactivation mechanism. Altogether, our hybrid MD-docking modeling approach enables the development of new in silico methods for quantitative assessment of activation propensity changes (e.g., due to mutations or local binding environment). It also unveils the underlying molecular mechanisms and facilitates the rational design of new cancer drugs.},

However, the high charge recombination rate, low electronic conductivity, and sluggish electrode kinetics have inhibited the PEC performance. Increasing the reaction temperature for water oxidation is an effective way to enhance the carrier kinetics of BiVO 4 . Herein, a polypyrrole (PPy) layer was coated on the BiVO 4 film. The PPy layer could harvest the near-infrared light to elevate the temperature of the BiVO 4 photoelectrode and further improve charge separation and injection efficiencies. In addition, the conductive polymer PPy layer acted as an effective charge transfer channel to facilitate photogenerated holes moving from BiVO 4 to the electrode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, PPy modification led to a significantly improved water oxidation property. After loading the cobalt–phosphate co-catalyst, the photocurrent density reached 3.64 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode, corresponding to an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 63\% at 430 nm. This work provided an effective strategy for designing a photothermal material assisted photoelectrode for efficient water splitting.},

This work demonstrates that two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and 13 C 18 O isotope labeling can be used to follow the aggregation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) in the presence of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with single-residue structural resolution. 60 nm AuNPs were found to inhibit hIAPP, tripling the aggregation time. Furthermore, calculating the actual transition dipole strength of the backbone amide I’ mode reveals that hIAPP forms a more ordered aggregate structure in the presence of AuNPs. Ultimately, such studies can provide insight into how mechanisms of amyloid aggregation are altered in the presence of nanoparticles, furthering our understanding of protein–nanoparticle interactions.},

  abstract = {Despite more than a century of study, consensus on the molecular basis of allostery remains elusive. A comparison of allosteric and non-allosteric members of a protein family can shed light on this important regulatory mechanism, and the bacterial biotin protein ligases, which catalyze post-translational biotin addition, provide an ideal system for such comparison. While the Class I bacterial ligases only function as enzymes, the bifunctional Class II ligases use the same structural architecture for an additional transcription repression function. This additional function depends on allosterically activated homodimerization followed by DNA binding. In this work, we used experimental, computational network, and bioinformatics analyses to uncover distinguishing features that enable allostery in the Class II biotin protein ligases. Experimental studies of the Class II Escherichia coli protein indicate that catalytic site residues are critical for both catalysis and allostery. However, allostery also depends on amino acids that are more broadly distributed throughout the protein structure. Energy-based community network analysis of representative Class I and Class II proteins reveals distinct residue community architectures, interactions among the communities, and responses of the network to allosteric effector binding. Bioinformatics mutual information analyses of multiple sequence alignments indicate distinct networks of coevolving residues in the two protein families. The results support the role of divergent local residue community network structures both inside and outside of the conserved enzyme active site combined with distinct inter-community interactions as keys to the emergence of allostery in the Class II biotin protein ligases.},

The existence and stability of the photocycle products are largely determined by the protein sequence and the presence of conserved hydrogen-bonding interactions in the vicinity of the chromophore. The vibrational signatures of biliverdin, however, are often weak and obscured under more intense protein bands, limiting spectroscopic studies of its non-transient signals. In this study, we apply isotope-labeling techniques to isolate the vibrational bands from the protein-bound chromophore of the bacterial phytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans . We elucidate the structure and ultrafast dynamics of the chromophore with 2D infra-red (IR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. The carbonyl stretch vibrations of the pyrrole rings show the heterogeneous distribution of hydrogen-bonding structures, which exhibit distinct ultrafast relaxation dynamics. Moreover, we resolve a previously undetected 1678 cm −1 band that is strongly coupled to the A- and D-ring of biliverdin and demonstrate the presence of complex vibrational redistribution pathways between the biliverdin modes with relaxation-assisted measurements of 2D IR cross peaks. In summary, we expect 2D IR spectroscopy to be useful in explaining how point mutations in the protein sequence affect the hydrogen-bonding structure around the chromophore and consequently its ability to photoisomerize to the light-activated states.},

  abstract = {The Spindle Assembly Abnormal Protein 6 (SAS-6) forms dimers, which then self-assemble into rings that are critical for the nine-fold symmetry of the centriole organelle. It has recently been shown experimentally that the self-assembly of SAS-6 rings is strongly facilitated on a surface, shifting the reaction equilibrium by four orders of magnitude compared to the bulk. Moreover, a fraction of non-canonical symmetries (i.e., different from nine) was observed. In order to understand which aspects of the system are relevant to ensure efficient self-assembly and selection of the nine-fold symmetry, we have performed Brownian dynamics computer simulation with patchy particles and then compared our results with the experimental ones. Adsorption onto the surface was simulated by a grand canonical Monte Carlo procedure and random sequential adsorption kinetics. Furthermore, self-assembly was described by Langevin equations with hydrodynamic mobility matrices. We find that as long as the interaction energies are weak, the assembly kinetics can be described well by coagulation-fragmentation equations in the reaction-limited approximation. By contrast, larger interaction energies lead to kinetic trapping and diffusion-limited assembly. We find that the selection of nine-fold symmetry requires a small value for the angular interaction range. These predictions are confirmed by the experimentally observed reaction constant and angle fluctuations. Overall, our simulations suggest that the SAS-6 system works at the crossover between a relatively weak binding energy that avoids kinetic trapping and a small angular range that favors the nine-fold symmetry.},

  abstract = {This study combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements to investigate the range of conformations that can be adopted by a pH/ionic strength (IS) sensitive protein and to quantify its distinct populations in solution. To explore how the conformational distribution of proteins may be modified in the environmental niches of biological media, we focus on the periplasmic ferric binding protein A (FbpA) from Haemophilus influenzae involved in the mechanism by which bacteria capture iron from higher organisms. We examine iron-binding/release mechanisms of FbpA in varying conditions simulating its biological environment. While we show that these changes fall within the detectable range for SAXS as evidenced by differences observed in the theoretical scattering patterns calculated from the crystal structure models of apo and holo forms, detection of conformational changes due to the point mutation D52A and changes in ionic strength (IS) from SAXS scattering profiles have been challenging. Here, to reach conclusions, statistical analyses with SAXS profiles and results from different techniques were combined in a complementary fashion. The SAXS data complemented by size exclusion chromatography point to multiple and/or alternative conformations at physiological IS, whereas they are well-explained by single crystallographic structures in low IS buffers. By fitting the SAXS data with unique conformations sampled by a series of MD simulations under conditions mimicking the buffers, we quantify the populations of the occupied substates. We also find that the D52A mutant that we predicted by coarse-grained computational modeling to allosterically control the iron binding site in FbpA, responds to the environmental changes in our experiments with conformational selection scenarios that differ from those of the wild type.},

  abstract = {Quantum chemical calculations on atomistic systems have evolved into a standard approach to studying molecular matter. These calculations often involve a significant amount of manual input and expertise, although most of this effort could be automated, which would alleviate the need for expertise in software and hardware accessibility. Here, we present the AutoRXN workflow, an automated workflow for exploratory high-throughput electronic structure calculations of molecular systems, in which (i) density functional theory methods are exploited to deliver minimum and transition-state structures and corresponding energies and properties, (ii) coupled cluster calculations are then launched for optimized structures to provide more accurate energy and property estimates, and (iii) multi-reference diagnostics are evaluated to back check the coupled cluster results and subject them to automated multi-configurational calculations for potential multi-configurational cases. All calculations are carried out in a cloud environment and support massive computational campaigns. Key features of all components of the AutoRXN workflow are autonomy, stability, and minimum operator interference. We highlight the AutoRXN workflow with the example of an autonomous reaction mechanism exploration of the mode of action of a homogeneous catalyst for the asymmetric reduction of ketones.},

Two major computational bottlenecks of DFTB ground-state calculations were addressed in our implementation: the Hamiltonian matrix diagonalization and the density matrix construction. The code was implemented and benchmarked on two different computer systems: (1) the SUMMIT IBM Power9 supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Leadership Computing Facility with 1–6 NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs per computer node and (2) an in-house Intel Xeon computer with 1–2 NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs.

  abstract = {Out-of-plane deformation in graphene is unavoidable during both synthesis and transfer procedures due to its special flexibility, which distorts the lattice and eventually imposes crucial effects on the physical features of graphene. Nowadays, however, little is known about this phenomenon, especially for zero-dimensional bulges formed in graphene. In this work, employing first-principles-based theoretical calculations, we systematically studied the bulge effect on the geometric, electronic, and transport properties of graphene. We demonstrate that the bulge formation can introduce mechanical strains (lower than 2\%) to the graphene’s lattice, which leads to a significant charge redistribution throughout the structure. More interestingly, a visible energy band splitting was observed with the occurrence of zero-dimensional bulges in graphene, which can be attributed to the interlayer coupling that stems from the bulged structure. In addition, it finds that the formed bulges in graphene increase the electron states near the Fermi level, which may account for the enhanced carrier concentration. However, the lowered carrier mobility and growing phonon scattering caused by the formed bulges diminish the transport of both electrons and heat in graphene. Finally, we indicate that bulges arising in graphene increase the possibility of intrinsic defect formation. Our work will evoke attention to the out-of-plane deformation in 2D materials and provide new light to tune their physical properties in the future.},

  abstract = {Unraveling the origin of Helmholtz capacitance is of paramount importance for understanding the interfacial structure and electrostatic potential distribution of electric double layers (EDL). In this work, we combined the methods of ab initio molecular dynamics and classical molecular dynamics and modeled electrified Cu(100)/electrolyte and graphene/electrolyte interfaces for comparison. It was proposed that the Helmholtz capacitance is composed of three parts connected in series: the usual solvent capacitance, water chemisorption induced capacitance, and Pauling repulsion caused gap capacitance. We found the Helmholtz capacitance of graphene is significantly lower than that of Cu(100), which was attributed to two intrinsic factors. One is that graphene has a wider gap layer at interface, and the other is that graphene is less active for water chemisorption. Finally, based on our findings, we provide suggestions for how to increase the EDL capacitance of graphene-based materials in future work, and we also suggest that the new understanding of the potential distribution across the Helmholtz layer may help explain some experimental phenomena of electrocatalysis.},

In this study, intermolecular or noncovalent interactions were studied for 1,3-dimethyl imidazolium [DMIM] + cation and nitrate [NO 3 ] − anion with water, employing quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using a revised multipolar polarizable force field. The effect of water on ionic liquids was evaluated in terms of thermodynamic and dynamic properties. Thermodynamic properties included liquid densities ρ , excess molar volumes Δ V E , and liquid structures g r ⁠ . Dynamic properties included self-diffusion coefficients D of mixture constituents as a function of water concentration. The density of ionic liquid–water mixtures monotonically decrease with increasing concentration of water. A negative excess volume was obtained for low and high water concentrations, demonstrating strong intermolecular interactions of water with ionic liquid components. Liquid structures of ionic liquid–water mixtures revealed a tendency for anions to interact with cations at shorter intermolecular distances when the water concentration is increased. Diffusion rates were found to increase for all mixture components with increase in the fraction of water. A significant change in the diffusion rate was found at ∼0.3 weight fraction of water. However, the water self-diffusion coefficient was dominant at all concentrations. The ratio of water/anion and anion/cation self-diffusion coefficients was found to decrease linearly with increasing concentration of water molecules.},

Within the density-functional theory, we employed two models sharing the same exchange-correlation functional but differing in the pseudopotential (PP) implementation [namely, Trouiller–Martins (TM) and Goedecker, Teter, and Hutter (GTH)]. They are both compatible with experimental data, and however, the TM PP construction results in a Ge tetrahedral environment largely predominant over the octahedral one, although the proportion of tetrahedra is considerably smaller when the GTH PP is used. We show that the difference in the local structure between TM and GTH models impacts the vibrational density of states while the thermal conductivity does not feature any appreciable sensitivity to such details. This behavior is rationalized in terms of extended vibrational modes.},

In this study, we propose a graph neural network model, “BOnd TArgeting Network,” that learns relative motion between neighboring pairs of particles, in addition to the self-motion of particles. By relating the structural features to these two different dynamical variables, the model autonomously acquires the ability to discern how the self motion of particles undergoing slow relaxation is affected by different dynamical processes, strain fluctuations and particle rearrangements, and thus can predict with high precision how slow structural relaxation develops in space and time.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional crystalline frameworks with nanoscale periodicity are valuable for many emerging technologies, from nanophotonics to nanomedicine. DNA nanotechnology has emerged as a prime route for constructing these materials, with most approaches taking advantage of the structural rigidity and bond directionality programmable for DNA building blocks. Recently, we have introduced an alternative strategy reliant on flexible, amphiphilic DNA junctions dubbed C-stars , whose ability to crystallize is modulated by design parameters, such as nanostructure topology, conformation, rigidity, and size. While C-stars have been shown to form ordered phases with controllable lattice parameter, response to stimuli, and embedded functionalities, much of their vast design space remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the effect of changing the chemical nature of the hydrophobic modifications and the structure of the DNA motifs in the vicinity of these moieties. While similar design variations should strongly alter key properties of the hydrophobic interactions between C-stars, such as strength and valency, only limited differences in self-assembly behavior are observed. This finding suggests that long-range order in C-star crystals is likely imposed by structural features of the building block itself rather than the specific characteristics of the hydrophobic tags. Nonetheless, we find that altering the hydrophobic regions influences the ability of C-star crystals to uptake hydrophobic molecular cargoes, which we exemplify by studying the encapsulation of antibiotic penicillin V. Besides advancing our understanding of the principles governing the self-assembly of amphiphilic DNA building blocks, our observations thus open up new routes to chemically program the materials without affecting their structure.},

Of these, the BDEs of only TiN and HfN had been previously measured. Due to the many ways electrons can be distributed among the d orbitals, these molecules possess an extremely high density of electronic states near the ground separated atom limit. Spin–orbit and nonadiabatic interactions couple these states quite effectively, so that the molecules readily find a path to dissociation when excited above the ground separated atom limit. The result is a sharp drop in ion signal in the R2PI spectrum when the molecule is excited above this limit, allowing the BDE to be readily measured. Using this method, the values D 0 (ScN) = 3.905(29) eV, D 0 (TiN) = 5.000(19) eV, D 0 (YN) = 4.125(24) eV, D 0 (MoN) = 5.220(4) eV, D 0 (RuN) = 4.905(3) eV, D 0 (RhN) = 3.659(32) eV, D 0 (HfN) = 5.374(4) eV, D 0 (OsN) = 5.732(3) eV, and D 0 (IrN) = 5.115(4) eV are obtained. To support the experimental findings, ab initio coupled-cluster calculations extrapolated to the complete basis set limit (CBS) were performed. With a semiempirical correction for spin–orbit effects, these coupled-cluster single double triple-CBS calculations give a mean absolute deviation from the experimental BDE values of 0.20 eV. A discussion of the periodic trends, summaries of previous work, and comparisons to isoelectronic species is also provided.},

With this parameter and excitation energies of alkali-metal and noble-gas atoms, the hyperfine splitting frequency of alkali-metal atoms is suitable for investigating the properties of noble-gas atoms, such as the s-wave scattering length of electrons, the electric-dipole polarizability, and the van der Waals radius. This study suggests the possibility of improving excitation energies and van der Waals potentials of colliding pairs.},

  abstract = {The linear radical cation of cyanoacetylene, HC 3 N + ( 2 Π), is not only of astrophysical interest, being the, so far undetected, cationic counterpart of the abundant cyanoaceteylene, but also of fundamental spectroscopic interest due to its strong spin–orbit and Renner–Teller interactions. Here, we present the first broadband vibrational action spectroscopic investigation of this ion through the infrared pre-dissociation (IRPD) method using a Ne tag. Experiments have been performed using the FELion cryogenic ion-trap instrument in combination with the FELIX free-electron lasers and a Laservision optical parametric oscillator/optical parametric amplifier system. The vibronic splitting patterns of the three interacting bending modes ( ν 5 , ν 6 , ν 7 ), ranging from 180 to 1600 cm −1 , could be fully resolved revealing several bands that were previously unobserved. The associated Renner–Teller and intermode coupling constants have been determined by fitting an effective Hamiltonian to the experimental data, and the obtained spectroscopic constants are in reasonable agreement with previous photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) studies and ab initio calculations on the HC 3 N + ion. The influence of the attached Ne atom on the infrared spectrum has been investigated by ab initio calculations at the RCCSD(T)-F12a level of theory, which strongly indicates that the discrepancies between the IRPD and PES data are a result of the effects of the Ne attachment.},

After deposition, only the two chelated forms are observed while they isomerize upon UV irradiation toward nonchelated species. From previous UV irradiation effects, we have already identified several nonchelated isomers, capable, in turn, of isomerizing and fragmenting; even fragmentation seems to be most unlikely due to cryogenic cages confinement. Based on these findings, we have attempted an approach to understand the reaction path of electronic relaxation. Indeed, we have demonstrated, in previous studies, that in the case of malonaldehyde, this electronic relaxation pathway proceeds through singlet states while it proceeds through triplet ones in the case of acetylacetone. We observed CO and CO 2 formations when photochemistry is almost observed among nonchelated forms, i.e., when the parent molecule is almost totally consumed. In order to identify a triplet state transition, we have tried to observe a “heavy atom effect” by increasing the weight of the matrix gas, from Ne to Xe, and to quench the T 1 state by doping the matrices with O 2 . It appears that, as in the case of acetylacetone, it is the nonchelated forms that fragment. It also appears that these fragmentations certainly take place in the T 1 triplet state and originate in an Π* ← n transition.},

  abstract = {Coagulation is a key factor governing the size distribution of nanoclusters during the high temperature synthesis of metal oxide nanomaterials. Population balance models are strongly influenced by the coagulation rate coefficient utilized. Although simplified coagulation models are often invoked, the coagulation process, particularly for nanoscale particles, is complex, affected by the coagulating nanocluster sizes, the surrounding temperature, and potential interactions. Toward developing improved models of nanocluster and nanoparticle growth, we have developed a neural network (NN) model to describe titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanocluster coagulation rate coefficients, trained with molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory calculations. Specifically, we first calculated TiO 2 nanocluster coagulation probabilities via MD trajectory calculations varying the nanocluster diameters from 0.6 to 3.0 nm, initial relative velocity from 20 to 700 m s −1 , and impact parameter from 0.0 to 8.0 nm. Calculations consider dipole–dipole interactions, dispersion interactions, and short-range repulsive interactions. We trained a NN model to predict whether a given set of nanocluster diameters, impact parameter, and initial velocity would lead to the outcome of coagulation. The accuracy between the predicted outcomes from the NN model and the MD trajectory calculation results is &gt;95\%. We subsequently utilized both the NN model and MD trajectory calculations to examine coagulation rate coefficients at 300 and 1000 K. The NN model predictions are largely within the range 0.65–1.54 of MD predictions, and importantly NN predictions capture the local minimum coagulation rate coefficients observed in MD trajectory calculations. The NN model can be directly implemented in population balances of TiO 2 formation.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has recently been gaining popularity as an alternative to the more common transient absorption spectroscopy due to the combination of high frequency and time resolution of 2DES. In order to advance the reliable analysis of population dynamics and to optimize the time resolution of the method, one has to understand the numerous field matter interactions that take place at an early and negative time. These interactions have historically been discussed in one-dimensional spectroscopy as coherent artifacts and have been assigned to both resonant and non-resonant system responses during or before the pulse overlap. These coherent artifacts have also been described in 2DES but remain less well-understood due to the complexity of 2DES and the relative novelty of the method. Here, we present 2DES results in two model nanocrystal samples, CdSe and CsPbI 3 . We demonstrate non-resonant signals due to solvent response during the pulse overlap and resonant signals, which we assign to perturbed free induction decay (PFID), both before and during the pulse overlap. The simulations of the 2DES response functions at early and negative time delays reinforce the assignment of the negative time delay signals to PFID. Modeling reveals that the PFID signals will severely distort the initial picture of the resonant population dynamics. By including these effects in models of 2DES spectra, one is able to push forward the extraction of early time dynamics in 2DES.},

The model is obtained via direct Boltzmann inversion using all-atom simulations of a single molecule, and its particular form is selected from a large pool of 6-bead coarse-grained models using two suitable metrics that quantify the agreement in the distribution of collective coordinates between all-atom and coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations of solutions in the dilute limit. For immunoglobulin G (IgG), a similar structure-based 12-bead model has been introduced in the literature [Chaudhri et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 116 , 8045 (2012)] and is employed here to compare findings for the compact BSA molecule and the more anisotropic IgG molecule. We define several modified coarse-grained models of BSA and IgG, which differ in their internal constraints and thus account for a variation of flexibility. We study denser solutions of the coarse-grained models with purely repulsive molecules (achievable by suitable salt conditions) and address the effect of packing and flexibility on dynamic and static behavior. Translational and rotational self-diffusivity is enhanced for more elastic models. Finally, we discuss a number of effective sphere sizes for the BSA molecule, which can be defined from its static and dynamic properties. Here, it is found that the effective sphere diameters lie between 4.9 and 6.1 nm, corresponding to a relative spread of about ±10\% around a mean of 5.5 nm.},

  abstract = {Deep neural network (DNN) potentials have recently gained popularity in computer simulations of a wide range of molecular systems, from liquids to materials. In this study, we explore the possibility of combining the computational efficiency of the DeePMD framework and the demonstrated accuracy of the MB-pol data-driven, many-body potential to train a DNN potential for large-scale simulations of water across its phase diagram. We find that the DNN potential is able to reliably reproduce the MB-pol results for liquid water, but provides a less accurate description of the vapor–liquid equilibrium properties. This shortcoming is traced back to the inability of the DNN potential to correctly represent many-body interactions. An attempt to explicitly include information about many-body effects results in a new DNN potential that exhibits the opposite performance, being able to correctly reproduce the MB-pol vapor–liquid equilibrium properties, but losing accuracy in the description of the liquid properties. These results suggest that DeePMD-based DNN potentials are not able to correctly “learn” and, consequently, represent many-body interactions, which implies that DNN potentials may have limited ability to predict the properties for state points that are not explicitly included in the training process. The computational efficiency of the DeePMD framework can still be exploited to train DNN potentials on data-driven many-body potentials, which can thus enable large-scale, “chemically accurate” simulations of various molecular systems, with the caveat that the target state points must have been adequately sampled by the reference data-driven many-body potential in order to guarantee a faithful representation of the associated properties.},

  abstract = {As correlation strength has a key influence on the simulation of strongly correlated materials, many approaches have been proposed to obtain the parameter using first-principles calculations. However, a comparison of the different Coulomb strengths obtained using these approaches and an investigation of the mechanisms behind them are still needed. Taking lanthanide metals as an example, we research the factors that affect the effective Coulomb interaction strength, U eff , by local screened Coulomb correction (LSCC), linear response (LR), and constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package. The U eff LSCC value increases from 4.75 to 7.78 eV, U eff LR is almost stable at about 6.0 eV (except for Eu, Er, and Yb), and U eff cRPA shows a two-stage decreasing trend in both light and heavy lanthanides. To investigate these differences, we establish a scheme to analyze the coexistence and competition between the orbital localization and the screening effect. We find that LSCC and cRPA are dominated by the orbital localization and the screening effect, respectively, whereas LR shows the balance of the competition between the two factors. Additionally, the performance of these approaches is influenced by different starting points from the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and PBE + U , especially for cRPA. Our results provide useful knowledge for understanding the U eff of lanthanide materials, and similar analyses can also be used in the research of other correlation strength simulation approaches.},

  abstract = {Due to the ubiquity and importance of water, water dimer has been intensively studied. Computing the (ro-)vibrational spectrum of water dimer is challenging. The potential has eight wells separated by low barriers, which makes harmonic approximations of limited utility. A variational approach is imperative, but difficult because there are 12 coupled vibrational coordinates. In this paper, we use a product contracted basis whose functions are products of intramolecular and intermolecular functions computed using an iterative eigensolver. An intermediate matrix F facilitates calculating matrix elements. Using F , it is possible to do calculations on a general potential without storing the potential on the full quadrature grid. We find that surprisingly many intermolecular functions are required. This is due to the importance of coupling between inter- and intra-molecular coordinates. The full G 16 symmetry of water dimer is exploited. We calculate, for the first time, monomer excited stretch states and compare P (1) transition frequencies with their experimental counterparts. We also compare with experimental vibrational shifts and tunneling splittings. Surprisingly, we find that the largest tunneling splitting, which does not involve the interchange of the two monomers, is smaller in the asymmetric stretch excited state than in the ground state. Differences between levels we compute and those obtained with a [6+6]D adiabatic approximation [Leforestier et al. J. Chem. Phys. 137 014305 (2012)] are ∼ 0.6 cm −1 for states without monomer excitation, ∼ 4 cm −1 for monomer excited bend states, and as large as ∼ 10 cm −1 for monomer excited stretch states.},

At this limit, the respective natural orbitals (NOs) are given by symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of “half-space” orbitals with the corresponding natural amplitudes having the same amplitudes but opposite signs. Minimization of the resulting explicit functional yields the large- R asymptotics for the occupation numbers of the weakly occupied NOs and the C 6 dispersion coefficient. The highly accurate approximates for the radial components of the p -type “half-space” orbitals and the corresponding occupation numbers (that decay like R −6 ), which are available for the first time thanks to the development of the present formalism, have some unexpected properties.},

The time-dependent induced magnetic moment is used to compute the ECD spectrum from an explicit electric perturbation. The full matrix representing the transition magnetic moment in the space of electronic states is generated from that among pairs of molecular orbitals. In the present work, we show the ECD spectra of methyloxirane, of several conformers of L-alanine, and of the Λ-Co(acac) 3 complex, computed from a singly excited ansatz of time-dependent density functional theory eigenstates. The time-domain ECD spectra properly reproduce the frequency-domain ones obtained in the linear-response regime and quantitatively agree with the available experimental data. Moreover, the time-domain approach to ECD allows us to naturally go beyond the ground-state rotationally averaged ECD spectrum, which is the standard outcome of the linear-response theory, e.g., by computing the ECD spectra from electronic excited states.},

  abstract = {A new algorithm based on a rigorous theorem and quantum data computationally mined from element 118 guarantees automated construction of initial Fermi–Löwdin-Orbital (FLO) starting points for all elements in the Periodic Table. It defines a means for constructing a small library of scalable FLOs for universal use in molecular and solid-state calculations. The method can be systematically improved for greater efficiency and for applications to excited states such as x-ray excitations and optically silent excitations. FLOs were introduced to recast the Perdew–Zunger self-interaction correction (PZSIC) into an explicit unitarily invariant form. The FLOs are generated from a set of N quasi-classical electron positions, referred to as Fermi-Orbital descriptors (FODs), and a set of N -orthonormal single-electron orbitals. FOD positions, when optimized, minimize the PZSIC total energy. However, creating sets of starting FODs that lead to a positive definite Fermi orbital overlap matrix has proven to be challenging for systems composed of open-shell atoms and ions. The proof herein guarantees the existence of a FLOSIC solution and further guarantees that if a solution for N electrons is found, it can be used to generate a minimum of N − 1 and a maximum of 2 N − 2 initial starting points for systems composed of a smaller number of electrons. Applications to heavy and super-heavy atoms are presented. All starting solutions reported here were obtained from a solution for element 118, Oganesson.},

This method was used to investigate the effect of spontaneous curvature ( H 0 ) for a lipid monolayer on the rate constant ( k r ) for constant tension ( σ )-induced rupture, which originates from pore formation in lipid bilayers. Lipids were incorporated with different H 0 values into GUV membranes to change the overall H 0 value for the GUV monolayer. The dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG)/dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) (4/6, molar ratio, here and elsewhere) monolayer has a negative H 0 , whereas the DOPG/dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) (4/6) monolayer has an essentially zero H 0 . A higher tension was required to induce the rupture of DOPG/DOPE (4/6)-GUVs compared with DOPG/DOPC (4/6)-GUVs. The line tension ( Γ ) for a pre-pore in DOPG/DOPE (4/6)-GUVs, determined by the analysis of the tension dependence of k r , was 1.5 times larger than that in DOPG/DOPC (4/6)-GUVs. The k r values for GUVs comprising DOPG/DOPC/18:1 lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (40/55/10), which has a positive H 0 , were larger than those for DOPG/DOPC (4/6)-GUVs under the same tension. The Γ value for DOPG/DOPC/LPC (40/55/10)-GUVs was almost half that for DOPG/DOPC (4/6)-GUVs. These results indicate that Γ decreases with increasing H 0 , which results in an increase in k r . Based on these results, the effect of H 0 on k r and Γ is discussed.},

  abstract = {This Perspective presents an overview of the development of the hierarchy of Davydov’s Ansätze and a few of their applications in many-body problems in computational chemical physics. Davydov’s solitons originated in the investigation of vibrational energy transport in proteins in the 1970s. Momentum-space projection of these solitary waves turned up to be accurate variational ground-state wave functions for the extended Holstein molecular crystal model, lending unambiguous evidence to the absence of formal quantum phase transitions in Holstein systems. The multiple Davydov Ansätze have been proposed, with increasing Ansatz multiplicity, as incremental improvements of their single-Ansatz parents. For a given Hamiltonian, the time-dependent variational formalism is utilized to extract accurate dynamic and spectroscopic properties using Davydov’s Ansätze as its trial states. A quantity proven to disappear for large multiplicities, the Ansatz relative deviation is introduced to quantify how closely the Schrödinger equation is obeyed. Three finite-temperature extensions to the time-dependent variation scheme are elaborated, i.e., the Monte Carlo importance sampling, the method of thermofield dynamics, and the method of displaced number states. To demonstrate the versatility of the methodology, this Perspective provides applications of Davydov’s Ansätze to the generalized Holstein Hamiltonian, variants of the spin-boson model, and systems of cavity-assisted singlet fission, where accurate dynamic and spectroscopic properties of the many-body systems are given by the Davydov trial states.},

Our x-ray diffraction studies clearly indicate that the compounds exhibit a frustrated tilted smectic phase with layer undulated structure. The low value of the dielectric constant as well as switching current measurements indicate the absence of polarization in this layer undulated phase. In spite of the absence of polarization, a planar aligned sample can be transformed irreversibly to a higher birefringent texture on the application of a high electric field. The zero field texture can only be retrieved by heating the sample to the isotropic phase and cooling it subsequently to the mesophase. We propose a double tilted smectic structure having layer undulation to account for the experimental observations with the layer undulation arising due to the leaning of the molecules in the layer.},

After assembly, the network connectivity and topology are frozen and the resulting system is characterized. We find that the fractal structure of the network depends on the number density at which the assembly has been carried out, but that systems with the same mean valence and same assembly density have the same structural properties. Moreover, we compute the long-time limit of the mean-squared displacement, also known as the (squared) localization length, of the cross-links and of the middle monomers of the strands, showing that the dynamics of long strands is well described by the tube model. Finally, we find a relation connecting these two localization lengths at high density and connect the cross-link localization length to the shear modulus of the system.},

  abstract = {In striking contrast to equilibrium systems, inertia can profoundly alter the structure of active systems. Here, we demonstrate that driven systems can exhibit effective equilibrium-like states with increasing particle inertia, despite rigorously violating the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. Increasing inertia progressively eliminates motility-induced phase separation and restores equilibrium crystallization for active Brownian spheres. This effect appears to be general for a wide class of active systems, including those driven by deterministic time-dependent external fields, whose nonequilibrium patterns ultimately disappear with increasing inertia. The path to this effective equilibrium limit can be complex, with finite inertia sometimes acting to accentuate nonequilibrium transitions. The restoration of near equilibrium statistics can be understood through the conversion of active momentum sources to passive-like stresses. Unlike truly equilibrium systems, the effective temperature is now density dependent, the only remnant of the nonequilibrium dynamics. This density-dependent temperature can in principle introduce departures from equilibrium expectations, particularly in response to strong gradients. Our results provide additional insight into the effective temperature ansatz while revealing a mechanism to tune nonequilibrium phase transitions.},

Temperature-dependent structural investigation suggests a faster network formation with increasing temperature, and the gel adopts a more compact network, which is inconsistent with the conventional understanding of thermal aggregation. The resulting gel network shows a fractal dimension δ , ranging from 1.5 to 2.2. The values of δ display a non-monotonic behavior with increasing amount of salt. The corresponding dynamics in the q range of 0.002–0.1 nm −1 is observable after major change of the gel structure. The extracted relaxation time exhibits a two-step power law growth in dynamics as a function of waiting time. In the first regime, the dynamics is associated with structural growth, whereas the second regime is associated with the aging of the gel, which is directly linked with its compactness, as quantified by the fractal dimension. The gel dynamics is characterized by a compressed exponential relaxation with a ballistic-type of motion. The addition of salt gradually makes the early stage dynamics faster. Both gelation kinetics and microscopic dynamics show that the activation energy barrier in the system systematically decreases with increasing salt concentration.},

  abstract = {Bacterial biofilms mechanically behave as viscoelastic media consisting of micron-sized bacteria cross-linked to a self-produced network of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) embedded in water. Structural principles for numerical modeling aim at describing mesoscopic viscoelasticity without losing details on the underlying interactions existing in wide regimes of deformation under hydrodynamic stress. Here, we approach the computational challenge to model bacterial biofilms for predictive mechanics in silico under variable stress conditions. Up-to-date models are not entirely satisfactory due to the plethora of parameters required to make them functioning under the effects of stress. As guided by the structural depiction gained in a previous work with Pseudomonas fluorescens [Jara et al. , Front. Microbiol. 11, 588884 (2021)], we propose a mechanical modeling by means of Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), which captures the essentials of topological and compositional interactions between bacterial particles and cross-linked EPS-embedding under imposed shear. The P. fluorescens biofilms have been modeled under mechanical stress mimicking shear stresses as undergone in vitro . The predictive capacity for mechanical features in DPD-simulated biofilms has been investigated by varying the externally imposed field of shear strain at variable amplitude and frequency. The parametric map of essential biofilm ingredients has been explored by making the rheological responses to emerge among conservative mesoscopic interactions and frictional dissipation in the underlying microscale. The proposed coarse grained DPD simulation qualitatively catches the rheology of the P. fluorescens biofilm over several decades of dynamic scaling.},

This combination could offer the gas adsorption properties of MOFs together with the mechanical stability and processability of PIMs, opening up a space of flexible, highly responsive adsorbing materials. In order to understand their structure and behavior, we present a process for the construction of amorphous SPCPs from secondary building blocks. We then use classical molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the resulting structures based on branch functionalities (f), pore size distributions (PSDs), and radial distribution functions and compare them to experimentally synthesized analogs. In the course of this comparison, we demonstrate that the pore structure of SPCPs is due to both pores intrinsic to the secondary building blocks, and intercolloid spacing between colloid particles. We also illustrate the differences in nanoscale structure based on linker length and flexibility, particularly in the PSDs, finding that stiff linkers tend to produce SPCPs with larger maximum pore sizes.},

  abstract = {A highly active heterogenized molecular CO 2 reduction catalyst on a conductive carbon support is investigated to identify if its improved catalytic activity can be attributed to strong electronic interactions between catalyst and support. The molecular structure and electronic character of a [Re +1 (tBu-bpy)(CO) 3 Cl] (tBu-bpy = 4,4′-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine) catalyst deposited on multiwalled carbon nanotubes are characterized using Re L 3 -edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy under electrochemical conditions and compared to the homogeneous catalyst. The Re oxidation state is characterized from the near-edge absorption region, while structural changes of the catalyst are assessed from the extended x-ray absorption fine structure under reducing conditions. Chloride ligand dissociation and a Re-centered reduction are both observed under applied reducing potential. The results confirm weak coupling of [Re(tBu-bpy)(CO) 3 Cl] with the support, since the supported catalyst exhibits the same oxidation changes as the homogeneous case. However, these results do not preclude strong interactions between a reduced catalyst intermediate and the support, preliminarily investigated here using quantum mechanical calculations. Thus, our results suggest that complicated linkage schemes and strong electronic interactions with the initial catalyst species are not required to improve the activity of heterogenized molecular catalysts.},

The results reveal that the density ratio and Ohnesorge number do not significantly affect the PDR. On the other hand, the viscosity ratio considerably affects the PDR, and a maximum PDR of 62\% compared to a smooth non-lubricated microchannel is achieved for a viscosity ratio of 0.01. Interestingly, the higher the Reynolds number of the working fluid, the higher the PDR. The meniscus shape within the microgrooves is strongly affected by the Reynolds number of the working fluid. Despite the insignificant effect of interfacial tension on the PDR, the interface shape within the microgrooves is appreciably influenced by this parameter.},

Such massive electronic excitation severely alters the interatomic potentials, producing unusual nonequilibrium states of matter and different chemistry. We employ density functional theory and tight binding molecular dynamics formalisms to study the response of bulk water to ultrafast excitation of its electrons. After a certain threshold electronic temperature, the water becomes electronically conducting via the collapse of its bandgap. At high doses, it is accompanied by nonthermal acceleration of ions to a temperature of a few thousand Kelvins within sub-100 fs timescales. We identify the interplay of this nonthermal mechanism with the electron–ion coupling, enhancing the electron-to-ions energy transfer. Various chemically active fragments are formed from the disintegrating water molecules, depending on the deposited dose.},

  abstract = {Protonated molecules have been increasingly detected in the interstellar medium (ISM), and usually astrochemical models fail at reproducing the abundances derived from observational spectra. Rigorous interpretation of the detected interstellar emission lines requires prior calculations of collisional rate coefficients with H 2 and He, i.e., the most abundant species in the ISM. In this work, we focus on the excitation of HCNH + induced by collision with H 2 and He. Therefore, we first calculate ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs) using the explicitly correlated and standard coupled cluster method with single, double, and non-iterative triple excitation in conjunction with the augmented-correlation consistent-polarized valence triple zeta basis set. Both the HCNH + –H 2 and HCNH + –He potentials are characterized by deep global minima of 1426.60 and 271.72 cm −1 , respectively, and large anisotropies. From these PESs, we derive state-to-state inelastic cross sections for the 16 low-lying rotational energy levels of HCNH + using the quantum mechanical close-coupling approach. The differences between cross sections due to ortho- and para- H 2 impacts turn out to be minor. Using a thermal average of these data, we retrieve downward rate coefficients for kinetic temperatures of up to 100 K. As it could be anticipated, differences of up to two orders of magnitude exist between the rate coefficients induced by H 2 and He collisions. We expect that our new collision data will help to improve the disagreement between abundances retrieved from observational spectra and astrochemical models.},

  abstract = {Photochromic molecules are widely studied and developed for their many potential applications. To optimize the required properties through theoretical models, a considerable chemical space is to be explored, and their environment in devices is to be accounted for.. To this end, cheap and reliable computational methods can be powerful tools to steer synthetic developments. As ab initio methods remain costly for extensive studies (in terms of the size of the system and/or number of molecules), semiempirical methods such as density functional tight-binding (TB) could offer a good compromise between accuracy computational cost. However, these approaches necessitate benchmarking on the families of compounds of interest. Thus, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the accuracy of several key features calculated with TB methods (DFTB2, DFTB3, GFN2-xTB, and LC-DFTB2) for three sets of photochromic organic molecules: azobenzene (AZO), norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC), and dithienylethene (DTE) derivatives. The features considered here are the optimized geometries, the difference in energy between the two isomers (ΔE), and of the energies of the first relevant excited states. All the TB results are compared to those obtained with DFT methods and state-of-the-art electronic structure calculation methods: DLPNO-CCSD(T) for ground states and DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD for excited states. Our results show that, overall, DFTB3 is the TB method leading to the best results for the geometries and the ΔE values and can be used alone for these purposes for NBD/QC and DTE derivatives. Single point calculations at the r2SCAN-3c level using TB geometries allow circumventing the deficiencies of the TB methods in the AZO series. For electronic transition calculations, the range separated LC-DFTB2 method is the most accurate TB method tested for AZO and NBD/QC derivatives, in close agreement with the reference.},

  abstract = {The interaction of water with different substances in the earth’s atmosphere lies at the heart of many processes that influence our climate. However, it is still unclear how different species interact with water on the molecular level and in which ways this interaction contributes to the water vapor phase transition. Here, we report the first measurements of water–nonane binary nucleation in the 50–110 K temperature range, along with unary nucleation data of both. The time-dependent cluster size distribution in a uniform post-nozzle flow was measured by time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled with single-photon ionization. From these data, we extract experimental rates and rate constants for both nucleation and cluster growth. The observed mass spectra of water/nonane clusters are not or only slightly affected by the introduction of the other vapor, and the formation of mixed clusters was not observed during nucleation of the mixed vapor. Additionally, the nucleation rate of either substance is not much affected by the presence (or absence) of the other species, i.e., the nucleation of water and nonane proceeds independently, indicating that hetero-molecular clusters do not play a role during nucleation. Only at the lowest temperature of our experiment (i.e., 51 K) do the measurements suggest that interspecies interaction slows water cluster growth. The findings here are in contrast to our earlier work in which we showed that vapor components in other mixtures, e.g., CO 2 and toluene/H 2 O, can interact to promote nucleation and cluster growth in a similar temperature range.},

  abstract = {Ab initio and semiempirical electronic structure methods are usually implemented in separate software packages or use entirely different code paths. As a result, it can be time-consuming to transfer an established ab initio electronic structure scheme to a semiempirical Hamiltonian. We present an approach to unify ab initio and semiempirical electronic structure code paths based on a separation of the wavefunction ansatz and the needed matrix representations of operators. With this separation, the Hamiltonian can refer to either an ab initio or semiempirical treatment of the resulting integrals. We built a semiempirical integral library and interfaced it to the GPU-accelerated electronic structure code TeraChem. Equivalency between ab initio and semiempirical tight-binding Hamiltonian terms is assigned according to their dependence on the one-electron density matrix. The new library provides semiempirical equivalents of the Hamiltonian matrix and gradient intermediates, corresponding to those provided by the ab initio integral library. This enables the straightforward combination of semiempirical Hamiltonians with the full pre-existing ground and excited state functionality of the ab initio electronic structure code. We demonstrate the capability of this approach by combining the extended tight-binding method GFN1-xTB with both spin-restricted ensemble-referenced Kohn–Sham and complete active space methods. We also present a highly efficient GPU implementation of the semiempirical Mulliken-approximated Fock exchange. The additional computational cost for this term becomes negligible even on consumer-grade GPUs, enabling Mulliken-approximated exchange in tight-binding methods for essentially no additional cost.},

  abstract = {Linear and nonlinear electronic spectra provide an important tool to probe the absorption and transfer of electronic energy. Here, we introduce a pure state Ehrenfest approach to obtain accurate linear and nonlinear spectra that is applicable to systems with large numbers of excited states and complex chemical environments. We achieve this by representing the initial conditions as sums of pure states and unfolding multi-time correlation functions into the Schrödinger picture. By doing this, we show that one can obtain significant improvements in accuracy over the previously used projected Ehrenfest approach and that these benefits are particularly pronounced in cases where the initial condition is a coherence between excited states. While such initial conditions do not arise when calculating linear electronic spectra, they play a vital role in capturing multidimensional spectroscopies. We demonstrate the performance of our method by showing that it is able to quantitatively capture the exact linear, 2D electronic spectroscopy, and pump–probe spectra for a Frenkel exciton model in slow bath regimes and is even able to reproduce the main spectral features in fast bath regimes.},

Instead, we introduce weaker orthogonality constraints between geminals that significantly lower the computational effort without sacrificing the indistinguishability of the electrons. That is to say, the electron pairs corresponding to the geminals are not fully distinguishable, and their product has yet to be antisymmetrized according to the Pauli principle to form a bona fide electronic wave function. Our geometrical constraints translate into simple equations involving the traces of products of our geminal matrices. In the simplest non-trivial model, a set of solutions is given by block-diagonal matrices where each block is 2 × 2 and consists of either a Pauli matrix or a normalized diagonal matrix multiplied by a complex parameter to be optimized. With this simplified Ansatz for geminals, the number of terms in the calculation of the matrix elements of quantum observables is considerably reduced. A proof of principle is reported and confirms that the Ansatz is more accurate than strongly orthogonal geminal products while remaining computationally affordable.},

In this study, we reveal that the largely displaced atoms in the MEP structures maintain transient chemical bond lengths resembling those of the same type in the stable initial and final states. Based on this discovery, we propose an adaptive semirigid body approximation (ASBA) to construct a physically reasonable initial guess for the MEP structures, which can be further optimized by the nudged elastic band method. Examination of several distinct dynamical processes in bulk, on crystal surface, and through two-dimensional system shows that our transition state calculations based on the ASBA results are robust and significantly faster than those based on the popular linear interpolation and image-dependent pair potential methods.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence-enhanced quantum mechanical method 1 (AIQM1) is a general-purpose method that was shown to achieve high accuracy for many applications with a speed close to its baseline semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) method ODM2*. Here, we evaluate the hitherto unknown performance of out-of-the-box AIQM1 without any refitting for reaction barrier heights on eight datasets, including a total of ∼24 thousand reactions. This evaluation shows that AIQM1’s accuracy strongly depends on the type of transition state and ranges from excellent for rotation barriers to poor for, e.g., pericyclic reactions. AIQM1 clearly outperforms its baseline ODM2* method and, even more so, a popular universal potential, ANI-1ccx. Overall, however, AIQM1 accuracy largely remains similar to SQM methods (and B3LYP/6-31G* for most reaction types) suggesting that it is desirable to focus on improving AIQM1 performance for barrier heights in the future. We also show that the built-in uncertainty quantification helps in identifying confident predictions. The accuracy of confident AIQM1 predictions is approaching the level of popular density functional theory methods for most reaction types. Encouragingly, AIQM1 is rather robust for transition state optimizations, even for the type of reactions it struggles with the most. Single-point calculations with high-level methods on AIQM1-optimized geometries can be used to significantly improve barrier heights, which cannot be said for its baseline ODM2* method.},

  abstract = {Modern chemical science and industries critically depend on the application of various catalytic methods. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of these processes still remain not fully understood. Recent experimental advances that produced highly-efficient nanoparticle catalysts allowed researchers to obtain more quantitative descriptions, opening the way to clarify the microscopic picture of catalysis. Stimulated by these developments, we present a minimal theoretical model that investigates the effect of heterogeneity in catalytic processes at the single-particle level. Using a discrete-state stochastic framework that accounts for the most relevant chemical transitions, we explicitly evaluated the dynamics of chemical reactions on single heterogeneous nanocatalysts with different types of active sites. It is found that the degree of stochastic noise in nanoparticle catalytic systems depends on several factors that include the heterogeneity of catalytic efficiencies of active sites and distinctions between chemical mechanisms on different active sites. The proposed theoretical approach provides a single-molecule view of heterogeneous catalysis and also suggests possible quantitative routes to clarify some important molecular details of nanocatalysts.},

To bridge the gap between the macroscopic electrical properties and the microscopic water-uptake mechanism, we investigated the hydration process of a Nafion membrane using ambient-pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) from vacuum up to ∼90\% relative humidity at room temperature. The O 1s and S 1s spectra provided a quantitative analysis of the water content ( λ ) and the transformation of the sulfonic acid group (–SO 3 H) to its deprotonated type (–SO 3 − ) during the water-uptake process. Taking advantage of a specially designed two-electrode cell, the conductivity of the membrane was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy before APXPS measurements with the same conditions, thereby establishing the connection between the electrical properties and the microscopic mechanism. By means of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory, the core-level binding energies of O- and S-containing species in the Nafion + H 2 O system were obtained.},

  abstract = {Designing realistic quantum mechanical (QM) models of enzymes is dependent on reliably discerning and modeling residues, solvents, and cofactors important in crafting the active site microenvironment. Interatomic van der Waals contacts have previously demonstrated usefulness toward designing QM-models, but their measured values (and subsequent residue importance rankings) are expected to be influenceable by subtle changes in protein structure. Using chorismate mutase as a case study, this work examines the differences in ligand-residue interatomic contacts between an x-ray crystal structure and structures from a molecular dynamics simulation. Select structures are further analyzed using symmetry adapted perturbation theory to compute ab initio ligand-residue interaction energies. The findings of this study show that ligand-residue interatomic contacts measured for an x-ray crystal structure are not predictive of active site contacts from a sampling of molecular dynamics frames. In addition, the variability in interatomic contacts among structures is not correlated with variability in interaction energies. However, the results spotlight using interaction energies to characterize and rank residue importance in future computational enzymology workflows.},

  abstract = {The self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles into ordered superlattices typically uses dynamic interactions to govern particle crystallization, as these non-permanent bonds prevent the formation of kinetically trapped, disordered aggregates. However, while the use of reversible bonding is critical in the formation of highly ordered particle arrangements, dynamic interactions also inherently make the structures more prone to disassembly or disruption when subjected to different environmental stimuli. Thus, there is typically a trade-off between the ability to initially form an ordered colloidal material and the ability of that material to retain its order under different conditions. Here, we present a method for embedding colloidal nanoparticle superlattices into a polymer gel matrix. This encapsulation strategy physically prevents the nanoparticles from dissociating upon heating, drying, or the introduction of chemicals that would normally disrupt the lattice. However, the use of a gel as the embedding medium still permits further modification of the colloidal nanoparticle lattice by introducing stimuli that deform the gel network (as this deformation in turn alters the nanoparticle lattice structure in a predictable manner). Moreover, encapsulation of the lattice within a gel permits further stabilization into fully solid materials by removing the solvent from the gel or by replacing the solvent with a liquid monomer that can be photopolymerized. This embedding method therefore makes it possible to incorporate ordered colloidal arrays into a polymer matrix as either dynamic or static structures, expanding their potential for use in responsive materials.},

This selection allowed the comparison between state-of-the-art calculations and experiment. Several computational aspects are tackled to define conditions where the results are converged with respect to the range of lattice summations, to the number of k-points in the first Brillouin zone, to the order of the multipole expansions for evaluating the long-range part of the electrostatic interactions, as well as to the atomic basis set size. A valence triple zeta basis set supplemented with polarization functions has been selected. Then, χ (2) calculations have been performed using a range of exchange-correlation functionals (XCFs). Results show the large impact of the amount of Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange on the amplitude but also on the sign on the χ (2) tensor components. To a given extent, these amplitude effects are consistent with results on molecules, but the sign reversal effects and the non-monotonic behavior of the χ (2) tensor components as a function of the amount of HF exchange are scarcely found for molecules. Then, using the recommended range-separated hybrid XCFs, the CPKS scheme leads to good agreement with experimental data for potassium dihydrogenophosphate, urea, and χ ZXX ( 2 ) of LiNbO 3 . The agreement is more questionable for χ ZZZ ( 2 ) of LiNbO 3 whereas it remains poor for ammonium dihydrogenophosphate and 2-methyl-4-nitroaniline, with large underestimations by about a factor of 3, opening a path to further fine-tuning of the ranges of inclusion of HF exchange.},

The experimental treatment of carbon phases was carried out at room temperature for 1 hour. The chemical and phase composition were studied by x-ray photoelectron (XP) and Raman spectroscopies, while the morphology and structure were determined by powder x-ray diffraction, as well as transmission electron microscopy techniques. To shed light on the most probable explanation of the observed results, we performed simulations and calculations of the binding energies of acetone, toluene, and phenol with model carbon phases: a perfect graphene sheet and a defective graphene sheet containing various structural defects (vacancies as well as zigzag and armchair edges). Simulations show that all non-covalent and most covalent coupling reactions are exothermic, with acetone coupling having the higher calorimetric effect. Based on the results of the simulations and the XP spectroscopy measurements, the probable reactions taking place during the respective treatments are outlined. The conducted studies (both theoretical and experimental) show that the treatment of graphite powders and CB with acetone, toluene, or phenol can be used as a preliminary stage of their modification and/or functionalization, including their conversion into graphene-like (defective graphene, reduced graphene oxide, and/or graphene oxide) phases. For example, the treatment of SPHERON 5000 with acetone significantly facilitates their subsequent modification with laser radiation to graphene-like phases.},

Small polaron hopping models (localized) are generally used to describe materials with small charge carrier mobilities, while periodic band models (delocalized) are used to describe materials with high charge carrier mobilities. Here, we prove the advantage of applying the constant relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to efficiently predict the anisotropic hole mobilities of several unsubstituted (anthracene, tetracene, pentacene, and hexacene) and substituted (2,6-diphenylanthracene, rubrene, and TIPS-pentacene) high-mobility n -acene single crystals. Several density functionals are used to optimize the crystals, and the composite density functional PBEsol0-3c/sol-def2-mSVP predicts the most experimentally similar geometries, adequate indirect bandgaps, and the theoretically consistent n-acene charge transport mobility trend. Similarities between BTE and Marcus mobilities are presented for each crystal. BTE and Marcus charge carrier mobilities computed at the same geometry result in similar mobility trends, differing mostly in materials with more substitutions or structurally complex substituents. By using a reduced number of calculations, BTE is able to predict anisotropic carrier mobilities efficiently and effectively for a range of high-mobility organic semiconductors.},

The first aim of this research is to assemble a comprehensive set of data on solubilities and dissolution kinetics that may be used in the simulation of battery cycling. The investigation also offers important insights to address key bottlenecks in the development and commercialization of metal–sulfur batteries, including the incomplete dissolution of sulfur in discharge and insoluble low-order sulfides in charge, the probability of shuttling of soluble polysulfides, and the pausing of the redox reactions in precipitated low order sulfides depending on their degree of solid state. The tested materials include sulfur, lithium sulfides Li 2 S x , x = 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8, and sodium sulfides Na 2 S x , x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, dissolved in two alternative electrolyte solvents: DOL:DME 1:1 v/v and TEGDME. The determined properties of the solute dissolution in the solvent include saturation concentration, mass transfer coefficient, and diffusion coefficient of the solvent in the solid solute. In general, the DOL:DME system offers high solubility in Li–S batteries and TEGDME offers the highest solubility in Na–S batteries. Low solubility sulfides are Li 2 S 2 and Li 2 S for the Li–S batteries, and Na 2 S 3 , Na 2 S 2 , and Na 2 S for the Na–S batteries. However, it is noted that Na 2 S 3 dissolves fast in TEGDME and also TEGDME diffuses fast into Na 2 S 3 , offering the possibility of a swollen Na 2 S 3 structure in which Na + ions might diffuse and continue the redox reactions in a semisolid state.},

However, little is known about nanofluidics in moderately concentrated solutions, which are critically important for industrial applications and living systems. Here, we show that nanoconfinement triggers general biphasic concentration patterns in a myriad of ion transport properties by using two contrasting systems: a biological ion channel and a much larger synthetic nanopore. Our findings show a low-concentration regime ruled by classical Debye screening and another one where ion–ion correlations and enhanced ion–surface interactions contribute differently to each electrophysiological property. Thus, different quantities (e.g., conductance vs noise) measured under the same conditions may appear contradictory because they belong to different concentration regimes. In addition, non-linear effects that are barely visible in bulk conductivity only in extremely concentrated solutions become apparent in nanochannels around physiological conditions.},

  abstract = {A method for directly calculating the temperature derivative of two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectra from simulations at a single temperature is presented. The approach is demonstrated by application to the OD stretching spectrum of isotopically dilute aqueous (HOD in H 2 O) solutions of urea as a function of concentration. Urea is an important osmolyte because of its ability to denature proteins, which has motivated significant interest in its effect on the structure and dynamics of water. The present results show that the temperature dependence of both the linear IR and 2D-IR spectra, which report on the underlying energetic driving forces, is more sensitive to urea concentration than the spectra themselves. Additional physical insight is provided by calculation of the contributions to the temperature derivative from different interactions, e.g., water–water, water–urea, and urea–urea, present in the system. Finally, it is demonstrated how 2D-IR spectra at other temperatures can be obtained from only room temperature simulations.},

  abstract = {The interplay between short-range attractions and long-range repulsions (SALR) characterizes the so-called liquids with competing interactions, which are known to exhibit a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases. The theoretical description of the phenomenology associated with glassy or gel states in these systems has to take into account both the presence of thermodynamic instabilities (such as those defining the spinodal line and the so called λ line) and the limited capability to describe genuine non-equilibrium processes from first principles. Here, we report the first application of the non-equilibrium self-consistent generalized Langevin equation theory to the description of the dynamical arrest processes that occur in SALR systems after being instantaneously quenched into a state point in the regions of thermodynamic instability. The physical scenario predicted by this theory reveals an amazing interplay between the thermodynamically driven instabilities, favoring equilibrium macro- and micro-phase separation, and the kinetic arrest mechanisms, favoring non-equilibrium amorphous solidification of the liquid into an unexpected variety of glass and gel states.},

Here, we report on the chemistry of ethylene and water mixtures in both pressure (0–15 GPa) and temperature (300–370 K) ranges relevant to celestial bodies conditions. The behavior of the binary mixture has been tracked, starting from the ethylene clathrate hydrate and following its evolution through two different crystalline phases up to 2.10 GPa, where it decomposes into a solid mixture of water ice and crystalline ethylene. The pressure and temperature evolution of this mixture has been studied up to the complete transformation of ethylene into polyethylene and compared with that of the pure hydrocarbon, reporting here for the first time its spectroscopic features upon compression. The spectroscopic analysis of the recovered polymers from the ice mixtures provided hints about the reactivity of the monomer under the environmental stress exerted by the water network. The results of this study are expected to be significant in a variety of fields ranging from astrochemistry to material science and also to fundamental chemistry, particularly regarding the study and modelization of the behavior of complex mixtures.},

  abstract = {The high density of aluminum nanocrystals (&gt;10 21 m −3 ) that develop during the primary crystallization in Al-based metallic glasses indicates a high nucleation rate (∼10 18 m −3 s −1 ). Several studies have been advanced to account for the primary crystallization behavior, but none have been developed to completely describe the reaction kinetics. Recently, structural analysis by fluctuation electron microscopy has demonstrated the presence of the Al-like medium range order (MRO) regions as a spatial heterogeneity in as-spun Al 88 Y 7 Fe 5 metallic glass that is representative for the class of Al-based amorphous alloys that develop Al nanocrystals during primary crystallization. From the structural characterization, an MRO seeded nucleation configuration is established, whereby the Al nanocrystals are catalyzed by the MRO core to decrease the nucleation barrier. The MRO seeded nucleation model and the kinetic data from the delay time ( τ ) measurement provide a full accounting of the evolution of the Al nanocrystal density (N v ) during the primary crystallization under isothermal annealing treatments. Moreover, the calculated values of the steady state nucleation rates ( J ss ) predicted by the nucleation model agree with the experimental results. Moreover, the model satisfies constraints on the structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic parameters, such as the critical nucleus size, the interface energy, and the volume-free energy driving force that are essential for a fully self-consistent nucleation kinetics analysis. The nucleation kinetics model can be applied more broadly to materials that are characterized by the presence of spatial heterogeneities.},

  abstract = {With an ever-increasing interest in water properties, many intermolecular force fields have been proposed to describe the behavior of water. Unfortunately, good models for liquid water usually cannot provide simultaneously an accurate melting point for ice. For this reason, the TIP4P/Ice model was developed for targeting the melting point and has become the preferred choice for simulating ice at coexistence. Unfortunately, available data for its dynamic properties in the liquid state are scarce. Therefore, we demonstrate a series of simulations aimed at the calculation of transport coefficients for the TIP4P/Ice model over a large range of thermodynamic conditions, ranging from T = 245 K to T = 350 K, for the temperature, and from p = 0 to p = 500 MPa, for the pressure. We have found that the self-diffusion (shear viscosity) exhibits smaller (increased) values than TIP4P/2005 and experiments. However, rescaling the temperature with respect to the triple point temperature, as in a corresponding states plot, we find that TIP4P/Ice compares very well with TIP4P/2005 and experiment. Such observations allow us to infer that despite the different original purposes of these two models examined here, one can benefit from a vast number of reports regarding the behavior of transport coefficients for the TIP4P/2005 model and utilize them following the routine described in this paper.},

In this paper, we consider the calculation of the free energies of such phases, exploring hybrid reference systems consisting of a combination of an Einstein solid for the oxygen ions occupying a crystal lattice and a Uhlenbeck-Ford potential for the protonic fluid that avoids irregularities associated with possible particle overlaps. Applying this approach to a recent neural-network potential-energy landscape for SI water ice, we compute Gibbs free energies as a function of temperature for the SI fcc and liquid phases to determine the melting temperature T m at 340 GPa. The results are consistent with previous estimates and indicate that the entropy difference between both phases is comparatively small, in particular due to the large amplitude of vibration of the oxygen ions in the fcc phase at the melting temperature.},

  abstract = {Until quite recently, in almost all papers on crystal nucleation in glass-forming substances, it was assumed that nucleation proceeds in a completely relaxed supercooled liquid and, hence, at constant values of the critical parameters determining the nucleation rate for any given set of temperature, pressure, and composition. Here, we analyze the validity of this hypothesis for a model system by studying nucleation in a lithium silicate glass treated for very long times (up to 250 days) in deeply supercooled states, reaching 60 K below the laboratory glass transition temperature, T g . At all temperatures in the considered range, T &lt; T g , we observed an enormous difference between the experimental number of nucleated crystals, N ( t ), and its theoretically expected value computed by assuming the metastable state of the relaxing glass has been reached. Analyzing the origin of this discrepancy, we confirmed that the key parameters determining the nucleation rates change with time as a result of the glass relaxation process. Finally, we demonstrate that, for temperatures below 683 K, this particular glass almost fully crystallizes prior to reaching the ultimate steady-state nucleation regime (e.g., at 663 K, it would take 176 years for the glass to reach 99\% crystallization, while 2600 years would be needed for complete relaxation). This comprehensive study proves that structural relaxation strongly affects crystal nucleation in deeply supercooled states at temperatures well below T g ; hence, this phenomenon has to be accounted for in any crystal nucleation model.},

  abstract = {This work constructs a rovibrational state-to-state model for the O 2 + O 2 system leveraging high-fidelity potential energy surfaces and quasi-classical trajectory calculations. The model is used to investigate internal energy transfer and nonequilibrium reactive processes in a dissociating environment using a master equation approach, whereby the kinetics of each internal rovibrational state is explicitly computed. To cope with the exponentially large number of elementary processes that characterize reactive bimolecular collisions, the internal states of the collision partner are assumed to follow a Boltzmann distribution at a prescribed internal temperature. This procedure makes the problem tractable, reducing the computational cost to a comparable scale with the O 2 + O system. The constructed rovibrational-specific kinetic database covers the temperature range of 7500–20 000 K. The reaction rate coefficients included in the database are parameterized in the function of kinetic and internal temperatures. Analysis of the energy transfer and dissociation process in isochoric and isothermal conditions reveals that significant departure from the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution occurs during the energy transfer and dissociation phase. Comparing the population distribution of the O 2 molecules against the O 2 + O case demonstrates a more significant extent of nonequilibrium characterized by a more diffuse distribution whereby the vibrational strands are more clearly identifiable. This is partly due to less efficient mixing of the rovibrational states, which results in more diffuse rovibrational distributions in the quasi-steady-state distribution of O 2 + O 2 . A master equation analysis for the combined O 2 + O and O 2 + O 2 system reveals that the O 2 + O 2 system governs the early stage of energy transfer, whereas the O 2 + O system takes control of the dissociation dynamics. The findings of the present work will provide a strong physical foundation that can be exploited to construct an improved reduced-order model for oxygen chemistry.},

  abstract = {The selection of cytosine, guanine, thymine, and adenine as components of the information biopolymers was a complex process influenced by several factors. Among them, the intermolecular interactions may have played a determinant role. Thus, a deep understanding of the intermolecular interactions between nucleobases and other prebiotic molecules may help understand the first instants of chemical evolution. Following this hypothesis, we present here a combined spectroscopic and computational study of theobromine 2 -adenine and thebromine-adenine 2 trimers. While adenine is a nucleobase, theobromine was probably part of the prebiotic chemistry. The trimers were formed in jets and probed by a combination of UV and IR spectroscopic techniques. The spectra were interpreted in light of the predictions obtained using density-functional methods. The results suggest the existence of a subtle balance between formation of hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions. Thus, while theobromine 2 -adenine tends to form complex in stacked structures, theobromine-adenine 2 prefers formation of planar structures, maximizing the interaction by hydrogen bonds. The small energy difference between planar and stacked structures highlights the importance of accurately modeling the dispersion forces in the functionals to produce reliable predictions.},

In this work, we analyze the quality of electronic structure approximations for spin-crossover energies of iron complexes with four different ligands by comparing energies from self-consistent and post-self-consistent calculations for methods based on the random phase approximation and the Fermi–Löwdin self-interaction correction. Considering that Hartree–Fock densities were found by Song et al. , J. Chem. Theory Comput. 14 , 2304 (2018), to eliminate the density error to a large extent, and that the Hartree–Fock method and the Perdew–Zunger-type self-interaction correction share some physics, we compare the densities obtained with these methods to learn their resemblance. We find that evaluating non-empirical exchange-correlation energy functionals on the corresponding self-interaction-corrected densities can mitigate the strong density errors and improves the accuracy of the adiabatic energy differences between HS and LS states.},

  abstract = {An alternative approach to density functional theory based on self-consistent field theory for ring polymers is applied to neutral atoms hydrogen to neon in their ground-states. The spontaneous emergence of an atomic shell structure and spherical symmetry-breaking of the total electron density are predicted by the model using the ideas of polymer excluded-volume between pairs of electrons to enforce the Pauli-exclusion principle and an exact electron self-interaction correction. The Pauli potential is approximated by neglecting inter-atomic correlations along with other types of correlations, and comparisons to Hartree–Fock theory are made, which also ignores correlations. The model shows excellent agreement with Hartree–Fock theory to within the standards of orbital-free density functional theory for the atomic binding energies and density profiles of the first six elements, providing exact matches for the elements hydrogen and helium. The predicted shell structure starts to deviate significantly past the element neon, and spherical symmetry-breaking is first predicted to occur at carbon instead of boron. The self-consistent field theory energy functional that describes the model is decomposed into thermodynamic components to trace the origin of spherical symmetry-breaking. It is found to arise from the electron density approaching closer to the nucleus in non-spherical distributions, which lowers the energy despite resulting in frustration between the quantum kinetic energy, electron–electron interaction, and the Pauli exclusion interaction. The symmetry-breaking effect is found to have a minimal impact on the binding energies, which suggests that the spherical-averaging approximation used in previous work is physically reasonable when investigating atomic systems. The pair density contour plots display behavior similar to polymer macro-phase separation, where individual electron pairs occupy single lobe structures that together form a dumbbell shape analogous to the 2p orbital shape. It is further shown that the predicted densities satisfy known constraints and produce the same total electronic density profile that is predicted by other formulations of quantum mechanics.},

  abstract = {The aggregation morphologies of conjugated polymers in solutions and solid films are important for their optoelectronic applications. Due to the amorphous state of the polymers, it remains a great challenge to determine their conformations in either liquids or solids. Herein, a ps/fs synchronized 2D IR technique is applied to investigate the molecular conformations of a high-mobility n-type low-bandgap copolymer, N2200, dissolved in CHCl 3 and CCl 4 , and in solid films cast from both solutions by the vibrational cross-angle method. In CCl 4 , the polymer forms more aggregates and folds more and the backbone dihedral angle of C–C(NDI)/C–S(Thiophene) of its average conformation is about 10° more distorted than that in CHCl 3 and the most stable conformation for a free molecule. Anti-intuitively, the solid films cast from both solutions have the same molecular conformation, and the conformation is similar to that of the polar CHCl 3 rather than the conformation of the less polar CCl 4 . The results imply that the interaction between the polymer backbones is probably stronger than its interaction with CCl 4 , which can naturally guide the rearrangement of polymer chains during the evaporation of solvent molecules. This work also implies that the balance and competition between the polymer/polymer interaction and the polymer/solvent interaction seem to be the dominant factors responsible for what morphology can form in a solid film cast from solution. It is not always true that different molecular conformations must exist in solid films grown from different solutions with different polarity or different extents of aggregates with different conformations.},

Phys. 147 , 164116 (2017)], we present a combined theoretical and experimental study of two-photon-induced vibronic transitions in polyatomic molecules that are probed in the VIbrationally Promoted Electronic Resonance experiment using two-photon excitation (2P-VIPER). In order to compute vibronic spectra, we employ time-independent and time-dependent methods based on the evaluation of Franck–Condon overlap integrals and Fourier transformations of time-domain correlation functions, respectively. The time-independent approach uses a generalized version of the FCclasses method, while the time-dependent approach relies on the analytical evaluation of Gaussian moments within the harmonic approximation, including Duschinsky rotation effects. For the Coumarin 6 dye, two-dimensional 2P-VIPER experiments involving excitation to the lowest-lying singlet excited state ( S 1 ) are presented and compared with corresponding one-photon VIPER spectra. In both cases, coumarin ring modes and a CO stretch mode show VIPER activity, albeit with different relative intensities. Selective pre-excitation of these modes leads to a pronounced redshift of the low-frequency edge of the electronic absorption spectrum, which is a prerequisite for the VIPER experiment. Theoretical analysis underscores the role of interference between Franck–Condon and Herzberg–Teller effects in the two-photon experiment, which is at the root of the observed intensity distribution.},

  abstract = {Recently proposed local self-interaction correction (LSIC) method [Zope et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 214108 (2019)] is a one-electron self-interaction-correction (SIC) method that uses an iso-orbital indicator to apply the SIC at each point in space by scaling the exchange–correlation and Coulomb energy densities. The LSIC method is exact for the one-electron densities, also recovers the uniform electron gas limit of the uncorrected density functional approximation, and reduces to the well-known Perdew–Zunger SIC (PZSIC) method as a special case. This article presents the self-consistent implementation of the LSIC method using the ratio of Weizsäcker and Kohn–Sham kinetic energy densities as an iso-orbital indicator. The atomic forces as well as the forces on the Fermi-Löwdin orbitals are also implemented for the LSIC energy functional. Results show that LSIC with the simplest local spin density functional predicts atomization energies of the AE6 dataset better than some of the most widely used generalized-gradient-approximation (GGA) functional [e.g., Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)] and barrier heights of the BH6 database better than some of the most widely used hybrid functionals (e.g., PBE0 and B3LYP). The LSIC method [a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.008 Å] predicts bond lengths of a small set of molecules better than the PZSIC-LSDA (MAE 0.042 Å) and LSDA (0.011 Å). This work shows that accurate results can be obtained from the simplest density functional by removing the self-interaction-errors using an appropriately designed SIC method.},

  abstract = {Trajectory-based methods that propagate classical nuclei on multiple quantum electronic states are often used to simulate nonadiabatic processes in the condensed phase. A long-standing problem of these methods is their lack of detailed balance, meaning that they do not conserve the equilibrium distribution. In this article, we investigate ideas for restoring detailed balance in mixed quantum–classical systems by tailoring the previously proposed spin-mapping approach to thermal equilibrium. We find that adapting the spin magnitude can recover the correct long-time populations but is insufficient to conserve the full equilibrium distribution. The latter can however be achieved by a more flexible mapping of the spin onto an ellipsoid, which is constructed to fulfill detailed balance for arbitrary potentials. This ellipsoid approach solves the problem of negative populations that has plagued previous mapping approaches and can therefore be applied also to strongly asymmetric and anharmonic systems. Because it conserves the thermal distribution, the method can also exploit efficient sampling schemes used in standard molecular dynamics, which drastically reduces the number of trajectories needed for convergence. The dynamics does however still have mean-field character, as is observed most clearly by evaluating reaction rates in the golden-rule limit. This implies that although the ellipsoid mapping provides a rigorous framework, further work is required to find an accurate classical-trajectory approximation that captures more properties of the true quantum dynamics.},

  abstract = {The core ionization energies of the second-period and third-period elements are studied by ΔSCF and Slater’s transition state (STS) theory by using Hartree–Fock (HF) and Kohn–Sham (KS) approximations. Electron correlation increases the estimated core ionization energies, while the self-interaction error (SIE) decreases them, especially for the third-period elements and is a more significant factor. As a result, while HF lacks electron correlation, it is free of SIE and reasonably predicts the core ionization energies. The core ionization energies calculated by HF STS are very close to those calculated by HF ΔSCF, showing that STS reasonably describes the relaxation of the core hole. The core ionization energies calculated by KS are particularly sensitive to the SIE of the functional used, with functionals having less SIE yielding more accurate ΔSCF core ionization energies. Consequently, BH&amp;HLYP gives better results than B3LYP and LC-BOP since BH&amp;HLYP is the hybrid functional with high proportion of the exact HF exchange. Although the core ionization energies are underestimated by ΔSCF due to SIE, STS gives larger core ionization energies than ΔSCF due to a concave behavior of the error curves of STS, which is also related to SIE. The mean absolute deviations of STS relative to ΔSCF, and relative to the experiment, are almost constant regardless of the nuclei among the element in the second period, and likewise among those in the third period. The systematic nature suggests that shifting the STS core ionization energies may be useful. We propose the shifted STS (1) for reproducing ΔSCF values, and the shifted STS (2) to reproduce the observed ones for KS calculations. Both schemes work quite well. The calculated results of KS ΔSCF and STS vary depending on the functional. However, the variation of each species’ shifted STS (2) is very small, and all shifted STS (2) values are close to the observed ones. As the shifted STS require only one SCF calculation, they are simple and practical for predicting the core ionization energies.},

Based largely on equilibrium structures, the parameterized DFTB3/CPE models were shown to exhibit improvements in molecular polarizabilities and intermolecular interactions. With more extensive analyses, however, we observe here that the available DFTB3/CPE models have two critical limitations: (1) they lead to sharply varying potential energy surfaces, thus causing numerical instability in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and (2) they lead to spurious interactions at short distances for some dimer complexes. These shortcomings are attributed to the employed screening functions and the overfitting of CPE parameters. In this work, we introduce a new strategy to simplify the parameterization procedure and significantly reduce free parameters down to four global (i.e., independent of element type) ones. With this strategy, two new models, DFTB3/CPE(r) and DFTB3/CPE(r † ) are parameterized. The new models lead to smooth potential energy surfaces, stable MD simulations, and alleviate the spurious interactions at short distances, thus representing consistent improvements for both neutral and ionic hydrogen bonds.},

Their complexity and rigidity make them a good testbed for the development of theoretical strategies that can complement the difficulties present in the experimental spectrum fitting. Classical and ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories are generated and employed as a source of structural information to compute average spectra for each MPc species. The original ZnPc force field employed in the classical molecular dynamics simulations has been modified in order to improve the agreement with the experimental EXAFS spectrum, and the modification strategy–based on MP2 optimized structures–being extended to the rest of MPcs. Both types of trajectories, classical and ab initio , provide very similar results, showing in all cases the main features present in the experimental spectra despite the different simulation timescales employed. Spectroscopical information has been analyzed on the basis of shells and legs contributions, making possible the comparison with the experimental fitting approaches. According to the simulations results, the simple relationships employed in the fitting process to define the dependence of the Debye Waller factors associated with multiple scattering paths with those of single scattering paths are reasonable. However, a lack of multiple backscattering paths contributions is found due to the intrinsic rigidity of the chemical motif (macrocycle). Its consequences in the Debye Waller factors of the fitted contributions are discussed.},

Auger electron spectroscopy exploits the Auger–Meitner effect, and although it is established as an analytic technique, the theoretical modeling of molecular Auger spectra from first principles remains challenging. Here, we use coupled-cluster theory and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory combined with two approaches to describe the decaying nature of core-ionized states: (i) Feshbach–Fano resonance theory and (ii) the method of complex basis functions. The spectra computed with these two approaches are in excellent agreement with each other and also agree well with experimental Auger spectra of benzene. The Auger spectrum of benzene features two well-resolved peaks at Auger electron energies above 260 eV, which correspond to final states with two electrons removed from the 1 e 1 g and 3 e 2 g highest occupied molecular orbitals. At lower Auger electron energies, the spectrum is less well resolved, and the peaks comprise multiple final states of the benzene dication. In line with theoretical considerations, singlet decay channels contribute more to the total Auger intensity than the corresponding triplet decay channels.},

  abstract = {Utilizing localized orbitals, local correlation theory can reduce the unphysically high system-size scaling of post-Hartree–Fock (post-HF) methods to linear scaling in insulating molecules. The sparsity of the four-index electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor is central to achieving this reduction. For second-order Møller–Plesset theory (MP2), one of the simplest post-HF methods, only the ( ia | jb ) ERIs are needed, coupling occupied orbitals i , j and virtuals a , b . In this paper, we compare the numerical sparsity (called the “ragged list”) and two other approaches revealing the low-rank sparsity of the ERI. The ragged list requires only one set of (localized) virtual orbitals, and we find that the orthogonal valence virtual-hard virtual set of virtuals originally proposed by Subotnik et al. gives the sparsest ERI tensor. To further compress the ERI tensor, the pair natural orbital (PNO) type representation uses different sets of virtual orbitals for different occupied orbital pairs, while the occupied-specific virtual (OSV) approach uses different virtuals for each occupied orbital. Our results indicate that while the low-rank PNO representation achieves significant rank reduction, it also requires more memory than the ragged list. The OSV approach requires similar memory to that of the ragged list, but it involves greater algorithmic complexity. An approximation (called the “fixed sparsity pattern”) for solving the local MP2 equations using the numerically sparse ERI tensor is proposed and tested to be sufficiently accurate and to have highly controllable error. A low-scaling local MP2 algorithm based on the ragged list and the fixed sparsity pattern is therefore promising.},

By only using the training samples of the instantaneous force under the thermal equilibrium state, the constructed CG models can accurately reproduce both the probability density function of the void formation in bulk and the spectrum of the capillary wave across the fluid interface. More importantly, the CG models accurately predict the volume-to-area scaling transition for the apolar solvation energy, illustrating the effectiveness to probe the meso-scale collective behaviors encoded with molecular-level fidelity.},

  abstract = {The excitation energy transfer (EET) process for photosynthetic antenna complexes consisting of subunits, each comprised of multiple chromophores, remains challenging to describe. The multichromophoric Förster resonance energy transfer theory is a popular method to describe the EET process in such systems. This paper presents a new time-domain method for calculating energy transfer based on the combination of multichromophoric Förster resonance energy transfer theory and the Numerical Integration of the Schrödinger Equation method. After validating the method on simple model systems, we apply it to the Light-Harvesting antenna 2 (LH2) complex, a light harvesting antenna found in purple bacteria. We use a simple model combining the overdamped Brownian oscillators to describe the dynamic disorder originating from the environmental fluctuations and the transition charge from the electrostatic potential coupling model to determine the interactions between chromophores. We demonstrate that with this model, both the calculated spectra and the EET rates between the two rings within the LH2 complex agree well with experimental results. We further find that the transfer between the strongly coupled rings of neighboring LH2 complexes can also be well described with our method. We conclude that our new method accurately describes the EET rate for biologically relevant multichromophoric systems, which are similar to the LH2 complex. Computationally, the new method is very tractable, especially for slow processes. We foresee that the method can be applied to efficiently calculate transfer in artificial systems as well and may pave the way for calculating multidimensional spectra of extensive multichromophoric systems in the future.},

  abstract = {Kohn–Sham (KS) inversion, in which the effective KS mean-field potential is found for a given density, provides insights into the nature of exact density functional theory (DFT) that can be exploited for the development of density functional approximations. Unfortunately, despite significant and sustained progress in both theory and software libraries, KS inversion remains rather difficult in practice, especially in finite basis sets. The present work presents a KS inversion method, dubbed the “Lieb-response” approach, that naturally works with existing Fock-matrix DFT infrastructure in finite basis sets, is numerically efficient, and directly provides meaningful matrix and energy quantities for pure-state and ensemble systems.

  abstract = {Independent electron surface hopping (IESH) is a computational algorithm for simulating the mixed quantum–classical molecular dynamics of adsorbate atoms and molecules interacting with metal surfaces. It is capable of modeling the nonadiabatic effects of electron–hole pair excitations on molecular dynamics. Here, we present a transparent, reliable, and efficient implementation of IESH, demonstrating its ability to predict scattering and desorption probabilities across a variety of systems, ranging from model Hamiltonians to full dimensional atomistic systems. We further show how the algorithm can be modified to account for the application of an external bias potential, comparing its accuracy to results obtained using the hierarchical quantum master equation. Our results show that IESH is a practical method for modeling coupled electron-nuclear dynamics at metal surfaces, especially for highly energetic scattering events.},

  abstract = {Over the last century, quantum theories have revolutionized our understanding of material properties. One of the most striking quantum phenomena occurring in heterogeneous media is the quantum tunneling effect, where carriers can tunnel through potential barriers even if the barrier height exceeds the carrier energy. Interestingly, the tunneling process can be accompanied by the absorption or emission of light. In most tunneling junctions made of noble metal electrodes, these optical phenomena are governed by plasmonic modes, i.e., light-driven collective oscillations of surface electrons. In the emission process, plasmon excitation via inelastic tunneling electrons can improve the efficiency of photon generation, resulting in bright nanoscale optical sources. On the other hand, the incident light can affect the tunneling behavior of plasmonic junctions as well, leading to phenomena such as optical rectification and induced photocurrent. Thus, plasmonic tunneling junctions provide a rich platform for investigating light–matter interactions, paving the way for various applications, including nanoscale light sources, sensors, and chemical reactors. In this paper, we will introduce recent research progress and promising applications based on plasmonic tunneling junctions.},

The model has been shown to reproduce the network properties of a wide range of systems, from low-dimensional inorganic glasses to colloidal nanoparticles deposited on a surface. Available extensive experimental microscopy results are analyzed and combined to highlight the behavior of two key metrics, the fraction of hexagonal rings ( p 6 ) and the coefficient of variation of the area. Their behavior is analyzed as a function of patient age, the onset of diabetes, and contact lens wearing status. Wearing contact lenses for ∼10 years is shown to change the endothelium structure by the equivalent of ∼30 years contact lens-free. Model network configurations are obtained using a Monte Carlo bond-switching algorithm, with the resulting topologies controlled by two potential model parameters (the bond and angular force constants) and the Monte Carlo temperature. The effect of systematically varying these parameters is investigated. In addition, the effect of constraining the ring size distribution is investigated. The networks generated with relatively weak bond force constants are shown to correlate best with the experimental information. The importance of extracting the full ring size distribution (rather than simply the fraction of hexagons) is discussed.},

  abstract = {Magnetic gels are composite materials consisting of a polymer matrix and embedded magnetic particles. Those are mechanically coupled to each other, giving rise to the magnetostrictive effects as well as to a controllable overall elasticity responsive to external magnetic fields. Due to their inherent composite and thereby multiscale nature, a theoretical framework bridging different levels of description is indispensable for understanding the magnetomechanical properties of magnetic gels. In this study, we extend a recently developed density functional approach from two spatial dimensions to more realistic three-dimensional systems. Along these lines, we connect a mesoscopic characterization resolving the discrete structure of the magnetic particles to macroscopic continuum parameters of magnetic gels. In particular, we incorporate the long-range nature of the magnetic dipole–dipole interaction and consider the approximate incompressibility of the embedding media and relative rotations with respect to an external magnetic field breaking rotational symmetry. We then probe the shape of the model system in its reference state, confirming the dependence of magnetostrictive effects on the configuration of the magnetic particles and on the shape of the considered sample. Moreover, calculating the elastic and rotational coefficients on the basis of our mesoscopic approach, we examine how the macroscopic types of behavior are related to the mesoscopic properties. Implications for real systems of random particle configurations are also discussed.},

The interparticle forces are derived from the Stillinger–Weber potential, where the three-body term is tuned to enable network formation and gelation in equilibrium. When subjected to the shear force field, the system develops remarkable modulations in the one-body density profile. Depending on the shear magnitude, particles accumulate either in quiescent regions or in the vicinity of maximum net flow, and we deduce this strong non-equilibrium response to be characteristic of the gel state. Studying the components of the internal force parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction reveals that the emerging flow and structure of the stationary state are driven by significant viscous and structural superadiabatic forces. Thereby, the magnitude and nature of the observed non-equilibrium phenomena differ from the corresponding behavior of simple fluids. We demonstrate that a simple power functional theory reproduces accurately the viscous force profile, giving a rationale of the complex dynamical behavior of the system.},

We investigate the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of a colloidal dispersion at the critical gel state using large amplitude oscillatory shear rheology. The colloidal gel at the critical point is subjected to oscillatory shear flow with increasing strain amplitude at different frequencies. We observe that the first harmonic of the elastic and viscous moduli exhibits a monotonic decrease as the material undergoes a linear to nonlinear transition. We analyze the stress waveform across this transition and obtain the nonlinear moduli and viscosity as a function of frequency and strain amplitude. The analysis of the nonlinear moduli and viscosities suggests intracycle strain stiffening and intracycle shear thinning in the colloidal dispersion. Based on the insights obtained from the nonlinear analysis, we propose a potential scenario of the microstructural changes occurring in the nonlinear region. We also develop an integral model using the time-strain separable Kaye–Bernstein–Kearsley–Zapas constitutive equation with a power-law relaxation modulus and damping function obtained from experiments. The proposed model with a slight adjustment of the damping function inferred using a spectral method, compares well with experimental data at all frequencies.},

The behavior of such a system generally cannot be solved analytically, necessitating the use of numerical methods. However, current numerical methods omit important details of the microscopic structure and dynamics of the fluid, which can modulate the magnitudes and directions of viscoelastic restoring forces. To address this issue, we develop a simulation platform for modeling viscoelastic media with tensorial elasticity. We build on the lattice Boltzmann algorithm and incorporate viscoelastic forces, elastic immersed objects, a microscopic orientation field, and coupling between viscoelasticity and the orientation field. We demonstrate our method by characterizing how the viscoelastic restoring force on a driven immersed object depends on various key parameters as well as the tensorial character of the elastic response. We find that the restoring force depends non-monotonically on the rate of diffusion of the stress and the size of the object. We further show how the restoring force depends on the relative orientation of the microscopic structure and the pulling direction. These results imply that accounting for previously neglected physical features, such as stress diffusion and the microscopic orientation field, can improve the realism of viscoelastic simulations. We discuss possible applications and extensions to the method.},

How to capture such a “backbone” is crucial to the understanding of various anomalous properties or behaviors in those materials, which remains a central challenge presently in physics, engineering, or material science. Here, we use a novel graph neural network to predict the contact force network in two-dimensional granular materials under uniaxial compression. With the edge classification model in the framework of the deep graph library, we show that the inter-particle contact forces can be accurately estimated purely from the knowledge of the static microstructures, which can be acquired from a discrete element method or directly visualized from experimental methods. By testing the granular packings with different structural disorders and pressure, we further demonstrate the robustness of the optimized graph neural network to changes in various model parameters. Our research tries to provide a new way of extracting the information about the inter-particle forces, which substantially improves the efficiency and reduces the costs compared to the traditional experiments.},

Microrheology has been applied to Laponite-based glasses and gels, but few studies evaluate the influence of probe particle size. In this work, we report the dynamics and microrheology of Laponite-polymer dispersions during aging using passive microrheology with three different probe particle sizes. At early aging times, the neat Laponite dispersion forms an arrested state; the nature of this state (e.g., a repulsive glass or gel) has remained the subject of debate. The addition of polymer retards gelation and melts the arrested state. While this melting has been observed at the macroscale and has been attributed to a re-entrant transition of a repulsive glass to a liquid state, to our knowledge, it has not been observed at the microscale. The delay of the gelation time needed to form an arrested state was found to depend on the polymer concentration and could vary from ∼24 h for neat Laponite to seven days for some Laponite-polymer samples. Significant effects of probe particle sizes are observed from the mean-squared displacement (MSD) curves as small and intermediate probe particles show diffusive motion, while the motion of large particles is restricted. By examining the factor of ⟨Δ r 2 (τ)⟩ a , structural heterogeneity can be confirmed through the strong size-dependence displayed. Different MSD trends of probe particles are obtained at longer aging times, but no significant changes occur after 30 days of aging. Our microrheology results also reveal significant effects of probe particle size.},

In the first step, we employ Monte Carlo simulations of a lattice model to equilibrate the large-scale chain structure above the tube scale while ensuring a spatially homogeneous density distribution. We then use theoretical insight from a constrained mode tube model to introduce the bead degrees of freedom together with random walk conformational statistics all the way down to the Kuhn scale of the chains. This is followed by a sequence of simulations with carefully parameterized force-capped bead–spring models, which slowly introduce the local bead packing while reproducing the larger-scale chain statistics of the target Kremer–Grest system at all levels of force-capping. Finally, we can switch to the full Kremer–Grest model without perturbing the structure. The resulting chain statistics is in excellent agreement with literature results on all length scales accessible in brute-force simulations of shorter chains.},

In this paper, we focus on understanding the dispersion and orientation patterns of nanorods in an unentangled polymer melt, particularly as a function of nanorod concentration, using molecular dynamics simulations. The system is comprised of flexible polymer chains and multi-thread nanorods that are equilibrated in the NPT ensemble. All interactions are purely repulsive except for those between polymers and rods. Results with attractive vs repulsive polymer–rod interactions are compared and contrasted. The concentration of rods has a direct impact on the phase behavior of the system. At lower concentrations, rods phase separate into nematic clusters, whereas at higher concentrations more isotropic and less structured rod configurations are observed. A detailed examination of the conformation of the polymer chains near the rod surface shows extension of the chains along the director of the rods (especially within clusters). The dispersion and orientation of the nanorods are a result of the competition between depletion entropic forces responsible for the formation of rod clusters, the enthalpic effects that improve mixing of rods and polymer, and entropic losses of polymers interpenetrating rod clusters.},

  abstract = {In this work, the question of the influence of the counterion size on the self-assembly in melts of diblock copolymers with one charged block was studied using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. It was assumed that the blocks were fully compatible, i.e., the Flory–Huggins parameter χ between them was equal to 0. Due to the presence of correlation attraction (electrostatic cohesion) between the charged species, the systems with all types of counterions underwent transitions to ordered states, forming various morphologies, including lamellae, perforated lamellae, and hexagonally packed cylinders. Phase diagrams were constructed by varying the chain composition f c and locating the order–disorder transition positions in terms of the electrostatic strength parameter λ (dimensionless Bjerrum length). Despite having a rather large ion size mismatch, the systems with smaller counterions demonstrated an even better tendency to form microphase separated states than the systems with larger ones. It was found that the differences between the phase diagrams of the systems with different counterions can be roughly rationalized by using coordinates (volume fraction of the charged block φ c —modified interaction parameter λ*). The latter parameter assumes that the electrostatic energy is simply inversely proportional to the characteristic distance between the ions of different signs. Such an approach appeared to be rather effective and allowed the diagrams obtained for different counterion sizes to almost coincide. The results of this work suggest that the counterion size can be used as a tool to control the system morphology as well as the effective incompatibility between the blocks.},

We provide here a benchmark of its fundamental gap Δ obtained from many-body GW and fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo methods. Both approaches independently arrive at a similar value of Δ ∼ 1.3 eV, suggesting the validity of both methods. Such a bandgap makes Sc 2 C(OH) 2 a 2D semiconductor suitable for optoelectronic applications. The absorbance spectra and the first exciton binding energy (0.63 eV), based on the Bethe–Salpeter equation, are presented as well. The reported results may serve to delineate experimental uncertainties and enable selection of reasonable approximations such as density functional theory functionals, for use in modeling of related MXenes.},

  abstract = {Understanding structural transformation and phase transition accompanying reactions in a solid as a catalyst or oxygen carrier is important to the design and optimization of many catalytic or chemical looping reaction processes. Herein, we combined density functional theory calculation with the stochastic surface walking global optimization approach to track the structural transformation accompanying the reduction of CuO upon releasing oxygen. We then used machine learning (ML) methods to correlate the structural properties of CuO x with varying x. By decomposing a reduction step into oxygen detachment and structural reconstruction, we identified two types of pathways: (1) uniform reduction with minimal structural changes; (2) segregated reduction with significant reconstruction. The results of ML analysis showed that the most important feature is the radial distribution functions of Cu–O at a percentage of oxygen vacancy [C(O V )] 50\% for CuO x formation. These features reflect the underlying physicochemical origin, i.e., Cu–O breaking and Cu–Cu formation in the respective stage of reduction. Phase diagram analysis indicates that CuO will be reduced to Cu 2 O under a typical oxygen uncoupling condition. This work demonstrates the complexity of solid structural transformation and the potential of ML methods in studying solid state materials involved in many chemical processes.},

The formation of (MoO 3 ) n chemically bound to C 60 is energetically favorable due to Δ G &lt; 0 for n = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9, and they well reproduced the histogram of the height of (MoO 3 ) n on the C 60 (111) terrace obtained by a STM height-profile. STS results demonstrated the upward energy shift of both highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of C 60 in the vicinity of (MoO 3 ) n ( n = 6 or 9), which is consistent with the previous results of the co-deposited C 60 /MoO 3 film obtained using photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopy [Wang and Gao, Appl.

Furthermore, it is noted that the C 60 –(MoO 3 ) n interactions exhibit a high heat resistance up to 250 °C by examining the UV–vis–NIR spectra of a co-deposited C 60 /MoO 3 (6:4) film before and after thermal annealing.

The properties considered in this work are densities, structural properties, transport properties, surface tension, freezing point depression, and maximum in density. All the developed models were able to describe quite well the experimental values of the densities. Structural properties were well described by models with charges equal to or larger than ±0.85, surface tension by the charge ±0.92, maximum in density by the charge ±0.85, and transport properties by the charge ±0.75. The use of a scaled charge of ±0.75 is able to reproduce with high accuracy the viscosities and diffusion coefficients of NaCl solutions for the first time. We have also considered the case of KCl in water, and the results obtained were fully consistent with those of NaCl. There is no value of the scaled charge able to reproduce all the properties considered in this work. Although certainly scaled charges are not the final word in the development of force fields for electrolytes in water, its use may have some practical advantages. Certain values of the scaled charge could be the best option when the interest is to describe certain experimental properties.},

  abstract = {The specific features of crystal nucleation widely determine the morphology of the evolving crystalline material. Crystal nucleation is, as a rule, not accessible by direct observation of the nuclei, which develop with time. This limitation is caused by the small size (nanometer scale) of the critical nuclei and the stochastic nature of their formation. We describe an experimental approach to the determination of specific features of the cluster size distribution employing fast scanning calorimetry at scanning rates up to 10 000 K s −1 . The surviving cluster fraction is determined by selectively melting/dissolving clusters smaller than the critical size corresponding to the highest temperature of a short spike positioned between the nucleation and the development stage in Tammann’s two-stage method. This approach allows for estimating the time evolution of the radius of the largest detectable clusters in the distribution. Knowing this radius as a function of nucleation time allows for determining a radial growth rate. In the example of poly( l -lactic acid) (PLLA), the order of magnitude estimate of radial growth rates of clusters of about 2–5 nm yields values between 10 −5 and 10 −3 nm s −1 . The radial growth rate of micrometer-sized spherulites is available from optical microscopy. The corresponding values are about three orders of magnitude higher than the values for the nanometer-sized clusters. This difference is explainable by stochastic effects, transient features, and the size dependence of the growth processes on the nanometer scale. The experimental and (order of magnitude) classical nucleation theory estimates agree well.},

  abstract = {Many phase change materials (PCMs) are found to crystallize without exhibiting a glass transition endotherm upon reheating. In this paper, we review experimental evidence revealing that these PCMs and likely other hyperquenched molecular and metallic systems can crystallize from the glassy state when reheated at a standard rate. Among these evidences, PCMs annealed below the glass transition temperature T g exhibit slower crystallization kinetics despite an increase in the number of sub-critical nuclei that should promote the crystallization speed. Flash calorimetry uncovers the glass transition endotherm hidden by crystallization and reveals a distinct change in kinetics when crystallization switches from the glassy to the supercooled liquid state. The resulting T g value also rationalizes the presence of the pre- T g relaxation exotherm ubiquitous of hyperquenched systems. Finally, the shift in crystallization temperature during annealing exhibits a non-exponential decay that is characteristic of structural relaxation in the glass. Modeling using a modified Turnbull equation for nucleation rate supports the existence of sub- T g fast crystallization and emphasizes the benefit of a fragile-to-strong transition for PCM applications due to a reduction in crystallization at low temperature (improved data retention) and increasing its speed at high temperature (faster computing).},

  abstract = {Multiple-step nucleation pathways have been observed during mineral formation in both inorganic and biomineral systems. These pathways can involve precursor aqueous species, amorphous intermediates, or metastable phases. Despite the widespread occurrence of these processes, elucidating the precise nucleation steps and the transformation mechanisms between each step remains a challenging task. Using a suite of potentiometric, microscopic, and spectroscopic tools, we studied the nucleation pathway of SrSO 4 as a function of the physico-chemical solution parameters. Our observations reveal that below a threshold supersaturation, nucleation is driven by bound species, akin to the prenucleation cluster model, which directly leads to the formation of the stable phase celestine, SrSO 4 . At higher supersaturations, this situation is altered, with nucleation dominated by the consumption of free ions. Importantly, this change in nucleation mechanism is coupled to the formation of a hemihydrate metastable phase, SrSO 4 · 1/2H 2 O, which eventually transforms into celestine, adhering to Ostwald’s rule of stages. This transformation is a solution-mediated process, also occurring in the presence of a fluid film and is controlled by the physico-chemical parameters of the surrounding environment. It proceeds through the dissolution of the metastable phase and the de novo crystallization of the final phase. Overall, our results reveal that ion association taking place during the prenucleation stage dictates whether the nucleation pathway goes through an intermediate phase or not. This also underlines that although Ostwald’s rule of stages is a common process, it is not a prerequisite for mineral formation—even in systems where it can occur.},

  abstract = {Glyphosate is a widely used herbicide, and its protonation and deprotonation sites are fundamental to understanding its properties. In this work, the sodiated, protonated, and deprotonated glyphosate were evaluated in the gas phase by infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy to determine the exact nature of these coordination, protonation, and deprotonation states in the gas phase. In this context, Natural Bond Orbital analyses were carried out to unravel interactions that govern glyphosate (de)protonation states in the gas phase. The solvent effect on the protonation/deprotonation equilibria was also investigated by implicit (Solvation Model Based on Density and polarizable continuum models) and explicit solvation models (Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations). These results show that glyphosate is protonated in the phosphonate group in the gas phase because of the strong hydrogen bond between the carboxylic oxygen (O7) and the protonated phosphonate group (O8–H19), while the most stable species in water is protonated at the amino group because of the preferential interaction of the NH 2 + group and the solvent water molecules. Similarly, deprotonated glyphosate [Glyp−H] − was shown to be deprotonated at the phosphonate group in the gas phase but not in solution, also because of the preferential solvation of the NH 2 + group present in the other deprotomers. Therefore, these results show that the stabilization of the protonated amino group by the solvent molecules is the governing factor of the (de)protonation equilibrium of glyphosate in water.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of a spin-state energy difference is crucial for understanding the spin crossover phenomena and is very challenging for density functional approximations, especially for local and semi-local approximations due to delocalization errors. Here, we investigate the effect of the self-interaction error removal from the local spin density approximation (LSDA) and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation on the spin-state gaps of Fe(II) complexes with various ligands using recently developed locally scaled self-interaction correction (LSIC) by Zope et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 214108 (2019)]. The LSIC method is exact for one-electron density, recovers the uniform electron gas limit of the underlying functional, and approaches the well-known Perdew–Zunger self-interaction correction (PZSIC) as a particular case when the scaling factor is set to unity. Our results, when compared with reference diffusion Monte Carlo results, show that the PZSIC method significantly overestimates spin-state gaps favoring low spin states for all ligands and does not improve upon density functional approximations. The perturbative LSIC-LSDA using PZSIC densities significantly improves the gaps with a mean absolute error of 0.51 eV but slightly overcorrects for the stronger CO ligands. The quasi-self-consistent LSIC-LSDA, such as coupled-cluster single double and perturbative triple [CCSD(T)], gives a correct sign of spin-state gaps for all ligands with a mean absolute error of 0.56 eV, comparable to that of CCSD(T) (0.49 eV).},

Though molecular dyads like PyCHDMA have the potential to change solar energy into electrical current through the process of photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), the major challenge is the real-time investigation of the photoinduced ICT process in crystals, necessary to design solid-state optoelectronic materials. The time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements with the single crystals showed that the ICT state lifetime of the thermodynamic form, PyCHDMA1 (pyrene and DMA: axial), is ∼3 ns, whereas, for the kinetic form, PyCHDMA20 (pyrene and DMA: equatorial), it is ∼7 ns, while photoexcited with 375 nm radiation. The polymorphic crystals were photo-excited and subsequently probed with a pink Laue x-ray beam in time-resolved x-ray diffraction (TRXRD) measurements. The TRXRD results suggest that in the ICT state, due to electron transfer from the tertiary N-atom in DMA moiety to the bridging group and pyrene moiety, a decreased repulsion between the lone-pair and the bond-pair at N-atom induces planarity in the C–N–(CH 3 ) 2 moiety, in both polymorphs. The Natural Bond Orbital calculations and partial atomic charge analysis by Hirshfeld partitioning also corroborated the same. Although the interfragment charge transfer (IFCT) analysis using the TDDFT results showed that for the charge transfer excitation in both conformers, the electrons were transferred from the DMA moiety to mostly the pyrene moiety, the bridging group has little role to play in that.},

From 17 000 to 21 500 cm −1 , the photodissociation spectrum of MgI + is broad and unstructured; photofragment images in this region show perpendicular anisotropy, which is consistent with absorption to the repulsive wall of the (1) Ω = 1 or (2) Ω = 1 states followed by direct dissociation to ground state products Mg + ( 2 S) + I ( 2 P 3/2 ). Analysis of photofragment images taken at photon energies near the threshold gives a bond dissociation energy D 0 (Mg + -I) = 203.0 ± 1.8 kJ/mol (2.10 ± 0.02 eV; 17 000 ± 150 cm −1 ). At photon energies of 33 000–41 000 cm −1 , exclusively I + fragments are formed. Over most of this region, the formation of I + is not energetically allowed via one-photon absorption from the ground state of MgI + . Images show the observed product is due to resonance enhanced two-photon dissociation. The photodissociation spectrum from 33 000 to 38 500 cm −1 shows vibrational structure, giving an average excited state vibrational spacing of 227 cm −1 . This is consistent with absorption to the (3) Ω = 0 + state from ν = 0, 1 of the (1) Ω = 0 + ground state; from the (3) Ω = 0 + state, absorption of a second photon results in dissociation to Mg* ( 3 P° J ) + I + ( 3 P J ). From 38 500 to 41 000 cm −1 , the spectrum is broad and unstructured. We attribute this region of the spectrum to one-photon dissociation of vibrationally hot MgI + at low energy and ground state MgI + at higher energy to form Mg ( 1 S) + I + ( 3 P J ) products.},

This surface simultaneously describes the two reaction channels, hydrogen abstraction from the methyl group [(R1) path] and from the alcohol group [(R2) path] of methanol to form water. PES-2022 is a smooth and continuous surface, which reasonably describes the topology of this reactive system from reactants to products, including the intermediate complexes present in the system. Based on PES-2022 an exhaustive dynamics study was performed using quasi-classical trajectory calculations under two different initial conditions: at a fixed room temperature, for direct comparison with the experimental evidence and at different collision energies, to analyze possible mechanisms of reaction. In the first case, the available energy was mostly deposited as water vibrational energy, with the vibrational population inverted in the stretching modes and not inverted in the bending modes, reproducing the experimental evidence. In the second case, the analysis of different dynamics magnitudes (excitation functions, product energy partitioning, and product scattering distributions), allows us to suggest different mechanisms for both (R1) and (R2) paths: a direct mechanism for the (R2) path vs an indirect one, related with “nearly trapped” trajectories in the intermediate complexes, for the (R1) path.},

Six complete Coulomb explosion channels were observed using the time-of-flight correlation map. The kinetic energy release distributions for these channels were obtained and compared with those available in the literature. The fragmentation mechanisms of the three-body dissociation channels were analyzed by the Dalitz plots and Newton diagrams. Both concerted breakup and sequential fragmentation pathways were identified in the channel SO 2 3+ → O + + O + + S + , whereas only the concerted breakup mechanism was confirmed for the channels SO 2 4+ → O + + O + + S 2+ and SO 2 4+ → O 2+ + O + + S + . Using the Coulomb explosion model, we determined the molecular geometry from the concerted fragmentation channels, and the obtained bond lengths and angles from the higher kinetic energy release peaks are close to that of the neutral SO 2 obtained by high-level quantum chemical calculation. The present results indicate that the electron impact experiment is a potential tool for the Coulomb explosion imaging of small molecules.},

In this paper, the significance of instrumental accuracy is described and the character/principle of selection on the simulation model is illuminated/proposed, showing that an adequate precision device and an appropriate fitting model are a prerequisite for a correct EIS analysis. Moreover, the drawbacks of conventional two-electrode EIS experiments for typical coin-type cells are rigorously pointed out by comparison with the ideal three-electrode configuration, where the real impedance information of the cathode would be masked by the sum of both the anode film resistance response and the unavoidable inductive loop signal. The three-electrode case enables efficient accurate observations on individual electrodes, thus facilitating abundant and useful information acquisition. Consequently, devices with a sufficient accuracy, rational simulation models, and advanced three-electrode cells are distinctly illustrated as standardized criterion/paradigm for EIS characterizations, which are essentially important for electrode and interface modifications in LIBs.},

However, the need for ultrafast calculations in interactive quantum mechanical studies, high-throughput virtual screening, and data-driven machine learning has shifted the emphasis toward calculation runtimes recently. This comes with new constraints for the software implementation as many fast calculations would suffer from a large overhead of the manual setup and other procedures that are comparatively fast when studying a single molecular structure, but which become prohibitively slow for high-throughput demands. In this work, we discuss the effect of various well-established semi-empirical approximations on calculation speed and relate this to data transfer rates from the raw-data source computer to the results of the visualization front end. For the former, we consider desktop computers, local high performance computing, and remote cloud services in order to elucidate the effect on interactive calculations, for web and cloud interfaces in local applications, and in world-wide interactive virtual sessions.

While its original formulation was limited to adiabatic populations, the growing interest in the application of FSSH to coherent phenomena prompts the question of how one should construct a complete density matrix based on FSSH trajectories. A straightforward solution is to define adiabatic coherences based on wavefunction coefficients. In this paper, we demonstrate that inconsistencies introduced in the density matrix through such treatment may lead to a violation of positivity. We furthermore show that a recently proposed coherent generalization of FSSH results in density matrices that satisfy positivity while yielding improved accuracy throughout much (but not all) of parameter space.},

The protocol is demonstrated for ceria, which is a prototypical reducible oxide material. The underlying idea is to achieve a consistent (and harmonized) set of Slater–Koster (SK) tables with connected repulsive potentials that enable switching on and off the in-valence description of the Ce 4 f states without serious loss of accuracy in structure and energetics. The implicit treatment of the Ce 4 f states, with the use of f -in-core SK-tables, is found to lead to a significant decrease in computational time. More importantly, it allows for explicit control of the oxidation states of individual Ce atoms. This makes it possible to “freeze” the electronic configuration, thereby allowing the exploration of the energetics for various meta-stable configurations. We anticipate that the outlined strategy can help to shed light on the interplay between the size, shape, and redox activity for nanoceria and other related materials.},

  abstract = {Localized molecular orbitals are often used for the analysis of chemical bonds, but they can also serve to efficiently and comprehensibly compute linear response properties. While conventional canonical molecular orbitals provide an adequate basis for the treatment of excited states, a chemically meaningful identification of the different excited-state processes is difficult within such a delocalized orbital basis. In this work, starting from an initial set of supermolecular canonical molecular orbitals, we provide a simple one-step top-down embedding procedure for generating a set of orbitals, which are localized in terms of the supermolecule but delocalized over each subsystem composing the supermolecule. Using an orbital partitioning scheme based on such sets of localized orbitals, we further present a procedure for the construction of local excitations and charge-transfer states within the linear response framework of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). This procedure provides direct access to approximate diabatic excitation energies and, under the Tamm–Dancoff approximation, also their corresponding electronic couplings—quantities that are of primary importance in modeling energy transfer processes in complex biological systems. Our approach is compared with a recently developed diabatization procedure based on subsystem TDDFT using projection operators, which leads to a similar set of working equations. Although both of these methods differ in the general localization strategies adopted and the type of basis functions (Slaters vs Gaussians) employed, an overall decent agreement is obtained.},

The key quantities characterizing transport are membrane permeability and its diffusion resistance. Such transport problems arising in very different contexts, ranging from plant physiology and cell biology to chemical engineering, have been studied for more than a century. Nevertheless, an expression giving the permeability for a membrane of arbitrary thickness at arbitrary surface densities of the channel openings is still unknown. Here, we fill in the gap and derive such an expression. Since this expression is approximate, we compare its predictions with the permeability obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations and find good agreement between the two.},

  abstract = {The transport of particles through channels is of paramount importance in physics, chemistry, and surface science due to its broad real world applications. Much insight can be gained by observing the transition paths of a particle through a channel and collecting statistics on the lifetimes in the channel or the escape probabilities from the channel. In this paper, we consider the diffusive transport through a narrow conical channel of a Brownian particle subject to intermittent dynamics, namely, stochastic resetting. As such, resetting brings the particle back to a desired location from where it resumes its diffusive phase. To this end, we extend the Fick–Jacobs theory of channel-facilitated diffusive transport to resetting-induced transport. Exact expressions for the conditional mean first passage times, escape probabilities, and the total average lifetime in the channel are obtained, and their behavior as a function of the resetting rate is highlighted. It is shown that resetting can expedite the transport through the channel—rigorous constraints for such conditions are then illustrated. Furthermore, we observe that a carefully chosen resetting rate can render the average lifetime of the particle inside the channel minimal. Interestingly, the optimal rate undergoes continuous and discontinuous transitions as some relevant system parameters are varied. The validity of our one-dimensional analysis and the corresponding theoretical predictions is supported by three-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations. We thus believe that resetting can be useful to facilitate particle transport across biological membranes—a phenomenon that can spearhead further theoretical and experimental studies.},

Interaction energies of the more distant dimers are easier to compute accurately and several of the methods tested are suitable as replacements for coupled-cluster through perturbative triples for all but the closest dimers.

We present an electronic structure method that combines the accuracy of the Harris functional approach with the computational efficiency of approximately linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT). The non-variational nature of the Harris functional has been addressed by constructing a Lagrangian energy functional, which restores the variational condition by imposing stationarity with respect to the reference density. The associated linear response equations may be treated with linear-scaling efficiency in an atomic orbital based scheme. Key ingredients to describe the structural and dynamical properties of molecular systems are the forces acting on the atoms and the stress tensor. These first-order derivatives of the Harris Lagrangian have been derived and implemented in consistence with the energy correction. The proposed method allows for simulations with accuracies close to the Kohn–Sham DFT reference. Embedded in the CP2K program package, the method is designed to enable ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of molecular solutions for system sizes of several thousand atoms. Available subsystem DFT methods may be used to provide the reference density required for the energy correction at near linear-scaling efficiency. As an example of production applications, we applied the method to molecular dynamics simulations of the binary mixtures cyclohexane-methanol and toluene-methanol, performed within the isobaric-isothermal ensemble, to investigate the hydrogen bonding network in these non-ideal mixtures.},

These are characterized by coupling between the diabatic electronic states and the vibrational degrees of freedom, resulting in linear displacements of the corresponding harmonic oscillators, and by nonadiabatic couplings between pairs of diabatic states. In order to derive the linear response functions, we first perform the Dyson expansion of the relevant propagators with respect to the nonadiabatic component of the Hamiltonian, then derive and expand with respect to the displacements the propagators at given interaction times, and finally provide analytical expressions for the time integrals that lead to the different contributions to the linear response function. The approach is then applied to the derivation of third-order response functions describing different physical processes: ground state bleaching, stimulated emission, excited state absorption, and double quantum coherence. Comparisons between the results obtained up to sixth order in the Dyson expansion and independent numerical calculation of the response functions provide evidence of the series convergence in a few representative cases.},

  abstract = {Reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations are performed to provide insight into the effects of external electrostatic fields on hydrocarbon reaction kinetics. By comparing the results from MD and DFT, the suitability of the MD method in modeling electrodynamics is first assessed. Results show that the electric field-induced polarization predicted by the MD charge equilibration method is in good agreement with various DFT charge partitioning schemes. Then, the effects of oriented external electric fields on the transition pathways of non-redox reactions are investigated. Results on the minimum energy path suggest that electric fields can cause catalysis or inhibition of oxidation reactions, whereas pyrolysis reactions are not affected due to the weaker electronegativity of the hydrogen and carbon atoms. MD simulations of isolated reactions show that the reaction kinetics is also affected by applied external Lorentz forces and interatomic Coulomb forces since they can increase or decrease the energy of collision depending on the molecular conformation. In addition, electric fields can affect the kinetics of polar species and force them to align in the direction of field lines. These effects are attributed to energy transfer via intermolecular collisions and stabilization under the external Lorentz force. The kinetics of apolar species is not significantly affected mainly due to the weak induced dipole moment even under strong electric fields. The dynamics and reaction rates of species are studied by means of large-scale combustion simulations of n -dodecane and oxygen mixtures. Results show that under strong electric fields, the fuel, oxidizer, and most product molecules experience translational and rotational acceleration mainly due to close charge transfer along with a reduction in their vibrational energy due to stabilization. This study will serve as a basis to improve the current methods used in MD and to develop novel methodologies for the modeling of macroscale reacting flows under external electrostatic fields.},

  abstract = {Herein, we employed a developed linear response time dependent density functional theory-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulation method that explicitly takes into account the excitonic effects to investigate photoinduced excitation energy transfer dynamics of a double-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) model with different excitation energies. The E 11 excitation of the outer CNT will generate a local excitation (LE) | out *〉 exciton due to its low energy, which does not induce any charge separation. In contrast, the E 11 excitation of the inner CNT can generate four kinds of excitons with the LE exciton | in *〉 dominates. In the 500-fs dynamics simulation, the LE exciton | in *〉 and charge transfer (CT) excitons | out − in + 〉 and | out + in − 〉 are all gradually converted to the | out *〉 exciton, corresponding to a photoinduced excitation energy transfer, which is consistent with experimental studies. Finally, when the excitation energy is close to the E 22 state of the outer CNT (∼1.05 eV), a mixed population of different excitons, with the | out *〉 exciton dominated, is generated. Then, photoinduced energy transfer from the outer to inner CNTs occurs in the first 50 fs, which is followed by an inner to outer excitation energy transfer that is completed in 400 fs. The present work not only sheds important light on the mechanistic details of wavelength-dependent excitation energy transfer of a double-walled CNT model but also demonstrates the roles and importance of CT excitons in photoinduced excitation energy transfer. It also emphasized that explicitly including the excitonic effects in electronic structure calculations and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations is significant for correct understanding/rational design of optoelectronic properties of periodically extended systems.},

The Lagrangian for the conventional SA-CASSCF analytic gradient theory is extended to the SA-DMRG-CASSCF variant that can fully consider a whole set of constraints on the parameters of multi-root canonical matrix product states formed at all the DMRG block configurations. An efficient algorithm to solve the CP-DMRG-CASSCF equations for determining the multipliers was developed. The complexity of the resultant analytic gradient algorithm is overall the same as that of the unperturbed SA-DMRG-CASSCF algorithm. In addition, a reduced-scaling approach was developed to directly compute the SA reduced density matrices (SA-RDMs) and their perturbed ones without calculating separate state-specific RDMs. As part of our implementation scheme, we neglect the term associated with the constraint on the active orbitals in terms of the active–active rotation in the Lagrangian. Thus, errors from the true analytic gradients may be caused in this scheme. The proposed gradient algorithm was tested with the spin-adapted implementation by checking how accurately the computed analytic energy gradients reproduce numerical gradients of the SA-DMRG-CASSCF energies using a common number of renormalized bases. The illustrative applications show that the errors are sufficiently small when using a typical number of the renormalized bases, which is required to attain adequate accuracy in DMRG’s total energies.},

Practical realizations of AC have been based on two approximations: (i) fixing one- and two-electron reduced density matrices (1- and 2-RDMs) at the zero-coupling constant limit and (ii) extended random phase approximation (ERPA). This work investigates the effect of removing the “fixed-RDM” approximation in AC. The analysis is carried out for two electronic Hamiltonian partitionings: the group product function- and the Dyall Hamiltonians. Exact reference AC integrands are generated from the DMRG full configuration interaction solver. Two AC models are investigated, employing either exact 1- and 2-RDMs or their second-order expansions in the coupling constant in the ERPA equations. Calculations for model molecules indicate that lifting the fixed-RDM approximation is a viable way toward improving the accuracy of existing AC approximations.},

Here, we extend the capabilities of the EOM-DEA-CCSD method to the calculations of a multiphoton property, two-photon absorption (2PA) cross sections. Closed-form expressions for the 2PA cross sections are derived within the expectation-value approach using response wave functions. We analyze the performance of this new implementation by comparing the EOM-DEA-CCSD energies and 2PA cross sections with those computed using the CC3 quadratic response theory approach. As benchmark systems, we consider transitions to the states with doubly excited character in twisted ethene and in polyenes, for which EOM-EE-CCSD (EOM-CCSD for excitation energies) performs poorly. The EOM-DEA-CCSD 2PA cross sections are comparable with the CC3 results for twisted ethene; however, the discrepancies between the two methods are large for hexatriene. The observed trends are explained by configurational analysis of the 2PA channels.},

  abstract = {Interpolating a density matrix from a set of known density matrices is not a trivial task. This is because a linear combination of density matrices does not necessarily correspond to another density matrix. In this Communication, density matrices are examined as objects of a Grassmann manifold. Although this manifold is not a vector space, its tangent space is a vector space. As a result, one can map the density matrices on this manifold to their corresponding vectors in the tangent space and then perform interpolations on that tangent space. The resulting interpolated vector can be mapped back to the Grassmann manifold, which can then be utilized (1) as an optimal initial guess for a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation or (2) to derive energy directly without time-consuming SCF iterations. Such a promising approach is denoted as Grassmann interpolation (G-Int). The hydrogen molecule has been used to illustrate that the described interpolated method in this work preserves the essential attributes of a density matrix. For phosphorus mononitride and ferrocene, it was demonstrated numerically that reference points for the definition of the corresponding tangent spaces can be chosen arbitrarily. In addition, the interpolated density matrices provide a superior and essentially converged initial guess for an SCF calculation to make the SCF procedure itself unnecessary. Finally, this accurate, efficient, robust, and systematically improved G-Int strategy has been used for the first time to generate highly accurate potential energy surfaces with fine details for the difficult case, ferrocene.},

  abstract = {Triplex DNA structure has potential therapeutic application in inhibiting the expression of genes involved in cancer and other diseases. As a DNA-targeting antitumor and antibiotic drug, coralyne shows a remarkable binding propensity to triplex over canonical duplex and thus can modulate the stability of triplex structure, providing a prospective gene targeting strategy. Much less is known, however, about coralyne-binding interactions with triplex. By combining multiple steady-state spectroscopy with ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy, we have investigated the binding behaviors of coralyne with typical triplexes. Upon binding with a G-containing triplex, the fluorescence of coralyne is markedly quenched owing to the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) of coralyne with the G base. Systematic studies show that the PET rates are sensitive to the binding configuration and local microenvironment, from which the coexisting binding modes of monomeric (full and partial) intercalation and aggregate stacking along the sugar-phosphate backbone are distinguished and their respective contributions are determined. It shows that coralyne has preferences for monomeric intercalation within CGG triplex and pure TAT triplex, whereas CGC + triplex adopts mainly backbone binding of coralyne aggregates due to charge repulsion, revealing the sequence-specific binding selectivity. The triplex-DNA-induced aggregation of coralyne could be used as a probe for recognizing the water content in local DNA structures. The strong π–π stacking of intercalated coralyne monomer with base-triplets plays an important role in stabilizing the triplex structure. These results provide mechanistic insights for understanding the remarkable propensity of coralyne in selective binding to triplex DNA and shed light on the prospective applications of coralyne-triplex targeted anti-gene therapeutics.},

  abstract = {This study examines the ultraviolet (UV) divergence in field-theoretic simulations (FTSs) of block copolymer melts, which causes an unphysical dependence on the grid resolution, Δ, used to represent the fields. Our FTSs use the discrete Gaussian–chain model and a partial saddle-point approximation to enforce incompressibility. Previous work has demonstrated that the UV divergence can be accounted for by defining an effective interaction parameter, χ = z ∞ χ b + c 2 χ b 2 + c 3 χ b 3 + ⋯ ⁠ , in terms of the bare interaction parameter, χ b , used in the FTSs, where the coefficients of the expansion are determined by a Morse calibration. However, the need to use different grid resolutions for different ordered phases generally restricts the calibration to the linear approximation, χ ≈ z ∞ χ b , and prevents the calculation of order–order transitions. Here, we resolve these two issues by showing how the nonlinear calibration can be translated between different grids and how the UV divergence can be removed from free energy calculations. By doing so, we confirm previous observations from particle-based simulations. In particular, we show that the free energy closely matches self-consistent field theory (SCFT) predictions, even in the region where fluctuations disorder the periodic morphologies, and similarly, the periods of the ordered phases match SCFT predictions, provided the SCFT is evaluated with the nonlinear χ .},

The radius of the fibrils ranges from 50 nm to a few hundred nm, and previous theoretical studies point to electrostatics and collagen elasticity (measured as the persistence length, l p ) as the main origin for the self-limiting size scales. In this study, we have investigated the collagen triple helical structure and fibril size scales in pH 2 solutions with varying NaCl concentrations from 10 −4 to 100 mM, at which collagen is positively charged, and in pH 7.4 solutions, with varying ionic strengths from 100 to 250 mM, at which collagen is both positively and negatively charged. Using static and dynamic light scattering, the radius of gyration ( R g ), hydrodynamic radius ( R h ), and second virial coefficient ( A 2 ) of collagen triple helices are determined, and l p is calculated. With increasing ionic strength, triple helical l p decreases in pH 2 solutions and increases in pH 7.4 solutions. The value ranges from 60 to 100 nm depending on the ionic environment, but at the salt concentration at which A 2 is near zero, there are no net backbone interactions in solution, and the intrinsic collagen triple helix l p is determined to be 90–95 nm. Electron microscopy is used to determine the diameter of fibrils assembled in pH 7.4 conditions, and we compare l p of the collagen triple helices and fibril diameter using recent theory on fibril assembly. By better understanding collagen l p and fibril assembly, we can further understand mechanisms of biomacromolecule self-assembly.},

The presence of a phase transition of the BKT universality class is shown in an off-lattice model of particles with purely repulsive interaction employing computer simulations. A critical spin wave region 0 &lt; T &lt; T BKT is found with a nonuniversal exponent η ( T ) that follows the shape suggested by BKT theory, including a critical value consistent with η BKT = 1/4. One can observe a transition from power-law decay to exponential decay in the static correlation functions at the transition temperature T BKT , which is supported by finite-size scaling analysis. A critical temperature T BKT = 0.17(1) is suggested. Investigations into the dynamic aspects of the phase transition are carried out. The short-time behavior of the incoherent spin autocorrelation function agrees with the Nelson–Fisher prediction, whereas the long-time behavior differs from the finite-size scaling known for the static XY model. Analysis of coherent spin wave dynamics shows that the spin wave peak is a propagating mode that can be reasonably well fitted by hydrodynamic theory. The mobility of the particles strongly enhances damping of the spin waves, but the model still lies within the dynamic universality class of the standard XY model.},

  abstract = {We show that an analogy between crowding in fluid and jammed phases of hard spheres captures the density dependence of the kissing number for a family of numerically generated jammed states. We extend this analogy to jams of mixtures of hard spheres in d = 3 dimensions and, thus, obtain an estimate of the random close packing volume fraction, ϕ RCP , as a function of size polydispersity. We first consider mixtures of particle sizes with discrete distributions. For binary systems, we show agreement between our predictions and simulations using both our own results and results reported in previous studies, as well as agreement with recent experiments from the literature. We then apply our approach to systems with continuous polydispersity using three different particle size distributions, namely, the log-normal, Gamma, and truncated power-law distributions. In all cases, we observe agreement between our theoretical findings and numerical results up to rather large polydispersities for all particle size distributions when using as reference our own simulations and results from the literature. In particular, we find ϕ RCP to increase monotonically with the relative standard deviation, s σ , of the distribution and to saturate at a value that always remains below 1. A perturbative expansion yields a closed-form expression for ϕ RCP that quantitatively captures a distribution-independent regime for s σ &lt; 0.5. Beyond that regime, we show that the gradual loss in agreement is tied to the growth of the skewness of size distributions.},

  abstract = {The routine use of electronic structures in many chemical simulation applications calls for efficient and easy ways to access electronic structure programs. We describe how the graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated electronic structure program TeraChem can be set up as an electronic structure server, to be easily accessed by third-party client programs. We exploit Google’s protocol buffer framework for data serialization and communication. The client interface, called TeraChem protocol buffers (TCPB), has been designed for ease of use and compatibility with multiple programming languages, such as C++, Fortran, and Python. To demonstrate the ease of coupling third-party programs with electronic structures using TCPB, we have incorporated the TCPB client into Amber for quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations. The TCPB interface saves time with GPU initialization and I/O operations, achieving a speedup of more than 2× compared to a prior file-based implementation for a QM region with ∼250 basis functions. We demonstrate the practical application of TCPB by computing the free energy profile of p-hydroxybenzylidene-2,3-dimethylimidazolinone (p-HBDI − )—a model chromophore in green fluorescent proteins—on the first excited singlet state using Hamiltonian replica exchange for enhanced sampling. All calculations in this work have been performed with the non-commercial freely-available version of TeraChem, which is sufficient for many QM region sizes in common use.},

  abstract = {Insights into the microscopic structure of aqueous interfaces are essential for understanding the chemical and physical processes on the water surface, including chemical synthesis, atmospheric chemistry, and events in biomolecular systems. These aqueous interfaces have been probed by heterodyne-detected sum-frequency generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy. To obtain the molecular response from the measured HD-SFG spectra, one needs to correct the measured ssp spectra for local electromagnetic field effects at the interface due to a spatially varying dielectric function. This so-called Fresnel factor correction can change the inferred response substantially, and different ways of performing this correction lead to different conclusions about the interfacial water response. Here, we compare the simulated and experimental spectra at the air/water interface. We use three previously developed models to compare the experiment with theory: an advanced approach taking into account the detailed inhomogeneous interfacial dielectric profile and the Lorentz and slab models to approximate the interfacial dielectric function. Using the advanced model, we obtain an excellent quantitative agreement between theory and experiment, in both spectral shape and amplitude. Remarkably, we find that for the Fresnel factor correction of the ssp spectra, the Lorentz model for the interfacial dielectric function is equally accurate in the hydrogen (H)-bonded region of the response, while the slab model underestimates this response significantly. The Lorentz model, thus, provides a straightforward method to obtain the molecular response from the measured spectra of aqueous interfaces in the H-bonded region.},

  abstract = {Methane hydrates are important from a scientific and industrial perspective, and form by nucleation and growth from a supersaturated aqueous solution of methane. Molecular simulation is able to shed light on the process of homogeneous nucleation of hydrates, using straightforward molecular dynamics or rare event enhanced sampling techniques with atomistic and coarse grained force fields. In our previous work [Arjun, T. A. Berendsen, and P. G. Bolhuis, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 116 , 19305 (2019)], we performed transition path sampling (TPS) simulations using all atom force fields under moderate driving forces at high pressure, which enabled unbiased atomistic insight into the formation of methane hydrates. The supersaturation in these simulations was influenced by the Laplace pressure induced by the spherical gas reservoir. Here, we investigate the effect of removing this influence. Focusing on the supercooled, supersaturated regime to keep the system size tractable, our TPS simulations indicate that nuclei form amorphous structures below roughly 260 K and crystalline sI structures above 260 K. For these temperatures, the average transition path lengths are significantly longer than in our previous study, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with TPS. The temperature to observe a critical nucleus of certain size was roughly 20 K lower compared to a spherical reservoir due to the lower concentration of methane in the solution, yielding a reduced driving force. We analyze the TPS results using a model based on classical nucleation theory. The corresponding free energy barriers are estimated and found to be consistent with previous predictions, thus adding to the overall picture of the hydrate formation process.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the influence of particle aspect ratio on the kinetics and phase behavior of hard gyrobifastigia (GBF). First, the formation of a highly anisotropic nucleus shape in the isotropic-to-crystal transition in regular GBF is explained by the differences in interfacial free energies of various crystal planes and the nucleus geometry predicted by the Wulff construction. GBF-related shapes with various aspect ratios were then studied, mapping their equations of state, determining phase coexistence conditions via interfacial pinning, and computing nucleation free-energy barriers via umbrella sampling using suitable order parameters. Our simulations reveal a reduction of the kinetic barrier for isotropic–crystal transition upon an increase in aspect ratio, and that for highly oblate and prolate aspect ratios, an intermediate nematic phase is stabilized. Our results and observations also support two conjectures for the formation of the crystalline state from the isotropic phase: that low phase free energies at the ordering phase transition correlate with low transition barriers and that the emergence of a mesophase provides a steppingstone that expedites crystallization.},

  abstract = {The Soret effect is the tendency of fluid mixtures to exhibit concentration gradients in the presence of a temperature gradient. Using molecular-dynamics simulation of two-component Lennard-Jones liquids, it is demonstrated that spatially sinusoidal heat pulses generate both temperature and pressure gradients. Over short timescales, the dominant effect is the generation of compressional waves, which dissipate over time as the system approaches mechanical equilibrium. The approach to mechanical equilibrium is also characterized by a decrease in particle density in the high-temperature region and an increase in particle density in the low-temperature region. It is demonstrated that concentration gradients develop rapidly during the propagation of compressional waves through the liquid. Over longer timescales, heat conduction occurs to return the system to thermal equilibrium, with the particle current acting to restore a more uniform particle density. It is shown that the Soret effect arises due to the fact that the two components of the fluid exhibit different responses to pressure gradients. First, the so-called isotope effect occurs because light atoms tend to respond more rapidly to evolving conditions. In this case, there appears to be a connection to previous observations of “fast sound” in binary fluids. Second, it is shown that the partial pressures of the two components in equilibrium, and more directly, the relative magnitudes of their derivatives with respect to temperature and density, determine which species accumulate in the high- and low-temperature regions. In the conditions simulated here, the dependence of the partial pressure on density gradients is larger than the dependence on temperature gradients. This is directly connected to the accumulation of the species with the largest partial pressure in the high-temperature region and the accumulation of the species with the smallest partial pressure in the low-temperature region. The results suggest that further development of theoretical descriptions of the Soret effect might begin with hydrodynamical equations in two-component liquids. Finally, it is suggested that the recently proposed concept of “thermophobicity” may be related to the sensitivity of partial pressures in a multicomponent fluid to changes in temperature and density.},

The PES presents two shallow minima of 31.85 and 37.12 cm −1 for the linear (He facing S) and the nearly T-shaped geometries, respectively. The dissociation energy of the complex was calculated and found to be D 0 = 14.183 cm −1 . Inelastic scattering calculations were performed using the close-coupling approach. Cross-sections for transitions between the 61 first fine structure levels of CCS were obtained for energy up to 600 cm −1 and rate coefficients for the 5–50 K temperature range were derived.

  abstract = {Two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy, infrared pump–infrared probe spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations were used to study vibrational relaxation by ring and carbonyl stretching modes in a series of methylated xanthine derivatives in acetonitrile and deuterium oxide (heavy water). Isotropic signals from the excited symmetric and asymmetric carbonyl stretch modes decay biexponentially in both solvents. Coherent energy transfer between the symmetric and asymmetric carbonyl stretching modes gives rise to a quantum beat in the time-dependent anisotropy signals. The damping time of the coherent oscillation agrees with the fast decay component of the carbonyl bleach recovery signals, indicating that this time constant reflects intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) to other solute modes. Despite their similar frequencies, the excited ring modes decay monoexponentially with a time constant that matches the slow decay component of the carbonyl modes. The slow decay times, which are faster in heavy water than in acetonitrile, approximately match the ones observed in previous UV pump–IR probe measurements on the same compounds. The slow component is assigned to intermolecular energy transfer to solvent bath modes from low-frequency solute modes, which are populated by IVR and are anharmonically coupled to the carbonyl and ring stretch modes. 2D IR measurements indicate that the carbonyl stretching modes are weakly coupled to the delocalized ring modes, resulting in slow exchange that cannot explain the common solvent-dependence. IVR is suggested to occur at different rates for the carbonyl vs ring modes due to differences in mode-specific couplings and not to differences in the density of accessible states.},

  abstract = {In-operando spectroscopic observation of the intermediates formed during various electrocatalytic oxidation and reduction reactions is crucial to propose the mechanism of the corresponding reaction. Surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy coupled to rotating disk electrochemistry (SERRS-RDE), developed about a decade ago, proved to be an excellent spectroscopic tool to investigate the mechanism of heterogeneous oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by synthetic iron porphyrin complexes under steady-state conditions in water. The information about the formation of the intermediates accumulated during the course of the reaction at the electrode interface helped to develop better ORR catalysts with second sphere residues in the porphyrin rings. To date, the application of this SERRS-RDE setup is limited to ORR only because the thiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-modified Ag electrode, used as the working electrode in these experiments, suffers from stability issues at more cathodic and anodic potential, where H 2 O oxidation, CO 2 reduction, and H + reduction reactions occur. The current investigation shows the development of a second-generation SERRS-RDE setup consisting of an Ag nanostructure (AgNS)-modified graphite electrode as the working electrode. These electrodes show higher stability (compared to the conventional thiol SAM-modified Ag electrode) upon exposure to very high cathodic and anodic potential with a good signal-to-noise ratio in the Raman spectra. The behavior of this modified electrode toward ORR is found to be the same as the SAM-modified Ag electrode, and the same ORR intermediates are observed during electrochemical ORR. At higher cathodic potential, the signatures of Fe(0) porphyrin, an important intermediate in H + and CO 2 reduction reactions, was observed at the electrode–water interface.},

This method, which we refer to as the spin mapping non-adiabatic RPMD (SM-NRPMD), is based on the spin-mapping formalism for the electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs) and ring polymer path-integral description for the nuclear DOFs. Using the Stratonovich–Weyl transform for the electronic DOFs and the Wigner transform for the nuclear DOFs, we derived an exact expression of the Kubo-transformed time-correlation function (TCF). We further derive the spin mapping non-adiabatic Matsubara dynamics using the Matsubara approximation that removes the high frequency nuclear normal modes in the TCF and derive the SM-NRPMD approach from the non-adiabatic Matsubara dynamics by discarding the imaginary part of the Liouvillian. The SM-NRPMD method has numerical advantages compared to the original NRPMD method based on the Meyer–Miller–Stock–Thoss (MMST) mapping formalism due to a more natural mapping using the SU ( N ) Lie Group that preserves the symmetry of the original system. We numerically compute the Kubo-transformed position auto-correlation function and electronic population correlation function for three-state model systems. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the SM-NRPMD method, which outperforms the original MMST-based NRPMD. We envision that the SM-NRPMD method will be a powerful approach to simulate electronic non-adiabatic dynamics and nuclear quantum effects accurately.},

  abstract = {The nonadiabatic phenomena, which are characterized by a strong coupling between electronic and nuclear motions, are ubiquitous. The nonadiabatic effect of the studied system can be significantly affected by the surrounding environment, such as solvents, in which such nonadiabatic process takes place. It is essential to develop the theoretical models to simulate these processes while accurately modeling the solvent environment. The time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is currently the most efficient approach to describe the electronic structures and dynamics of complex systems, while the polarizable continuum model (PCM) represents one of the most successful examples among continuum solvation models. Here, we formulate the first-order derivative couplings (DCs) between the ground and excited states as well as between two excited states by utilizing time-independent equation of motion formalism within the framework of both linear response and spin flip formulations of TDDFT/CPCM (the conductor-like PCM), and implement the analytical DCs into the Q-CHEM electronic structure software package. The analytic implementation is validated by the comparison of the analytical and finite-difference results, and reproducing geometric phase effect in the protonated formaldimine test case. Taking 4-( N , N -dimethylamino)benzonitrile and uracil in the gas phase and solution as an example, we demonstrate that the solvent effect is essential not only for the excitation energies of the low-lying excited-states but also for the DCs between these states. Finally, we calculate the internal conversion rate of benzophenone in a solvent with DC being used. The current implementation of analytical DCs together with the existing analytical gradient and Hessian of TDDFT/PCM excited states allows one to study the nonadiabatic effects of relatively large systems in solutions with low computational cost.},

  abstract = {Herein, we present a new method to efficiently calculate electronically excited states in large molecular assemblies, consisting of hundreds of molecules. For this purpose, we combine the long-range corrected tight-binding density functional fragment molecular orbital method (FMO-LC-DFTB) with an excitonic Hamiltonian, which is constructed in the basis of locally excited and charge-transfer configuration state functions calculated for embedded monomers and dimers and accounts explicitly for the electronic coupling between all types of excitons. We first evaluate both the accuracy and efficiency of our fragmentation approach for molecular dimers and aggregates by comparing it with the full LC-TD-DFTB method. The comparison of the calculated spectra of an anthracene cluster shows a very good agreement between our method and the LC-TD-DFTB reference. The effective computational scaling of our method has been explored for anthracene clusters and for perylene bisimide aggregates. We demonstrate the applicability of our method by the calculation of the excited state properties of pentacene crystal models consisting of up to 319 molecules. Furthermore, the participation ratio of the monomer fragments to the excited states is analyzed by the calculation of natural transition orbital participation numbers, which are verified by the hole and particle density for a chosen pentacene cluster. The use of our FMO-LC-TDDFTB method will allow for future studies of excitonic dynamics and charge transport to be performed on complex molecular systems consisting of thousands of atoms.},

The parameters have been obtained consistently from atomic SOC calculations using the density–functional theory.

  abstract = {In the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation, the total spin S and spin projection M are good quantum numbers. In contrast, spin symmetry is lost in the presence of spin-dependent interactions, such as spin–orbit couplings in relativistic Hamiltonians. Therefore, the relativistic density matrix renormalization group algorithm (R-DMRG) only employing particle number symmetry is much more expensive than nonrelativistic DMRG. In addition, artificial breaking of Kramers degeneracy can happen in the treatment of systems with an odd number of electrons. To overcome these issues, we propose time-reversal symmetry adaptation for R-DMRG. Since the time-reversal operator is antiunitary, this cannot be simply achieved in the usual way. We introduce a time-reversal symmetry-adapted renormalized basis and present strategies to maintain the structure of basis functions during the sweep optimization. With time-reversal symmetry adaptation, only half of the renormalized operators are needed, and the computational costs of Hamiltonian-wavefunction multiplication and renormalization are reduced by half. The present construction of the time-reversal symmetry-adapted basis also directly applies to other tensor network states without loops.},

The PBC-GEBF approach can help predict structures and properties of molecular crystals at different theory levels by performing molecular quantum chemistry calculations on a series of non-periodic subsystems constructed from the studied systems. A more rigorous formula of the forces on translational vectors of molecular crystals was proposed and implemented, enabling more reliable predictions of crystal structures. Our benchmark results on several typical molecular crystals show that the PBC-GEBF approach could reproduce the forces on atoms and the translational vectors and the optimized crystal structures from the corresponding conventional periodic methods. The improved PBC-GEBF approach is then applied to predict the crystal structures and vibrational spectra of two molecular crystals containing large molecules. The PBC-GEBF approach can provide a satisfactory description on the crystal structure of a molecular crystal containing 312 atoms in a unit cell at density-fitting second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory and density functional theory (DFT) levels and the infrared vibrational spectra of another molecular crystal containing 864 atoms in a unit cell at the DFT level.

Here, we have developed a first-principles method to determine exciton dispersion and exciton–phonon interaction in semiconducting and insulating solids based on time-dependent density functional theory. The first-principles method is formulated in planewave bases and pseudopotentials and can be used to compute exciton band structures, exciton charge density, ionic forces, the non-adiabatic coupling matrix between excitonic states, and the exciton–phonon coupling matrix. Based on the spinor formulation, the method enables self-consistent noncollinear calculations to capture spin-orbital coupling. Hybrid exchange-correlation functionals are incorporated to deal with long-range electron–hole interactions in solids. A sub-Hilbert space approximation is introduced to reduce the computational cost without loss of accuracy. For validations, we have applied the method to compute the exciton band structure and exciton–phonon coupling strength in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers; both agree very well with the previous GW-Bethe–Salpeter equation and experimental results. This development paves the way for accurate determinations of exciton dynamics in a wide range of solid-state materials.},

  abstract = {Learning pair interactions from experimental or simulation data is of great interest for molecular simulations. We propose a general stochastic method for learning pair interactions from data using differentiable simulations (DiffSim). DiffSim defines a loss function based on structural observables, such as the radial distribution function, through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The interaction potentials are then learned directly by stochastic gradient descent, using backpropagation to calculate the gradient of the structural loss metric with respect to the interaction potential through the MD simulation. This gradient-based method is flexible and can be configured to simulate and optimize multiple systems simultaneously. For example, it is possible to simultaneously learn potentials for different temperatures or for different compositions. We demonstrate the approach by recovering simple pair potentials, such as Lennard-Jones systems, from radial distribution functions. We find that DiffSim can be used to probe a wider functional space of pair potentials compared with traditional methods like iterative Boltzmann inversion. We show that our methods can be used to simultaneously fit potentials for simulations at different compositions and temperatures to improve the transferability of the learned potentials.},

While short from an instrumentation standpoint, these length and time scales remain long compared to microscopic molecular motions. Theoretical expressions are derived to infer experimentally measurable correlations from the two-body diffusion matrix appropriate for membrane-bound bodies coupled by hydrodynamic interactions. The temporal (and associated spatial) averaging resulting from finite acquisition times has the effect of washing out correlations as compared to naive predictions (i.e., the bare elements of the diffusion matrix), which would be expected to hold for instantaneous measurements. The theoretical predictions are shown to be in excellent agreement with Brownian dynamics simulations of experimental measurements. Numerical results suggest that the experimental measurement of membrane protein diffusion, in complement to lipid diffusion measurements, might help to resolve the experimental ambiguities encountered for certain black lipid membranes.},

We show, on the example of fitting of molecular potential energy surfaces of increasing dimensionality, the practical disappearance of the property of locality of a Gaussian-like kernel in high dimensionality.

In this work, we extend the MLEBF method to treat covalently bonded fragment ones. The main idea is cutting a target system into many fragments according to chemical properties. Fragments with dangling bonds are first saturated by chemical groups; then, saturated fragments, together with the original fragments without dangling bonds, are grouped into different layers. The accurate total energy expression is formulated with the many-body energy expansion theory, in combination with the inclusion–exclusion principle that is used to delete the contribution of chemical groups introduced to saturate dangling bonds. Specifically, in a two-layer MLEBF model, the photochemically active and inert layers are calculated with high-level and efficient electronic structure methods, respectively. Intralayer and interlayer energies can be truncated at the two- or three-body interaction level. Subsequently, through several systems, including neutral and charged covalently bonded fragment systems, we demonstrate that MLEBF can provide accurate ground- and excited-state energies and gradients. Finally, we realize the structure, conical intersection, and path optimizations by combining our MLEBF program with commercial and free packages, e.g., ASE and SciPy. These developments make MLEBF a practical and reliable tool for studying complex photochemical and photophysical processes of large nonbonded and bonded fragment systems.},

  abstract = {Ultracold-atom simulations of the Hubbard model provide insights into the character of charge and spin correlations in and out of equilibrium. The corresponding numerical simulations, on the other hand, remain a significant challenge. We build on recent progress in the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of electrons in continuous space and apply similar ideas to the square-lattice Hubbard model. We devise and benchmark two discrete-time QMC methods, namely the fermionic-propagator QMC (FPQMC) and the alternating-basis QMC (ABQMC). In FPQMC, the time evolution is represented by snapshots in real space, whereas the snapshots in ABQMC alternate between real and reciprocal space. The methods may be applied to study equilibrium properties within the grand-canonical or canonical ensemble, external field quenches, and even the evolution of pure states. Various real-space/reciprocal-space correlation functions are also within their reach. Both methods deal with matrices of size equal to the number of particles (thus independent of the number of orbitals or time slices), which allows for cheap updates. We benchmark the methods in relevant setups. In equilibrium, the FPQMC method is found to have an excellent average sign and, in some cases, yields correct results even with poor imaginary-time discretization. ABQMC has a significantly worse average sign, but also produces good results. Out of equilibrium, FPQMC suffers from a strong dynamical sign problem. On the contrary, in ABQMC, the sign problem is not time-dependent. Using ABQMC, we compute survival probabilities for several experimentally relevant pure states.},

  abstract = {Recently, Kohn–Sham (KS) methods with new correlation functionals, called σ -functionals, have been introduced. Technically, σ -functionals are closely related to the well-known random phase approximation (RPA); formally, σ -functionals are rooted in perturbation theory along the adiabatic connection. If employed in a post-self-consistent field manner in a Gaussian basis set framework, then, σ -functional methods are computationally very efficient. Moreover, for main group chemistry, σ -functionals are highly accurate and can compete with high-level wave-function methods. For reaction and transition state energies, e.g., chemical accuracy of 1 kcal/mol is reached. Here, we show how to calculate first derivatives of the total energy with respect to nuclear coordinates for methods using σ -functionals and then carry out geometry optimizations for test sets of main group molecules, transition metal compounds, and non-covalently bonded systems. For main group molecules, we additionally calculate vibrational frequencies. σ -Functional methods are found to yield very accurate geometries and vibrational frequencies for main group molecules superior not only to those from conventional KS methods but also to those from RPA methods. For geometries of transition metal compounds, not surprisingly, best geometries are found for RPA methods, while σ -functional methods yield somewhat less good results. This is attributed to the fact that in the optimization of σ -functionals, transition metal compounds could not be represented well due to the lack of reliable reference data. For non-covalently bonded systems, σ -functionals yield geometries of the same quality as the RPA or as conventional KS schemes combined with dispersion corrections.},

In addition, the thermal fluctuation of excitonic couplings from dynamic nuclear motion in an anthracene crystal with LC-OC-DFTB/SSR(4,4) shows a similar fluctuation of excitonic coupling and spectral density with those of first-principle calculations.

By means of this solution, we extend exact analytical calculations for the time-dependent classical Smoluchowski rate coefficient to the case that includes the so-called inertial effects, occurring in the host media with finite relaxation times. We also present a brief survey of Smoluchowski’s theory and its various subsequent refinements, including works devoted to the description of the short-time behavior of Brownian particles. In this paper, we managed to show that a known Rice’s formula, commonly recognized earlier as an exact reaction rate coefficient for the case of hyperbolic diffusion, turned out to be only its approximation being a uniform upper bound of the exact value. Here, the obtained formula seems to be of great significance for bridging a known gap between an analytically estimated rate coefficient on the one hand and molecular dynamics simulations together with experimentally observed results for the short times regime on the other hand. A particular emphasis has been placed on the rigorous mathematical treatment and important properties of the relevant initial boundary value problems in parabolic and hyperbolic diffusion theories.},

First, we defined a strategy to divide the Dirac–Fock operator into zero- and first-order terms. We then demonstrated that the first-order extended DK transformation, which is the Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation for the zero-order term, as well as the second- and third-order EDK and EIOTC, could be well defined. The EDK- and EIOTC-transformed Fock matrix, kinetic energy operator, nuclear attraction operator, and density matrix were derived. These equations were numerically evaluated, and it was found that these methods were accurate. In particular, EIOTC was consistent with the four-component approach. Four-component and extended two-component calculations are more expensive than non-relativistic calculations due to small-component-type two-electron integrals. We developed a new approximation formula, RIS-V, for small-component-type two-electron integrals, including the spin–orbit interaction between electrons. These results suggest that the RIS-V formula effectively accelerates the four-component and extended two-component methods.},

  abstract = {Density Functional Theory (DFT) sees prominent use in computational chemistry and physics; however, problems due to the self-interaction error (SIE) pose additional challenges to obtaining qualitatively correct results. As an unphysical energy an electron exerts on itself, the SIE impacts most practical DFT calculations. We conduct an in-depth analysis of the one-electron SIE in which we replicate delocalization effects for simple geometries. We present a simple visualization of such effects, which may help in future qualitative analysis of the one-electron SIE. By increasing the number of nuclei in a linear arrangement, the SIE increases dramatically. We also show how molecular shape impacts the SIE. Two- and three-dimensional shapes show an even greater SIE stemming mainly from the exchange functional with some error compensation from the one-electron error, which we previously defined [D. R. Lonsdale and L. Goerigk, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 22 , 15805 (2020)]. Most tested geometries are affected by the functional error, while some suffer from the density error. For the latter, we establish a potential connection with electrons being unequally delocalized by the DFT methods. We also show how the SIE increases if electrons occupy higher-lying atomic orbitals; seemingly one-electron SIE free methods in a ground are no longer SIE free in excited states, which is an important insight for some popular, non-empirical density functional approximations (DFAs). We conclude that the erratic behavior of the SIE in even the simplest geometries shows that robust DFAs are needed. Our test systems can be used as a future benchmark or contribute toward DFT development.},

The construction of metal–air batteries prefers using self-supporting catalysts with favorable activity as well as fast kinetics. However, it is challenging due to the limited electropositivity of metal-free catalysts for O–O bond formation in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), scaling relationship restrictions between OER and oxygen reduction reaction, and difficulty in porosity construction on the monolith electrode surface. In this contribution, through developing a facile methodology of quenching high-temperature carbon clothes in liquid nitrogen, a self-supported carbon cloth with bifunctional active graphene skin and fast kinetics is well constructed to serve as the air cathode in metal–air batteries. Regulated oxygen species and three-dimensionally hierarchical porosity are well constructed on the carbon fiber surfaces, contributing high intrinsic activity and prominently enhanced kinetics, which leads to favorable performances in aqueous as well as flexible rechargeable zinc–air batteries.

Here, we use femtosecond, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements of a cyanine dye, Cy5, to probe local conformations in samples of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA–Cy5), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA–Cy5), and Holliday junction DNA (HJ–DNA–Cy5). A line shape analysis of the 2D spectra reveals a strong excitation–emission correlation present in only the dsDNA–Cy5 complex, which is a signature of inhomogeneous broadening.

Using a combination of small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and rheology, we compared the physical properties of the suspensions with their structural behavior. Four surfactants were studied, all with the same hydrophobic tail length but different headgroups: hexaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether (C 12 EO 6 , nonionic), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, anionic), cocamidopropyl betaine (CapB, zwitterionic), and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB, cationic). Contrast variation SANS studies using deuterated version of C 12 EO 6 or SDS, or by varying the D 2 O/H 2 O ratio of the suspensions (with CapB), allowed focusing only on the structural properties of OCNFs or surfactant micelles. We showed that, in the concentration range studied, for C 12 EO 6 , although the nanofibrils are concentrated thanks to an excluded volume effect observed in SANS, the rheological properties of the suspensions are not affected. Addition of SDS or CapB induces gelation for surfactant concentrations superior to the critical micellar concentration (CMC). SANS results show that attractive interactions between OCNFs arise in the presence of these anionic or zwitterionic surfactants, hinting at depletion attraction as the main mechanism of gelation. Finally, addition of small amounts of DTAB (below the CMC) allows formation of a tough gel by adsorbing onto the OCNF surface.},

  abstract = {Tight-binding approaches, especially the Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB) and the extended tight-binding schemes, allow for efficient quantum mechanical simulations of large systems and long-time scales. They are derived from ab initio density functional theory using pragmatic approximations and some empirical terms, ensuring a fine balance between speed and accuracy. Their accuracy can be improved by tuning the empirical parameters using machine learning techniques, especially when information about the local environment of the atoms is incorporated. As the significant quantum mechanical contributions are still provided by the tight-binding models, and only short-ranged corrections are fitted, the learning procedure is typically shorter and more transferable as it were with predicting the quantum mechanical properties directly with machine learning without an underlying physically motivated model. As a further advantage, derived quantum mechanical quantities can be calculated based on the tight-binding model without the need for additional learning. We have developed the open-source framework—Tight-Binding Machine Learning Toolkit—which allows the easy implementation of such combined approaches. The toolkit currently contains layers for the DFTB method and an interface to the GFN1-xTB Hamiltonian, but due to its modular structure and its well-defined interfaces, additional atom-based schemes can be implemented easily. We are discussing the general structure of the framework, some essential implementation details, and several proof-of-concept applications demonstrating the perspectives of the combined methods and the functionality of the toolkit.},

  abstract = {Silica-based aerogels are a promising low-cost solution for improving the insulation efficiency of single-pane windows and reducing the energy consumption required for space heating and cooling. Two key material properties required are high porosity and small pore sizes, which lead to low thermal conductivity and high optical transparency, respectively. However, porosity and pore size are generally directly linked, where high porosity materials also have large pore sizes. This is unfavorable as large pores scatter light, resulting in reduced transmittance in the visible regime. In this work, we utilized preformed silica colloids to explore methods for reducing pore size while maintaining high porosity. The use of preformed colloids allows us to isolate the effect of solution conditions on porous gel network formation by eliminating simultaneous nanoparticle growth and aggregation found when using typical sol–gel molecular-based silica precursors. Specifically, we used in situ synchrotron-based small-angle x-ray scattering during gel formation to better understand how pH, concentration, and colloid size affect particle aggregation and pore structure. Ex situ characterization of dried gels demonstrates that peak pore widths can be reduced from 15 to 13 nm, accompanied by a narrowing of the overall pore size distribution, while maintaining porosities of 70\%–80\%. Optical transparency is found to increase with decreasing pore sizes while low thermal conductivities ranging from 95 +/− 13 mW/m K are maintained. Mechanical performance was found to depend primarily on effective density and did not show a significant dependence on solution conditions. Overall, our results provide insights into methods to preserve high porosity in nanoparticle-based aerogels while improving optical transparency.},

  abstract = {Conventional gas–liquid phase transitions feature a coexistence line that has a monotonic and positive slope in line with our intuition that cooling always leads to condensation. Here, we study the inverse phenomenon, condensation of adsorbed organic molecules into dense domains upon heating. Our considerations are motivated by recent experiments [Aeschlimann et al. , Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 60 , 19117–19122 (2021)], which demonstrate the partial dissolution of an ordered molecular monolayer and the mobilization of molecules upon cooling. We introduce a simple lattice model in which each site can have three states corresponding to unoccupied and two discernible molecular conformations. We investigate this model through Monte Carlo simulations, mean-field theory, and exact results based on the analytical solution of the Ising model in two dimensions. Our results should be broadly applicable to molecules with distinct conformations that have sufficiently different entropies or heat capacities.},

  abstract = {Simulations of water near extended hydrophobic spherical solutes have revealed the presence of a region of depleted density and accompanying enhanced density fluctuations. The physical origin of both phenomena has remained somewhat obscure. We investigate these effects employing a mesoscopic binding potential analysis, classical density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a simple Lennard-Jones solvent, and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations of a monatomic water (mw) model. We argue that the density depletion and enhanced fluctuations are near-critical phenomena. Specifically, we show that they can be viewed as remnants of the critical drying surface phase transition that occurs at bulk liquid–vapor coexistence in the macroscopic planar limit, i.e., as the solute radius R s → ∞ . Focusing on the radial density profile ρ ( r ) and a sensitive spatial measure of fluctuations, the local compressibility profile χ ( r ), our binding potential analysis provides explicit predictions for the manner in which the key features of ρ ( r ) and χ ( r ) scale with R s , the strength of solute–water attraction ɛ sf , and the deviation from liquid–vapor coexistence of the chemical potential, δμ . These scaling predictions are confirmed by our DFT calculations and GCMC simulations. As such, our theory provides a firm basis for understanding the physics of hydrophobic solvation.},

  abstract = {Protic ionic liquids (PILs), made from anhydrous mixtures of Bronsted acids HA and bases B (HA + B → BH + + A − ), occasionally suffer from limited ionicity. In cases of “poor” PILs (&lt;10\% ionicity, e.g., using carboxylic acids), past simulations have hinted that ion-pair association, more than incomplete proton transfer, is at fault. To improve upon the Fuoss equation for predicting the degree of ion pairing, new electrostatic equations (including induced dipoles) are presented, for ion-pair and other associations that occur in anhydrous amine/carboxylic acid mixtures. The equations present the association Gibbs energies ΔG A (and thus the association constants K A ) as functions of three fundamental properties: the acid/base mixing ratio (n = x A /x B ), the HA-to-B proton-transfer strength (ΔpK a,ε=78 ), and the dielectric constant (relative permittivity) of the mixture (ε). Parameter values were obtained from fits to constant-dielectric quantum chemistry data (obtained and presented here). These ΔG A functions were then used to predict ΔG ioniz values for the net ion-generating (autoionization) equilibrium in carboxylic acid/amine mixtures: 2 B ( H A ) n ⇄ B ( H A ) n − d H B + + A ( H A ) n + d − 1 − ⁠ , where n = x A /x B and d = degree of disproportionation. The agreement with experiment was excellent, demonstrating that these equations could have useful predictive power.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate prenucleation and heterogeneous nucleation in the liquid Pb/solid Al system as an example of systems with large lattice misfit using molecular dynamics simulation. Solid Pb and Al have a large positive lattice misfit ( f ) of 18.2\% along the densely packed [110] direction. This study reveals that prenucleation occurs at 600 K (an undercooling of 15 K), and a 2-dimensional (2D) ordered structure forms at the interface with a coincidence site lattice (CSL) between the first Pb and first Al layers. The CSL accommodates the major part of the f , and only a small residual lattice misfit ( f r ) of 1.9\% remains. The formation of the CSL transforms the original substrate into a considerably potent nucleant, where the first Pb layer becomes the new surface layer of the substrate. At an undercooling of about 22 K, nucleation proceeds by merging 2D ordered structure through structural templating: the second Pb layer is epitaxial to the CSL Pb layer, the third Pb layer largely accommodates the f r , and the fourth Pb layer is a nearly perfect crystalline plane. Further analysis indicates that the interface with the CSL has a lower interfacial energy than with a cube-to-cube orientation relationship. For the first time, we established that the CSL was an effective mechanism to accommodate the f for systems with a large positive misfits. Heterogeneous nucleation is governed not by a single mechanism (misfit dislocations in Turnbull’s model), but instead by various mechanisms depending on f . This study sheds new light on the atomistic mechanism of heterogeneous nucleation.},

Obtained by compressing aromatics around 20 GPa, they are characterized by potentially exceptional mechanical properties. The reaction mechanisms have been partly elucidated through computational studies and x-ray diffraction experiments. However, in all these studies, the electronic modifications to which the molecule is subjected with increasing pressure are neglected as also if, and to which extent, the electronic excited states are involved in the high-pressure reactivity. In fact, the pressure increase induces remarkable changes in the electronic properties of molecular crystals, which are often directly related to the reaction’s onset and path. We report the pressure evolution of the two-photon induced emission spectrum of crystalline stilbene, the archetype of a class of molecules from which double-core nanothreads are obtained, with the twofold purpose of gaining insight into the reaction mechanism and monitoring if the structural changes observed in x-ray diffraction studies have a detectable counterpart in the electronic properties of the system. The freezing of the spectral diffusion observed on rising pressure is ascribed to a hampered conformational rearrangement because of the larger stiffness of the local environment. The transition to the high pressure phase where the nanothreads form is revealed by the slope change of the pressure shift of all spectral components, while the progressive intensification with pressure of the 0-0 transition suggests a strengthening of the ethylenic bond favoring the charge delocalization on the benzene moieties, which is likely the trigger of the chemical instability.},

  abstract = {The ability of salts to change the macroscopic viscosity of their aqueous solutions is described by the Jones–Dole equation with B -coefficient for the linear concentration term. The sign and value of this coefficient are often considered as a measure of the salt’s structure-making/breaking ability, while the validity of this assignment is still under discussion. Here, by applying Raman and Brillouin scattering spectroscopy to various salts from the Hofmeister series, we studied a possible relation between macroscopic Jones–Dole’s B -coefficient and the microscopic dynamic response. Raman spectroscopy provides information about molecular vibrations and Brillouin spectroscopy about acoustic phonons with wavelengths of hundreds of nanometers. It has been found that Jones–Dole’s B -coefficient correlates linearly with the coefficients, describing the concentration dependences of the average OH stretching frequency, real and imaginary parts of gigahertz elastic modulus. These relationships have been interpreted to mean that the OH stretching frequency is a measure of the ion-induced changes in the water network that cause changes in both viscosity and gigahertz relaxation. Depolarized inelastic light scattering revealed that the addition of structure-making ions not only changes the frequency of the relaxation peak but also increases the low-frequency part of the relaxation susceptibility. It was shown that the ion-induced increase in the gigahertz elastic modulus can be described by changes in the relaxational susceptibility without a noticeable change in the instantaneous elastic modulus. The isotropic Raman contribution associated with the tetrahedral-like environment of H 2 O molecule does not correlate with Jones–Dole’s B -coefficient, suggesting a minor influence of these tetrahedral-like configurations on viscosity.},

High-quality single crystals were grown from melt microdroplets to determine the crystal structure by x-ray diffraction. Form 2 is metastable and exhibits a disordered structure. The crystal nucleation and growth kinetics of the two CMZ polymorphs were systematically measured. Form 2 nucleates and grows faster than the existing form (Form 1). The maximum nucleation rate of Forms 1 and 2 was observed at 50 °C (1.07 T g ). The summary of the maximum nucleation rate temperature of CMZ and the other six organic compounds indicates that nucleation near T g in the supercooled liquid is a useful approach to discovering new polymorphs. This study is relevant for the discovering new drug polymorphs through an understanding of nucleation and growth kinetics during melt crystallization.},

Various methods exist, that initiate structural recovery, such as changing the temperature or applying a strong, external static field. This work is concerned with high alternating electric fields and their suitability to study structural recovery and aging. The present work demonstrates that rationalizing the nonlinear dielectric response of a supercooled liquid to high-amplitude ac-fields requires multiple fictive temperatures. This feature is in stark contrast to structural recovery after a temperature down-jump or a considerable increase in the static electric field, for which a single parameter, the fictive temperature or material time, describes the structural change. In other words, the structural recovery from a high ac-field does not adhere to time aging–time superposition, which is so characteristic of genuine aging processes.},

It is a strenuous task to prepare nanofluidic devices, because a small misalignment leads to a significant alteration in various properties of the devices. Here, we focus on the rotational misalignment between two parallel graphene sheets. Using molecular dynamics simulation, we probe the structure and dynamics of monolayer water confined inside graphene nanochannels for a range of commensurate twist angles. With SPC/E and TIP4P/2005 water models, our simulations reveal the independence of the equilibrium number density— n ∼ 13 nm −2 for SPC/E and n ∼ 11.5 nm −2 for TIP4P/2005— across twists. Based on the respective densities of the water models, the structure and dielectric constant are invariant of twist angles. The confined water structure at this density shows square ice ordering for SPC/E water only. TIP4P/2005 shows ordering at the vicinity of a critical density ( n ∼ 12.5 nm −2 ). The average perpendicular dielectric constant of the confined water remains anomalously low ( ⁠ ∼ 2 for SPC/E and ∼ 6 for TIP4P/2005) for the studied twist angles. We find that the friction coefficient of confined water molecules varies for small twist angles, while becoming independent for twists greater than 5.1°. Our results indicate that a small, angular misalignment will not impair the dielectric properties of monolayer water within a graphene slit-pore, but can significantly influence its dynamics.},

We identify quantum states responsible for the precise detection of the magnetic field direction, taking into account the strongly axial hyperfine interactions of each radical in the radical pair. The contribution of these states to the formation of the cryptochrome signaling state sharply increases when the magnetic field becomes orthogonal to the hyperfine axis of either radical. Due to such a response, the radical pair may be able to detect the particular field direction normal to the plane containing the hyperfine axes of the radicals.},

Although studies have been conducted since their discovery, the synthesis of these species in the laboratory has ushered in a new wave of investigations of these structures, both theoretically and experimentally. In some of these theoretical studies, high-order corrections for correlation energy are included to account for the mid multi-reference character found in these systems. Many of these studies include a focus on kinetics; therefore, the calculated energies should be accurate (&lt;1 kcal/mol in error). In this research, we compute the enthalpies of formation for a small set of Criegee intermediates, including higher-order coupled cluster corrections for correlation energy up to coupled cluster with perturbative quintuple excitations. The enthalpies of formation for formaldehyde oxide, anti -acetaldehyde oxide, syn -acetaldehyde oxide, and acetone oxide are presented at 0 K as 26.5, 15.6, 12.2, and 0.1 kcal mol −1 , respectively. Additionally, we do not recommend the coupled cluster with perturbative quadruple excitations [CCSDT(Q)] energy correction, as it is approximately twice as large as that of the coupled cluster with full quadruple excitations (CCSDTQ). Half of the CCSDT(Q) energy correction may be included as a reliable, cost-effective estimation of CCSDTQ energies for Criegee intermediates.},

These transitions are induced by the couplings between the electronic states of the bound anionic system and the electron-detached system composed of the neutral molecule and the free electron. A discretization scheme for the detached system is introduced, and a set of formulas is derived that enable the approximate calculation of couplings between the bound and free-electron states. We demonstrate our method on the example of the anion of vinylidene, a high-energy isomer of acetylene, for which detailed experimental data are available. Our results provide information on the time scale of the autoionization process and give insight into the energetic and angular distribution of the ejected electrons, as well as the associated changes in the molecular geometry. We identify the formation of structures with reduced C–C bond lengths and T-like conformations through bending of the CH 2 group with respect to the C–C axis and point out the role of autoionization as a driving process for the isomerization to acetylene.},

  abstract = {A modified neglect of differential overlap has been parameterized specifically for water and its oligomers with the addition of polarization functions on both hydrogen and oxygen, Feynman dispersion, and a slight modification of the treatment of the hydrogen nucleus. The results show that it is possible to easily obtain good geometries and energies for hydrogen-bonded water aggregates. Data from the Benchmark Energy and Geometry Database water-cluster database were used to parameterize the new Hamiltonian for water clusters from the dimer to the decamer using MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ optimized geometries and CCSD(T)/CBS oligomerization energies. Seventy five oligomerization and rearrangement energies derived from the parameterization data are reproduced with a root mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.79 kcal mol −1 and the geometries of 38 oligomers with an RMSE of 0.17 Å. Interestingly, the Feynman dispersion term adopts a role different from that intended and tunes the atomic polarizability. The implications of these results in terms of future dedicated neglect of diatomic differential overlap Hamiltonians and those that use force-field-like atom types are discussed.},

  abstract = {The theoretical prediction of the rates of nonradiative processes in molecules is fundamental in assessing their emissive properties. In this context, global harmonic models have been widely used to simulate vibronic spectra as well as internal conversion rates and to predict photoluminescence quantum yields. However, these simplified models suffer from the limitations that are inherent to the harmonic approximation and can have a severe effect on the calculated internal conversion rates. Therefore, the development of more accurate semiclassical methods is highly desirable. Here, we introduce a procedure for the calculation of nonradiative rates in the framework of the time-dependent semi-classical Extended Thawed Gaussian Approximation (ETGA). We systematically investigate the performance of the ETGA method by comparing it to the adiabatic and vertical harmonic methods, which belong to the class of widely used global harmonic models. Its performance is tested in potentials that cannot be treated adequately by global harmonic models, beginning with Morse potentials of varying anharmonicity followed by a double well potential. The calculated radiative and nonradiative internal conversion rates are compared to reference values based on exact quantum dynamics. We find that the ETGA has the capability to predict internal conversion rates in anharmonic systems with an appreciable energy gap, whereas the global harmonic models prove to be insufficient.},

  abstract = {The first paper of this series [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034103 (2023)] demonstrated that excess entropy scaling holds for both fine-grained and corresponding coarse-grained (CG) systems. Despite its universality, a more exact determination of the scaling relationship was not possible due to the semi-empirical nature. In this second paper, an analytical excess entropy scaling relation is derived for bottom-up CG systems. At the single-site CG resolution, effective hard sphere systems are constructed that yield near-identical dynamical properties as the target CG systems by taking advantage of how hard sphere dynamics and excess entropy can be analytically expressed in terms of the liquid packing fraction. Inspired by classical equilibrium perturbation theories and recent advances in constructing hard sphere models for predicting activated dynamics of supercooled liquids, we propose a new approach for understanding the diffusion of molecular liquids in the normal regime using hard sphere reference fluids. The proposed “fluctuation matching” is designed to have the same amplitude of long wavelength density fluctuations (dimensionless compressibility) as the CG system. Utilizing the Enskog theory to derive an expression for hard sphere diffusion coefficients, a bridge between the CG dynamics and excess entropy is then established. The CG diffusion coefficient can be roughly estimated using various equations of the state, and an accurate prediction of accelerated CG dynamics at different temperatures is also possible in advance of running any CG simulation. By introducing another layer of coarsening, these findings provide a more rigorous method to assess excess entropy scaling and understand the accelerated CG dynamics of molecular fluids.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models facilitate an efficient exploration of complex systems by reducing the unnecessary degrees of freedom of the fine-grained (FG) system while recapitulating major structural correlations. Unlike structural properties, assessing dynamic properties in CG modeling is often unfeasible due to the accelerated dynamics of the CG models, which allows for more efficient structural sampling. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the present series of articles is to establish a better correspondence between the FG and CG dynamics. To assess and compare dynamical properties in the FG and the corresponding CG models, we utilize the excess entropy scaling relationship. For Paper I of this series, we provide evidence that the FG and the corresponding CG counterpart follow the same universal scaling relationship. By carefully reviewing and examining the literature, we develop a new theory to calculate excess entropies for the FG and CG systems while accounting for entropy representability. We demonstrate that the excess entropy scaling idea can be readily applied to liquid water and methanol systems at both the FG and CG resolutions. For both liquids, we reveal that the scaling exponents remain unchanged from the coarse-graining process, indicating that the scaling behavior is universal for the same underlying molecular systems. Combining this finding with the concept of mapping entropy in CG models, we show that the missing entropy plays an important role in accelerating the CG dynamics.},

  abstract = {One important problem in constructing the reduced dynamics of molecular systems is the accurate modeling of the non-Markovian behavior arising from the dynamics of unresolved variables. The main complication emerges from the lack of scale separations, where the reduced dynamics generally exhibits pronounced memory and non-white noise terms. We propose a data-driven approach to learn the reduced model of multi-dimensional resolved variables that faithfully retains the non-Markovian dynamics. Different from the common approaches based on the direct construction of the memory function, the present approach seeks a set of non-Markovian features that encode the history of the resolved variables and establishes a joint learning of the extended Markovian dynamics in terms of both the resolved variables and these features. The training is based on matching the evolution of the correlation functions of the extended variables that can be directly obtained from the ones of the resolved variables. The constructed model essentially approximates the multi-dimensional generalized Langevin equation and ensures numerical stability without empirical treatment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by constructing the reduced models of molecular systems in terms of both one-dimensional and four-dimensional resolved variables.},

  abstract = {For many laser-based methods of material characterization and analysis, a tensor formulation of theory is necessary, especially in techniques that exploit nonlinear or chiral optics. The fundamental interactions that underpin such methods offer various levels of approach to theory, but the most rigorous often lead to equations of considerable complexity. To compute the values for individual material parameters frequently demands making assumptions of extreme simplicity, overly dependent on calculational method, yet still providing unsatisfactory results. A pragmatic and entirely rigorous symmetry-based approach to the irreducible tensorial structures circumvents many of these problems, securing reliable results and guiding the pathway to applications. Instead of focusing on individual tensor components, such an approach can rapidly determine the number of linearly independent quantities—and hence the number of operationally different setups necessary for full characterization. By such means, one can directly ascertain how variations of optical polarization and beam geometry can reliably capture the response of any material system. The use of an irreducible tensor method operates independently of any means that might be chosen to calculate material properties. It removes the need for common simplifying assumptions, such as the approximation of tensorial structure by a scalar representation, adoption of a two-state model, or disregarding near-resonance damping. It also obviates any dependence on a choice of simulation package or quantum-calculational software. In this paper, the principles are set down and illustrated by application to experiments of varying degrees of complexity, including interactions of growing significance in the realm of chiral nonlinear optics. Limitations of this approach are also critically assessed.},

  abstract = {Spectral line shape models can successfully reproduce experimental Rayleigh-Brillouin spectra, but they need knowledge about the bulk viscosity η b . Light scattering involves GHz frequencies, but since η b is only documented at low frequencies, η b is usually left as a free parameter, which is determined by a fit of the model to an experimental spectrum. The question is whether models work so well because of this freedom. Moreover, for light scattering in air, spectral models view “air” as an effective molecule. We critically evaluate the use of η b as a fit parameter by comparing η b obtained from fits of the Tenti S6 model to the result of Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) for a mixture of Nitrogen and Oxygen. These simulations are used to compute light scattering spectra, which are then compared to experiments. The DSMC simulation parameters are cross-checked with a molecular dynamics simulation based on intermolecular potentials. At large values of the uniformity parameter y , y ≈ 4, where the Brillouin contribution to spectra is large, fitted η b are 20\% larger than the ones from DSMC, while the quality of the simulated spectra is comparable to that of the Tenti S6 line shape model. At smaller y , the difference between fitted and simulated η b can be as large as 100\%. We hypothesize the breakdown of the bulk viscosity concept to be the cause of this fallacy.},

Recently, it has been demonstrated that ultrafast 2D-IR spectroscopy allows the detection of the protein amide I band in H 2 O-based fluids, meaning that IR methods can now be applied to study proteins in physiologically relevant solvents. In this perspective, we describe the basis of the 2D-IR method for observing the protein amide I band in H 2 O and show how this development has the potential to impact areas ranging from our fundamental appreciation of protein structural dynamics to new applications for 2D-IR spectroscopy in the analytical and biomedical sciences. In addition, we discuss how the spectral response of water, rather than being a hindrance, now provides a basis for new approaches to data pre-processing, standardization of 2D-IR data collection, and signal quantification. Ultimately, we visualize a direction of travel toward the creation of 2D-IR spectral libraries that can be linked to advanced computational methods for use in high-throughput protein screening and disease diagnosis.},

Local hydrophobicity quantifies the presence and structure of water molecules at the interface, whereas “buried surface” reports on the available space for solvent. For simulations with Hb frozen in its T 0 and R 4 states, the correlation coefficient between LH and buried surface is 0.36 and 0.44, respectively, but it increases considerably if the 95\% confidence interval is used. The LH with Hb frozen and flexible changes little for most residues at the interfaces but is significantly altered for a few select ones: Thr41 α , Tyr42 α , Tyr140 α , Trp37 β , Glu101 β (for T 0 ) and Thr38 α , Tyr42 α , Tyr140 α (for R 4 ). The number of water molecules at the interface is found to increase by ∼ 25\% for T 0 → R 4 , which is consistent with earlier measurements. Since hydration is found to be essential to protein function, it is clear that hydration also plays an essential role in allostery.},

Following a quench from high temperature, where the colloids are essentially hard spheres, to a temperature below the gel point, the suspensions form gels that undergo aging characterized by a steadily increasing elastic shear modulus and slowing, increasingly constrained microscopic dynamics. The aging proceeds at a faster rate for stronger attraction strength. When the attraction strength is suddenly lowered during aging, the gel properties evolve non-monotonically in a manner resembling the Kovacs effect in glasses, in which the modulus decreases and the microscopic dynamics become less constrained for a period before more conventional aging resumes. Eventually, the properties of the gel following the decrease in attraction strength converge to those of a gel that has undergone aging at the lower attraction strength throughout. The time scale of this convergence increases as a power law with the age at which the attraction strength is decreased and decreases exponentially with the magnitude of the change in attraction. A model for gel aging in which particles attach and detach from the gel at rates that depend on their contact number reproduces these trends and reveals that the non-monotonic behavior results from the dispersion in the rates that the populations of particles with different contact number adjust to the new attraction strength.},

The approach combines two techniques: self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to predict the structure of the self-assembled, solvated membrane and on-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to model diffusion of solutes. Solvation is simulated in SCFT by constraining the glassy membrane matrix while relaxing the brush-like membrane pore coating against the solvent. The kMC simulations capture the resulting solute spatial distribution and concentration-dependent local diffusivity in the polymer-coated pores; we parameterize the latter using particle-based simulations. We apply our approach to simulate solute diffusion through nonequilibrium morphologies of a model triblock copolymer, and we correlate diffusivity with structural descriptors of the morphologies. We also compare the model’s predictions to alternative approaches based on simple lattice random walks and find our multiscale model to be more robust and systematic to parameterize. Our multiscale modeling approach is general and can be readily extended in the future to other chemistries, morphologies, and models for the local solute diffusivity and interactions with the membrane.},

  abstract = {The interplay of liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and dynamical arrest can lead to the formation of gels and glasses, which is relevant for such diverse fields as condensed matter physics, materials science, food engineering, and the pharmaceutical industry. In this context, protein solutions exhibit remarkable equilibrium and non-equilibrium behaviors. In the regime where attractive and repulsive forces compete, it has been demonstrated, for example, that the location of the dynamical arrest line seems to be independent of ionic strength, so that the arrest lines at different ionic screening lengths overlap, in contrast to the LLPS coexistence curves, which strongly depend on the salt concentration. In this work, we show that the same phenomenology can also be observed when the electrostatic repulsions are largely screened, and the range and strength of the attractions are varied. In particular, using lysozyme in brine as a model system, the metastable gas–liquid binodal and the dynamical arrest line as well as the second virial coefficient have been determined for various solution conditions by cloud-point measurements, optical microscopy, centrifugation experiments, and light scattering. With the aim of understanding this new experimental phenomenology, we apply the non-equilibrium self-consistent generalized Langevin equation theory to a simple model system with only excluded volume plus short-range attractions, to study the dependence of the predicted arrest lines on the range of the attractive interaction. The theoretical predictions find a good qualitative agreement with experiments when the range of the attraction is not too small compared with the size of the protein.},

  abstract = {Gelation offers a powerful strategy to assemble plasmonic nanocrystal networks incorporating both the distinctive optical properties of constituent building blocks and customizable collective properties. Beyond what a single-component assembly can offer, the characteristics of nanocrystal networks can be tuned in a broader range when two or more components are intimately combined. Here, we demonstrate mixed nanocrystal gel networks using thermoresponsive metal–terpyridine links that enable rapid gel assembly and disassembly with thermal cycling. Plasmonic indium oxide nanocrystals with different sizes, doping concentrations, and shapes are reliably intermixed in linked gel assemblies, exhibiting collective infrared absorption that reflects the contributions of each component while also deviating systematically from a linear combination of the spectra for single-component gels. We extend a many-bodied, mutual polarization method to simulate the optical response of mixed nanocrystal gels, reproducing the experimental trends with no free parameters and revealing that spectral deviations originate from cross-coupling between nanocrystals with distinct plasmonic properties. Our thermoreversible linking strategy directs the assembly of mixed nanocrystal gels with continuously tunable far- and near-field optical properties that are distinct from those of the building blocks or mixed close-packed structures.},

  abstract = {Compression and interpenetration of two opposing polymer brushes formed by end-grafted adsorption-active chains are studied by the numerical self-consistent field approach and by analytical theory. For sufficiently strong polymer–surface attraction, a fraction of chains in the adsorption-active brush condenses into a near-surface layer, while the remaining ones form the outer brush with reduced effective grafting density. Analysis shows that the normal pressure in adsorption-active brushes can be understood in terms of the effective grafting density concept although the pressure at small separations is affected by the presence of the dense adsorbed phase. We propose a simple theory modification that accounts for this effect. We also formulate a procedure for extracting the value of the effective grafting density directly from the pressure vs separation curves by inverting the equation of state. In contrast to the normal pressure, the interpenetration of the two opposing adsorption-active brushes demonstrates a much more intricate behavior. At weak to moderate compressions, the effective grafting density concept works well but fails spectacularly at small interbrush separations. We identify two interpenetration regimes for adsorption-active brushes: (i) at separations larger than the ideal Gaussian coil size N 1/2 , the overlap of the two brushes is concentrated in the mid-plane region, in the same way as in brushes grafted onto non-attractive surfaces; (ii) at separations less than N 1/2 , the brush overlap is strongly enhanced in the wall regions where the attractive interaction plays an important role both in generating the dense layer for the “proper” brush and in attracting the “foreign” chains.},

  abstract = {The motion of a colloidal probe in a viscoelastic fluid is described by friction or mobility, depending on whether the probe is moving with a velocity or feeling a force. While the Einstein relation describes an inverse relationship valid for Newtonian solvents, both concepts are generalized to time-dependent memory kernels in viscoelastic fluids. We theoretically and experimentally investigate their relation by considering two observables: the recoil after releasing a probe that was moved through the fluid and the equilibrium mean squared displacement (MSD). Applying concepts of linear response theory, we generalize Einstein’s relation and, thereby, relate recoil and MSD, which both provide access to the mobility kernel. With increasing concentration, however, MSD and recoil show distinct behaviors, rooted in different behaviors of the two kernels. Using two theoretical models, a linear two-bath particle model, and hard spheres treated by mode coupling theory, we find a Volterra relation between the two kernels, explaining differing timescales in friction and mobility kernels under variation of concentration.},

We introduce a particle-based, reactive model of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX) with molecular resolution utilizing generalized energy-conserving dissipative particle dynamics with reactions. The model is parameterized with respect to the data from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations as well as from quantum mechanical calculations, thus bridging atomic processes to the mesoscales, including microstructures and defects. It accurately captures the response of RDX under a range of thermal loading conditions compared to atomistic simulations. In addition, the Hugoniot response of the CG model in the overdriven regime reasonably matches atomistic simulations and experiments. Exploiting the model’s high computational efficiency, we investigate mesoscale systems involving millions of molecules and characterize size-dependent criticality of hotspots in RDX. The combination of accuracy and computational efficiency of our reactive model provides a tool for investigation of mesoscale phenomena, such as the role of microstructures and defects in the shock-to-deflagration transition, through particle-based simulation.},

We avoid the use of simple models for the bath and instead use density functional theory to compute all molecule–phonon interactions and the properties of the lattice phonons, for methane scattering from Ir(111). We find that while the large metal mass leads to long bath correlation times, these are not significantly longer than the time over which the reduced density matrix changes due to interactions with the bath. We show that the neglect of memory is reasonable and the use of the Redfield equation is justified. We also show how the commonly used rotating wave approximation is far too severe for this scattering problem. A less restrictive approximation that is nearly exact for our system gives an equation of motion in the Lindblad form. As a result, the Monte Carlo wave packet methods can be used to describe gas–phonon scattering, guaranteeing positivity, and with all couplings derived from first-principles.},

  abstract = {Dicationic ionic liquids (DILs) have been shown to be useful as an effective solvent for the absorption of CO 2 . However, compared to monocationic ionic liquids (MILs), they have been less investigated for this application. Previous studies on MIL–CO 2 systems have shown that anions play the main role in tuning CO 2 capture, but the partial negative charge on the oxygens of CO 2 may interact with cation centers and, especially, for DILs with two charge centers, the role of cations can be significant. Therefore, the current work focuses on how cation symmetry and the length of side chains affect interactions and also the dynamical and structural properties of DIL–CO 2 systems using molecular dynamics simulation. In addition, the effect of CO 2 on the infrared vibrational spectra of isolated ions and ion triplet (DIL molecules) was studied using density functional theory calculations and the observed red and blue shifts have been interpreted. The results indicated that symmetric cation with longer side chains tend to interact more strongly with CO 2 molecules. It seems that increasing the length of the side chains causes more bending of the middle chain, and in addition to increasing the free fraction volume, it weakens the interaction between cations and anions, and as a result more interaction between gas and cation. The results of this work may contribute to the rational molecular design of DILs for CO 2 capture, DIL-based gas sensors, etc.},

Ab initio electronic structure theory using the spin–orbit configuration interaction method is applied in a study of spectral transitions in PtCl 4 2− including counter-ion environmental effects. In this method, electronic wave functions are eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum operator belonging to one of the symmetry types of the molecular double group. PtCl 4 2− is investigated as a charged gas phase complex, a point-charge-neutralized complex, and a pseudopotential-neutralized complex.

Eight isomers could be formed, but only three were found to be thermodynamically stable relative to the first dissociation limit. We spectroscopically characterized the two lowest energy stable isomers, C 1–ClSSO and trans -ClSSO, using the accurate CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ method. The dipole moments of the two lowest energy stable isomers are predicted to be 1.90 and 1.60 debye, respectively. The C 1–ClSSO isomer is suitable for laser induced fluorescence detection since the lowest excited electronic states absorb in the visible, ∼610 nm, and near UV region, 330 nm. We mapped the evolution of the low-lying excited electronic states along the ClS, SS, and SO bond lengths to find that the production of ClS, SO, or S 2 O is plausible, whereas the production of ClS 2 is not allowed.},

The SCAP substrate and SERS nanoprobes were used to target and capture the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to form a sandwich structure on the Au film substrate, which can generate ultra-strong “hot spots” to achieve ultrasensitive detection. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was performed by monitoring changes in SERS peak intensity on a SCAP SERS substrate-based detection platform. This assay detects S protein with a LOD of less than 0.7 fg mL −1 and pseudovirus as low as 0.8 TU mL −1 in about 12 min. The results of the simulated oropharyngeal swab system in this study indicated the possibility of it being used for clinical detection, providing a potential option for rapid and accurate diagnosis and more effective control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.},

  abstract = {Although photothermal imaging was originally designed to detect individual molecules that do not emit or small nanoparticles that do not scatter, the technique is now being applied to image and spectroscopically characterize larger and more sophisticated nanoparticle structures that scatter light strongly. Extending photothermal measurements into this regime, however, requires revisiting fundamental assumptions made in the interpretation of the signal. Herein, we present a theoretical analysis of the wavelength-resolved photothermal image and its extension to the large particle scattering regime, where we find the photothermal signal to inherit a nonlinear dependence upon pump intensity, together with a contraction of the full-width-at-half-maximum of its point spread function. We further analyze theoretically the extent to which photothermal spectra can be interpreted as an absorption spectrum measure, with deviations between the two becoming more prominent with increasing pump intensities. Companion experiments on individual 10, 20, and 100 nm radius gold nanoparticles evidence the predicted nonlinear pump power dependence and image contraction, verifying the theory and demonstrating new aspects of photothermal imaging relevant to a broader class of targets.},

Here, we present a visible white light continuum-based fMES spectrometer and systematically explore the sensitivity enhancement expected from fluorescence detection. As a demonstration of sensitivity, we report room temperature two-dimensional coherence maps of vibrational quantum coherences in a laser dye at optical densities of ∼2–3 orders of magnitude lower than conventional approaches. This high sensitivity is enabled by a combination of biased sampling along the optical coherence time axes and a rapid scan of the pump–probe waiting time T at each sample. A combination of this approach with acousto-optic phase modulation and phase-sensitive lock-in detection enables measurements of room temperature vibrational wavepackets even at the lowest ODs. Alternative faster data collection schemes, which are enabled by the flexibility of choosing a non-uniform undersampled grid in the continuous T scanning approach, are also demonstrated.},

Examined over “ safe ” excitations of the QUESTDB set, ωB88PTPSS performs quite well for open-shell systems, correctly and fairly accurately [relative to equation-of-motion coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) reference] predicts negative gaps for 50 systems with inverted singlet–triplet gaps, and is one of the leading performers for intramolecular charge-transfer excitations and achieves near-second-order approximate coupled cluster (CC2) and second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction quality for the Q1 and Q2 subsets. Subsequently, we tested ωB88PTPSS on two sets of real-life examples from recent computational chemistry literature–the low energy bands of chlorophyll a (Chl a ) and a set of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) systems. For Chl a , ωB88PTPSS qualitatively and quantitatively achieves DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD-level performance and provides excellent agreement with experiment. For TADF systems, ωB88PTPSS agrees quite well with spin-component-scaled CC2 (SCS-CC2) excitation energies, as well as experimental values, for the gaps between the S 1 and T 1 excited states.},

We also find that a preconditioned QCLE can outperform the standard QCLE in certain cases, highlighting the fact that there is no unique QCLE. Finally, we also point out that one can construct a mean-field Ehrenfest algorithm using a phase-space representation similar to what is done for PSSH.

  abstract = {Saturation of electron magnetization by microwave irradiation under magic-angle spinning (MAS) is studied theoretically. The saturation is essential for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhancement of nuclear magnetic resonance signals. For a spin with a large g -anisotropy and a long T 1 relative to the rotor period, the sample rotation distributes saturation to the whole powder sample spectrum. Analytical expressions for the saturation and frequency profiles are obtained. For a pair of coupled electrons such as those in bis-nitroxides, which are commonly used for MAS DNP, an e l – e r model (where e l and e r stand for electrons on the left and the right, respectively, in their spectral positions) is introduced to simplify the analysis of a coupled two-spin system under MAS. For such a system, strong electron couplings exchange magnetization during dipolar/ J rotor events when the two electron frequencies cross each other. The exchange is equivalent to a swap of the e l and e r electrons. This allows for the treatment of a coupled spin pair as two independent spins such that an analytical solution can be obtained for the steady-state magnetization and the difference between the two electrons. The theoretical study with its analytical result provides a simple physical picture of electron saturation under MAS and of how radical properties and experimental parameters affect cross-effect DNP. The effects of depolarization and the extension to more coupled electron spins are also discussed using this approach.},

  abstract = {Path sampling allows the study of rare events, such as chemical reactions, nucleation, and protein folding, via a Monte Carlo (MC) exploration in path space. Instead of configuration points, this method samples short molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories with specific start- and end-conditions. As in configuration MC, its efficiency highly depends on the types of MC moves. Since the last two decades, the central MC move for path sampling has been the so-called shooting move in which a perturbed phase point of the old path is propagated backward and forward in time to generate a new path. Recently, we proposed the subtrajectory moves, stone-skipping (SS) and web-throwing, that are demonstrably more efficient. However, the one-step crossing requirement makes them somewhat more difficult to implement in combination with external MD programs or when the order parameter determination is expensive. In this article, we present strategies to address the issue. The most generic solution is a new member of subtrajectory moves, wire fencing (WF), that is less thrifty than the SS but more versatile. This makes it easier to link path sampling codes with external MD packages and provides a practical solution for cases where the calculation of the order parameter is expensive or not a simple function of geometry. We demonstrate the WF move in a double-well Langevin model, a thin film breaking transition based on classical force fields, and a smaller ruthenium redox reaction at the ab initio level in which the order parameter explicitly depends on the electron density.},

  abstract = {We present a molecular geometry optimization algorithm based on the gradient-enhanced universal kriging (GEUK) formalism with ab initio prior mean functions, which incorporates prior physical knowledge to surrogate-based optimization. In this formalism, we have demonstrated the advantage of allowing the prior mean functions to be adaptive during geometry optimization over a pre-fixed choice of prior functions. Our implementation is general and flexible in two senses. First, the optimizations on the surrogate surface can be in both Cartesian coordinates and curvilinear coordinates. We explore four representative curvilinear coordinates in this work, including the redundant Coulombic coordinates, the redundant internal coordinates, the non-redundant delocalized internal coordinates, and the non-redundant hybrid delocalized internal Z-matrix coordinates. We show that our GEUK optimizer accelerates geometry optimization as compared to conventional non-surrogate-based optimizers in internal coordinates. We further showcase the power of the GEUK with on-the-fly adaptive priors for efficient optimizations of challenging molecules (Criegee intermediates) with a high-accuracy electronic structure method (the coupled-cluster method). Second, we present the usage of internal coordinates under the complete curvilinear scheme. A complete curvilinear scheme performs both surrogate potential-energy surface (PES) fitting and structure optimization entirely in the curvilinear coordinates. Our benchmark indicates that the complete curvilinear scheme significantly reduces the cost of structure minimization on the surrogate compared to the incomplete curvilinear scheme, which fits the surrogate PES in curvilinear coordinates partially and optimizes a structure in Cartesian coordinates through curvilinear coordinates via the chain rule.},

Still, these techniques often rely on the localization of the density matrix or accurate embedding approaches, limiting their applicability. In contrast, stochastic density functional theory (sDFT) achieves linear- and sub-linear scaling by statistically sampling the ground state density without relying on embedding or imposing localization. In return, ground state observables, such as the forces on the nuclei, fluctuate in sDFT, making optimizing the nuclear structure a highly non-trivial problem. In this work, we combine the most recent noise-reduction schemes for sDFT with stochastic optimization algorithms to perform structure optimization within sDFT. We compare the performance of the stochastic gradient descent approach and its variations (stochastic gradient descent with momentum) with stochastic optimization techniques that rely on the Hessian, such as the stochastic Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm. We further provide a detailed assessment of the computational efficiency and its dependence on the optimization parameters of each method for determining the ground state structure of bulk silicon with varying supercell dimensions.},

The computational efficiency of TDADFT is benchmarked with four sets of molecules comprising alkanes, fullerenes, DNA fragments, and zeolites. The results show that TDADFT has a computational scaling between 1.3 and 1.9 with respect to the number of basis functions, which is lower than the scaling of standard time-dependent density functional theory. Due to its computational simplifications, TDADFT is particularly well suited for Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations.

  abstract = {Efficient energy transport in photosynthetic antenna is a long-standing source of inspiration for artificial light harvesting materials. However, characterizing the excited states of the constituent chromophores poses a considerable challenge to mainstream quantum chemical and semiempirical excited state methods due to their size and complexity and the accuracy required to describe small but functionally important changes in their properties. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to calculating the excited states of large biochromophores, exemplified by a specific method for calculating the Q y transition of bacteriochlorophyll a , which we name Chl-xTB. Using a diagonally dominant approximation to the Casida equation and a bespoke parameterization scheme, Chl-xTB can match time-dependent density functional theory’s accuracy and semiempirical speed for calculating the potential energy surfaces and absorption spectra of chlorophylls. We demonstrate that Chl-xTB (and other prospective realizations of our protocol) can be integrated into multiscale models, including concurrent excitonic and point-charge embedding frameworks, enabling the analysis of biochromophore networks in a native environment. We exploit this capability to probe the low-frequency spectral densities of excitonic energies and interchromophore interactions in the light harvesting antenna protein LH2 (light harvesting complex 2). The impact of low-frequency protein motion on interchromophore coupling and exciton transport has routinely been ignored due to the prohibitive costs of including it in simulations. Our results provide a more rigorous basis for continued use of this approximation by demonstrating that exciton transition energies are unaffected by low-frequency vibrational coupling to exciton interaction energies.},

  abstract = {Simulating the unitary dynamics of a quantum system is a fundamental problem of quantum mechanics, in which quantum computers are believed to have significant advantage over their classical counterparts. One prominent such instance is the simulation of electronic dynamics, which plays an essential role in chemical reactions, non-equilibrium dynamics, and material design. These systems are time- dependent , which requires that the corresponding simulation algorithm can be successfully concatenated with itself over different time intervals to reproduce the overall coherent quantum dynamics of the system. In this paper, we quantify such simulation algorithms by the property of being fully-coherent : the algorithm succeeds with arbitrarily high success probability 1 − δ while only requiring a single copy of the initial state. We subsequently develop fully-coherent simulation algorithms based on quantum signal processing (QSP), including a novel algorithm that circumvents the use of amplitude amplification while also achieving a query complexity additive in time t , ln(1/ δ ), and ln(1/ ϵ ) for error tolerance ϵ : Θ ‖ H ‖ | t | + ln ( 1 / ϵ ) + ln ( 1 / δ ) ⁠ . Furthermore, we numerically analyze these algorithms by applying them to the simulation of the spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model and the correlated electronic dynamics of an H 2 molecule. Since any electronic Hamiltonian can be mapped to a spin Hamiltonian, our algorithm can efficiently simulate time-dependent ab initio electronic dynamics in the circuit model of quantum computation. Accordingly, it is also our hope that the present work serves as a bridge between QSP-based quantum algorithms and chemical dynamics, stimulating a cross-fertilization between these exciting fields.},

  abstract = {From coupled-cluster singles and doubles model including connected triples corrections [CCSD(T)] calculations on the water dimer and B97D/CC on the water-circumcoronene complex at a large number of randomly generated conformations, interaction potentials for the physisorption of water on graphene are built, accomplishing almost sub-chemical accuracy. The force fields were constructed by decomposing the interaction into electrostatic and van der Waals contributions, the latter represented through improved Lennard-Jones potentials. Besides, a Chemistry at Harvard Macromolecular Mechanics (CHARMM)-like term was included in the water–water potential to improve the description of hydrogen bonds, and an induction term was added to model the polarization effects in the interaction between water and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or graphene. Two schemes with three and six point charges were considered for the interactions water–water and water-PAH, as Coulomb contributions are zero in the water-graphene system. The proposed fitted potentials reproduce the ab initio data used to build them in the whole range of distances and conformations and provide results for selected points very close to CCSD(T) benchmarks. When applied to the water-graphene system, the obtained results are in excellent agreement with p-CCSD(T), revised symmetry-adapted perturbation theory based on density functional theory monomer properties (DFT-SAPT), and diffusion Monte Carlo reference values. Furthermore, the stability of the various conformers water-PAH and water-graphene, as well as the different trends observed between these systems are rationalized in terms of the modifications of the electrostatic contribution.},

In the low-energy regime, the long-range tail of the three-body potential dictates the fate of the reaction and the main reaction product. On the contrary, in the high-energy regime, the short-range of atom–atom and atom–ion interaction potential dominate the dynamics, enhancing molecular formation.},

This methodology generates accurate predictions for molecule size distributions for a variety of initial chemical compositions and temperatures ranging from 3200 to 5000 K. Specifically, we show that the size distribution of small molecules is particularly well predicted, and the size of the largest molecule can be accurately predicted provided that this molecule is not too large.},

Combining ab initio QM/MM methods and periodic boundary conditions (PBC) is currently the optimal approach for modeling chemical processes in an infinite environment, but frequently, these models are too time-consuming for general applicability to biological systems in a solution. Here, we define a simple and efficient electrostatic embedding QM/MM model in PBC, combining the benefits of electrostatic potential fitted atomic charges and particle-mesh Ewald sums, which can efficiently treat systems of an arbitrary size at a reasonable computational cost. To illustrate this, we apply our scheme to extract the lowest singlet excitation energies from a model for Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 1 containing circa 93 000 atoms, accurately reproducing the experimental absorption maximum.},

We discuss theoretical tools that can help us understand and therefore improve on cell performance. One theory is able to describe all aspects of the energy conversion: nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We recommend to use the theory with operationally defined, independent variables, as others have done before. These describe well-defined experiments. Three invariance criteria serve as a basis for any description: of local electroneutrality, entropy production invariance, and emf ’s independence of the frame of reference. Alternative formalisms, using different sets of variables, start with ionic or neutral components. We show that the heat flux is not the same in the two formalisms and derive a new relationship between the heat fluxes. The heat flux enters the definition of the Peltier coefficient and is essential for the understanding of the Peltier heat at the electrode interfaces and of the Seebeck coefficient of the cell. The Soret effect can occur independently of any Seebeck effect, but the Seebeck effect will be affected by the presence of a Soret effect. Common misunderstandings are pointed out. Peltier coefficients are needed for the interpretation and design of experiments.},

We find that the local nature of Q x excitation enables identification of molecular properties of the delocalized Q y excitons. Specifically, we demonstrate that the cross-peak region, where excitation energy is resonant with Q y while detection is at Q x , contains specific spectral signatures that can reveal the full real-space molecular Hamiltonian, a task that is impossible by considering the Q y transitions alone. System–bath coupling and site energy disorder in realistic systems may limit the resolution of these spectral signatures due to spectral congestion.},

  abstract = {The ribosomal exit tunnel is the primary structure affecting the release of nascent proteins at the ribosome. The ribosomal exit tunnels from different species have elements of conservation and differentiation in structural and physico-chemical properties. In this study, by simulating the elongation and escape processes of nascent proteins at the ribosomal exit tunnels of four different organisms, we show that the escape process has conserved mechanisms across the domains of life. Specifically, it is found that the escape process of proteins follows the diffusion mechanism given by a simple diffusion model, and the median escape time positively correlates with the number of hydrophobic residues and the net charge of a protein for all the exit tunnels considered. These properties hold for 12 distinct proteins considered in two slightly different and improved Gō-like models. It is also found that the differences in physico-chemical properties of the tunnels lead to quantitative differences in the protein escape times. In particular, the relatively strong hydrophobicity of E. coli ’s tunnel and the unusually high number of negatively charged amino acids on the tunnel’s surface of H. marismortui lead to substantially slower escapes of proteins at these tunnels than at those of S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens .},

We investigate the relationship between rates of energy transfer across polar and nonpolar contacts and contact dynamics for the β 2 -adrenergic receptor, a rhodopsin-like G-protein coupled receptor, in an antagonist-bound inactive state and agonist-bound active state. From structures sampled during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find the active state to have, on average, a lower packing density, corresponding to generally more flexibility and greater entropy than the inactive state. Energy exchange networks (EENs) are computed for the inactive and active states from the results of the MD simulations. From the EENs, changes in the rates of energy transfer across polar and nonpolar contacts are found for contacts that remain largely intact during activation. Change in dynamics of the contact, and entropy associated with the dynamics, can be estimated from the change in rates of energy transfer across the contacts. Measurement of change in the rates of energy transfer before and after the transition between states thereby provides information about dynamic contributions to activation and allostery.},

  abstract = {Phase transitions of proteins are strongly influenced by surface chemical modifications or mutations. Human γD-crystallin (HGD) single-mutants have been extensively studied because they are associated with the onset of juvenile cataract. However, they have also provided a rich library of molecules to examine how specific inter-protein interactions direct protein assembly, providing new insights and valuable experimental data for coarse-grained patchy-particle models. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of new inter-protein interactions by mutagenesis is additive and increases the number and variety of condensed phases formed by proteins. When double mutations incorporating two specific single point mutations are made, the properties of both single mutations are retained in addition to the formation of a new condensed phase. We find that the HGD double-mutant P23VC110M self-assembles into spherical particles with retrograde solubility, orthorhombic crystals, and needle/plate shape crystals, while retaining the ability to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation. This rich polymorphism is only partially predicted by the experimental data on the constituent single mutants. We also report a previously un-characterized amorphous protein particle, with unique properties that differ from those of protein spherulites, protein particulates previously described. The particles we observe are amorphous, reversible with temperature, tens of microns in size, and perfectly spherical. When they are grown on pristine surfaces, they appear to form by homogeneous nucleation, making them unique, and we believe a new form of protein condensate. This work highlights the challenges in predicting protein behavior, which has frustrated rational assembly and crystallization but also provides rich data to develop new coarse-grained models to explain the observed polymorphism.},

  abstract = {Interplay of Coulomb interaction energy, free ion entropy, and conformational elasticity is a fascinating aspect in polyelectrolytes (PEs). We develop a theory for complexation of two oppositely charged PEs, a process known to be the precursor to the formation of complex coacervates in PE solutions, to explore the underlying thermodynamics of complex formation, at low salts. The theory considers general degrees of solvent polarity and dielectricity within an implicit solvent model, incorporating a varying Coulomb strength. Explicit calculation of the free energy of complexation and its components indicates that the entropy of free counterions and salt ions and the Coulomb enthalpy of bound ion-pairs dictate the equilibrium of PE complexation. This helps decouple the self-consistent dependency of charge and size of the uncomplexed parts of the polyions, derive an analytical expression for charge, and evaluate the free energy components as functions of chain overlap. Complexation is observed to be driven by enthalpy gain at low Coulomb strengths, driven by entropy gain of released counterions but opposed by enthalpy loss due to reduction of ion-pairs at moderate Coulomb strengths, and progressively less favorable due to enthalpy loss at even higher Coulomb strengths. The total free energy of the system is found to decrease linearly with an overlap of chains. Thermodynamic predictions from our model are in good quantitative agreement with simulations in literature.},

  abstract = {Lyotropic liquid crystal phases (LCPs) are widely studied for diverse applications, including protein crystallization and drug delivery. The structure and properties of LCPs vary widely depending on the composition, concentration, temperature, pH, and pressure. High-throughput structural characterization approaches, such as small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), are important to cover meaningfully large compositional spaces. However, high-throughput LCP phase analysis for SAXS data is currently lacking, particularly for patterns of multiphase mixtures. In this paper, we develop semi-automated software for high throughput LCP phase identification from SAXS data. We validate the accuracy and time-savings of this software on a total of 668 SAXS patterns for the LCPs of the amphiphile hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in 53 acidic or basic ionic liquid derived solvents, within a temperature range of 25–75 °C. The solvents were derived from stoichiometric ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) or ethanolammonium nitrate (EtAN) by adding water to vary the ionicity, and adding precursor ions of ethylamine, ethanolamine, and nitric acid to vary the pH. The thermal stability ranges and lattice parameters for CTAB-based LCPs obtained from the semi-automated analysis showed equivalent accuracy to manual analysis, the results of which were previously published. A time comparison of 40 CTAB systems demonstrated that the automated phase identification procedure was more than 20 times faster than manual analysis. Moreover, the high throughput identification procedure was also applied to 300 unpublished scattering patterns of sodium dodecyl-sulfate in the same EAN and EtAN based solvents in this study, to construct phase diagrams that exhibit phase transitions from micellar, to hexagonal, cubic, and lamellar LCPs. The accuracy and significantly low analysis time of the high throughput identification procedure validates a new, rapid, unrestricted analytical method for the determination of LCPs.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical investigation of the design of a new actuator type made of anisotropic colloidal particles grafted with stimuli-responsive polymer chains. These artificial muscles combine the osmotic actuation principle of stimuli-responsive hydrogels with the structural alignment of colloidal liquid crystals to achieve directional motion. The solubility of the stimuli-responsive polymer in the neutral state, its degree of polymerization, the salt concentration, and the grafting density of the polymer chains on the surface of the colloidal particles are investigated and identified as important for actuator performance and tunability. The computational results suggest that the proposed mechanically active material matches or exceeds the performances of natural muscles and provide the guidelines for the realization of artificial muscles with predetermined actuation properties.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art 6D quantum dynamics simulations for the dissociative chemisorption of H 2 on a thermally distorted Cu(111) surface, using the static corrugation model, were analyzed to produce several (experimentally available) observables. The expected error, especially important for lower reaction probabilities, was quantified using wavepackets on several different grids as well as two different analysis approaches to obtain more accurate results in the region where a slow reaction channel was experimentally shown to be dominant. The lowest reaction barrier sites for different thermally distorted surface slabs are shown to not just be energetically, but also geometrically, different between surface configurations, which can be used to explain several dynamical effects found when including surface temperature effects. Direct comparison of simulated time-of-flight spectra to those obtained from state-of-the-art desorption experiments showed much improved agreement compared to the perfect lattice BOSS approach. Agreement with experimental rotational and vibrational efficacies also somewhat improved when thermally excited surfaces were included in the theoretical model. Finally, we present clear quantum effects in the rotational quadrupole alignment parameters found for the lower rotationally excited states, which underlines the importance of careful quantum dynamical analyses of this system.},

  abstract = {Surface platinum hydride structures may exist and play a potentially important role during electrocatalysis and cathodic corrosion of Pt(111). Earlier work on platinum hydrides suggests that Pt may form clusters with multiple equivalents of hydrogen. Here, using thermodynamic methods and density functional theory, we compared several surface hydride structures on Pt(111). The structures contain multiple monolayers of hydrogen in or near the surface Pt layer. The hydrogen in these structures may bind the subsurface or reconstruct the surface both in the set of initial configurations and in the resulting (meta)stable structures. Multilayer stable configurations share one monolayer of subsurface H stacking between the top two Pt layers. The structure containing two monolayers (MLs) of H is formed at −0.29 V vs normal hydrogen electrode, is locally stable with respect to configurations with similar H densities, and binds H neutrally. Structures with 3 and 4 ML H form at −0.36 and −0.44 V, respectively, which correspond reasonably well to the experimental onset potential of cathodic corrosion on Pt(111). For the 3 ML configuration, the top Pt layer is reconstructed by interstitial H atoms to form a well-ordered structure with Pt atoms surrounded by four, five, or six H atoms in roughly square-planar and octahedral coordination patterns. Our work provides insight into the operando surface state during low-potential reduction reactions on Pt(111) and shows a plausible precursor for cathodic corrosion.},

  abstract = {Ion transport in solids is a key topic in solid-state ionics. It is critical but challenging to understand the relationship between material structures and ion transport. Nanochannels in crystals provide ion transport pathways, which are responsible for the fast ion transport in fast lithium (Li)-ion conductors. The controlled synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) provides a promising approach to artificially regulating nanochannels. Herein, the CNTs with a diameter of 5.5 Å are predicted to exhibit an ultralow Li-ion diffusion barrier of about 10 meV, much lower than those in routine solid electrolyte materials. Such a characteristic is attributed to the similar chemical environment of a Li ion during its diffusion based on atomic and electronic structure analyses. The concerted diffusion of Li ions ensures high ionic conductivities of CNTs. These results not only reveal the immense potential of CNTs for fast Li-ion transport but also provide a new understanding for rationally designing solid materials with high ionic conductivities.},

Probing the behavior of molecular species at the electrochemical interfaces they form is paramount to understanding redox reaction mechanisms. Combining surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with electrochemical methods offers a powerful way to explore such mechanisms, but carbon itself is not a SERS activating substrate. Here, we report on a hybrid substrate consisting of single- or few-layer graphene sheets deposited over immobilized silver nanoparticles, which allows for simultaneous SERS and electrochemical investigation. To demonstrate the viability of our substrate, we adsorbed anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate to graphene and studied its redox response simultaneously using SERS and cyclic voltammetry in acidic solutions. We identified spectral changes consistent with the reversible redox of the quinone/hydroquinone pair. The SERS intensities on bare silver and hybrid substrates were of the same order of magnitude, while no discernible signals were observed over bare graphene, confirming the SERS effect on adsorbed molecules. This work provides new prospects for exploring and understanding electrochemical processes in situ at graphitic carbon electrodes.},

  abstract = {Trapped ultracold alkali-metal atoms can be used to measure pressure in the ultra-high-vacuum and XHV pressure regimes, those with p &lt; 10 −6 Pa. This application for ultracold atoms relies on precise knowledge of collision rate coefficients of alkali-metal atoms with residual room-temperature atoms and molecules in the ambient vacuum or with deliberately introduced gasses. Here, we determine combined elastic and inelastic rate coefficients as well as glancing-angle rate coefficients for ultracold 7 Li and 87 Rb with room-temperature noble gas atoms as well as H 2 and 14 N 2 molecules. Glancing collisions are those processes where only little momentum is transferred to the alkali-metal atom and this atom is not ejected from its trap. Rate coefficients are found by performing quantum close-coupling scattering calculations using ab initio ground-state electronic Born–Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces. The potentials for Li and Rb with noble gas atoms and also for Rb( 2 S)–H 2 (X Σ g + ⁠ ) and Rb( 2 S)–N 2 (X 1 Σ g + ⁠ ) systems are based on the non-relativistic spin-restricted coupled-cluster method with single, double, and noniterative triple excitations [RCCSD(T)]. For Li( 2 S)–N 2 (X 1 Σ g + ⁠ ), the potential is computed at the explicitly correlated spin-restricted RCCSD(T)-F12 level. For Rb, Kr, and Xe atoms, scalar relativistic corrections to the core electrons have been included, while second-order spin–orbit corrections from the valence electrons have been estimated. Data for Li–H 2 and Li–He were taken from the existing literature. We estimate standard uncertainties of the rate coefficients by comparing rate coefficients calculated using potentials found with electronic basis sets of increasing size, including estimates of relativistic spin–orbit corrections and the uncertainty of the van der Waals coefficients. The relative uncertainties of rate coefficients are 1\%–2\% with the exception of 7 Li or 87 Rb colliding with 20 Ne. Those have relative uncertainties of 9\% and 8\%, respectively. We also show that a commonly used semiclassical approximation for the total elastic rate coefficient agrees with the quantum calculations to 10\% with the exception of 7 Li and 87 Rb collisions with H 2 , where the semiclassical value underestimates the quantum value by 20\%.},

Analyses based on these quantities and the critical points of the 1-RDM performed on two charge-shift bonds show that although they share common features, there are fundamental differences in these interactions that are detected neither by density-based analysis nor by valence bond theory.

  abstract = {Single atom alloy AgCu catalysts have attracted great attention, since doping the single Cu atom introduces narrow free-atom-like Cu 3 d states in the electronic structure. These peculiar electronic states can reduce the activation energies in some reactions and offer valuable guidelines for improving catalytic performance. However, the geometric tuning effect of single Cu atoms in Ag catalysts and the structure–activity relationship of AgCu catalysts remain unclear. Here, we prepared well-resolved pristine Ag n − as well as single atom alloy Ag n −1 Cu − and Ag n −1 Au − ( n = 7–20) clusters and investigated their reactivity with O 2 . We found that replacing an Ag atom in Ag n − ( n = 15–18) with a Cu atom significantly increases the reactivity with O 2 , while replacement of an Ag with an Au atom has negligible effects. The adsorption of O 2 on Ag n − or Ag n −1 Cu − clusters follows the single electron transfer mechanism, in which the cluster activity is dependent on two descriptors, the energy level of α-HOMO (strong correlation) and the α-HOMO–LUMO gap (weak correlation). Our calculation demonstrated that the cluster arrangements caused by single Cu atom alloying would affect the above activity descriptors and, therefore, regulates clusters’ chemical activity. In addition, the observed reactivity of clusters in the representative sizes with n = 17–19 can also be interpreted using the symmetry-adapted orbital model. Our work provides meaningful information to understand the chemical activities of related single-atom-alloy catalysts.},

This involves electronic structure calculations on NaI to obtain adiabatic potential energy curves, non-adiabatic and spin–orbit couplings, followed by nuclear dynamics, treated fully quantum mechanically in a strictly diabatic representation. A single avoided crossing at 13.22 a 0 dominates the reactions, and the total cross sections are well captured by the semi-classical Landau–Zener model. Compared to the measured ion-pair formation cross section, the calculated cross section is about a factor of two smaller, and the overall shape of the calculated differential cross section is in reasonable agreement with the measured ion-pair formation differential cross section. Treating the Landau–Zener coupling as an empirical parameter of 0.05 eV, the measured total and differential cross sections are well captured when performing fully quantum mechanical cross section calculations including rotational coupling. A semi-empirical spin–orbit coupling model is also investigated, giving satisfactory estimation of the effects of spin–orbit interactions for the reactions.},

Generally, these symmetry-adapted cluster configuration interactions VIE match reasonably well with the experimental spectrum over this wide energy range. Density functional calculations of the corresponding adiabatic terms (AIE) were also performed. Higher energy ionic states were determined by complete active space self-consistent field methods; these include all π-ionizations and some σ-ionic states. These were analyzed by Franck–Condon (FC) procedures and compared with an experiment. The spectral onset is complex, where two states, later shown to be the 1 2 B 2 and 1 2 B 1 states, are strongly overlapping. The superposition of the FC vibrational structure in the 1 2 B 2 and 1 2 B 1 states accounts for most of the peaks arising at the onset of the photoelectron spectra. However, the small separation between these two ionic states makes vibronic interaction fairly inevitable. In the absence of Herzberg–Teller analyses for ionic states, we have sought and determined a transition state between the 1 2 B 2 and 1 2 B 1 states, showing that vibronic coupling does occur. The lack of degradation in the vibrational envelope of the higher of the two states contrasts with our previous work on the halogenobenzenes, where overlapping state envelopes led to considerable widening of the line width at half-height of the higher energy states.},

The first step of neutral fragmentation is electronic excitation, yet neither the absorption spectrum in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region nor the electron energy loss spectrum have previously been reported. Here, we experimentally probed the excited states by VUV photoabsorption spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). We found that the distribution of states populated upon electron impact with low-energy electrons is significantly different from that following photoabsorption. This difference was confirmed and interpreted with ab initio modeling of both VUV and EELS spectra. We propose here a new computational protocol for the simulation of EELS spectra combining the Born approximation with approximate forms of correlated wave functions, which allows us to calculate the (usually very expensive) scattering cross sections at a cost similar to the calculation of oscillator strengths. Finally, we perform semi-classical non-adiabatic dynamics simulations to investigate the possible neutral fragments of the molecule formed through electron-induced neutral dissociation. We show that the product distribution is highly non-statistical.},

  abstract = {The charge-transfer (CT) excited state of FHCl (F + H–Cl − ), generated by the photodetachment of an electron from its precursor anion (FHCl − ) by a photon energy of ∼9.5 eV, is a realistic prototype of two bidirectional-coupled reaction pathways, namely the proton-transfer (PT) and electron-transfer (ET) channels, that produce F + HCl and FH + Cl combinations, respectively. The early-time dynamics of the CT was studied via the time-dependent propagations of nuclear wave packets comprising three nonadiabatically coupled electronic states defined within a three-dimensional space. The detailed analyses of the early-time dynamics revealed an interesting phenomenon in which the onset of PT was ∼80 fs earlier than that of ET, indicating that PT dominated ET in this case. A more significant finding was that the proper adjustment of the electronic-charge distribution for the onset of ET was obtained ∼80 fs after the onset of PT; this adjustment was mediated by the initial movement of the H atom, i.e., the F–H vibration mode. To avail experimental observables, the branching ratio, χ = PT/(PT + ET), and absorption spectrum generating the neutral FHCl molecule from its precursor anion were also simulated. The results further demonstrated the dependences of the χ s and spectrum on the change in the initial vibration level of the precursor anion, as well as the isotopic substitution of the connecting H atom with deuterium, tritium, and muonium.},

  abstract = {Structural characterization of neutral water clusters is crucial to understanding the structures and properties of water, but it has been proven to be a challenging experimental target due to the difficulty in size selection. Here, we report the size-specific infrared spectra of confinement-free neutral water nonamer (H 2 O) 9 based on threshold photoionization, using a tunable vacuum ultraviolet free-electron laser. Distinct OH stretch vibrational fundamentals in the 3200–3350 cm −1 region are observed, providing unique spectral signatures for the formation of an unprecedented (H 2 O) 9 structure evolved by adding a ninth water molecule onto a hydrogen bond-unbroken edge of the (H 2 O) 8 octamer with D 2 d symmetry. This nonamer structure coexists with the five previously identified structures that can be viewed as derived by inserting a ninth water molecule into a hydrogen bond-broken edge of the D 2 d / S 4 octamer. These findings provide key microscopic information for systematic understanding of the formation and growth mechanism of dynamical hydrogen-bonding networks that are responsible for the structure and properties of condensed-phase water.},

  abstract = {The measurement of translational diffusion coefficients by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential in a broad range of fields, including organic, inorganic, polymer, and supramolecular chemistry. It is also a powerful method for mixture analysis. Spatially encoded diffusion NMR (SPEN DNMR)&quot; is a time efficient technique to collect diffusion NMR data, which is particularly relevant for the analysis of samples that evolve in time. In many cases, motion other than diffusion is present in NMR samples. This is, for example, the case of flow NMR experiments, such as in online reaction monitoring and in the presence of sample convection. Such motion is deleterious for the accuracy of DNMR experiments in general and for SPEN DNMR in particular. Limited theoretical understanding of flow effects in SPEN DNMR experiments is an obstacle for their broader experimental implementation. Here, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of flow effects in SPEN DNMR and of their compensation, throughout the relevant pulse sequences. This analysis is validated by comparison with numerical simulation performed with the Fokker–Planck formalism. We then consider, through numerical simulation, the specific cases of constant, laminar, and convection flow and the accuracy of SPEN DNMR experiments in these contexts. This analysis will be useful for the design and implementation of fast diffusion NMR experiments and for their applications.},

Furthermore, the experimentally observed difference in relative cross-peak intensities between the two intramolecular modes of bromoform and the intermolecular modes can be explained by the C 3 v -symmetry of bromoform in combination with orientational averaging. The good agreement with the experimental results provides further evidence for our interpretation that the 2D Raman–THz response of bromoform is, indeed, related to the anharmonic coupling between the intra- and intermolecular modes.},

In view of such applications, it is essential to understand how (photo)excitation alters the non-linear optical response of these materials under high carrier density conditions. Broadband transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy is by now a widely used tool to study the semiconductor physics in such highly excited systems. However, the complex interplay between different many-body interactions in 2D materials produces highly congested spectral information and an ensuing non-trivial non-linear photo-response, thereby masking the desired intrinsic photophysics. Herein, we outline a concise roadmap for analyzing such congested datasets based on examples of TA analysis of various 2D materials. In particular, we emphasize the synergy between an initial qualitative understanding of the transient photo-response based on line shapes and their derivatives and a consequent quantitative spectral deconvolution backed by such insights.},

  abstract = {The thermoelectric properties of RbBaX (X = Sb, Bi), an anisotropic material with strong anharmonicity, are systematically studied by first-principles calculations, combined with the self-consistent phonon theory and the Boltzmann transport equation. A reasonable lattice thermal conductivity κ L is captured by fully handling the phonon frequency shift and four-phonon scattering caused by the quartic anharmonicity. The κ L of RbBaSb and RbBaBi along the a-axis is only 0.60 and 0.36 W m −1 K −1 at 300 K, respectively, which is much lower than that of most thermoelectric materials. The low phonon group velocity resulting from the unusually weak atomic bonding strengths along the a-axis is the origin of the ultralow κ L . Furthermore, the high dispersion near the conduction band minimum enables n-type doping with a higher electrical conductivity. The results show that orthorhombic RbbaBi has a ZT as high as 1.04 at 700 K along the a-axis direction, indicating its great application potential in the thermoelectric field.},

Theoretically, although the fermionic hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method has been widely applied to investigate the strongly correlated Kondo states in these junctions, the existence of low-energy spin excitations presents new challenges to numerical simulations. These include the quest for a more accurate and efficient decomposition for the non-Markovian memory of low-temperature environments and a more careful handling of errors caused by the truncation of the hierarchy. In this work, we propose several new algorithms, which significantly enhance the performance of the HEOM method, as exemplified by the calculations on systems involving various types of low-energy spin excitations. Being able to characterize both the Kondo effect and spin excitation accurately, the HEOM method offers a sophisticated and versatile theoretical tool, which is valuable for the understanding and even prediction of the fascinating quantum phenomena explored in cutting-edge experiments.},

At their center is the concept of memory. The explicit time-nonlocal description of memory is both protracted and elaborate. When physical intuition is at a premium, one would desire a more compact, yet complete, description. Here, we demonstrate how and when the time-convolutionless formalism constitutes such a description. In particular, by focusing on the dissipative dynamics of the spin-boson and Frenkel exciton models, we show how to: easily construct the time-local generator from reference reduced dynamics, elucidate the dependence of its existence on the system parameters and the choice of reduced observables, identify the physical origin of its apparent divergences, and offer analysis tools to diagnose their severity and circumvent their deleterious effects. We demonstrate that, when applicable, the time-local approach requires as little information as the more commonly used time-nonlocal scheme, with the important advantages of providing a more compact description, greater algorithmic simplicity, and physical interpretability. We conclude by introducing the discrete-time analog and a straightforward protocol to employ it in cases where the reference dynamics have limited resolution. The insights we present here offer the potential for extending the reach of dynamical methods, reducing both their cost and conceptual complexity.},

In this work, we demonstrate that if a suitably augmented Gaussian basis set is used for density functional calculations, the Pulay force can be suppressed, and HF forces can be computed as accurately as analytical forces with state-of-the-art basis sets, allowing geometry optimization and molecular dynamics to be reliably performed with HF forces.

It is based on ω B97X-V as one of the best-performing density functionals for the GMTKN55 thermochemistry database and completes the family of “3c” methods toward range-separated hybrid DFT. This method is consistently available for all elements up to Rn (Z = 1–86). Its further key ingredients are a polarized valence double- ζ (vDZP) Gaussian basis set, which was fully optimized in molecular DFT calculations, in combination with large-core effective core potentials and a specially adapted D4 dispersion correction. Unlike most existing double- ζ atomic orbital sets, vDZP shows only small basis set superposition errors (BSSEs) and can compete with standard sets of triple- ζ quality. Small residual BSSE effects are efficiently absorbed by the D4 damping scheme, which overall eliminates the need for an explicit treatment or empirical corrections for BSSE. Thorough tests on a variety of thermochemistry benchmark sets show that the new composite method, dubbed ω B97X-3c, is on par with or even outperforms standard hybrid DFT methods in a quadruple-zeta basis set at a small fraction of the computational cost. Particular strengths of this method are the description of non-covalent interactions and barrier heights, for which it is among the best-performing density functionals overall.},

The present approach shows a clear contrast to the previous functionals where the homogeneous electron gas serves as a reference to build the response function. As a benchmark test, we apply the method to a QM water molecule in a dimer system and that embedded in a condensed environment to make comparisons with the results given by the QM/MM calculations employing the Kohn–Sham DFT. It was found that the energetics and the polarization density of the QM solute under the influence of the MM environment can be adequately reproduced with our approach.

The molecular orbital and configuration interaction coefficients of the solute wavefunction, and the induced dipoles on solvent atoms, are solved by minimizing the state averaged energy variationally. In particular, by formulating AMOEBA water models and the polarizable continuum model (PCM) in a unified way, the algorithms developed for computing SA-CASSCF/PCM energies, analytical gradients, and non-adiabatic couplings in our previous work can be generalized to SA-CASSCF/AMOEBA by properly substituting a specific list of variables. Implementation of this method will be discussed with the emphasis on how the calculations of different terms are partitioned between the quantum chemistry and molecular mechanics codes. We will present and discuss results that demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the implementation. Next, we will discuss results that compare three solvent models that work with SA-CASSCF, i.e., PCM, fixed-charge force fields, and the newly implemented AMOEBA. Finally, the new SA-CASSCF/AMOEBA method has been interfaced with the ab initio multiple spawning method to carry out non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. This method is demonstrated by simulating the photodynamics of the model retinal protonated Schiff base molecule in water.},

In this study, we present evidence that the self-assembly of two-dimensional (2D) silver bismuth iodide double perovskite derivatives at the interface of aqueous and organic solutions leads to the formation of defects capable of modulating the light emission spectra of these materials. Through an analysis of the structural parameters used to explain the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of 2D perovskites, we show the light spectra emitted by (4-ammonium methyl)piperidinium (4-AMP) and (3-ammonium methyl)pyridinium (3-AMPy)-spaced AgBiI 8 double perovskites formed through interfacial solution-phase chemistry differ qualitatively and quantitatively from thin film samples. We use previous results to propose the differences observed in the PL spectra of different material morphologies stem from equatorial iodide vacancy formation driven by the kinetics of self-assembly at the liquid–liquid interface. These results show the generality of these chemical physics principles in the formation of defect sites in solution-processed semiconducting nanomaterials, which could help enable their broad use in optoelectronic technologies.},
