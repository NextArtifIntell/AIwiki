  abstract     = {Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder, rendering the development of automated seizure detection systems imperative. While complex machine learning models are powerful, their training and hardware deployment remain challenging. The reservoir computing system offers a low-cost solution in terms of both hardware requirements and training. In this paper, we introduce a compact reservoir computing system for seizure detection, based on the α-In 2 Se 3 dynamic memristors. Leaky integrate-and-fire neurons are used for post-processing the output of the system, and experimental results indicate their effectiveness in suppressing erroneous outputs, where both accuracy and specificity are enhanced by over 2.5\%. The optimized compact reservoir system achieves 96.40\% accuracy, 86.34\% sensitivity, and 96.56\% specificity in seizure detection tasks. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using reservoir computing for seizure detection and shows its potential for future application in extreme edge devices.},

However, the effects of complex environmental factors like obstacle blocking and other unavoidable scattering need to be sufficiently considered for practical applications. In this work, we employ an experiment-based deep learning approach for programmable metasurface design to control powers delivered to specific locations generally with obstacle blocking. Without prior physical knowledge of the complex system, large sets of experimental data can be efficiently collected with a programmable metasurface to train a deep neural network (DNN). The experimental data can inherently incorporate complex factors that are difficult to include if only simulation data are used for training. Moreover, the DNN can be updated by collecting new experimental data on-site to adapt to changes in the environment. Our proposed experiment-based DNN demonstrates significant potential for intelligent wireless communication, imaging, sensing, and quiet-zone control for practical applications.},

It is now well understood that average calibration is insufficient, and most studies implement additional methods for testing the conditional calibration with respect to uncertainty , i.e., consistency . Consistency is assessed mostly by so-called reliability diagrams. There exists, however, another way beyond average calibration, which is conditional calibration with respect to input features , i.e., adaptivity . In practice, adaptivity is the main concern of the final users of the ML-UQ method, seeking the reliability of predictions and uncertainties for any point in the feature space. This article aims to show that consistency and adaptivity are complementary validation targets and that good consistency does not imply good adaptivity. An integrated validation framework is proposed and illustrated with a representative example.},

  abstract     = {Generative design for materials has recently gained significant attention due to the rapid evolution of generative deep learning models. There have been a few successful generative design demonstrations of molecular-level structures with the help of graph neural networks. However, in the realm of macroscale material structures, most of the works are targeting two-dimensional, ungoverned structure generations. Hindered by the complexity of 3D structures, it is hard to extract customized structures with multiple desired properties from a large, unexplored design space. Here we report a novel framework, a multi-objective driven Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN), to implement inverse designs of 3D structures according to given geometrical, structural, and mechanical requirements. Our framework consists of a WGAN-based network that generates 3D structures possessing geometrical and structural features learned from the target dataset. Besides, multiple objectives are introduced to our framework for the control of mechanical property and isotropy of the structures. An accurate surrogate model is incorporated into the framework to perform efficient prediction on the properties of generated structures in training iterations. With multiple objectives combined by their weight and the 3D WGAN acting as a soft constraint to regulate features that are hard to define by the traditional method, our framework has proven to be capable of tuning the properties of the generated structures in multiple aspects while keeping the selected structural features. The feasibility of a small dataset and the scalability of the objectives of other properties make our work an effective approach to provide fast and automated structure designs for various functional materials.},

We present a version of image segmentation called manifold projection image segmentation (MPIS) that is generally applicable to a broad range of systems without the need for training because MPIS uses unsupervised machine learning with a few physically motivated hyperparameters. We apply MPIS to nanoscale x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) imaging, where XANES spectra are collected with nanometer spatial resolution. We show the superiority of manifold projection over linear transformations, such as the commonly used principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, MPIS maintains accuracy while reducing computation time and sensitivity to noise compared to the standard nano-XANES imaging analysis procedure. Finally, we demonstrate how multimodal information, such as x-ray fluorescence data and spatial location of pixels, can be incorporated into the MPIS framework. We propose that MPIS is adaptable for any spectral imaging technique, including scanning transmission x-ray microscopy, where the length scale of domains is larger than the resolution of the experiment.},

However, researchers have noticed that a large fraction of features in high-dimensional datasets are commonly uninformative (too noisy or irrelevant). Because optimal feature selection is an NP-hard task, it is essential to understand how uninformative features impact the performance of machine learning algorithms. Here, we conduct systematic experiments on algorithms from a wide range of taxonomy families using synthetic datasets with different numbers of uninformative features and different numbers of patterns to be learned. Upon visual inspection, we classify these algorithms into four groups with varying robustness against uninformative features. For the algorithms in three of the groups, we find that when the number of uninformative features exceeds the number of data instances per pattern to be learned, the algorithms fail to learn the patterns. Finally, we investigate whether increasing the distinguishability of patterns or adding training instances can mitigate the effect of uninformative features. Surprisingly, we find that uninformative features still cause algorithms to suffer big losses in performance, even when patterns should be easily distinguishable. Analyses of real-world data show that our conclusions hold beyond the synthetic datasets we study systematically.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a novel three-step learning-based machine learning (ML) methodology is developed utilizing 26 000 experimental records from The Perovskite Database Project. A comprehensive set of 29 features encompassing both categorical and numerical data was utilized to train various ML models for various solar cell performance metrics, including open-circuit voltage (V OC ), short-circuit current (J SC ), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE). The model accuracy was assessed using four key metrics: mean absolute error, mean square error, root mean square error, and R 2 score. Among the constructed models, random forest (RF) emerged as the standout performer, boasting an R 2 score of 0.70 for PCE. This RF model was then used for prediction on the large, optimized design pool of Sn-based perovskite data with intent to probe a viable non-toxic substitute to the standard Pb-based absorber. A three-step algorithm was tailored, which led to the discovery of a new set of feature combinations, showcasing a PCE improvement over the existing peak performance of Sn-based devices. The key aspects identified were device architecture, dimensionality, and deposition procedures for essential layers, including the electron transport layer, the hole transport layer, the perovskite absorber layer, and the back-contact. Through consideration of these features, an impressive increase in PCE was achieved. There was a 28.35\% increase in PCE from 12.24\% to 15.71\% for architecture optimization and a 24.6\% increase in PCE from 12.24\% to 15.25\% for deposition method optimization. This study additionally addresses the effective implementation of target encoding applied to a diverse set of categorical feature labels. The data-driven methodology proposed in this study allows scientists to efficiently identify an optimal architecture and deposition parameters for non-toxic Sn-based perovskite materials with a much higher anticipated device PCE compared to traditional trial-and-error analyses. Further exploration and exploitation of the current investigation is expected to lead to successful and sustainable development of highly efficient Sn-based perovskite solar cells.},

  abstract     = {The application of compressed sensing (CS)-enabled data reconstruction for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains a challenging problem. This is due to the fact that the information lost in k-space from the acceleration mask makes it difficult to reconstruct an image similar to the quality of a fully sampled image. Multiple deep learning-based structures have been proposed for MRI reconstruction using CS, in both the k-space and image domains, and using unrolled optimization methods. However, the drawback of these structures is that they are not fully utilizing the information from both domains (k-space and image). Herein, we propose a deep learning-based attention hybrid variational network that performs learning in both the k-space and image domains. We evaluate our method on a well-known open-source MRI dataset (652 brain cases and 1172 knee cases) and a clinical MRI dataset of 243 patients diagnosed with strokes from our institution to demonstrate the performance of our network. Our model achieves an overall peak signal-to-noise ratio/structural similarity of 40.92 ± 0.29/0.9577 ± 0.0025 (fourfold) and 37.03 ± 0.25/0.9365 ± 0.0029 (eightfold) for the brain dataset, 31.09 ± 0.25/0.6901 ± 0.0094 (fourfold) and 29.49 ± 0.22/0.6197 ± 0.0106 (eightfold) for the knee dataset, and 36.32 ± 0.16/0.9199 ± 0.0029 (20-fold) and 33.70 ± 0.15/0.8882 ± 0.0035 (30-fold) for the stroke dataset. In addition to quantitative evaluation, we undertook a blinded comparison of image quality across networks performed by a subspecialty trained radiologist. Overall, we demonstrate that our network achieves a superior performance among others under multiple reconstruction tasks.},

  abstract     = {Numerically solving partial differential equations typically requires fine discretization to resolve necessary spatiotemporal scales, which can be computationally expensive. Recent advances in deep learning have provided a new approach to solving partial differential equations that involves the use of neural operators. Neural operators are neural network architectures that learn mappings between function spaces and have the capability to solve partial differential equations based on data. This study utilizes a novel neural operator called Hyena, which employs a long convolutional filter that is parameterized by a multilayer perceptron. The Hyena operator is an operation that enjoys sub-quadratic complexity and enjoys a global receptive field at the meantime. This mechanism enhances the model’s comprehension of the input’s context and enables data-dependent weight for different partial differential equation instances. To measure how effective the layers are in solving partial differential equations, we conduct experiments on the diffusion–reaction equation and Navier–Stokes equation and compare it with the Fourier neural operator. Our findings indicate that the Hyena neural operator can serve as an efficient and accurate model for learning the partial differential equation solution operator.

Abnormal spontaneous activity (SA) is detected with electromyography (EMG) as an essential hallmark in diagnosing NMD, which causes fatigue, pain, and muscle weakness. Monitoring the effects of NMD calls for new smart devices to collect and classify EMG. Delay-based Reservoir Computing (DRC) is a neuromorphic algorithm with high efficiency in classifying sequential data. This work proposes a new DRC-based algorithm that provides a reference for medical education and training and a second opinion to clinicians to verify NMD diagnoses by detecting SA in muscles. With a sampling frequency of Fs = 64 kHz, we have classified SA with EMG signals of 1 s of muscle recordings. Furthermore, the DRC model of size N = 600 nodes has successfully detected SA signals against normal muscle activity with an accuracy of up to 90.7\%. The potential of using neuromorphic processing approaches in point-of-care diagnostics, alongside the supervision of a clinician, provides a more comprehensive and reliable clinical profile. Our developed model benefits from the potential to be implemented in physical hardware to provide near-sensor edge computing.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the incorporation of machine learning (ML) has heralded significant advancements in materials science. For instance, in spintronics, it has been shown that magnetic parameters, such as the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction, can be estimated from magnetic domain images using ML. Magnetic materials exhibit hysteresis, leading to numerous magnetic states with locally minimized energy (LME) even within a single sample. However, it remains uncertain whether these parameters can be derived from LME states. In our research, we explored the estimation of material parameters from an LME magnetic state using a convolutional neural network. We introduced a technique to manipulate LME magnetic states, combining the ac demagnetizing method with the magneto-optical Kerr effect. By applying this method, we generated multiple LME magnetic states from a single sample and successfully estimated its material composition. Our findings suggest that ML emphasizes not the global domain structures that are readily perceived by humans but the more subtle local domain structures that are often overlooked. Adopting this approach could potentially facilitate the estimation of magnetic parameters from any state observed in experiments, streamlining experimental processes in spintronics.},

  abstract     = {Memristive neural networks have extensively been investigated for their capability in handling various artificial intelligence tasks. The training performance of memristive neural networks depends on the pulse scheme applied to the constituent memristors. However, the design of the pulse scheme in most previous studies was approached in an empirical manner or through a trial-and-error method. Here, we choose ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) as a model memristor and demonstrate a physics-based predictive model for the pulse design to achieve high training performance. This predictive model comprises a physical model for FTJ that can adequately describe the polarization switching and memristive switching behaviors of the FTJ and an FTJ-based neural network that uses the long-term potentiation (LTP)/long-term depression (LTD) characteristics of the FTJ for the weight update. Simulation results based on the predictive model demonstrate that the LTP/LTD characteristics with a good trade-off between ON/OFF ratio, nonlinearity, and asymmetry can lead to high training accuracies for the FTJ-based neural network. Moreover, it is revealed that an amplitude-increasing pulse scheme may be the most favorable pulse scheme as it offers the widest ranges of pulse amplitudes and widths for achieving high accuracies. This study may provide useful guidance for the pulse design in the experimental development of high-performance memristive neural networks.},

Recent studies have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in predicting various physical outcomes through machine learning-assisted approaches. However, it remains challenging to generalize current methods, usually crafted for a specific problem, to other more complex or broader scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed graph neural network (GNN) models with enhanced generalizability derived from the distinct GNN architecture and neural operator techniques. As a proof of concept, we employ our GNN models to predict finite element (FE) simulation results for three-dimensional solid mechanics problems with varying boundary conditions. Results show that our GNN model achieves accurate and robust performance in predicting the stress and deformation profiles of structures compared with FE simulations. Furthermore, the neural operator embedded GNN approach enables learning and predicting various solid mechanics problems in a generalizable fashion, making it a promising approach for surrogate modeling.},

Here, we employ unsupervised machine learning (ML) methods to assess the surface condition of a soft tissue by detecting and classifying different wear morphologies as well as the severity of surface damage they represent. We show that different clustering methods, especially a k -means clustering algorithm, can indeed achieve a—from a material science point of view—meaningful classification of those tissue samples.

Common methods for quantifying output uncertainty, such as performing a grid or random search over the model input space, are computationally intractable for a large number of input parameters represented by a high-dimensional input space. It is, therefore, generally unclear as to whether a numerical simulation can reproduce a particular outcome (e.g., a set of experimental results) with a plausible set of model input parameters. Here, we present a method for efficiently searching the input space using Bayesian optimization to minimize the difference between the simulation output and a set of experimental results. Our method allows explicit evaluation of the probability that the simulation can reproduce the measured experimental results in the region of input space defined by the uncertainty in each input parameter. We apply this method to the simulation of charge-carrier dynamics in the perovskite semiconductor methyl-ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ), which has attracted attention as a light harvesting material in solar cells. From our analysis, we conclude that the formation of large polarons, quasiparticles created by the coupling of excess electrons or holes with ionic vibrations, cannot explain the experimentally observed temperature dependence of electron mobility.},

  abstract     = {Using deep learning to develop nanophotonic structures has been an active field of research in recent years to reduce the time intensive iterative solutions found in finite-difference time-domain simulations. Existing work has primarily used a specific type of generative network: conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial networks. However, these networks have issues with producing clear optical structures in image files; for example, a large number of images show speckled noise, which often results in non-manufacturable structures. Here, we report the first use of cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks to design nanophotonic structures. This approach significantly reduces the amount of speckled noise present in generated geometric structures and allows shapes to have clear edges. We demonstrate that for a given input reflectance spectra, the system generates designs in the form of images, and a complementary network generates reflectance spectra if an image containing a shape is provided as an input. The results show a higher Frechet Inception Distance score than previous approaches, which indicates that the generated structures are of higher quality and are able to learn nonlinear relationships between both datasets. This method of designing nanophotonics provides alternative avenues for development that are more noise robust while still adhering to desired optical properties.},

Nano-tracking analysis (NTA) has been commercialized and widely used as a method to measure individual nanoparticles in liquids and evaluate their size distribution by analyzing Brownian motion. We have combined deep learning (DL) for NTA to extract more property information and explored a methodology to achieve an evaluation for individual particles to understand their diversity. Practical NTA always assumes spherical shape when quantifying particle size using the Stokes–Einstein equation, but it is not possible to verify whether the measured particles are truly spherical. We developed a DL model that predicts the shape of nanoparticles using time series trajectory data of BM obtained from NTA measurements to address this problem. As a result, we were able to discriminate with ∼80\% accuracy between spherical and rod-shaped gold nanoparticles of different shapes, which are evaluated to have nearly equal particle size without any discrimination by conventional NTA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the mixing ratio of spherical and rod-shaped nanoparticles can be quantitatively estimated from measured data of mixed samples of nanoparticles. This result suggests that it is possible to evaluate particle shape by applying DL analysis to NTA measurements, which was previously considered impossible, and opens the way to further value-added NTA.},

This approach combines the elements from the symbolic regression methods, such as SISSO and active learning, into a single framework. The primary focus of constructing this framework is to approximate physical laws in an active learning regime toward a more robust predictive performance, as traditional evaluation on hold-out sets in machine learning does not account for out-of-distribution effects which may lead to a complete failure on unseen chemical space.

The prediction of future fluid flow fields is based on the previously predicted fluid flow field to ensure long-term predictions without diverging. A combination of convolutional neural networks and transformer architecture is utilized to handle both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data. To assess the performance of the model, a priori assessments are conducted, and significant agreements are found with the ground truth data. The a posteriori predictions, which are generated after a considerable number of simulation steps, exhibit predicted variances. The autoregressive training and prediction of a posteriori states are deemed crucial steps toward the development of more complex data-driven turbulence models and simulations. The highly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of turbulent flows can be handled by the proposed model, and accurate predictions over long time horizons can be generated. Overall, the potential of using deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of turbulence modeling and simulation is demonstrated by this approach.

Applied inverse problems are challenging because a solution may (i) not exist, (ii) not be unique, or (iii) be sensitive to measurement noise contaminating the data. Bayesian statistical inversion (BSI) is an approach to tackle ill-posed and/or ill-conditioned inverse problems. Advantageously, BSI provides a “solution” that (i) quantifies uncertainty by assigning a probability to each possible value of the unknown parameter/input and (ii) incorporates prior information and beliefs about the parameter/input. Herein, we provide a tutorial of BSI for inverse problems by way of illustrative examples dealing with heat transfer from ambient air to a cold lime fruit. First, we use BSI to infer a parameter in a dynamic model of the lime temperature from measurements of the lime temperature over time. Second, we use BSI to reconstruct the initial condition of the lime from a measurement of its temperature later in time. We demonstrate the incorporation of prior information, visualize the posterior distributions of the parameter/initial condition, and show posterior samples of lime temperature trajectories from the model. Our Tutorial aims to reach a wide range of scientists and engineers.},

  abstract     = {In-memory computing (IMC) using emerging nonvolatile devices has received considerable attention due to its great potential for accelerating artificial neural networks and machine learning tasks. As the basic concept and operation modes of IMC are now well established, there is growing interest in employing its wide and general application. In this perspective, the path that leads memristive IMC to general-purpose machine learning is discussed in detail. First, we reviewed the development timeline of machine learning algorithms that employ memristive devices, such as resistive random-access memory and phase-change memory. Then we summarized two typical aspects of realizing IMC-based general-purpose machine learning. One involves a heterogeneous computing system for algorithmic completeness. The other is to obtain the configurable precision techniques for the compromise of the precision-efficiency dilemma. Finally, the major directions and challenges of memristive IMC-based general-purpose machine learning are proposed from a cross-level design perspective.},

In this study, we demonstrate the recognition of OAM Bell states using interference patterns generated by a classical light source and a single-photon source from a Sagnac interferometer-based OAM Bell state evolution device. The interference patterns exhibit a one-to-one correspondence with the input Bell states, providing conclusive evidence for the full recognition of OAM Bell states. Furthermore, we introduce machine learning to the field of Bell state recognition by proposing a neural network model capable of accurately recognizing higher order single-photon OAM Bell states, even in the undersampling case. In particular, the model’s training set includes interference patterns of OAM Bell states generated by classical light sources, yet it is able to recognize single-photon OAM Bell states with high accuracy, without relying on quantum resources during training. Our innovative application of neural networks to the recognition of single-photon OAM Bell states not only circumvents the resource consumption and experimental difficulties associated with quantum light sources but also facilitates the study of OAM-based quantum information.},

  abstract     = {Numerous physics theories are rooted in partial differential equations (PDEs). However, the increasingly intricate physics equations, especially those that lack analytic solutions or closed forms, have impeded the further development of physics. Computationally solving PDEs by classic numerical approaches suffers from the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency and is not applicable to the empirical data generated by unknown latent PDEs. To overcome this challenge, we present KoopmanLab, an efficient module of the Koopman neural operator (KNO) family, for learning PDEs without analytic solutions or closed forms. Our module consists of multiple variants of the KNO, a kind of mesh-independent neural-network-based PDE solvers developed following the dynamic system theory. The compact variants of KNO can accurately solve PDEs with small model sizes, while the large variants of KNO are more competitive in predicting highly complicated dynamic systems govern by unknown, high-dimensional, and non-linear PDEs. All variants are validated by mesh-independent and long-term prediction experiments implemented on representative PDEs (e.g., the Navier–Stokes equation and the Bateman–Burgers equation in fluid mechanics) and ERA5 (i.e., one of the largest high-resolution global-scale climate datasets in earth physics). These demonstrations suggest the potential of KoopmanLab to be a fundamental tool in diverse physics studies related to equations or dynamic systems.},

For training the inverse model, 75 000 synthetic EL images were generated with randomized parameters of the physical cell model. We combine 17 deep convolutional neural networks based on a modified VGG19 architecture into a deep ensemble to add uncertainty estimates. Using the silicon solar cell model, we show that such a novel approach to data-driven statistical inverse modeling can help apply recent developments in deep learning to new engineering applications that require real-time parameterizations of physical models augmented by confidence intervals. The trained network was tested on four different physical solar cell samples, and the estimated parameters were used to create the corresponding model representations. Resimulations of the measurements yielded relative deviations of the calculated and the measured junction voltage values of 0.2\% on average with a maximum of 10\%, demonstrating the validity of the approach.},

The ongoing advancement in MLCC manufacturing has improved capacitive volumetric density for both low and high voltage devices; however, concerns about long-term stability under higher fields and temperatures are always a concern, which impact their reliability and lifespan. Consequently, predicting the mean time to failure (MTTF) for MLCCs remains a challenge due to the limitations of existing models. In this study, we develop a physics-based machine learning approach using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting method to predict the MTTF of X7R MLCCs under various temperature and voltage conditions. We employ a transfer learning framework to improve prediction accuracy for test conditions with limited data and to provide predictions for test conditions where no experimental data exists. We compare our model with the conventional Eyring model (EM) and, more recently, the tipping point model (TPM) in terms of accuracy and performance. Our results show that the machine learning model consistently outperforms both the EM and TPM, demonstrating superior accuracy and stability across different conditions. Our model also exhibits a reliable performance for untested voltage and temperature conditions, making it a promising approach for predicting MTTF in MLCCs.},

A convolutional neural network was trained with pairs of optical images that display the characteristics of the crystal and photoluminescence images that show the distributions of crystal defects. The model was trained to predict the existence of crystal defects at the center pixel of the given image from its optical features. Prediction accuracy and separability were enhanced by feeding three-dimensional data and data augmentation. The prediction was successful with a high area under the curve of over 0.9 in a receiver operating characteristic curve. Likelihood maps showing the distributions of the predicted defects are in good resemblance with the correct distributions. Using the trained model, we visualized the most important regions to the predicted class by gradient-based class activation mapping. The extracted regions were found to contain mostly particular grains where the grain boundaries changed greatly due to crystal growth and clusters of small grains. This technique is beneficial in providing a rapid and statistical analysis of various crystal characteristics because the features of optical images are often complex and difficult to interpret. The interpretations can help us understand the physics of crystal growth and the effects of crystallographic characteristics on the generation of detrimental defects. We believe that this technique will contribute to the development of a better fabrication process for high-performance multicrystalline materials.},

In addition, it is proved that the multiplexing PRC exhibits a superior performance on the task of signal equalization in an optical fiber communication link. This improved performance is owing to the rich neuron interconnections both in parallel and in series. In particular, this scheme is highly scalable owing to the rich mode resources in FP lasers.},

The model is written for the SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuits Emphasis) simulator and considers as one of its inputs a measure of the oxygen flow used during the deposition of the switching layer. After a thorough statistical calibration of the model parameters using experimental current–voltage characteristics associated with different fabrication conditions, the corresponding curves were simulated and the results were compared with the original data. In this way, the average switching behavior of the structures (low and high current states, set and reset voltages, etc.) as a function of the oxygen content can be forecasted. In a subsequent phase, the collective response of the devices when used in a neural network was investigated in terms of the output features of the network (mainly power dissipation and power efficiency). The role played by parasitic elements, such as the line resistance and the read voltage influence on the inference accuracy, was also explored. Since a similar strategy can be applied to any other material-related fabrication parameter, the proposed approach opens up a new dimension for circuit designers, as the behavior of complex circuits employing devices with specific characteristics can be realistically assessed before fabrication.},

New architectures such as graph neural networks have seen significant research investments recently. For heterogeneous catalysis, defining substrate intramolecular bonds and adsorbate/substrate intermolecular bonds is a time-consuming and challenging process. Before applying a model, dataset pre-processing, node/bond descriptor design, and specific model constraints have to be considered. In this work, a framework designed to solve these issues is presented in the form of an automatic graph representation algorithm (AGRA) tool to extract the local chemical environment of metallic surface adsorption sites. This tool is able to gather multiple adsorption geometry datasets composed of different systems and combine them into a single model. To show AGRA’s excellent transferability and reduced computational cost compared to other graph representation methods, it was applied to five different catalytic reaction datasets and benchmarked against the Open Catalyst Projects graph representation method. The two oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) datasets with O/OH adsorbates obtained 0.053 eV root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) when combined together, whereas the three carbon dioxide reduction reaction datasets with CHO/CO/COOH obtained an average performance of 0.088 eV RMSD. To further display the algorithm’s versatility and extrapolation ability, a model was trained on a subset combination of all five datasets with an RMSD of 0.105 eV. This universal model was then used to predict a wide range of adsorption energies and an entirely new ORR catalyst system, which was then verified through density functional theory calculations.},

Niobium-based alloys can be considered as promising candidates because of their exceptional properties at elevated temperatures. The conventional approach to alloy design relies on phase diagrams and structure–property data of limited alloys and extrapolates this information into unexplored compositional space. In this work, we harness machine learning and provide an efficient design strategy for finding promising niobium-based alloy compositions with high yield and ultimate tensile strength. Unlike standard composition-based features, we use domain knowledge-based custom features and achieve higher prediction accuracy. We apply Bayesian optimization to screen out novel Nb-based quaternary and quinary alloy compositions and find these compositions have superior predicted strength over a range of temperatures. We develop a detailed design flow and include Python programming code, which could be helpful for accelerating alloy design in a limited alloy data regime.},

Memristors are characterized by an onset of high current values under applied voltage that produces a transition to a low resistance state or successively to different stable states of increasing conductivity that implement synaptic weights. Here, we develop a nonlinear model to explain the variation with time of the voltage and the resistance and compare it to experimental results on ionic–electronic halide perovskite memristors. We find separate experimental signatures of the capacitive discharge and inductive current increase. We show that the capacitor produces an increase step of the resistance due to the influence of the series resistance. In contrast, the inductor feature associated with inverted hysteresis causes a decrease of the resistance, as observed experimentally. The chemical inductor feature dominates the potentiation effect in which the conductivity increases with the voltage stimulus. Our results enable a quantitative characterization of highly nonlinear electronic devices using a combination of techniques such as time transient decays and impedance spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {Neuromorphic visual systems that integrate the functionalities of sensing, memory, and processing are expected to overcome the shortcomings of conventional artificial visual systems, such as data redundancy, data access delay, and high-energy consumption. Neuromorphic visual systems based on emerging flexible optoelectronic synaptic devices have recently opened up innovative applications, such as robot visual perception, visual prosthetics, and artificial intelligence. Various flexible optoelectronic synaptic devices have been fabricated, which are either two-terminal memristors or three-terminal transistors. In flexible optoelectronic synaptic transistors (FOSTs), the synaptic weight can be modulated by the electricity and light synergistically, which endows the neuromorphic visual systems with versatile functionalities. In this Review, we present an overview of the working mechanisms, device structures, and active materials of FOSTs. Their applications in neuromorphic visual systems for color recognition, image recognition and memory, motion detection, and pain perception are presented. Perspectives on the development of FOSTs are finally outlined.},

MGD utilizes zero-order optimization techniques for online training of hardware neural networks. We demonstrate its ability to train neural networks on modern machine learning datasets, including CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, and compare its performance to backpropagation. Assuming realistic timescales and hardware parameters, our results indicate that these optimization techniques can train a network on emerging hardware platforms orders of magnitude faster than the wall-clock time of training via backpropagation on a standard GPU, even in the presence of imperfect weight updates or device-to-device variations in the hardware. We additionally describe how it can be applied to existing hardware as part of chip-in-the-loop training or integrated directly at the hardware level. Crucially, because the MGD framework is model-free it can be applied to nearly any hardware platform with tunable parameters, and its gradient descent process can be optimized to compensate for specific hardware limitations, such as slow parameter-update speeds or limited input bandwidth.},

  abstract     = {We show that unsupervised machine learning can be used to learn chemical transformation pathways from observational Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) data. To enable this analysis, we assumed the existence of atoms, a discreteness of atomic classes, and the presence of an explicit relationship between the observed STEM contrast and the presence of atomic units. With only these postulates, we developed a machine learning method leveraging a rotationally invariant variational autoencoder (VAE) that can identify the existing molecular fragments observed within a material. The approach encodes the information contained in STEM image sequences using a small number of latent variables, allowing the exploration of chemical transformation pathways by tracing the evolution of atoms in the latent space of the system. The results suggest that atomically resolved STEM data can be used to derive fundamental physical and chemical mechanisms involved, by providing encodings of the observed structures that act as bottom-up equivalents of structural order parameters. The approach also demonstrates the potential of variational (i.e., Bayesian) methods in the physical sciences and will stimulate the development of more sophisticated ways to encode physical constraints in the encoder–decoder architectures and generative physical laws and causal relationships in the latent space of VAEs.},

The features of the calculated pair distribution functions (PDFs) of these defected structures are extracted using linear methods (principal component analysis and non-negative matrix factorization) and non-linear methods (autoencoder and convolutional neural network). The extracted features are used as inputs to a neural network that maps feature weights to the concentration of each defect type.

A physics-based initialization of the autoencoder has the highest accuracy in predicting defect concentrations.

The nonintuitive optimal composition with a large α xy of ∼10 A K −1 m −1 was identified through the two-step Bayesian optimization using rough and fine candidate pools. The Berry curvature and band dispersion analyses revealed that α xy is enhanced by the appearance of the flat band near the Fermi level due to the multilayer formation. The magnitude of the energy derivative of the anomalous Hall conductivity increases owing to the large Berry curvature near the flat band along the R-M high symmetry line, which emerges only in the optimized superlattice, leading to the α xy enhancement. The effective method verified here will broaden the choices of ANE materials to more complex systems and, therefore, lead to the development of transverse thermoelectric conversion technologies.},

A long short-term memory neural network was trained with pairs of light reflection patterns and the correct orientations of each grain, successfully predicting orientation with an error median of 8.61°. The model was improved by diverse data taken from various incident light angles and by data augmentation. When trained on different incident angles, the model was capable of estimating different orientations. This is related to the geometrical configuration of the incident light angles and surface facets of the crystal. The failure in certain orientations is thought to be complemented by supplementary data taken from different incident angles. Combining data from multiple incident angles, we acquired an error median of 4.35°. Data augmentation was successfully performed, reducing error by an additional 35\%. This technique can provide the crystallographic orientations of a 15 × 15 cm 2 sized wafer in less than 8 min, while baseline techniques such as electron backscatter diffraction and Laue scanner may take more than 10 h. The rapid and accurate measurement can accelerate data collection for full-sized ingots, helping us gain a comprehensive understanding of crystal growth.

  abstract     = {One of the key performance metrics for optical networks is the maximum achievable throughput for a given network. Determining it, however, is a nondeterministic polynomial time (NP) hard optimization problem, often solved via computationally expensive integer linear programming (ILP) formulations. These are infeasible to implement as objectives, even on very small node scales of a few tens of nodes. Alternatively, heuristics are used although these, too, require considerable computation time for a large number of networks. There is, thus, a need for an ultra-fast and accurate performance evaluation of optical networks. For the first time, we propose the use of a geometric deep learning model, message passing neural networks (MPNNs), to learn the relationship between node and edge features, the network structure, and the maximum achievable network throughput. We demonstrate that MPNNs can accurately predict the maximum achievable throughput while reducing the computational time by up to five-orders of magnitude compared to the ILP for small networks (10–15 nodes) and compared to a heuristic for large networks (25–100 nodes)—proving their suitability for the design and optimization of optical networks on different time- and distance-scales.},

In addition, obtaining a large number of samples to achieve accurate predictions remains a challenge due to the complex and lengthy experimental process. In this work, based on T g of 100 polymers, we use a feature selection algorithm combining FeatureWiz and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator to quickly select molecular descriptors that are minimally redundant and maximally relevant to T g . The processed dataset is interpolated from the original dataset using the nearest neighbor interpolation algorithm to solve the data deficiency problem. Finally, the synthetic minority oversampling technique algorithm is used to solve the data imbalance problem.

Machine Learning (ML) approaches can help with the diagnostic prediction from circulating tumor cells in liquid biopsy or from a primary tumor in solid biopsy. After predicting the metastatic potential from a deep learning model, doctors in a clinical setting can administer a safe and correct treatment for a specific patient. This paper investigates the use of deep convolutional neural networks for predicting a specific cancer cell line as a tool for label free identification. Specifically, deep learning strategies for weight initialization and performance metrics are described, with transfer learning and the accuracy metric utilized in this work. The equipment used for prediction involves brightfield microscopy without the use of chemical labels, advanced instruments, or time-consuming biological techniques, giving an advantage over current diagnostic methods. In the procedure, three different binary datasets of well-known cancer cell lines were collected, each having a difference in metastatic potential. Two different classification models were adopted (EfficientNetV2 and ResNet-50) with the analysis given for each stage in the ML architecture. The training results for each model and dataset are provided and systematically compared. We found that the test set accuracy showed favorable performance for both ML models with EfficientNetV2 accuracy reaching up to 99\%. These test results allowed EfficientNetV2 to outperform ResNet-50 at an average percent increase of 3.5\% for each dataset. The high accuracy obtained from the predictions demonstrates that the system can be retrained on a large-scale clinical dataset.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the super-resolution of velocity fields in two-dimensional flows from the viewpoint of rotational equivariance. Super-resolution refers to techniques that enhance the resolution of an image from low to high resolution, and it has recently been applied in fluid mechanics. Rotational equivariance of super-resolution models is defined as the property by which the super-resolved velocity field is rotated according to a rotation of the input, leading to inferences that are covariant with the orientation of fluid systems. In physics, covariance is often related to symmetries. To better understand the connection with symmetries, the notion of rotational consistency of datasets is introduced within the framework of supervised learning, which is defined as the invariance of pairs of low- and high-resolution velocity fields with respect to rotation. This consistency is sufficient and necessary for super-resolution models to learn rotational equivariance from large datasets. Such a large dataset is not required when rotational equivariance is imposed on super-resolution models through the use of prior knowledge in the form of equivariant kernel patterns. Nonetheless, even if a fluid system has rotational symmetry, this symmetry may not carry over to a velocity dataset, which is not rotationally consistent. This inconsistency can arise when the rotation does not commute with the generation of low-resolution velocity fields. These theoretical assertions are supported by the results of numerical experiments, where two existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are converted into rotationally equivariant CNNs and the inferences of these CNNs are compared after the supervised training.},

A recurrent application of such an operator rolls out a long sequence of predicted flame fronts, and a learned operator is required to not only make accurate short-term predictions but also reproduce characteristic nonlinear behavior, such as fractal front structures and detached flame pockets. Using two datasets of flame front solutions obtained from a heavy-duty direct numerical simulation and a light-duty modeling equation, we compare the performance of three state-of-art operator-regression network methods: convolutional neural networks, Fourier neural operator (FNO), and deep operator network. We show that, for learning complicated front evolution, FNO gives the best recurrent predictions in both the short and long term. A consistent extension allowing the operator-regression networks to handle complicated flame front shape is achieved by representing the latter as an implicit curve.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of material failure is a critical phenomenon relevant to a range of scientific and engineering fields, from healthcare to structural materials. We propose a specially designed deep neural network, DyFraNet, which can predict dynamic fracture behaviors by identifying a complete history of fracture propagation—from the onset of cracking, as a crack grows through the material, modeled as a series of frames evolving over time and dependent on each other. Furthermore, the model can not only forecast future fracture processes but also backcast to elucidate past fracture histories. In this scenario, once provided with the outcome of a fracture event, the model will reveal past events that led to this state and can also predict future evolutions of the failure process. By comparing the predicted results with atomistic-level simulations and theory, we show that DyFraNet can capture dynamic fracture mechanics by accurately predicting how cracks develop over time, including measures such as the crack speed, as well as when cracks become unstable. We use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, Grad-CAM, to interpret how DyFraNet perceives the relationship between geometric conditions and fracture dynamics, and we find that DyFraNet pays special attention to the areas around crack tips that have a critical influence in the early stage of fracture propagation. In later stages, the model pays increased attention to the existing or newly formed damaged regions in the material. The proposed approach offers the potential to accelerate the exploration of dynamical processes in material design against failure and can be adapted for all kinds of dynamical problems.},

However, reproducible growth of highly insulating stoichiometric (STO) films remains challenging due to the difficulty of precise stoichiometry control in perovskite oxide films. Here, to grow stoichiometric (STO) thin films by fine-tuning multiple growth conditions, we developed a new Bayesian optimization (BO)-based machine learning method that encourages exploration of the search space by varying the prior mean to get out of suboptimal growth condition parameters. Using simulated data, we demonstrate the efficacy of the new BO method, which reproducibly reaches the global best conditions. With the BO method implemented in machine-learning-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (ML-MBE), a highly insulating stoichiometric (STO) film with no absorption in the bandgap was developed in only 44 MBE growth runs. The proposed algorithm provides an efficient experimental design platform that is not as dependent on the experience of individual researchers and will accelerate not only oxide electronics but also various material syntheses.},

Under this perspective, this work focuses on the basic principles of RC systems. The ability of self-selective conductive-bridging random access memory devices to operate in two modes, namely, volatile and non-volatile, by regulating the applied voltage is first presented. We then investigate the relaxation time of these devices as a function of the applied amplitude and pulse duration, a critical step in determining the desired non-linearity by the reservoir. Moreover, we present an in-depth study of the impact of selecting the appropriate pulse-stream and its final effects on the total power consumption and recognition accuracy in a handwritten digit recognition application from the National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. Finally, we conclude at the optimal pulse-stream of 3-bit, through the minimization of two cost criteria, with the total power remaining at 287 µW and simultaneously achieving 82.58\% recognition accuracy upon the test set.},

To that end, large labeled datasets are required for the supervised training of machine learning models. We present an algorithm that achieves 97.7\% precision when automatically labeling edge localized modes in the large DIII-D tokamak discharge database.

With the aim of finding an accurate forecast model in the proper representation of various household energy profiles, our research objective is centered on the development of a reliable forecast system for a group of 24-household energy consumers. In this energy study, we proposed long-term forecasts of (1) residential energy profiles within the multi-classification framework and (2) energy costing of the household demands using the Keras two-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv2D) model and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. These high-level Keras neural networks are built to extract multivariate features for household energy consumption modeling and forecasting. The proposed forecast systems utilized a similar model hyperparameter configuration, while the forecast skills are validated with spatial–temporal variation datasets of ten remote locations. The actual costs of household demand and supply are estimated and compared with Conv2D predictions. The finding results (hourly and seasonal predictions and model evaluation) revealed that Conv2D and LSTM forecast systems are promising for household energy forecast solutions. Experimental results of the Conv2D predictive system achieved better forecast skills [correlation coefficient (0.727–0.994) and root mean square error (0.190–0.868)] than LSTM forecasts (0.308–0.987 and 0.278–1.212). However, experimental findings revealed that forecast skills of the predictive systems in residential energy demand predictions are highly influenced by the (1) quality of input datasets, (2) model hyperparameter tuning approach, and (3) learning rate of selected network optimizer(s).},

However, traditional experiments and molecular simulations are time-consuming and labor-intensive, which no longer meet the requirements of new materials development. With the rapid advances of artificial intelligence and materials informatics, machine learning algorithms are increasingly applied in materials science, aiming to shorten the development period of new materials. With the evolution of polymeric materials, the structure of polymers has become more and more complex. Traditional machine learning algorithms often do not perform satisfactorily when dealing with complex data. Presently, deep learning algorithms, including deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks, show their uniquely excellent learning capabilities for large and complex data, which will be a powerful tool for the design and development of polymeric materials. This Review introduces principles of several currently popular deep learning algorithms and discusses their multiple applications in the materials field. Applications range from property prediction and molecular generation at the molecular level to structure identification and material synthesis in polymers. Finally, future challenges and opportunities for the application of deep learning in polymeric materials are discussed.},

In this paper, we present a machine learning framework, namely PREDICT ( PR edict properties from E xisting D atabase I n C omplex alloys T erritory), that opens a pathway to predict elastic constants in large compositional space with little computational expense. The framework only relies on the DFT database of binary alloys and predicts Voigt–Reuss–Hill Young’s modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus, elastic constants, and Poisson’s ratio in MPEAs. We show that the key descriptors of elastic constants are the A–B bond length and cohesive energy. The framework can predict elastic constants in hypothetical compositions as long as the constituent elements are present in the database, thereby enabling property exploration in multi-compositional systems. We illustrate predictions in a FCC Ni-Cu-Au-Pd-Pt system.},

The nonlinear operations by nonlinear activations in each layer remarkably enhance the expressiveness of DNNs, resulting in the great success in a variety of application domains. Although the necessity of layer-wise nonlinear operations is agreed, the optimal nonlinearity for each layer in a given DNN is not clear. In this regard, we propose an easy-to-use method to layer-wise measure the optimal nonlinearity for a given DNN using its replica termed a linear-nonlinear network (LiNLNet). The key to the LiNLNet is the use of linear-nonlinear units (LiNLUs) whose degree of nonlinearity is parameterized by a trainable parameter p . The parameter p is shared among all LiNLUs in a given layer, thus indicating the layer-wise optimal nonlinearity. This method allows layer-level pruning such that the layers that do not require nonlinearity are merged into the subsequent layers, reducing computational complexity. For proofs of concept, we applied the proposed method to a MLP, AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. The results commonly indicate the last hidden layer as a linear layer that may be merged into the output layer, reducing memory usage by 27\% while maintaining the accuracy for LiNL-AlexNet on ImageNet.},

Still, for many research problems, the amount of data available for training a machine learning (ML) model is very limited. An important strategy to combat the problems arising from data sparsity is feature elimination—a method that aims at reducing the dimensionality of an input feature space. Most such strategies exclusively focus on analyzing pairwise correlations, or they eliminate features based on their relation to a selected output label or by optimizing performance measures of a certain ML model. However, those strategies do not necessarily remove redundant information from datasets and cannot be applied to certain situations, e.g., to unsupervised learning models. Neither of these limitations applies to the network-based, correlation-driven redundancy elimination (NETCORE) algorithm introduced here, where the size of a feature vector is reduced by considering both redundancy and elimination efficiency. The NETCORE algorithm is model-independent, does not require an output label, and is applicable to all kinds of correlation topographies within a dataset. Thus, this algorithm has the potential to be a highly beneficial preprocessing tool for various machine learning pipelines.},

We show that larger networks with fewer reused layers are more tolerable to failed devices. Devices stuck at high resistance states are more tolerable than devices stuck at low resistance states. To improve the robustness of DNNs to defective devices, we develop training methods that add noise and corrupt devices in the weight matrices during network training and show that this can increase the network accuracy in the presence of the failed devices. We also provide estimated maximum defective device tolerance of some common networks.},

  abstract     = {Streamline tracing in hypersonic flows is essential for designing a high-performance waverider and intake. Conventionally, the streamline equations are solved after obtaining the velocity field over a basic flow field from simplified flow differential equations or three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics. The hypersonic waverider shape is generated by repeatedly applying the streamline tracing approach along several planes. This approach is computationally expensive for iterative waverider optimization. We provide a novel strategy where an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained to directly predict the streamlines without solving the differential equations. We consider the standard simple cone-derived waverider using Taylor–Maccoll equations for the conical flow field as a template for the study. First, the streamlines from the shock are solved for a wide range of cone angle and Mach number conditions resulting in an extensive database. The streamlines are parameterized by a third-order polynomial, and an ANN is trained to predict the coefficients of the polynomial for arbitrary inputs of Mach number, cone angle, and streamline originating locations. We apply this strategy to design a cone-derived waverider and compare the geometry obtained with the standard conical waverider design method and the simplified waverider design method. The ANN technique is highly accurate, with a difference of 0.68\% from the standard method in the coordinates of the waverider. The performance of the three waveriders is compared using Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. The ANN-derived waverider does not indicate severe flow spillage at the leading edge. The new ANN-based approach is 20 times faster than the standard method.},

  abstract     = {Making reliable predictions of the mechanical behavior of alloys with a prolonged service life is beneficial for many structural applications. In this work, we propose an interpretable machine learning (ML) approach to predict fatigue life cycles ( N f ) and creep rupture life ( t r ) in titanium-based alloys. Chemical compositions, experimental parameters, and alloy processing conditions are employed as descriptors for the development of gradient boost regression models for log-scaled N f and t r . The models are trained on an extensive experimental dataset, predicting log-scaled N f and t r with a very small root mean squared error of 0.17 and 0.15, respectively. An intuitive interpretation of the ML models is carried out via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to understand the complex interplay of various features with N f and t r . The SHAP interpretation of the ML models reveals close agreement with the general creep equation and Wöhler curve of fatigue. The approach proposed in this study can accelerate the design of novel Ti-based alloys with desired properties.},

  abstract     = {The massive use of artificial neural networks (ANNs), increasingly popular in many areas of scientific computing, rapidly increases the energy consumption of modern high-performance computing systems. An appealing and possibly more sustainable alternative is provided by novel neuromorphic paradigms, which directly implement ANNs in hardware. However, little is known about the actual benefits of running ANNs on neuromorphic hardware for use cases in scientific computing. Here, we present a methodology for measuring the energy cost and compute time for inference tasks with ANNs on conventional hardware. In addition, we have designed an architecture for these tasks and estimate the same metrics based on a state-of-the-art analog in-memory computing (AIMC) platform, one of the key paradigms in neuromorphic computing. Both methodologies are compared for a use case in quantum many-body physics in two-dimensional condensed matter systems and for anomaly detection at 40 MHz rates at the Large Hadron Collider in particle physics. We find that AIMC can achieve up to one order of magnitude shorter computation times than conventional hardware at an energy cost that is up to three orders of magnitude smaller. This suggests great potential for faster and more sustainable scientific computing with neuromorphic hardware.},

While the IMC concept is simple and promising, the details of its implementation cover a broad range of problems and solutions, including various memory technologies, circuit topologies, and programming/processing algorithms. This Perspective aims at providing an orientation map across the wide topic of IMC. First, the memory technologies will be presented, including both conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-based and emerging resistive/memristive devices. Then, circuit architectures will be considered, describing their aim and application. Circuits include both popular crosspoint arrays and other more advanced structures, such as closed-loop memory arrays and ternary content-addressable memory. The same circuit might serve completely different applications, e.g., a crosspoint array can be used for accelerating matrix-vector multiplication for forward propagation in a neural network and outer product for backpropagation training. The different algorithms and memory properties to enable such diversification of circuit functions will be discussed. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities for IMC will be presented.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) has emerged as an indispensable methodology to describe, discover, and predict complex physical phenomena that efficiently help us learn underlying functional rules, especially in cases when conventional modeling approaches cannot be applied. While conventional feedforward neural networks are typically limited to performing tasks related to static patterns in data, recursive models can both work iteratively based on a changing input and discover complex dynamical relationships in the data. Deep language models can model flexible modalities of data and are capable of learning rich dynamical behaviors as they operate on discrete or continuous symbols that define the states of a physical system, yielding great potential toward end-to-end predictions. Similar to how words form a sentence, materials can be considered as a self-assembly of physically interacted building blocks, where the emerging functions of materials are analogous to the meaning of sentences. While discovering the fundamental relationships between building blocks and function emergence can be challenging, language models, such as recurrent neural networks and long-short term memory networks, and, in particular, attention models, such as the transformer architecture, can solve many such complex problems. Application areas of such models include protein folding, molecular property prediction, prediction of material failure of complex nonlinear architected materials, and also generative strategies for materials discovery. We outline challenges and opportunities, especially focusing on extending the deep-rooted kinship of humans with symbolism toward generalizable artificial intelligence (AI) systems using neuro-symbolic AI, and outline how tools such as ChatGPT and DALL·E can drive materials discovery.},
