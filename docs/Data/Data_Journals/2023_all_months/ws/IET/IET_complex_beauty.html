  abstract     = {This article reports a novel adaptive Sinc-based zooming technique. The theoretical basis of the zooming technique is the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula and the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. The technique can be used to zoom out, zoom in, and reconstruct two-dimensional images with no zoom. The technique introduces a novel concept called pixel-local-scaled k-space, which is calculated as follows. The k-space magnitude and the bandwidth of the image to zoom are calculated. The bandwidth of the frequency components of the image to zoom is estimated by the difference between the maximum and the minimum numerical value of the k-space magnitude. The ratio between the standardised k-space magnitude of the image and the bandwidth is calculated pixel-by-pixel, and is called pixel-local-scaled k-space. The signal is reconstructed using a finite convolution between image pixel intensities and Sinc functions. The zooming factor is consequential to the numerical difference between the pixel-local-scaled k-space and the sampling rate. The novelty of this zooming technique is to be adaptive because the pixel-local-scaled k-space is a pixel-by-pixel map, that is, an image with the same number of pixels as the departing image. Adaptive Sinc-based zooming is validated through the comparison with non-adaptive Sinc-based zooming, and its smoothing effect is compared to the smoothing of a variety of image space and z-space filters. The adaptive Sinc-based zooming technique achieves image zooming reconstruction using sampling rates within an extended range versus the range allowed by non-adaptive Sinc-based zooming.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in medical technology impose a limited number of devices for biomedical applications. A variety of techniques are being proposed to improve the performance of novel antenna designs in response to the rapid development of modern wireless technologies. A miniaturised microstrip antenna structure based on metamaterial (MTM) is presented here. The objective of this work is to present a high-directive antenna for wireless systems utilising MTM properties. Directivity is improved by the incorporation of the MTM structure on the ground structure. In order to improve the performance parameters of the antenna for medical applications, this study provides the design and analysis of a multiband patch antenna employing split-ring MTM. The split-ring resonator (SRR) MTM structures are embedded in a unique and novel way in the ground structure of the antenna. So that subwavelength modes get introduced in the patch cavity and a good performance characteristics is obtained. The reference antenna is a rectangular microstrip patch antenna exhibiting a directivity of 1.1823 dB that resonates at a frequency of 2.32 GHz. The optimised SRR MTM is positioned in the ground plane of the suggested antenna to increase the directivity of the antenna. This technology covers the frequency range between 2.24 and 3.96 GHz used for biomedical applications and the ultra-wideband (UWB) range from 4.48 to 9.08 GHz used for medical applications, industrial and scientific areas. The number of gaps of the rectangular-shaped SRRs is a key component of the enhancement of directivity from 1.1823 to 8.88823 dB.},

  abstract     = {The anaconda software required python code in order to run the utilized individual K-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest regression (RFR), and linear regression (LR) models. The results show that RFR machine learning (ML) technique out of the other utilized models shows the best performance for a used dataset. The findings of this article indicate that the dataset utilized proposed model provides an acceptable algorithm for FACC design and optimization. In the current study of preparation of geopolymer concrete (GPC), relevant variables such as curing, fly ash, calcined clay, added water, super plasticizer, coarse aggregate, quarry stone dust, caustic soda, and water glass were used as input parameters. The ranges, mode, median, standard deviation, and other identifying details were checked using descriptive statistical analysis for the input parameters. The strength due to the compression of FACC GPC was predicted using RFR, LR, and KNN ML techniques, all based on Python coding. The ensemble ML technique, RFR outperformed the individual ML technique, KNN, in terms of prediction. The RFR indicates that the maximum amount of R 2 is 0.92, and LR provides 0.58, although the KNN was less accurate, with a coefficient of determination of 0.56. The RFR technique’s lower values of errors, mean absolute error (MAE), MSE, and root mean square error (RMSE) yield 1.99, 7.17, and 2.67 MPa, respectively. The excellent accuracy of the RFR methodology is confirmed by a statistical analysis of errors. Curing temperature, curing hours, molarity of NaOH, and FACC ratio significantly affect the compressive strength (CS) of FACC GPC. The findings indicate that the proposed model provides an acceptable algorithm for FACC design and optimization using RFR among the three combinations of ML methods for a given dataset.},

The efficiency of the proposed alignment-free algorithm have been tested using Coronavirus datasets obtained from NCBI database, against established results from proven techniques. In the proposed approach, the nucleotide sequences are converted into numerical ones leveraging purine–pyrimidine mapping and a DNA walk is calculated to visually interpret them. Second-generation wavelet transform employing Cohen–Daubechies–Feauveau wavelet is applied to the numerical sequences of Coronavirus to determine the approximate coefficients. Approximate coefficients are used to cluster Coronavirus sequences using UPGMA phylogenetic tree for three different datasets of Coronaviruses comprising Coronavirus groups, Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs) and α – β – δ – γ Coronavirus genre. The proposed algorithm has successfully classified all the datasets with more than 97% of average accuracy compared in terms of complexity and accuracy against FFT, first-generation DWT, MEGA, and CLUSTAL-W. The obtained accuracy for Corona group is 100%, HCoV dataset is 100%, and for α – β – δ – γ CoV is 92%. The runtimes of the algorithm are 0.70, 1.22, and 0.63 sec for the respective Coronavirus datasets.},

Nonconventional means of machining have gained popularity keeping focus on the challenging machining circumstances that are well-known for their very precision and machining accuracy, no matter what type, shape, or hardness is being machined.

In today’s industrial landscape, striving for excellence involves minimising casting defects to zero and enhancing mechanical characteristics. To comprehend the enhancement in microstructure and mechanical properties of castings, this experimental study examines the influence of mechanical mould vibration on the solidification of A356 alloy. The casting process involves a frequency of 50 Hz. To evaluate the effect of vibration during casting, a comparison is made between a casting without mould vibration and its corresponding mechanical properties.

It advantages the material to have higher hardness and better sensitivity to phase transformation. One of the machining techniques that is preferred to cut hard material is electrical discharge machining (EDM). This study aims to examine the fatigue characteristics of a NiTi60 alloy that has undergone electro-discharge machining and examine the impact of machining parameters on microstructural changes. In this investigation first, the influence of EDM process parameters such as pulse current, voltage, pulse on time, and pulse off time on surface integrity aspects was investigated. Second, the impact of these process variables on fatigue strength was examined. The surface integrity parameters of EDM-machined specimens, such as microcracks, surface crack density (SCD), white layer thickness (WLT), and residual stress formation have been examined by various characterization techniques. The obtained results show that pulse current and voltage are dominating factors affecting SCD. The thickness of the white layer seems to be increased with the rise in the pulse current and pulse on time, and tensile kinds of residual stresses are present in the WLT region, whose magnitude is dependent on process parameters. The fatigue tests were performed using a servo hydraulic testing machine at a frequency of 20 Hz for 106 number of cycles. The fatigue crack initiation, propagation, and effects of process parameters have been examined. It has been found that an increase in pulse current and voltage leads to the generation of microvoids in the WLT region and thereby causes fatigue cracks to take birth. Later on, a correlation between WLT and SCD was observed by implementing an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The accuracy of ANN model prediction is reported to be high, where WLT and SCD have a 0.98 observed correlation coefficient.},

  abstract     = {Conductive hydrogels are emerging as an advanced electronic platform for wearable sensors by synergizing the advantageous features of conductivity and flexibility. Especially conductive polymer hydrogels have widespread applications in the fields of catalysis, biomedicine, monitoring, and wearable electronic skin owing to the outstanding strain sensitivity and resilience thereof. Nevertheless, how to maintain the conductivity of hydrogels and electronic skins under strain or deformation remains a significant challenge. To tackle the said bottleneck, a multiple H-bonding MXene-based conductive hydrogel was established in the present study. With the participation of MXene and Fe 2 + ions, the hydrogel network was strengthened, which might be attributed to the H-bonding among the polymer chain, MXene, and Fe 2 + ions. Meanwhile, the elongation at break and compression modulus of Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)- M3F hydrogels increased to 513% and 85.6 kPa compared with the initial PVA hydrogel, respectively. After incorporating Fe 2 + ions, the PVA-M3F hydrogels exhibited greater conductivity, which was 7 . 9 × 1 0 − 4 S/cm. Notably, the PVA-M3F hydrogels displayed good resilience, leading to stable conductivity and strain sensitivity. Subsequently, a finger joint was designed to verify the maintenance of conductivity and monitoring behaviors. PVA-M3F conductive hydrogel was found to possess an outstanding capability for electrical signals feedback and was expected to be applied to electronic sensors or monitors. In summary, the introduction of MXene and Fe 2 + ions into PVA hydrogels can not only tune the conductivity but also have promising prospects as a countermeasure for wearable electronics.},

This paper explains the empirical results of the selection of appropriate cutting settings that assure lower power consumption in high-end Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines. An experiment employing the Taguchi methodology on an extruded W-Al- Si-C rod was performed on a CNC lathe with cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut as the process parameters. The performance characteristics (energy usage) were quantified by a data collection system. Minor energy process parameters were selected after data analysis. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the worth of the chosen methodology. A total of 350 rpm, 0.37 mm/rev feed rate, and 1 mm of cut depth produced the best MRR result. The maximum material removal rate (MRR) is obtained at lower levels of spindle speed and depth of cut, i.e., 1.452 g/sec.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly disease with a poor prognosis, there is therefore a crucial need for novel therapeutic targets. Current preclinical models of GBM fail to predict clinical outcomes, thus, new translationally relevant models are urgently needed for reliable therapeutic target validation. 3D spheroid culture of cancer cells has been shown to better reflect tumour biology than 2D monolayer culture, as has culturing cells in flow-based microfluidic devices, which mimic key aspects of the tumour microenvironment. Gene knockdown by siRNA is a key preclinical target validation tool, however, siRNA-mediated knockdown of cancer spheroids in microfluidic culture has not yet been demonstrated. Here we describe a simple and robust microfluidic device that can maintain GBM spheroids (U87 cells) for at least 7 days. Via RNA sequencing analysis, we demonstrate that spheroids grown in microfluidic culture are more proliferative than spheroids grown in static plate culture and downregulate genes associated with cell adhesion, potentially offering insights into the metastatic process. Comparison of target gene ( PRMT2 and RAB21 ) knockdown using siRNA between 2D monolayer cultured cells, static spheroid culture and spheroids maintained in the microfluidic device showed that gene expression (as measured by quantitative-PCR) was significantly reduced in all culture systems. Knockdown was most efficient in cells grown in 2D monolayer culture followed by static spheroid culture, but we also demonstrate ∼ 4 0 % knockdown efficiency using the microfluidic device. In summary, this study describes an easy-to-use microfluidic culture platform and provides evidence that pre-clinical siRNA-mediated target validation studies will be possible in flow systems that mimic tumour physiology.},

The potential effects of pharmaceutical agents on fetus have made concerns about their use and require more studies to address these concerns. A placenta-on-a-chip model was fabricated and tested for transport of naltrexone (NTX) and its primary metabolite 6 β -naltrexol. The NTX/6 β -naltrexol transported from the maternal channel to the fetal channel was then collected from the fetal channel. To evaluate the behavior of neural cells following exposure to NTX and 6 β -naltrexol, perfusate from the fetal channel was directed toward the cultured N27 neural cells. Neural cells exposed to the transported NTX/6 β -naltrexol were then evaluated for gene expression and cell viability. Results showed significantly higher fold changes in IL-6 and TNF- α expression when exposed to NTX/6 β -naltrexol. However, a lower fold change in IL-1 β expression was observed, while it remained the same in sphingosine kinase (sphk)1. Also, cell viability with NTX/6 β -naltrexol exposure was determined to be significantly lower ( p &lt; 0 . 0 0 1 ). This study has the potential to reveal the impact of pharmaceutical agents on the developing neural system of fetuses and their premature brains.},

  abstract     = {In modern manufacturing industries, automated machining systems have become a necessity. However, optimizing resource utilization and achieving a good surface finish remain challenging tasks. Excessive tool usage and poor surface finish are common problems encountered in turning centers, which affect productivity and product quality. In this research, we propose an approach that leverages automation and machine learning techniques to maximize tool use and improve surface finish. Our objective is to investigate the relationship between tool life and surface roughness and to develop a method that can optimize cutting parameters for turning centers. We have conducted an experimental study to evaluate the proposed approach, which involves the automatic determination of cutting parameters based on machine learning algorithms, and concluded a cutting speed of 43.10 m/min, the surface finish achieved for aluminum material was 1.98 μ m. In the case of mild steel material, the surface finish was 12 μ m at a cutting speed of 25.13 m/min. Similarly, for cast iron material, the surface finish was 8.45 μ m at a cutting speed of 30.16 m/min. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional manual method in terms of surface finish, tool usage, and machining time. Our approach can be applied to other machining systems, providing a practical and effective solution to improve the efficiency and quality of machining processes. This paper presents an experiment that explores the relationship between tool life and surface roughness. Furthermore, an automated approach is proposed for eliminating G code in machining, which can improve the efficiency of machine tools and result in a better surface finish. Objective: To maximize tool use and improve surface finish in turning centers by incorporating automation and machine learning. Idea: This research aims to explore the use of automation and machine learning in turning centers to optimize the cutting parameters and achieve a better surface finish. Description of the idea: The study was conducted by performing experiments on three different materials, i.e., aluminum, mild steel, and cast iron. The cutting parameters, including spindle speed, feed, and depth of cut, were controlled by a programmable logic controller (PLC) integrated with a tachometer and Vernier scale. The surface finish was measured using a surface roughness tester, and the data was analyzed using a supervised machine learning algorithm.},

Despite its rapid growth over the past decade, the acceptance of hybrid AM within the industry has been limited due to various constraints. To achieve industrial acceptance, it is necessary to address the challenges and limitations of AM. As an effort to mitigate environmental concerns, manufacturers have recently started to explore integrating additional and secondary production methods into their manufacturing processes. Integrated production solutions have shown promise in overcoming present-day barriers in production systems by utilizing the best available integration technology. In this context, this article focuses on three critical points in the manufacturing sector. First, recent developments in the integration of AM processes have been significant. Second, integrated technical planning has been improved, which is essential for the successful implementation of hybrid manufacturing. Finally, there is a growing need to understand the mixed supplement production industry that combines both traditional and AM techniques. Thus, it is essential to emphasize advances in AM processes, integrated technical planning, and mixed supplement production industry to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving manufacturing sector.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has come a long way since its initial inception. Previously considered a fast prototyping method, it offers significant benefits for use as a method of producing user-end parts that are limited in quantity, customizable, and/or complicated geometries. For AM to be considered in high-performance applications, such as automotive and aerospace, we must consider AM technology and the available and compatible printing materials. Typically only thermoset plastic resins are capable of meeting high-performance specifications, such as sufficiently high strength, stiffness, and toughness, as well as excellent chemical and environmental resistance. This review presents a broad overview of the available high-performance thermoset chemistries and formulations, i.e., resin blends. The base resin chemistries that are covered are: vinyl, epoxy, imides, cyanate ester, urethanes, benzoxazine, and click chemistries (e.g., Michael addition). Subsequently, more application-relevant blends of these base resins are discussed. Each section focuses on resin details such as reaction mechanisms, typical monomer structure, mechanical properties, and applications specific to AM. The review is organized as follows. We begin with an introduction on the state-of-the-art, the challenges still faced by the field, and a benchmark definition of “high performance.” This is followed by a discussion of the available AM technologies for thermoset printing, with a focus on their advantages and disadvantages. Next, we cover the details of different resin chemistry, followed by their blends. The following section details the difficulties in developing AM technologies that allow for the incorporation of fillers, such as rheological modifiers and reinforcements. The review ends with a perspective on the future of AM technologies that would bridge the gap between pure resin printing and the much needed composite printing for high-performance applications.},

Moreover, a series of numerical analyses using finite element modelling (FEM) is conducted to provide insight into the mechanical behaviour of such modular columns and beams. Apart from the cost-saving, CE and social impact benefits of the proposed elements, the results indicate that modular structural elements incorporating flowline have shown very high axial, shear and flexural capacities, which make them suitable to be used in high-rising buildings, bridges, etc. The proposed elements can be a solution to decommission and reuse the flexible flowline on a large scale in construction.},

  abstract     = {Dental disease evaluation and clinical assessment are frequently accomplished through radiographic penetration. The difficulty of obtaining an accurate clinical diagnosis from radiographs rises due to the minimal mineral density change in demineralized tissue of tooth and gum disorders. Dental abnormalities may not be visible on radiographs until the demineralization is higher than 40%, according to the literature. As a result, a dental practitioner’s judgment can have a big impact on how accurately the radiography penetration depth is determined through visual inspection. To counteract this effect, image processing-based clinical diagnosis methods have become widely adopted, transforming dentistry from traditional to advance in recent years. The efforts made in the area of image processing-based digital dental diagnosis of the most challenging dental issues are outlined in the presented comprehensive literature evaluation, which also identifies any research gaps in the scope of work already done. The included studies’ quality was evaluated using Quality Assessment and Diagnostic Accuracy Tool-2 (QUADAS-2). A total of 52 out of 178 articles, published from 2012 to February 2023, were reviewed and data like image-processing approach, the size of datasets, approach results, advantages and disadvantages, name(s) of diagnosed diseases, imaging type, author, and publication year were extracted. Results show that, in 52 studies, more than 14 image-processing approaches were used on different types of radiographs for the diagnosis of a single or more than one disease by a single approach with an accuracy range from 64% to 93%. Most studies have used artificial intelligence (AI) for computer-aided diagnosis and used dental experts to label their dataset and validate the outcome of proposed methods. Efforts done by different research groups for image processing-based digital diagnosis are appreciable but still, they are lagging to meet clinically expected accuracy. There looks to be a great requirement for the development or standardization of existing methodology and it is also needed to construct standard public dental datasets to attract a greater number of research groups in the dental field.},
