  abstract     = {The effectiveness of machine learning approaches depends on the quality of the data representation. In fact, some representations may mislead such learning approaches upon concealing relevant explanatory variables. Although feature engineering, that utilizes domain knowledge and/or expert supervision, yields typical data representation techniques, generic unsupervised feature learning represents an even more objective alternative to determine relevant attributes and generate optimal feature spaces. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy unsupervised feature learning approach (FUL) that automatically derives new features by revealing the intrinsic structure of the data. In fact, FUL exploits the clusters and the associated fuzzy memberships generated by a fuzzy C-means algorithm, and devises new basis functions and their corresponding representation. The experiments results showed that FUL overtakes relevant state of the art approaches. It yielded the highest F1-measure with an improvement of 8%, 11%, 3%, and 4% on Parkinson, Epilepsy, Gait, and breast cancer datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, rainfall prediction has received major attention in research areas because of its demanding applications in pollution control management and flood control management. Despite having numerous learning-based approaches to calculate future rainfall trends, it remains inefficient to predict rainfall occurrences by learning linear and nonlinear data patterns of historical weather information (i.e., exact prediction value is complicated to be predicted). These complications are addressed with the evolution of stochastic models which have a greater ability to minimize prediction bias and represent long-term weather variability. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel modified stochastic fuzzy Aquila (MSFA) algorithm to make precise predictions regarding future trends by evaluating rainfall time series data. The proposed MSFA algorithm is applied in rainfall prediction applications in evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic model. Here, 10 features of the open weather dataset collected from Tamil Nadu are provided as input for the proposed rainfall prediction design. The data inconsistencies such as undesirable format and missing values are structured using preprocessing procedures, namely data arrangement, null value removal, and data partitioning. The preprocessed data are fed into the proposed MSFA algorithm which learns the data features more precisely and predicts the probable occurrence of rainfall. To evaluate the performances of the proposed MSFA algorithm, the metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination, root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are analyzed. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed MSFA algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of all metrics.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the rapid development of mobile devices and embedded system raises a demand for intelligent models to address increasingly complicated problems. However, the complexity of the structure and extensive parameters press significantly on efficiency, storage space, and energy consumption. Additionally, the explosive growth of tasks with enormous model structures and parameters makes it impossible to compress models manually. Thus, a standardized and effective model compression solution achieving lightweight neural networks is established as an urgent demand by the industry. Accordingly, Dynamic Channel Ranking Strategy (DCRS) method is proposed to compress deep convolutional neural networks. DCRS selects channels with high contribution of each prunable layer according to compression ratio searched by reinforcement learning agent. Compared with current model compression methods, DCRS efficaciously applies various channel ranking strategies on prunable layers. Experiments indicate with a 50% compression ratio, compressed MobileNet achieved 70.62% top1 and 88.2% top5 accuracy on ImageNet, and compressed ResNet achieved 92.03% accuracy on CIFAR-10. DCRS reduces more FLOPS in these neural networks. The compressed model achieves the best Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy on ResNet50, the best Top-1 accuracy on MobilNetV1.},

In this work, we approach this forecast problem for the weekly wholesale food price index in the Chinese market during a 10-year period of January 1, 2010–January 3, 2020. To facilitate the analysis, we propose the use of the nonlinear auto-regressive neural network. Technically, we investigate forecast performance, based upon the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) as the evaluation metrics, corresponding to one hundred and twenty settings that cover different algorithms for model estimations, numbers of hidden neurons and delays, and ratios for splitting the data. Our experimental result suggests the construction of the neural network with three delays and 10 hidden neurons, which is trained through the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, as the forecast model. It leads to high accuracy and stabilities with the RRMSEs of 1.93% for the training phase, 2.16% for the validation phase, and 1.95% for the testing phase. Comparisons of forecast accuracy between the proposed model and some other machine learning models, as well as traditional time-series econometric models, suggest that our proposed model leads to statistically significant better performance. Our results could benefit different forecast users, such as policymakers and various market participants, in policy analysis and market assessments.},

  abstract     = {As the popularity of wireless networks deepens, the diversity of device types and hardware environments makes network data take on heterogeneous forms while the threat of malicious attacks from outside can prevent ordinary methods from mining information from abnormal data. In view of this, the research will be devoted to the feature processing of the anomalous data itself, and the convolutional operation of the anomalous information by the convolutional neural network (CNN). This is to extract the internal information. In the first step of the cascaded CNNs, the dimensions of the anomaly data will be processed, the anomaly data will be sorted under the concept of relevance grouping, and then the sorted results will be added to the convolution and pooling. The performance test uses three datasets with different feature capacities as the attack sources, and the results show a 13.22% improvement in information mining performance compared to the standard CNN. The extended CNN step will perform feature identification for homologous or similar network threats, with feature expansion within the convolutional layer first, and then pooling to reduce the computational cost. The test results show that when the maximum value domain of linear expansion is 2, the model has the best feature recognition performance, fluctuating around 85%; The model comparison test results show that the accuracy of the extended CNN is higher than that of the standard CNN, and the model stability is better than that of the back propagation (BP) neural network. This indicates that the cascaded CNN dual module can mine for the data itself, thus ignoring the risk unknowns, and this connected CNN has some practical significance. The proposed cascaded CNN module applies advanced neural network technology to identify internal and external risk data. The research content has important reference value for the security management of IoT systems.},

Searching maximal exact match is among the most used tasks in sequence searching within a larger DNA sequence or database. Many exact algorithms have been designed to deal with this problem. The best improvements made by these algorithms have led to a time and space complexity of O ( n ) and they remain practically less effective for large sequences. Heuristic methods will therefore be a good alternative to implement. In this work, we present an efficient heuristic algorithm based on PSO metaheuristic to deal with the problem of searching the maximal exact match of small searched sequences in large ones. The time and space complexity of the designed algorithm is of O (1). The experimental results showed the efficiency of the proposed search algorithm for finding maximal exact match in large sequences when compared with two other sequence searching algorithms.},

Traditionally, the most used algorithms in text classification are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Bi-Gated Recurrent Neural Network (BiGRU). For CNN, it can extract the feature form the neighbors, and a softmax layer is followed for classification. The global feature is not included in the CNN model. LSTM introduces the gate, which can capture the information before the node. BiGRU is developed from LSTM, and it can find the features in the context. So compared to LSTM, BiGRU not only includes the information before, but also can capture the following features. Thus, LSTM and BiGRU can extract the global features, but cannot capture the local features. In order to deal with this weakness, we proposed a fusion model for comments classification, which combines the CNN and BiGRU in our model. Different from other methods, CNN and BiGRU are parallelly connected. CNN model can extract the local feature, and BiGRU can find the global feature. Then we concatenate the two kinds of features and feed to recognition layer for classification. Then we use our model to classify the telephone comments; compared with the traditional machine SVM and tow deep neural models — CNN and BiGRU — our model performed better.},

Traditional gene selection methods cannot achieve satisfactory classification results. In this study, we propose a novel multi-target hybrid gene selection method named RMOGA (ReliefF Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm), which aims to select a few genes and obtain good tumor recognition accuracy. RMOGA consists of two phases. Firstly, ReliefF is used to select the top 5% subset of genes from the original datasets. Secondly, a multi-objective genetic algorithm searches for the optimal gene subset from the gene subset obtained by the ReliefF method. To verify the validity of RMOGA, we conducted extensive experiments on 11 available microarray datasets and compared the proposed method with other previous methods. Two classical classifiers including Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine were used to measure the classification performance of all comparison methods. Experimental results show that the RMOGA algorithm can yield significantly better results than previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and the number of selected genes.},

Then, based on the DenseAttentionNet, a few-shot learning algorithm called Meta-DenseAttention is presented to balance the model parameters and the classification effect. The dense connection and attention mechanism are combined to meet the requirements of fewer parameters and to achieve a good classification effect for the first time . The experimental results show that the DenseAttentionNet, not only reduces the number of parameters by 55% but also outperforms other classic backbones in the classification effect compared with the ResNet-12 benchmark. In addition, Meta-DenseAttention has an accuracy of 56.57% (5way-1shot) and 72.73% (5way-5shot) on the miniImageNet, although the number of parameters is only 3.6 M.

Image manipulation, particularly image colorization, has become easier, making it harder to differentiate between fake colorized images and actual images. Furthermore, the RGB space is no longer considered to be the best option for color-based detection techniques due to the high correlation between channels and its blending of luminance and chrominance information. This paper proposes a new approach for fake colorized image detection based on a novel image representation created by combining color information from three separate color spaces (HSV, Lab, and Ycbcr) and selecting the most different channels from each color space to reconstruct the image. Features from the proposed image representation are extracted based on transfer learning using the pre-trained CNNs ResNet50 model. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach has been used for classification purposes due to its high ability for generalization. Our experiments indicate that our proposed models outperform other state-of-the-art fake colorized image detection methods in several aspects.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the strong and outstanding development of the Internet, the need to refer to the feedback of previous customers when shopping online is increasing. Therefore, websites are developed to allow users to share experiences, reviews, comments and feedback about the services and products of businesses and organizations. The organizations also collect user feedback about their products and services to give better directions. However, with a large amount of user feedback about certain services and products, it is difficult for users, businesses, and organizations to pay attention to them all. Thus, an automatic system is necessary to analyze the sentiment of a customer feedback. Recently, the well-known pre-trained language models for Vietnamese (PhoBERT) achieved high performance in comparison with other approaches. However, this method may not focus on the local information in the text like phrases or fragments. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on PhoBERT for sentiment classification. The output of contextualized embeddings of the PhoBERT’s last four layers is fed into the CNN. This makes the network capable of obtaining more local information from the sentiment. Besides, the PhoBERT output is also given to the transformer encoder layers in order to employ the self-attention technique, and this also makes the model more focused on the important information of the sentiment segments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach gives competitive performance compared to the existing studies on three public datasets with the opinions of Vietnamese people.},

  abstract     = {How to utilize symbolic knowledge in deep learning is an important problem. Deep neural networks are flexible and powerful, while symbolic knowledge has the virtue of interpretability and intuitiveness. It is necessary to combine the two together to inject symbolic knowledge into neural networks. We propose a novel approach to combine neural networks with logic rules. In this approach, task-specific supervised learning and policy-based reinforcement learning are performed alternately to train a neural model until convergence. The basic idea is to use supervised learning to train a deep model and use reinforcement learning to propel the deep model to meet logic rules. In the process of the policy gradient reinforcement learning, if a predicted output of a deep model meets all logical rules, the deep model is given a positive reward, otherwise, it is given a negative reward. By maximizing the expected rewards, the deep model can be gradually adjusted to meet logical constraints. We conduct experiments on the tasks of named entity recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

The fire data are transmitted to the main controller through LoRa wireless module and fused by back propagation neural network, which is self-learning and adaptive. The output of neural network and fuzzy inference with other factors are used for decision criteria to improve the identification accuracy.

  abstract     = {In the modern capital market, the price of a stock is often considered to be highly volatile and unpredictable because of various social, financial, political and other dynamic factors. With calculated and thoughtful investment, stock market can ensure a handsome profit with minimal capital investment, while incorrect prediction can easily bring catastrophic financial loss to the investors. This paper introduces the application of a recently introduced machine learning model — the transformer model, to predict the future price of stocks of Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), the leading stock exchange in Bangladesh. The transformer model has been widely leveraged for natural language processing and computer vision tasks, but, to the best of our knowledge, has never been used for stock price prediction task task using DSE data. Recently, the introduction of time2vec encoding to represent the time series features has made it possible to employ the transformer model for the stock price prediction. This paper aims to leverage these two effective techniques to discover forecasting ability on the volatile stock market of DSE. We deal with the historical daily and weekly data of eight specific stocks listed in DSE. Our experiments demonstrate promising results and acceptable root-mean-squared error on most of the stocks. We also compare the performance of our model with that of a well-known benchmark stock forecasting model called ARIMA and report satisfactory results.},

The classification accuracy of the GWO–DBN model reached 75.67%. The experimental results demonstrate the reliability of the GWO–DBN model.

Still, the existing methods do not make further special research on group photos. Therefore, we propose a new concept of group photo styling based on analyzing group photos and photographic theory. Besides that, by comparing and analyzing many group photos, we classify the group photos into five categories. In this paper, the main factors of the head and pose are considered simultaneously, and the method of Group Photo Styling Classification (GPSC) can classify different group photos automatically. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we collected a Group Photo Styling Dataset (GPSD). The dataset contains 998 group photo images, and each image’s group photo styling category is marked. The experimental results on GPSD show that the fusion of head features and pose features can classify different group photos well. The accuracy of GPSC reaches 93.9%, much higher than the previous classification model.},

Such medical data can be invested in numerous visual recognition applications. In this context, these data may be segmented to generate a precise 3D representation of an organ that may be visualized and manipulated to aid surgeons during surgical interventions. Notably, the segmentation process is performed manually through the use of image processing software. Within this framework, multiple outstanding approaches were elaborated. However, the latter proved to be inefficient and required human intervention to opt for the segmentation area appropriately. Over the last few years, automatic methods which are based on deep learning approaches have outperformed the state-of-the-art segmentation approaches due to the use of the relying on Convolutional Neural Networks. In this paper, a segmentation of preoperative patients CT scans based on deep learning architecture was carried out to determine the target organ’s shape. As a result, the segmented 2D CT images are used to generate the patient-specific biomechanical 3D model. To assess the efficiency and reliability of the proposed approach, the 3DIRCADb dataset was invested. The segmentation results were obtained through the implementation of a U-net architecture with good accuracy.},

Like experienced human drivers, the self-driving vehicle needs to perceive the interaction of surrounding vehicles and decide the best trajectory from many choices. However, previous methods either lack modeling of interactions or ignore the multi-modal nature of this problem. In this paper, we focus on two important cues of trajectory prediction: interaction and maneuver, and propose Maneuver conditioned Attentional Network named MAN. MAN learns the interactions of all vehicles in a scenario in parallel by self-attention social pooling and the attentional decoder generates the future trajectory conditioned on the predicted maneuver among 3 classes: Lane Changing Left (LCL), Lane Changing Right (LCR) and Lane Keeping (LK). Experiments demonstrate the improvement of our model in prediction on the publicly available NGSIM and HighD datasets. We also present quantitative analysis to study the relationship between maneuver prediction accuracy and trajectory error.},

WVSSs are vulnerable to jamming attacks creating an unwanted denial of service. Hence, it is essential to secure this system from jamming attacks. In this paper, three models of IoT-fuzzy inference system-based jamming detection system are proposed for detecting and countermeasure the presence of jamming by computing two jamming detection metrics; PDR and PLR, and based on the result, the system countermeasures this attack by storing the video feed locally in the subsystem nodes. FIS models are based on Mamdani, Tsukamoto, and Sugeno fuzzy logic which optimizes the jamming detection metrics for detecting the jamming attack. The efficiency of these proposed models is compared in detecting jamming signals. The experimental results show that the proposed Tsukamoto model detects jamming attacks with high accuracy and efficiency.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the internet of services has been more responsive to access through the development of various application program interfaces (API). Accessing an HTTP uniform resource locator (URL) contains malicious software intended by the attacker to create security breaches through the use of APIs from various services on the internet. By default, the non-attentive URL downloads and installs malware in the background without the user’s knowledge. The host does not analyze the API-URL security certificate contract due to the feature access by the user. Therefore, the current Machine Learning (ML) techniques only check malware signatures and certificates rather than analyzing URL behaviour based on the impact of a URL accessed from the internet. To address this problem, we propose a novel intelligent malicious software based on URL-API intensity feature selection (IFS) and deep spectral neural classification (DSNC) for improving Host Security. Initially, the URL — successive certificate signing (SCS) of the user link accessibility is verified based on API download rate logs. This system identifies the best malware software. The Link Redirection Stability Rate (LRSR) is estimated based on the Redirection URL by accessing the direct link and redirect link. The domain transformation matrix (DTM) was created to create a pattern to access successive features. URL-API Intensity Feature Selection selects each estimated feature, and the selected features are based on soft-max logical activation with a recurrent neural network (RNN) optimized for deep learning. RNN is trained in the spectral domain for improving computation and efficiency. It predicts the class based on the risk of malicious weight to categorize class by reference. The proposed IFS-DSNC achieves accuracy of 95.6% than the other algorithms such as KNN, NB, CNN, LCS, GCRNC AGSCR. The experimental result shows that the proposed method provides better performance in finding malware software than the existing approaches, thereby improving the security against host breaching.},

  abstract     = {Grey Wolf optimizer (GWO) has been used in several fields of research. The main advantages of this algorithm are its simplicity, little controlling parameter, and adaptive exploratory behavior. However, similar to other metaheuristic algorithms, the GWO algorithm has several limitations. The main drawback of the GWO algorithm is its low capability to handle a multimodal search landscape. This drawback occurs because the alpha, beta, and gamma wolves tend to converge to the same solution. This paper presents HDGM – a novel hybrid optimization model of dragonfly algorithm and grey wolf optimizer, aiming to overcome the disadvantages of GWO algorithm. Dragonfly algorithm (DA) is combined with GWO in this study because DA has superior exploration ability, which allows it to search in promising areas in the search space. To verify the solution quality and performance of the HDGM algorithm, we used twenty-three test functions to compare the proposed model’s performance with that of the GWO, DA, particle swam optimization (PSO) and ant lion optimization (ALO). The results show that the hybrid algorithm provides more competitive results than the other variants in terms of solution quality, stability, and capacity to discover the global optimum.},

  abstract     = {Multi-focus images can be fused by the deep learning (DL) approach. Initially, multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) is used to perform the classification task. The classifier of the convolutional neural network (CNN) is implemented to determine whether the pixel is defocused or focused. The lack of available data to train the system is one of the demerits of the MFIF methodology. Instead of using MFIF, the unsupervised model of the DL approach is affordable and appropriate for image fusion. By establishing a framework of feature extraction, fusion, and reconstruction, we generate a Deep CNN of N End-to-End Unsupervised Model. It is defined as a Siamese Multi-Scale feature extraction model. It can extract only three different source images of the same scene, which is the major disadvantage of the system. Due to the possibility of low intensity and blurred images, considering only three source images may lead to poor performance. The main objective of the work is to consider n parameters to define n source images. Many existing systems are compared to the proposed method for extracting features from images. Experimental results of various approaches show that Enhanced Siamese Multi-Scale feature extraction used along with Structure Similarity Measure (SSIM) produces an excellent fused image. It is determined by undergoing quantitative and qualitative studies. The analysis is done based on objective examination and visual traits. By increasing the parameters, the objective assessment increases in performance rate and complexity with time.},

  abstract     = {Sign Language is the natural language used by a community that is hearing impaired. It is necessary to convert this language to a commonly understandable form as it is used by a comparatively small part of society. The automatic Sign Language interpreters can convert the signs into text or audio by interpreting the hand movements and the corresponding facial expression. These two modalities work in tandem to give complete meaning to each word. In verbal communication, emotions can be conveyed by changing the tone and pitch of the voice, but in sign language, emotions are expressed using nonmanual movements that include body posture and facial muscle movements. Each such subtle moment should be considered as a feature and extracted using different models. This paper proposes three different models that can be used for varying levels of sign language. The first test was carried out using the Convex Hull-based Sign Language Recognition (SLR) finger spelling sign language, next using a Convolution Neural Network-based Sign Language Recognition (CNN-SLR) for fingerspelling sign language, and finally pose-based SLR for word-level sign language. The experiments show that the pose-based SLR model that captures features using landmark or key points has better SLR accuracy than Convex Hull and CNN-based SLR models.},

The impact will be more influenced in healthcare management. This research aims to detect the rumors and identify the sources using deep learning algorithms. In our proposed system, after pre-processing, the tweet comments are extracted from topics and ranked as deny, support, query and comment. Then the comments are classified as positive, negative and neutral using Artificial Neural Network Neuro-fuzzy Inference System Spline-based pi-shaped Membership Function (ANISPIMF). Then the negative comments are classified into offensive, violence, misogyny and hate mongering by using Improved Deep Learning Neural Network (IDLNN) which is the combination of Deep Neural Network with Cuckoo Search–Flower Pollination Algorithm to optimize the weight values. The optimized ANISPIMF performs very well for the COVID-19 dataset in terms of Accuracy, Precision and Recall. The proposed system attains better performance and efficiency when weighted against prevailing methodologies — regarding the performance measures, there is an improvement of accuracy by 0.6%, recall by 0.7%, and precision by 1%, together with an F 1-score of 1.2% than the Multiloss Hierarchical Bi-LSTM with Attenuation Factor (MHA).},

Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN) will offer mobile users with a huge amount of available bandwidth. Due to spectrum management issues such as spectrum sensing and sharing, CRN networks pose some challenges. Hence in this paper, Adaptive Rider Optimization (AROA) is developed to improve the energy efficiency for different spectrum sensing conditions. The proposed algorithm is utilized to compute the sensing time, sequence length, and detection threshold. In order to detect the spectrum with optimal values of transmission power and sensing bandwidth, the AROA uses the adaptive threshold detection method. The spectrum sensing and sharing of the CRN network are achieved with the help of the AROA algorithm. The proposed method is implemented in MATLAB and the performances such as Normalized Energy consumption, delay, SNR, Jitter, blocking probability, convergence analysis, and Throughput are evaluated. The proposed method is contrasted with the existing methods such as Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), respectively.},

However, there would be a need to enhance the functionality of prior methodologies. In this proposed model, a unique fusion model depending upon optimal thresholding and deep learning approaches are presented. An enhanced monarch butterfly optimization (EMBO) determines an optimal threshold with fusion rules as in shearlet transform. The efficiency of the fusion process mainly depends on the fusion rule and the optimization of the fusion rule can improve the efficiency of the fusion. The extraction element of the deep learning approach was then utilized to fuse high- and low-frequency sub-bands. The fusion technique was carried out using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The studies were carried out for MRI and CT images.

  abstract     = {Mining patterns from High-utility itemsets (HUIs) have been exploited recently in place of frequent itemset mining (FIMs) or association-rule mining (ARMs) as they highlight profitability of products where quantity and profits are taken into account. Several techniques for HUIs have been proposed and they encounter exponential search spaces which have more distinct items or voluminous databases. Alternatively, Evolutionary Computations (ECs)-based meta-heuristics algorithms can be effective in solving issues in HUIs since a set of near-optimal solutions can be obtained within restricted periods. Current ECs-based techniques consume more time to identify HUIs in transactional databases, discover unacceptable combinations of HUIs, and finally fail to discover HUIs when neighborhood searches are not executed locally and globally. To overcome these challenges, a HUI mining algorithm based on Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) using multiple strategies including elitism, population diversifications, exclusive preservations, and neighborhood exploration techniques has been proposed. Thus, this work defines mining patterns based on DE and PSO to identify HUIs in voluminous transactional databases. The HUIM-DE-PSO-DE algorithm proposed in this work discovers more number of HUIs which is revealed in experimental results obtained from a set of benchmark data instances. Results are compared with existing approaches using several performance metrics including convergence speeds, minimum utility threshold values, and execution time consumed.},

Existing research work proposed energy competence with trust as well as Quality of Service (QoS) multipath routing protocol for improving network lifetime and other QoS parameters, selection criteria for multipath. However, this protocol has some limitations, such as scalability, data redundancy, bandwidth utilization, and network traffic. The most important challenge lies in managing the voluminous data produced by the network’s sensors. As a result of this study, Intelligent Data Fusion Techniques (IDFTs) were presented, which can greatly minimize redundant data, decrease the quantity of transmitting data, broaden the network life cycle, enhance bandwidth utilization, and therefore, resolve the energy and bandwidth usage bottleneck. This paper proposes Improved Whale Optimization Algorithms (IWOAs) for intelligent data fusion where the amount of data collected from sensor sources is reduced and the information offered is enhanced by duplicate data, which also increases data dependability. IWOAs are used to combine the actual information from the cluster’s sensor nodes at the sink node, resulting in increased information and the ability to make local judgments about the particular events. The sink node transmits local decisions to base station on a regular basis that combines the local decisions and provides the ultimate judgment, easing the pressure on the base station to evaluate all of the data. As per the results obtained, the proposed intelligent data fusion method significantly increases the network’s robustness and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANET) allow for an ad-hoc networking among Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), have recently gained popularity in a variety of military and non-militant applications. The existing work used the Glowworm Swarm Optimization (GSO) algorithm to create a self-organization depending on clustering technique for FANET. Owing to UAV increased mobility, network topology might vary over time, providing route discovery and maintenance is one of the most difficult tasks. And also, the network throughput is still more worsened by the network congestion. To solve this problem, the proposed work designed an energy efficient clustering and fuzzy-based path selection for FANET. In this work, initially, the clustering is performed using the UAV distance. For efficient communication and energy consumption, optimal selection of Cluster Head (CH) is performed by using Adaptive Mutation with Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (AMTLBO) algorithm. To improve the optimal selection of CH nodes, the best fitness values are calculated. The fitness function depends on Link capacity, remaining energy and neighbor UAV distance. Next to that, nodes begin communications as well as transmit their information to their CH. Improved Fuzzy-based Routing (IFR) is introduced for improving the route discovery process. The goal is to find routes that have a high level of flying autonomy, minimal mobility, and a higher Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). As a result, the energy usage of network is decreased, as well as the cluster’s lifespan is extended. Finally, an adaptive and reliable congestion detection mechanism is introduced to transmit the packets with congestion free path. The experimental result shows that the proposed AMTLBO system attains higher performance compared to the existing system in terms of energy usage, throughput, delay, overhead and packet delivery ratio.},

  abstract     = {Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) are a universal issue for the well-being of people as they result in morbidities and deaths with the onset of additional diseases. Because there are no clear early symptoms of CKD, people frequently miss them. Timely identification of CKD allows individuals to acquire proper medications to prevent the development of the diseases. Machine learning technique (MLT) can strongly assist doctors in achieving this aim due to their rapid and precise determination capabilities. Many MLT encounter inappropriate features in most databases that might lower the classifier’s performance. Missing values are filled using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Adaptive Weight Dynamic Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (AWDBOA) are nature-inspired feature selection (FS) techniques with good explorations, exploitations, convergences, and do not get trapped in local optimums. Operators used in Local Search Algorithm-Based Mutation (LSAM) and Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) which use diversity and generations of adaptive weights to features for enhancing FS are modified in this work. Simultaneously, an adaptive weight value is added for FS from the database. Following the identification of features, six MLT are used in classification tasks namely Logistic Regressions (LOG), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), KNNs, Naive Baye (NB), and Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN). The CKD databases were retrieved from MLT repository of UCI (University of California, Irvine). Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, and accuracy are compared to assess this work’s classification framework with existing approaches.},
