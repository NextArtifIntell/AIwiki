  abstract     = {A communicating system is k -synchronizable if all of the message sequence charts representing the executions can be divided into slices of k sends followed by k receptions. It was previously shown that, for a fixed given k , one could decide whether a communicating system is k -synchronizable. This result is interesting because the reachability problem can be solved for k -synchronizable systems. However, the decision procedure assumes that the bound k is fixed. In this paper we improve this result and show, for mailbox communication, that it is possible to decide if such a bound k exists.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a framework for building probabilistic models with subsequential failure transducers. We first show how various types of subsequential transducers commonly used in natural language processing are represented by conditional probabilistic subsequential transducers and probabilistic subsequential failure transducers. Afterwards, we introduce efficient algorithms for composition of conditional probabilistic subsequential transducers with probabilistic subsequential failure transducers and canonization (weight-pushing) of probabilistic subsequential failure transducers. Those algorithms are applicable to many tasks for representing probabilistic models. One such task is the construction of the H C L G weighted transducer used in speech recognition which we describe in detail. At the end, a comparison between the presented H C L G failure weighted transducer and the standard H C L G weighted transducer along with empirical results for HMM-based speech recognition decoding reveal the competitiveness of the presented constructions.},

Here we distinguish the cases when the involved automata are reset automata, permutation automata, permutation-reset automata, or do not have any restriction on their structure. It turns out that the picture on the obtained state complexities of the cascade product is diverse, and for all cases, except where the left automaton is a unary permutation(-reset) or a deterministic finite automaton without structural restrictions, and the right one is a reset automaton or a deterministic finite automaton without structural restrictions, we are able to identify state sizes that cannot be reached — these numbers are called “magic.”},

We give a sharp state complexity bound expressed in terms of the longest strings in the unary projection languages of an associated finite language. Additionally, for a subclass, we give sharp bounds expressed in terms of the size of a recognizing input automaton and the size of the alphabet. We also state a related state complexity bound for the commutative closure on finite languages. Lastly, we investigate the language inclusion, equivalence and universality problems on APCs up to permutational, or Parikh, equivalence. These problems are known to be P S P A C E -complete on APCs in general, even for fixed alphabets. We show them to be decidable in polynomial time for fixed alphabets if we only want to solve them up to Parikh equivalence.

We state alternative characterizations for both classes, that the shuffle of any language (resp. any commutative language) with a language from 𝒞𝒪𝓂 + ( Σ ∗ ) gives a regular language (resp. a language from 𝒞𝒪𝓂 + ( Σ ∗ ) ) and that 𝒞𝒪𝓂 + is also closed for iterated shuffle. Then we introduce the wider class ℛ 𝒞𝒪𝓂 that is also closed under iterated shuffle, but fails to be closed for binary shuffle and is not a positive variety. Furthermore, we give an automata-theoretical characterization for the regularity of the iterated shuffle of a regular commutative language. We use this result to show that, for a fixed alphabet, it is decidable in polynomial time whether the iterated shuffle of a commutative regular language given by a deterministic automaton is regular.

We study the dependency of k from the number h of caterpillars that are packed, both in the case that these caterpillars are all isomorphic to one another (in which case the packing is called placement ) and when they are not. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the placement of h Δ -regular caterpillars and sufficient conditions for the packing of a set of Δ 1 -, Δ 2 -, … , Δ h -regular caterpillars such that the degree Δ i and the degree Δ j of the non-leaf vertices can differ from one caterpillar to another, for 1 ≤ i , j ≤ h , i ≠ j .},

The idea is that a stable matching of a roommate instance I is a stable matching (that however must satisfy a certain condition) of some marriage instance I ′ . I ′ is obtained just by making two copies of I , one for the men’s table and the other for the women’s table. The second objective is to investigate the possibility of reducing the roommate problem to the marriage problem (with one-to-one correspondence between their stable matchings) in polynomial time. For a given I , we construct the rotation POSET P of I ′ and then we “halve” it to obtain P ′ , by which we can forget the above condition and can use all the closed subsets of P ′ for all the stable matchings of I . Unfortunately this approach works (runs in polynomial time) only for restricted instances.},

  abstract     = {With a rapidly growing attention on the development of learning-augmented algorithms, we revisit the classical online traveling salesman problem (OLTSP) from the perspective of such learning approaches. A learning-augmented online algorithm, or simply an online algorithm with predictions, considers how to improve its competitive performance with theoretical guarantees by forecasting the information of future requests, e.g., their release time or locations in the OLTSP. In this study, we investigate the OLTSP on the real line, motivated by the parcel picking problem in a smart warehouse, which aims at scheduling a route for a server (saying, a Kiva robot), starting at the origin, serving all online requests and returning to the origin such that the completion time is minimized. Each online request is released over time on the real line and the server moves back and forth along the line with unit speed. We mainly focus on zealous algorithms, a special type of online algorithms for the OLTSP which never allow the sever to wait if there are still unserved requests, and exploit a specific forecasting strategy, called online predictions , which makes a sequence of predictions one by one in an online manner. In order to ensure better competitive performance, we particularly explore the worst-case scenarios that restrict the power of such predictions. Based on the discussion, we make an assumption in which online predictions are guaranteed to be useful, and devise a learning-augmented algorithm with max 6 λ + 1 4 λ , 2 λ + 1 2 λ -robustness and max 3 2 + η t + η p O P T , 6 + λ 4 + ( 1 − λ ) η p O P T -consistency, 0 &lt; λ ≤ 1 , comparing to the previous lower bound of 7 4 , where η t and η p which indicate prediction errors are sufficiently small constants. Moreover, we also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Given a triangle Δ , we study the problem of determining the smallest enclosing and largest embedded isosceles triangles of Δ with respect to area and perimeter. This problem was initially posed by Nandakumar [17, 22] and was first studied by Kiss, Pach, and Somlai [13], who showed that if Δ ′ is the smallest area isosceles triangle containing Δ , then Δ ′ and Δ share a side and an angle. In the present paper, we prove that for any triangle Δ , every maximum area isosceles triangle embedded in Δ and every maximum perimeter isosceles triangle embedded in Δ shares a side and an angle with Δ . Somewhat surprisingly, the case of minimum perimeter enclosing triangles is different: there are infinite families of triangles Δ whose minimum perimeter isosceles containers do not share a side and an angle with Δ .},

  abstract     = {Suppose we are given a graph with nodes characterized by amounts of supplies and demands of multiple commodities. The amounts of commodities stored at nodes (supplies) are given by positive numbers while those of demands at nodes are given by negative numbers. To meet demands we send commodities from nodes to neighbors by using vehicles, one at each node, with some loading capacity moving to and from neighbors. In this paper we adopt a one-way transportation model in which we just send commodities from a node to one of its neighbors along an edge. When we choose one neighbor at each node, we have a set of trips which naturally define a graph such that each connected component has at most one cycle, which is known as a pseudoforest. We present a linear-time algorithm for deciding whether there is a set of trips that meet all demands using one-way multi-commodity transportations on a pseudoforest with node degrees bounded by a constant. Using the algorithm, we first present an efficient algorithm for finding an optimal set of one-way one-commodity trips that minimize the maximum unmet demand on a pseudoforest, and then extend the idea to a multi-commodity problem on a pseudoforest with node degrees bounded by a constant.},

For this, we firstly introduce an extended propositional interaction logic over De Morgan algebras and we show that its formulas can encode the uncertainty of several architectures applied in systems with a finite number of components. In turn, we introduce a first-order extended interaction logic over De Morgan algebras which is applied for modelling uncertainty in the interactions of well-known parametric architectures. Moreover, we prove that the equivalence problem for a large class of formulas of that logic is decidable in doubly exponential time by providing an effective translation to fuzzy recognizable series. For any such formula over a totally ordered De Morgan algebra, we further prove that we can compute in exponential time the set of sequences of parametric fuzzy interactions which ensure the trustworthiness of the formula according to a particular threshold.},

It is nowadays widely used, especially in malware to make the code hard to analyse and to detect by anti-viruses. Thus, the analysis of such self modifying programs is a big challenge. Pushdown systems (PDSs) is a natural model that is extensively used for the analysis of sequential programs because they allow to accurately model procedure calls and mimic the program’s stack. In this work, we propose to extend the PushDown System model with self-modifying rules. We call the new model Self-Modifying PushDown System (SM-PDS). A SM-PDS is a PDS that can modify its own set of transitions during execution. We show how SM-PDSs can be used to naturally represent self-modifying programs and provide efficient algorithms to compute the backward and forward reachable configurations of SM-PDSs. We implemented our techniques in a tool and obtained encouraging results. In particular, we successfully applied our tool for the detection of self-modifying malware.},

In a trip using a vehicle we can send commodities from a node to a neighbor along an edge and also bring back some other commodities from the neighbor. In this paper we are interested in feasibility problem, which is to decide whether there is a single round of trips that meet all demands. We prove the feasibility problem is NP-complete even in the easiest case of a one-commodity transportation problem with unbounded capacity.

Menger’s theorem shows that the number of (edge)-disjoint paths is closely related to (edge) connectivity. Clearly, disjoint paths not only provide alternative routings to tolerate faulty vertices but also avoid communication bottlenecks. Furthermore, disjoint paths can speed up the transmission time by distributing data among disjoint paths. In order to assess the fault tolerance of the network objectively, we aim to extend vertex or edge failures to substructure malfunction. In this paper, we show the maximum number of vertex (edge)-disjoint paths in star graph in the case of genetic substructure faults. Let S k ( 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 ) be a k -dimensional substar of S n . We show that there exist min { d S n − S k ( u ) , d S n − S k ( v ) } vertex (edge)-disjoint paths to connect any two vertices u and v in S n − S k , where d S n − S k ( u ) is the degree of vertex u in S n − S k .

  abstract     = {The Network Construction problem, studied by Angluin et al. , Hosoda et al. , and others, asks for a minimum-cost network satisfying a set of connectivity constraints which specify subsets of the vertices in the network that have to form connected subgraphs. More formally, given a set V of vertices, construction costs for all possible edges between pairs of vertices from V , and a sequence S 1 , S 2 , … , S r ⊆ V of connectivity constraints, the objective is to find a set E of edges such that each S i induces a connected subgraph of the graph ( V , E ) and the total cost of E is minimized. First, we study the online version where every constraint must be satisfied immediately after its arrival and edges that have already been added can never be removed. We give an O ( B 2 log n ) -competitive and O ( ( B + log r ) log n ) -competitive polynomial-time algorithms, where B is an upper bound on the size of constraints, while r , n denote the number of constraints and the number of vertices, respectively. On the other hand, we observe that an Ω ( B ) -competitive lower bound as well as an Ω ( B ) -competitive lower bound in the cost-uniform case are implied by the known lower bounds for unbounded constraints. For the cost-uniform case with unbounded constraints, we provide an O ( n ( log n + log r ) ) -competitive upper bound with high probability. The latter bound is against an oblivious adversary while our other randomized competitive bounds are against an adaptive adversary. Next, we discuss a hybrid approximation method for the (offline) Network Construction problem combining an approximation algorithm of Hosoda et al. with one of Angluin et al. and an application of the hybrid method to bioinformatics. Finally, we consider a natural strengthening of the connectivity requirements in the Network Construction problem, where each constraint has to induce a subgraph (of the constructed graph) of diameter at most d . Among other things, we provide a polynomial-time ( B 2 − B + 2 ) B 2 -approximation algorithm for the Network Construction problem with the d -diameter requirements, when each constraint has at most B vertices, and show the APX-completeness of this variant.},

Fault tolerance is an important criterion in the design of interconnection networks. The folded hypercube F Q n is an important variant of hypercube Q n which remains many desirable properties of hypercube. We consider the strong Menger connectivity of folded hypercubes when part of the network is faulty. We show that F Q n − Q s ( 1 ≤ s ≤ n − 1 ) is strong Menger (edge) connected. Which means that when a subcube Q s is faulty, the surviving graph F Q n − Q s is strong Menger (edge) connected. This generalizes the result of F Q n in [ J. Parallel Distrib.

  abstract     = {Given two disjoint vertex-sets, S = { s 1 , … , s k } and T = { t 1 , … , t k } in a graph, a paired many-to-many k -disjoint path cover joining S and T is a set of pairwise vertex-disjoint paths { P 1 , … , P k } that altogether cover every vertex of the graph, in which each path P i runs from s i to t i . In this paper, we reveal that a bipartite torus-like graph, if built from lower dimensional torus-like graphs that have good disjoint-path-cover properties, retain such good property. As a result, an m -dimensional bipartite torus, m ≥ 3 , with at most 2 m − 4 edge faults has a paired many-to-many 3 -disjoint path cover joining arbitrary disjoint sets S and T of size 3 each such that S ∪ T contains the equal numbers of vertices from different parts of the bipartition.},

  abstract     = {Computer networks are prone to targeted attacks and random failures. Robustness is a measure of an ability of a network to continue functioning when part of the network is either naturally damaged or targeted for attack. The study of network robustness is a critical tool in the characterization and understanding of complex interconnected systems. There are several proposed graph metrics that predicates network resilience against such attacks. Isolated rupture degree is a novel graph-theoretic concept defined as a measure of network vulnerability. Isolated rupture degree is argued as an appropriate measure for modelling the robustness of network topologies in the face of possible node destruction. In this paper, the relationships between isolated rupture degree and some other graph parameters such as connectivity, covering number, minimum vertex degree are established. The isolated rupture degrees of 2 K 2 -free graphs, middle graphs, corona graphs of a middle graph and a complete graph K 2 on two vertices are evaluated, then compared and the more stable graph types are reported. A sharp upper bound for the isolated rupture degree of middle graphs is established.},

The first result is that there is a language L 0 defined by an LL(1) grammar in the Greibach normal form, to which every language L defined by an LL(1) grammar in the Greibach normal form can be reduced by a homomorphism, that is, w ∈ L if and only if h ( w ) ∈ L 0 . Then it is shown that this statement does not hold for the full class of LL( k ) languages. The other hardest language theorem is then established in the following form: there is a language L 0 defined by an LL(1) grammar in the Greibach normal form, such that, for every language L defined by an LL( k ) grammar, with k ≥ 1 , there exists a homomorphism h , for which w ∈ L if and only if h ( w $ ) ∈ L 0 , where $ is a new symbol. The results lead to two robust language families: the closures of the languages defined by LL(1) grammars in the Greibach normal form under inverse homomorphisms and under inverse finite transductions.},

We show that for a given top-down transducer with look-ahead it is decidable whether or not its translation is definable (1) by a linear deterministic top-down tree transducer or (2) by a tree homomorphism. We present algorithms that construct equivalent such transducers if they exist. Our results also apply to bottom-up transducers as well as compositions of transducers.},

The canonical acceptors for LL ( k ) languages are deterministic stateless pushdown automata with input lookahead of size k . We investigate the computational capacity of reversible computations of such automata. A pushdown automaton with lookahead k is said to be reversible if its predecessor configurations can uniquely be computed by a pushdown automaton with backward input lookahead (lookback) of size k . It is shown that we cannot trade a lookahead for states or vice versa. The impact of having states or a lookahead depends on the language. While reversible pushdown automata with states accept all regular languages, we are going to prove that there are regular languages that cannot be accepted reversibly without states, even in case of an arbitrarily large lookahead. This completes the comparison of reversible with ordinary pushdown automata in our setting. Moreover, it turns out that there are problems which can be solved by reversible deterministic stateless pushdown automata with lookahead of size k + 1 , but not by any reversible deterministic stateless pushdown automaton with lookahead of size k . So, an infinite and tight hierarchy of language families dependent on the size of the lookahead is shown. Finally, we prove that the language families accepted by reversible deterministic stateless pushdown automata with lookahead of size k are not closed under standard operations. For example, we show that the families are anti-AFLs which are not closed under intersection.},

Our main results are forbidden patterns for deterministic automata (finite words) and for Carton-Michel automata (infinite words). In order to give concise patterns, we allow the use of subwords on paths in finite graphs. This concept is formalized as subword-patterns. For certain types of subword-patterns there exists a non-deterministic logspace algorithm to decide their presence or absence in a given automaton. In particular, this leads to NL algorithms for deciding the levels of the FO 2 quantifier alternation hierarchies. This applies to both full and half levels, each over finite and infinite words.

  abstract     = {We consider two-tape automata where one tape contains the input word w and the other an advice string α ( | w | ) . Such an automaton recognizes a language L if there is an advice function for which every word on the input tape is correctly classified. This model has been introduced by Küçük et al. with the aim of modeling non-uniform computations on finite automata. So far, most results concerned automata with 1-way tapes, both for the input and the advice. First, we show that making just one of the tapes 2-way already increases the model’s power. Then we consider the case where both tapes are 2-way, which can also be viewed as a restricted version of the non-uniform families of automata used by Ibarra and Ravikumar to define the class NUDSPACE . We show this restriction to be not too significant since, e.g., ℒ ( 2 𝒜 2 ℐ DFA/poly), i.e., the languages recognized by automata with 2-way input and advice tape with polynomial advice, equals N U D S P A C E ( O ( log ( n ) ) ) . Hence, we can show that many interesting problems concerning the state complexity of families of automata carry over to the problems concerning the advice size of non-uniform automata. In particular, the question whether there can be a more than polynomial gap in advice between determinism and nondeterminism is of great interest: The existence of a language that is recognized by a 2-way NFA with a constant number of advice heads and polynomial (resp. logarithmic) advice, while a corresponding 2-head DFA needs exponential (resp. polynomial) advice, would imply L ≠ N L (resp. L L ≠ N L L ). We show that for advice of size ( log n ) o ( 1 ) there is no gap between determinism and nondeterminism, and that the gap is at most exponential.},

  abstract     = {The largest known reset thresholds for DFAs are equal to ( n − 1 ) 2 , where n is the number of states. This is conjectured to be the maximum possible. PFAs (with partial transition function) can have exponentially large reset thresholds. This is still true if we restrict to binary PFAs. However, asymptotics do not give conclusions for fixed n . We prove that the maximal reset threshold for binary PFAs is strictly greater than ( n − 1 ) 2 if and only if n ≥ 6 . These results are mostly based on the analysis of synchronizing word lengths for a certain family of binary PFAs. This family has the following properties: it contains the well-known Černý automata; for n ≤ 1 0 it contains a binary PFA with maximal possible reset threshold; for all n ≥ 6 it contains a PFA with reset threshold larger than the maximum known for DFAs. Analysis of this family reveals remarkable patterns involving the Fibonacci numbers and related sequences such as the Padovan sequence. We derive explicit formulas for the reset thresholds in terms of these recurrent sequences. Asymptotically the Černý family gives reset thresholds of polynomial order. We prove that PFAs in the family are not extremal for n ≥ 4 1 . For that purpose, we present an improvement of Martyugin’s prime number construction of binary PFAs.},

  abstract     = {Scientific applications are usually described using directed acyclic graphs, where nodes represent tasks and edges represent dependencies between tasks. For some applications, this graph is a tree: each task produces a single result used solely by its parent. The temporary results of each task have to be stored between their production and their use. We focus on the case when the data manipulated are very large. Then, during an execution, all data may not fit together in memory. In such a case, some data have to be temporarily written to disk and evicted from memory. These data are later read from disk when they are needed for computation. These Input/Output operations are very expensive; hence, our goal is to minimize their total volume. The order in which the tasks are processed considerably influences the amount of such Input/Output operations. Finding the schedule which minimizes this amount is an open problem that we revisit in this paper. We first formalize and generalize known results, and prove that existing solutions can be arbitrarily worse than the optimal. We then present an Integer Linear Program to solve it optimally. Finally, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm. We demonstrate its good performance through simulations on both synthetic and realistic trees built from actual scientific applications.},

  abstract     = {The gathering over meeting nodes problem requires the robots to gather at one of the pre-defined meeting nodes . This paper investigates the problem with respect to the objective function that minimizes the total number of moves made by all the robots. In other words, the sum of the distances traveled by all the robots is minimized while accomplishing the gathering task. The robots are deployed on the nodes of an anonymous two-dimensional infinite grid which has a subset of nodes marked as meeting nodes . The robots do not agree on a global coordinate system and operate under an asynchronous scheduler. A deterministic distributed algorithm has been proposed to solve the problem for all those solvable configurations, and the initial configurations for which the problem is unsolvable have been characterized. The proposed gathering algorithm is optimal with respect to the total number of moves performed by all the robots in order to finalize the gathering .},

The domination number and it’s types can be used network vulnerability parameters. Recently, the disjunctive total domination number has been defined by Henning and Naicker. In this paper, the disjunctive total domination numbers of the transformation graph G + + z when z = { + , − } of some graphs G have been obtained.

  abstract     = {In the contemporary world, to meet the increasing need to deal with massive data, the interconnection networks for large-scale parallel and distributed systems need to expand for stronger scalability requirements. Let G n be a recursive n -dimensional network. Since the presence of faulty links or processors may disconnect the entire network, one hopes that every remaining processor lies in an undamaged lower-dimensional subnetwork. Under this circumstance, in 2012, Yang and Wang first proposed the conception of ℓ -embedded edge-connectivity η ℓ ( G n ) of G n , which is defined as the minimum number of links whose removal results in several disconnected components, and each processor is contained in an ℓ -dimensional subnetwork G ℓ . The augmented cube, denoted by A Q n , proposed by Choudum and Sunitha, is a momentous variant of the hypercube as an interconnection topology of parallel computing. It retains many favorable properties of the hypercube and possesses several embedded properties that the hypercube and other variations do not have. For 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ n − 1 and n ≥ 1 , this paper determines ℓ -embedded edge-connectivity of n -dimensional augmented cube, η ℓ ( A Q n ) , and shows exact values η ℓ ( A Q n ) = 2 ℓ ( 2 n − 2 ℓ ) − δ , where δ = 1 if ℓ = 0 , and δ = 0 otherwise. The parameters can provide more accurate measurements for the reliability and fault-tolerance of the corresponding systems.},
