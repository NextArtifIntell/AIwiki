We use EGARCH model to capture the leverage of return shocks due to COVID-19. Based on ANN-EGARCH-EVT-Copula models, we solve our portfolio optimization consisting of these six indices with different copula models. Using different performance measures to evaluate the efficiency of the models we show that under the Sharpe ratio and Sortino ratio the Gumbel copula gives better performance whereas with Average Drawdown and Max Drawdown measures, the Gaussian copula model is a best model for optimizing the portfolio.},

  abstract     = {Several stochastic frontier production analysis problems are not linear regression problems; two error components (inefficiency and noise) may not have symmetric dependence. In nonlinear problems, the data are divided into two or more regimes according to turning points or change points; the relationships between the output and all the inputs are allowed to differ between regimes. In the problem of two-error dependence, the inefficiency component generally plays a more dominant role than the noise component, thereby the output of each firm is mainly influenced by the inefficiency; in such cases, the symmetric dependence is not suitable. It is, therefore, desirable to come up with a new nonlinear asymmetric copula-based stochastic frontier model (SFM). Two nonlinear structures, namely kink and threshold and skew-normal copula, are suggested to SFM to deal with these problems. The Monte Carlo simulations and analysis of a real data set are employed to evaluate the accuracy and performance of proposed models. The results show that the proposed models show a higher performance when compared with the conventional linear SFM with symmetric two-error dependence.},

In the 1-D case, the smallest transportation cost of such a change is proportional to what is known as the Wasserstein metric. The same metric can be used to describe the distance between two probability distributions. In the last decades, it turned out that this metric can be successfully used in many economic applications beyond transportation. These successes are somewhat of a mystery: in principle, there are many different metrics on the set of all probability distributions, and it is not immediately clear why namely Wasserstein metric is so successful. In this paper, we show that the Wasserstein metric naturally appears in decision making situations. This fact explains the usefulness of the Wassterstein’s metric in economic applications.},

To be more precise, the simplest distribution that can be obtained from scale invariance is the Pareto distribution — a frequent particular case of the general Burr family of distributions. Next simplest are all distributions from the Burr family.

The causal effects of education on earnings are estimated using a nonparametric approach with selection bias adjustment and parametric approaches with selection bias and ability bias adjustments. The results show different estimates for returns to education across model specifications, indicating the importance of the bias adjustments and parametric assumptions.},

However, a limitation is that Chen et al. 3 assumed normal distributions that compose only a subset of the much larger family of skew normal distributions, which are used as distributions of random errors in many economical models such as stochastic frontier models that are popular and useful models to investigate production efficiency in microeconomics, see Hung. 5 Therefore, it would be useful to generalize to skew normal distributions. We perform the mathematical derivations for the generalization and support them with simulations and worked examples. Finally, we provide a free and user-friendly computer program by which researchers can perform the APP to determine minimum sample sizes necessary to meet specifications for precision and confidence, with respect to Cohen’s d , for a matched sample under the large umbrella of skew normal distributions.},

This law is actively used in economics and finance to check that the data in financial reports are real — and not improperly modified by the reporting company. The first challenge is that the cheaters know about it, and make sure that their modified data satisfies Benford’s law. The second challenge related to this law is that lately, another application of this law has been discovered — namely, an application to deep learning, one of the most effective and most promising machine learning techniques. It turned out that the neurons’ weights obey this law only at the difficult-to-detect stage when the fitting is optimal – and when further attempts attempt to fit will lead to the undesirable over-fitting. In this paper, we provide a possible solution to both challenges: we show how to use this law to make financial cheating practically impossible, and we provide qualitative explanation for the effectiveness of Benford’s Law in machine learning.},

We used several measures to quantify the trading network information, such as Trading Weight, Closeness, Betweenness, PageRank, and Modularity. The analysis showed that they were closely related to credit levels. In particular, the Trading Weight usually belonged to the top five critical features for almost all classifiers. Overall, we saw that the correct prediction of the network models was consistently higher than those without a network.

Based on five biological and chemical datasets, the results acquired the potential result from the suggested algorithm that is compared to other approaches based on intra-cluster distances and the Rand index.

In addition to it, in the decoder acoustic module, such as Adaptive Hidden Markov Model using the Baum-Welch algorithm is utilized instead of a Viterbi algorithm to reduce the computational time and memory usage. The text file from the speech recognition module is rendered to synchronize the missing offset with the video using parallel processing by defining the start time, the end time, the delay time. Best outcomes are demonstrated by the experimental results of the proposed technique with 98.4% of accuracy compare with existing techniques. The proposed technique which gives 3.8% better accuracy performance compare with existing technique i.e. MFCC, DNN and CNN.},

  abstract     = {The clinical diagnosis of heart disease in most situations is based on a difficult amalgamation of pathological and clinical information. Because of this complication, there is a significant level of curiosity among many diagnostic healthcare professionals and researchers who are keenly interested in the efficient, accurate, and early-stage forecasting of heart disease. Deep Learning Algorithms aid in the prediction of heart disease. The main focus of this paper is to develop a method for predicting heart disease through Modified Rough K means + + (MRK + + ) clustering along with the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). This paper is categorized into two modules: (1) Propose a clustering component based on Modified Rough K-means + + ; (2) disease prediction based on RBM. The input Cleveland dataset is clustered using the stochastic probabilistic rough k-means + + clustering technique in the module for clustering. The clustered data is acquired and used in the RBM, and this hybrid structure is then used in the heart disease forecasting module. Throughout the testing procedure, the most valid result is chosen from the clustered test data, and the RBM classifier that correlates to the nearest cluster in the test data is based on the smallest distance or similar parameters. Furthermore, the output value is used to predict heart disease. There are three different types of experiments that are performed: In the first experiment comprises modifying the rough K-means + + clustering algorithm, the second experiment evaluates the classification result, and the third experiment suggests hybrid model representation. When the Hybrid Modified Rough k-means + + - RBM model is compared with any single model, it provides the highest accuracy.},

Area facts allow a deeper understanding of users’ options and actions by bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. This expansion of wide geo-spatial datasets has inspired studies into novel recommender systems that aim to make users’ travels and social interactions easier. This huge amount of data generated by these devices has prompted an increase in the number of research activities and procedures aimed at breaking down and recovering useful data based on these large datasets. The aim of this challenge is to study GPS directions from a variety of people, as well as examine and apply computational strategies to recover useful data from those directions, useful data from GPS directions, including areas of interest and people’s proximity, and then create an instrument for information representation. This paper demonstrates how data mining techniques is used to recover valuable information from spatial data. As well as how such data can be useful in understanding people and areas within a district.

This method allows the Robot to identify dynamic or static unidentified objects while directing the Robot to prevent collisions and advance toward the objective. The Robot is capable of moving in a variety of environments. The Robot may communicate and travel in dynamic space by perceiving its surroundings and pursuing a free-collision route. This study covers creating a multi-agent system that includes fuzzy logic to regulate the robotic movements along a path reactive for effective Navigation. This project aims to develop an algorithm that allows the Robot to do distinct tasks to accomplish a unified objective, autonomous Navigation in a slightly unfamiliar environment. Under such a situation, the usage of a multi-agent system is advantageous. As a result, we created a framework made up of four agents responsible for sensing, Navigation, dynamic, and static obstacle avoidance. These agents communicate with one another via a coordinating mechanism.},

The system’s automatic fish detection and tracking capabilities are improved, enhancing underwater investigation for supervising ecological biodiversity. The publicly accessible field-truth dataset assesses recall, F1-score, and classification and tracking precision. Utilizing current tracking R-CNN algorithms like Lowest Output Sum of Siamese Mask (SiamMask), Sequential Non-Maximum Suppression (Seq-NMS), and Squared Errors (MOSSE), comparative performance testing is conducted. In comparison to Siam-Mask (84%), Seq-NMS (78%) and MOSSE (75%), more than 120 of 170 specific bream were detected using the pre-trained Mask-R-CNN of the proposed algorithm (87%). This pre-trained Mask R-CNN system was used in the evaluation, and it was discovered that detection and tracking accuracy had increased significantly. This suggests that the ocean ecosystem could benefit from applying the proposed approach for management of ecology.},

  abstract     = {Most of the existing works on games under uncertainty consider only one type of uncertainty: fuzzy, random, rough, etc. However, in real-world games, it often happens that randomness and fuzziness simultaneously affect the interaction between players and their payoffs. Investigating fuzzy random games is challenging as it is difficult to express the preferences of players in the presence of two different types of uncertainty. This paper presents a new approach to games involving randomness and fuzziness. Specifically, we consider bi-matrix games where the payoffs are fuzzy random variables. Using probability and possibility measures, we formulate related fuzzy chance-constrained games. Then, we introduce Nash equilibrium for these games. Next, we establish sufficient conditions for the existence of this equilibrium. Further, the problem of its computing is formulated as a nonlinear complementarity problem. Finally, examples of market competition games and pollution management are given to illustrate the application potential of the proposed approach. The novelty and advantage of this work are that it grants the players the freedom to choose the probability and possibility confidence/satisfaction levels at which they want Nash equilibrium to be, and equilibrium computation is simpler compared to existing approaches to fuzzy random bi-matrix games.},

Swap operation and swap sequence are applied for the modification of the different operations of the BA to solve the TSPs. The cyclic crossover operation is applied in a regular interval of iterations on the best found solution and each solution of the final population of BA for the enhancement of the exploration as well as exploitation of the search process. K-Opt operation is applied on the population in each iteration of the BA with some probability for the exploitation. The algorithm is tested with a set of benchmark test instances of the TSPLIB. The algorithm produces exact results for a set of significantly large size problems. For the TSPs in fuzzy environment, a fuzzy simulation approach is proposed to deal with the fuzzy data having linear as well as non-linear membership functions. Also, a rough simulation process is proposed to deal with the TSPs in the rough environment where rough estimation can be done following any type of rough measure.

Determining which real-time and multi-modal disaster information can effectively support humanitarian aid has become a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end model, named GCN-based Multi-modal Domain Adaptation (GMDA), which consists of three essential modules: the GCN-based feature extraction module, the attention-based fusion module and the MMD domain adaptation module. The GCN-based feature extraction module integrates text and image representations through GCNs, while the attention-based fusion module then merges these multi-modal representations using an attention mechanism. Finally, the MMD domain adaptation module is utilized to alleviate the dependence of GMDA on source domain events by computing the maximum mean discrepancy across domains. Our proposed model has been extensively evaluated and has shown superior performance compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal domain adaptation models in terms of F1 score and variance stability.},

  abstract     = {The Decision tree algorithm is a very popular classifier for reasoning through recursive partitioning of the data space. To choose the best attributes for splitting, the range of each continuous attribute should be split into two or more intervals. Then partitioning criteria are calculated for each value. Fuzzy partitioning can be used to reduce sensitivity to noise and increase tree stability. Also, tree-building algorithms face memory limitations as they need to keep the entire training dataset in the main memory. In this paper, we introduced a fuzzy decision tree approach based on fuzzy sets. To avoid storing the entire training dataset in the main memory and overcome the memory limitations, the algorithm incrementally builds FDTs. Membership functions are automatically generated. The Fuzzy Information Gain (FIG) is then used as the fast split attribute selection criterion, and leaf expansion is performed only on the instances stored in it. The efficiency of this algorithm is examined in terms of accuracy and tree complexity. The results show that the proposed algorithm can overcome memory limitations and balance accuracy and complexity while reducing the complexity of the tree.},

Chattering phenomenon, which is characteristic of customary sliding mode control (SMC), avoided by the on-line fuzzy regulation of the sliding surface in the controller, when the system is subject to disturbances and CIN. Finite-time boundedness (FTB) properties are designed with adequate conditions, which are entrenched in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with the help of cost and Lyapunov functions. Numerical simulations for the synchronization problem of the chaotic modified Colpitt’s system and Duffing system clearly show the good performance of the proposed control scheme.

  abstract     = {This paper deals with fuzzy multi-depot bus scheduling (FMDBS) problem in which the objective function and constraints are defined with fuzzy attributes. Credibility relation is used to formulate the problem as an integer multicommodity flow problem. A novel combination of branch-and-price and heuristic algorithms, is proposed to efficiently solve FMDBS problem. In the proposed algorithm, the heuristic algorithm is applied to generate initial columns for the column generation method. Also, a heuristic algorithm is used to improve the generated solutions in each node of the branch-and-price tree. Two sets of benchmark examples are applied to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for large-scale instances. Also, the algorithm is applied to solve the classical multi-depot bus scheduling problem. The results show that the proposed algorithm decreases integrality gap and computational time in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms and normal branch-and-price algorithm. Finally, as a case study, the bus schedules in Tehran BRT network are generated.},

Combining three-way TOPSIS decision ideas with MADM is a feasible and meaningful research direction. In light of this, this paper generalizes the classical TOPSIS method with the help of mean and standard deviation and proposes the so-called modified three-way TOPSIS. First, using a pair of thresholds which is derived by mean and standard deviation, we divide decision alternatives into three segments, and then a preliminary rank results of decision alternatives can be obtained. Furthermore, in each decision region, we use two ranking regulations (one-way TOPSIS or modified two-way TOPSIS method) to rank decision alternatives. A practical example of urban expressway route selection illustrates the feasibility of the proposed method. Finally, we test the feasibility and validity of the modified three-way TOPSIS method by comparing with some existing method.},

Subsequently, centroid selection plays a vital role in cluster formation, which is done using a new Improved Lion Algorithm (LA) termed as Cross over probability-based LA model (CP-LA). As a novelty, this paper introduced a new inter and intracluster similarity model. Moreover, this centroid selection is made in such a way that the proposed adaptive weighted similarity should be minimal. Based on the characteristics of the document, the weights are automatically adapted with the similarity measure. The proposed adaptive weighted similarity function involves the inter-cluster, and intra-cluster similarity of both ordered and unordered documents.

  abstract     = {Autism spectrum disease is one of the severe neuro developmental disorders that are currently present worldwide (ASD). It is a chronic disorder that has an impact on a person’s behaviour and communication abilities. The world health organization’s 2019 study states that an increasing number of people are being diagnosed with ASD, which poses a risk because it is comparable to high medical expenses. Early detection can significantly lessen the impact. Traditional techniques are costly and time-consuming. This paper offers a Novel Deep Recurrent Neural Network (NDRNN) algorithm for the detection of the level of autism to address the aforementioned problems. The deep recurrent neural network is developed with several hidden recurrent network layers with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) units. In this work, Artificial Algae Algorithm (AAA) is used as a feature extraction algorithm, to obtain the best optimal features among the listed feature set. An Intelligent Water Droplet (IWD) algorithm is used for obtaining optimal weight and bias value for the recurrent neural network. The algorithm was evaluated for the dataset obtained by the Indian scale for assessment of autism. Experimental results shows that this proposed model produces the 91% of classification accuracy and 92% of sensitivity and reduces the cost.},

This work proposes some types and categories of bi-polar preference possibly involved in preference and uncertain evaluation environment, discusses some methods and techniques to elicit the preference strengths from practical backgrounds, and suggests several techniques to generate corresponding weight vectors for performing bi-polar preference based information fusion. Detailed decision making procedure and numerical example with management background are also presented.

To ensure the quality of foods through their various attributes, different types of methods have been introduced. In this proposed method, three underlying blocks namely Hyperspectral Food Image Context Extractor (HFICE), Hyperspectral Context Fuzzy Classifier (HCFC) and CNN for Food Quality Analyzer (CFQA). Hyperspectral Food Image Context Extractor module is used as the preprocess to get food attributes such as texture, color, size, shape and molecular particulars. Hyperspectral Context Fuzzy Classifier module identifies a particular part of the food (zone entity) is whether carbohydrate, fat, protein, water or unusable core. CNN for Food Quality Analyzer module uses a Tuned Convolutional layer, Heuristic Activation Operation, Parallel Element Merge Layer and a regular Fully Connected Layer. Indian Pines, Salinas and Pavia are the benchmark dataset to evaluate hyperspectral image-based machine learning procedures. These datasets are used along with a dedicated Chicken meat HSI dataset is used in the training and testing process.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, many sequences of events are generated in areas as diverse as healthcare, finance, and social network. People have been studying these data for a long time. They hope to predict the type and occurrence time of the next event by using relationships among events in the data. recently, with the successful application of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in natural language processing, it has been introduced into point process. However, RNN cannot capture the long-term dependence among events well, and self-attention can partially mitigate this problem precisely. Transformer Hawkes Process (THP) using self-attention greatly improves the performance of the Hawkes Process, but THP cannot ignore the effect of irrelevant events, which will affect the computational complexity and prediction accuracy of the model. In this paper, we propose an Adaptively Sparse Transformers Hawkes Process (ASTHP). ASTHP considers the periodicity and nonlinearity of event time in the time encoding process. The sparsity of the ASTHP is achieved by substituting Softmax with α -entmax: α -entmax is a differentiable generalization of Softmax that allows unrelated events to gain exact zero weight. By optimizing the neural network parameters, different attention heads can adaptively select sparse modes (from Softmax to Sparsemax). Compared with the existing models, ASTHP model not only ensures the prediction performance but also improves the interpretability of the model. For example, the accuracy of ASTHP model on MIMIC-II dataset is improved by nearly 3 percentage points, and the model fitting degree and stability are also improved significantly.},

Since FWA’s search processes are relatively simple, it is inefficient. In this paper, a dynamic multi-swarm competitive fireworks algorithm (DMCFWA) is developed to enhance the search capability of FWA. Firstly, based on the scaling coefficient updated by utilizing the fitness value of the optimal firework, the dynamic explosion amplitude strategy is proposed to improve the search capability of the best firework. Secondly, utilizing the location information of the fireworks, an improved search method is designed to enhance the local search capability of firework swarms. Thirdly, a multi-swarm independent selection technique and a restart operation are adopted to boost its abilities of global exploration and local exploitation. Finally, to reduce the computational cost of FWA, a new initialization method is used and a new model for calculating the spark number is embedded in DMCFWA. By adopting these strategies, DMCFWA easily implements and does well in exploitation and exploration. CEC2017 test suite and four engineering constraint problems are used to demonstrate the performance of DMCFWA. Experimental results show that DMCFWA performs more effectively and stably than its competitors.},

While the fuzzy set-valued information system is a generalization of fuzzy information systems, the relationship between the information granulation and the uncertainty in fuzzy set-valued information systems remains to be studied. This paper probes into uncertainty measures in fuzzy set-valued information systems based on the fuzzy β -neighborhood and the idea of granulation. Specifically, the fuzzy β -neighborhood similarity relation that reflects the similarity between two objects is defined in terms of the nearness degree. We propose the concepts of information granules and granular structures induced by fuzzy β -neighborhood similarity relations, based on which we introduce the granularity measures and rough approximation measures of granular structures in fuzzy set-valued information systems. Given the situation of decision information systems, we propose the granularity-based rough approximation measures by combining granularity measures with rough approximation measures. Experiment results and effectiveness analysis show that the measures we proposed are reasonable and feasible.},

In the case where the set of alternatives is discrete, the use of the nonadditivity index proposed in the literature often leads to interpretations which are not always robust. Indeed, the sign of this nonadditivity index can depend on the arbitrary choice of a numerical representation in the set of all numerical representations compatible with the ordinal preferential information given by the Decision Maker. We characterize the ordinal preferential information for which the problem appears.

The base algorithm is converted into a binary one and a chaotic search to augment POA’s exploration and exploitation process, denoted as chaotic binary pelican optimization algorithm (CBPOA). The main focus of chaos theory is to resolve the slow convergence rate as well as entrapment in local optimal issues of classical POA. Therefore, ten dissimilar chaotic maps are entrenched in POA to tackle these issues and attain a more robust and effective search mechanism. CBPOA executes on continuous search; thus, the continuous search is reformed to a discrete one by adapting transfer functions. In CBPOA, eight transfer functions are used to find the best one and inspect CBPOA. Consequently, the performance of the CBPOA has been investigated by targeting several metrics under 18 UCI datasets. The best variant is nominated and explored the performance with classical wrapper-based and filter-based schemes. Furthermore, the proposed CBPOA is evaluated using 23 functions from CEC-2017, 2018 and 2020 benchmarks. As an outcome, CBPOA has accomplished better outcomes than existing schemes and is superior in handling feature selection problems.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty estimation methods using deep learning approaches strive against separating how uncertain the state of the world manifests to us via measurement (objective end) from the way this gets scrambled with the model specification and training procedure used to predict such state (subjective means) — e.g., number of neurons, depth, connections, priors (if the model is bayesian), weight initialization, etc. This poses the question of the extent to which one can eliminate the degrees of freedom associated with these specifications and still being able to capture the objective end. Here, a novel non-parametric quantile estimation method for continuous random variables is introduced, based on the simplest neural network architecture with one degree of freedom: a single neuron. Its advantage is first shown in synthetic experiments comparing with the quantile estimation achieved from ranking the order statistics (specifically for small sample size) and with quantile regression. In real-world applications, the method can be used to quantify predictive uncertainty under the split conformal prediction setting, whereby prediction intervals are estimated from the residuals of a pre-trained model on a held-out validation set and then used to quantify the uncertainty in future predictions — the single neuron used here as a structureless “thermometer” that measures how uncertain the pre-trained model is. Benchmarking regression and classification experiments demonstrate that the method is competitive in quality and coverage with state-of-the-art solutions, with the added benefit of being more computationally efficient.},

  abstract     = {The imbalanced data classification is a challenging issue in many domains including medical intelligent diagnosis and fraudulent transaction analysis. The performance of the conventional classifier degrades due to the imbalanced class distribution of the training data set. Recently, machine learning and deep learning techniques are used for imbalanced data classification. Data preprocessing approaches are also suitable for handling class imbalance problem. Data augmentation is one of the preprocessing techniques used to handle skewed class distribution. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is a promising class balancing approach and it generates noise during the process of creation of synthetic samples. In this paper, AutoEncoder is used as a noise reduction technique and it reduces the noise generated by SMOTE. Further, Deep one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network is used for classification. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with existing approaches using different metrics such as Precision, Recall, Accuracy, Area Under the Curve and Geometric Mean. Ten data sets with imbalance ratio ranging from 1.17 to 577.87 and data set size ranging from 303 to 284807 instances are used in the experiments. The different imbalanced data sets used are Heart-Disease, Mammography, Pima Indian diabetes, Adult, Oil-Spill, Phoneme, Creditcard, BankNoteAuthentication, Balance scale weight &amp; distance database and Yeast data sets. The proposed method shows an accuracy of 96.1%, 96.5%, 87.7%, 87.3%, 95%, 92.4%, 98.4%, 86.1%, 94% and 95.9% respectively. The results suggest that this method outperforms other deep learning methods and machine learning methods with respect to G-mean and other performance metrics.},

It is the process of predicting the request of the next web page that users are significantly interested while searching the web. It helps the users to find relevant pages in the field of web mining. In particular, web user may spend more time to identify expected information. To understand behavior of users and to visit the page based on their interest at a specific time, an effective web page recommendation method is developed by developed Multi-Verse Sailfish Optimization (MVSFO)-based Deep Residual network. Accordingly, proposed MVSFO is derived by the integration of Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO) and Sailfish Optimizer (SFO), respectively. Here, the process of recommendation is carried out using weblog data and the web page image. The sequential patterns are acquired from weblog data, and the patterns are grouped with Deep fuzzy clustering based on cosine similarity. The matching process among test pattern and sequential patterns are made using Canberra distance. Here, the recommended web pages obtained from the weblog data and pages obtained from web pages image using the Deep Residual network are enable to generate the output using fractional order-based ranking.

  abstract     = {The breast cancer diagnosis is one of the challenging tasks of medical field. Especially, the breast cancer diagnosis among younger women (under 40 years old) is more complicated, because their breast tissue is generally denser than the older women. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin image dataset contains two classes: (i) Benign (Minority class), (ii) Malignant (Majority class). The imbalanced class distribution leads to a deterioration in the classifier model performance owing to the biased classification towards the majority class. Therefore, in this article, an improved generative adversarial network (I-GAN) is proposed to overcome the class imbalance problem. Here, the proposed method is the consolidation of deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCIGAN) and modified convolutional neural network, (MCNN), therefore it is known as DCIGAN-MCNN method. First, the DCIGAN is utilized for balancing the dataset by generating more samples in the training dataset. Then, this training dataset based the classification of Breast cancer is developed using the modified convolutional neural network. The proposed method is executed in MATLAB. The performance analysis are carried out in Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Prognostic) Data Set provides Maximum Geometry Mean (MGM) as 24.058%, 9.582%, Matthews’s correlation coefficient (MCC) as 78.623%, 30.357% higher than the existing methods, like CI-BC-RK-SVM, CI-BC-GA, CI-BC-DC-CNN, CI-BC-RF and CI-BC-BMIC-Net respectively.

In addition, future values are modeled by using forecasting methods, i.e., point estimation and interval estimation.

Using these results, a genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem for obtaining optimal or converging solutions. The effectiveness of the algorithm is also compared with other methods found in the literature. The previous methods require conversion of the problem into 0-1 mixed integer optimization problem solvable by some nonlinear optimization solvers and thereby, the computational work may increase with the size of the problem. Some test problems are developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

However, these individuals and companies face more challenges with the issue of “how to obtain the full benefit that the platforms provide”. Therefore, social media policies to improve the online promotion are turning out to be more significant. The popularization of social media contents are related to public attention and interest of users, thus the popularity fore cast of online contents has considered being the major task in social media analytic and it facilitates several appliances in diverse domain as well. This paper intends to introduce a popularity forecast approach that derives and combines the richest data of “text content encoder, user encoder, time series encoder, and user sentiment analysis”. The extracted features are then predicted via Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Particularly, to enhance the prediction accuracy of the LSTM, the weights are fine-tuned via Self Adaptive Rain optimization (SA-RO).},

It is necessary to develop an automated technique for COVID-19 identification. This work investigates a new framework that predicts COVID-19 based on X-ray images. The suggested methodology contains core phases as preprocessing, feature extraction, selection and categorization. The Guided and 2D Gaussian filters are utilized for image improvement as a preprocessing phase. The outcome is then passed to 2D-superpixel method for region of interest (ROI). The pre-trained models such as Darknet-53 and Densenet-201 are then applied for features extraction from the segmented images. The entropy coded GLEO features selection is based on the extracted and selected features, and ensemble serially to produce a single feature vector. The single vector is finally supplied as an input to the variations of the SVM classifier for the categorization of the normal/abnormal (COVID-19) X-rays images. The presented approach is evaluated with different measures known as accuracy, recall, F1 Score, and precision. The integrated framework for the proposed system achieves the acceptable accuracies on the SVM Classifiers, which authenticate the proposed approach’s effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Big data is important in knowledge manipulation, assessment, and prediction. However, extracting and analyzing knowledge through big database are complex because of imbalance data distribution that leads to wrong decisions and biased classification outputs. Hence, an effective and optimal big data classification approach is designed using the proposed Bird Swarm Deer Hunting Optimization-Deep Belief Network (BSDHO-based DBN) algorithm based on spark architecture that follows the master and slave nodes. The proposed BSDHO is obtained by combining Deer Hunting Optimization algorithm and Bird Swarm Algorithm. The developed model poses two nodes, namely slave and master node. The training data is initially given to the master node in the spark architecture to perform transformation of data. Here, the transformation of data is done with an exponential log kernel, and then selection of feature is done with sequential forward selecting for choosing suitable features for enhanced processing. Consequently, oversampling process is performed with Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (Fuzzy KNN) in the slave node using selected features to manage imbalance data. Then, in master node, classification is done with Deep belief Network, and trained using developed Bird swarm Deer Hunting Optimization (BSDHO) algorithm. On the other hand, the test data is taken as input, and is fed to the slave node to perform data transformation. Then, the transformed data is given to the master node for classification based on the proposed BSDHO. At last, the training data and testing data output produced the classified output. The proposed BSDHO-based DBN provided enhanced outcomes with highest specificity of 97.92%, accuracy of 96.92%, and sensitivity of 96.9%.},

Most of the recent granular computing based clustering algorithms only utilize the plain granule features without taking the granule structure into account, especially in information area with widespread application of algebraic structure. This paper aims at proposing an algebraic structure based clustering method from granular computing prospective. Specifically, the algebraic structure based granularity is firstly formulated based on the granule structure of an algebraic binary operator. An algebraic structure based clustering method is then proposed by incorporating congruence partitioning granules and homomorphically projecting granule structure. Finally, proof of the lattice at multiple hierarchical levels and comparative analysis of experimental cases validate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering method. The algebraic structure based clustering method can provide a general framework to perform granularity clustering using the algebraic granule structure information. It meanwhile advances the granular computing methods by combing the granular computing theory and the clustering theory.},

As a supplement to the previous results, in this article we fully characterize the distributivity equations of idempotent uninorms over these two functions by virtue of the associated functions of idempotent uninorms. Moreover, we also discuss the distributivity conditions of above two special functions over idempotent uninorms, yet find in this case that the associated functions of idempotent uninorms must satisfy particular conditions and those two functions usually are a class of special aggregation functions with a constant domain whose value equals to the neutral element of the idempotent uninorm.},

When instance features or label sets are too sparse to be extracted effectively, we argument that the inter-instance relations and inter-label correlation can supplement and deduce the relevant information. Meanwhile, to enhance the explainable of neural network, Gaussian process is adopted to simulate the real underlying distribution of multi-label dataset. Besides, this paper also considers that contributions of different features have different effects on the experimental results, thus self-attention is leveraged to balance various features.

The literature displays a number of clustering algorithms using a map-reduce framework, but they did not assure the effective clusters such that knowledge extraction becomes tough. With the aim to render a better and effective data clustering method to analyze the big data arriving from distributed systems, this paper uses a new clustering method. The proposed method named as BatDolphin-based Sparse Fuzzy C-Means (BatDol-Sparse FCM) clustering algorithm is proposed that paves way for the optimal selection of the cluster centroids. The distributed big data is managed using the Map-Reduce framework that is inbuilt with the BatDolphin-based Sparse Fuzzy C-Means algorithm such that the local and global clustering is executed. The implementation of the proposed BatDol-Sparse FCM algorithm is done by using data from the E-khool Learning Management System (LMS) and three medical datasets from the UCI repository. The analysis is performed using the metrics, such as clustering accuracy (CA) and dice coefficient (DC). From the simulation results, it is evident that the proposed parallel clustering scheme provided better results than the existing algorithms with the values of 0.96 and 0.9667 for CA and DC respectively.},
