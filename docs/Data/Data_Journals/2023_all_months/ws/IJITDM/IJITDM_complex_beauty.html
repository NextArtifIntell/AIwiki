It is observed that the reviewer evaluation reports have a crucial impact on the support decisions of the projects. In this study, a decision support system (DSS), namely R&amp;D Reviewer, is developed to help the decision-makers with the assignment of the appropriate reviewer to R&amp;D project proposals. It is aimed to create an artificial intelligence-based decision support system that enables the classification of Turkish R&amp;D projects with natural language processing (NLP) methods. Furthermore, we examine the reviewer ranking process by using fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods. The data in the database is processed primarily to classify the R&amp;D projects and the word embedding model NLP, “Word2Vec”. Also, we designed the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to select the features by using the automatic feature learning approach. Moreover, we incorporate a new integrated hesitant fuzzy VIKOR and TOPSIS methodology into the developed DSS for the reviewer ranking process.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops an approach for detecting landslide using IoT. The simulation of IoT is the preliminary step that helps to collect data. The suggested Water Particle Grey Wolf Optimization (WPGWO) is used for the routing. The Water Cycle Algorithm (WCA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) are combined in the suggested method (WPGWO). The fitness is newly modeled considering energy, link cost, distance, and delay. The maintenance of routes is done to assess the dependability of the network topology. The landslide detection process is carried out at the IoT base station. In feature selection, angular distance is used. Oversampling is used to enrich the data, and Deep Residual Network (DRN) — used for landslide identification — is trained using the proposed Water Cycle Particle Swarm Optimization (WCPSO) method, which combines WCA and PSO. The proposed WCPSO-based DRN offered effective performance with the highest energy of 0.049 J, throughput of 0.0495, accuracy of 95.7%, sensitivity of 97.2% and specificity of 93.9%. This approach demonstrated improved robustness and produced the global best optimal solution. For the proposed WPGWO, WCA, GWO, and PSO are linked to improve performance in determining the optimum routes. When comparing with existing methods the proposed WCPSO-based DRN offered effective performance.},

  abstract     = {Background: The social media revolution has offered new facilities and opportunities to the online community to communicate their intentions, opinions, and views regarding products, services, policies, and events. The identification of intent focuses on the detection of intents from user reviews, that is, whether the specific review of the user includes intention or not. Intent mining is also named intent identification which helps business organizations to identify the purchase intentions of users. However, detecting user intentions encoded in text queries is a complicated task in several Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as robots, smart agents, personal assistants, and search engines. The existing research works have discovered the utilization of several machine learning techniques to detect the intents from queries of users. Most works consider intent detection as a classification problem, with utterances as predefined intents. Research question: Whether the researcher resolves the detection of user intentions encoded in text queries? How the researcher solves the existing challenges based on intent mining? Purpose: The main contribution of the research is to design and implement intent detection using topic clustering and deep learning. Methodology: Initially, the dataset related to diverse queries is gathered. Then, the label creation is performed by clustering. The clustering is performed by a k -means clustering model with a cosine similarity function. Once the clustering is performed for different queries, the label is created, which is used to train the network under the detection process. For the detection, this paper uses a Heuristic-based Capsule Network (H-CapNet) that could perform the intention for a new query. The hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm with Escaping Energy searched Grey–Harris Hawks Algorithm (EEG-HHA) is used for improving the capsule network. Validation: Experimental analysis shows that the developed method has superior performance in evaluating standard datasets with other approaches. Results: From the simulation results, the accuracy of the developed EEG-HHA-CapNet for dataset 1 is secured at 3%, 1.6%, 2%, and 1.1% increased than PSO-CapNet, WOA-CapNet, HHO-CapNet, and GWO-CapNet. Conclusion: Thus, the designed user intent detection models reveal their more advanced performance based on the diverse performance and error metrics for datasets 1 and 2.},

However, since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, stock markets around the world seem to suffer a serious impact. Therefore, whether investors can beat the markets by applying technical trading rules during the period of COVID-19 pandemic becomes an important issue for market participants. The purpose of this study is to examine the profitability of trading stocks with the use of technical trading rules under the COVID-19 pandemic. By trading the constituent stocks of DJ 30 and NASDAQ 100, we find that almost all of the trading rules employed in this study fail to beat the market during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which is different from the results in 2019. The revealed findings of this study may shed light on that investors should adopt technical trading with care when stock markets are seriously affected by black swan events like COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges in the Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) field is how we can identify criteria weights correctly. However, some MCDA methods do not use an explicitly defined vector of criterion weights, leaving the decision-maker lacking knowledge in this area. This is the motivation for our research because, in that case, a decision-maker cannot indicate a detailed justification for the proposed results. In this paper, we focus on the problem of identifying criterion weights in multi-criteria problems. Based on the proposed Characteristic Object Method (COMET) model, we used linear regression to determine the global and local criterion weights in the given situation. The work was directed toward a practical problem, i.e., evaluating Formula One drivers’ performances in races in the 2021 season. The use of the linear regression model allowed for identifying the criterion weights. Thanks to that, the expert using the system based on the COMET method can be equipped with the missing knowledge about the significance of the criteria. The local identification allowed us to establish how small input parameter changes affect the final result. However, the local weights are still highly correlated with global weights. The proposed approach to identifying weights proved to be an effective tool that can be used to fill in the missing knowledge that the expert can use to justify the results in detail. Moreover, weights identified in that way seem to be more reliable than in the classical approach, where we know only global weights. From the research it can be concluded, that the identified global and local weights importance provide highly similar results, while the former one provides more detailed information for the expert. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be used as a support tool in the practical problem as it guarantees additional data for the decision-maker.},

  abstract     = {Since capital may not be abundant for banks, banks have to assess the efficiency of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to efficiently and profitably allocate available funds. This study aims to generate criteria priority series for the decision process of commercial credit applications (DPCCAs) to conduct statistical hypothesis testing and produce information for researchers, decision-makers/managers. Having lots of criteria in assessing SME performance, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) — a multi-criteria decision-making method — is applied according to experts’ views. By determining SMEs’ indicator-criteria priorities, this study’s priorities give information on SME growth potential, managerial competence and institutionalization which are rarely used in SMEs’ credit evaluation in academic studies. This study also evaluates tolerated consistency boundary approach (TCBA) defined in Pekkaya’s studies and generates priority-series that allows for statistical testing. The findings reveal that “profitability and business volume” with its sub-criteria of “operating profitability” have the highest priority, and then “stability and intelligence” with “repayment practices of debts” and “total income and stability in profitability” have quite high priorities among seven main- and 26 sub-criteria. This study contains some criteria which are not previously observed in the related literature, incorporates considerably more expert views, and shows to conduct statistical hypothesis tests by using the generated priority series via AHP for each criterion.},

In contrast, the pedagogical strategies that adapt to the fundamental individual skills of the students have proved to be more effective.

Effective utilization of these approaches can be enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) and semantic web technologies that can increase data generation, access, flow, integration, and comprehension using the same open standards driving the World Wide Web. This study proposes a novel adaptive educational eLearning system (AEeLS) that can gather and analyze data from learning repositories and adapt these to the educational curriculum according to the student’s skills and experience.

  abstract     = {Background: In recent times, medical technology has generated massive reports such as scanned medical images and electronic patient accounts. These reports are necessary to be stored in the highly secured platform for further reference. Traditional storage systems are infeasible for storing massive data. In addition, it suffers to provide secure storage and privacy protection at the time of medical services. It is necessary to provide secure storage and full utilization of personal medical records for the common people in practice. The healthcare system based on IoT enhances the support for the patients and doctors in diagnosing the sufferers at an accurate time using the monitored health data. Yet, doctors make an inappropriate decision regarding the sufferer’s sickness when the information regarding health data saved in the cloud gets lost or hacked owing to an external attack or also power failure. Hence, it is highly essential for verifying the truthfulness of the sufferer’s information regarding health data saved on the cloud.Hypothesis: The major intention of this task is to adopt a new chaotic-based healthcare medical data storage system for storing medical data (medical images) with high protection. Methodology: Initially, the input medical images are gathered from the benchmark datasets concerning different modalities. The collected medical images are enciphered by developing Hybrid Chaotic Map by adapting the 2D-Logistic Chaotic Map (2DLCM), and Piece-Wise Linear Chaotic Map (PWLCM) referred to as Hybrid Logistic Piece-Wise Chaotic Map (HLPWCM). An Optimized Recurrent Neural Network (O-RNN) is proposed for key generation using Best Fitness-based Coefficient vector improved Spotted Hyena Optimizer (BF-CSHO). The O-RNN-based key generation utilizes the extracted image features like first and second-order statistical features and the targets are acquired as a unique encrypted key, which is used for securing the medical data. The same BF-CSHO is used for improving the training algorithm (weight optimization) of RNN to minimize the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the cipher (encrypted) images and original images. Results: From the result analysis, the suggested BF-CSHO-RNN-HLPWCM, by considering the image size at 5 5 4 × 5 5 4 shows 10.4%, 8.5%, 3.97%, 0.62%, 3.88%, 2.40%, and 7.82% provides better computational efficiency than LCM, PWLCM, LPWCM, PSO-RNN-HLPWCM, JA-RNN-HLPWCM, GWO-RNN-HLPWCM, and SHO-RNN-HLPWCM, respectively. Conclusion: Thus, the simulation findings show the effective efficiency of the offered method owing to the security of the stored medical data.},

  abstract     = {Data provenance is a kind of metadata that describes the origin and derivation history of data. It provides the information about various direct and indirect sources of data and different transformations applied on it. Provenance information are beneficial in determining the quality, truthfulness, and authenticity of data. It also explains how, when, why, and by whom this data are created. In a relational database, fine-grained provenance captured at different stages (i.e., multi-layer provenance) is more significant and explanatory as it provides various remarkable information such as immediate and intermediate sources and origin of data. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-layer data provenance framework for Zero-Information Loss Relational Database (ZILRDB) . The proposed framework is implemented on top of the relational database using the object relational database concepts to maintain all insert, delete, and update operations efficiently. It has the capability to capture multi-layer provenance for different query sets including historical queries. We also propose Provenance Relational Algebra (PRA) as an extension of traditional relational algebra to capture the provenance for ASPJU (Aggregate, Select, Project, Join, Union) queries in relational database. The framework provides a detailed provenance analysis through multi-depth provenance querying. We store the provenance data in both relational and graph database, and further evaluate the performance of the framework in terms of provenance storage overhead and average execution time for provenance querying.

  abstract     = {The ubiquity of data, and in particular in MCDM situations, makes it challenging for the Decision Makers (DM) to figure out a way of making proper use of data. This paper presents a three-stage decision framework for DMs to consider the performance range of alternatives holistically. The framework consists of (i) data preparation, (ii) two distance-based Gray Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM-G) methods using gray interval data to rank the alternatives and (iii) a decision analysis template. For comparison, gray Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) and gray Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison (MABAC) methods that rely on arithmetic and geometric mean respectively are used to generate the ranks. The mean-based ranking methods produce stable and efficient ranks in comparison to extremum-based comparison methods, due to their innate nature. The correlation of ranks is analyzed to conclude that the stability of ranks is better when gray interval data is considered. As an example, this paper considers performance range of the 10 criteria used in computing Ease of Doing Business (EDB) index as the gray interval. The sample performance of the G20 countries during the period 2004 to 2020 was used to illustrate the calculations. Further, a general analytic template based on the rank deviation on account of differences in upper and lower bounds of performance helped in classifying the economies as stable leaders, predictable middle and volatile followers. The paper contributes a suitable MCDM and analysis approach when the DM is presented with a gray interval as the alternatives’ performance.},

The Sailfish Optimization is a swarm-based metaheuristics optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging strategy of a group of Sailfish. Sailfish Optimization explores the search space in only one direction, limiting its converging capacity and causing local minima stagnation. Convergence will be optimal if the search space is reconnoitred in both directions, improving classification accuracy. As a result, combining the Opposition-Based Learning and Sailfish Optimization strategies improves SFO’s exploration capability by patrolling the search space in all directions. Sailfish Optimization Algorithm based on Opposition-Based Learning successfully amalgamates the model to global optima at a faster convergence rate and better classification accuracy. The recommended method is tested with six different cancer microarray datasets for two different classifiers: the Support Vector Machine classifier and the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. From the results obtained, the proposed model aided with Support Vector Machine outperforms the existing Sailfish Optimization with or without K-Nearest Neighbor in terms of convergence capability, classification accuracy, and selection of the most delicate salient features from the dataset.},

This paper proposes a behavioral TOPSIS with prospect theory and regret theory considering risk attitudes. First, the defect of classical TOPSIS is illustrated as motivation. Next, we introduce a behavioral TOPSIS with prospect theory and show how it overcomes the defect of classical TOPSIS. Then, regret theory is applied to extend behavioral TOPSIS to show the regret attitude. Finally, a numerical example is used to demonstrate the feasibility and comparative analysis is presented to show the novelty and validity of the proposed method.},

Since only a few studies have considered this context, this research examines how eight variants of a digital presentation of cordless kettle packaging influence purchase willingness, which was derived from pairwise comparisons using eigenvectors. The experimental conditions differed in three factors: the existence of a product graphical context, a brief or extended product description, and white or black packaging background color. Results of analyses of variance and conjoint analyses revealed a significant role of all examined effects, with the background color being the least influential. The best-rated designs included graphical context and extended textual information. There were also some meaningful gender-related differences revealed by conjoint analyses. The black background color was much more important for females than males. The outcomes broaden our knowledge on people’s perception of packaging design graphical factors, and their impact on purchase decisions.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 infection was announced as a pandemic in late 2019. Due to the high speed of the spread, rapid diagnosis can prevent the virus outbreak. Detection of the virus using prominent information from CT scan images is a fast, cheap, and accessible method. However, these image datasets are imbalanced due to the nature of medical data and the lack of coronavirus images. Consequently, the conventional classification algorithms classify this data unsuitably. Oversampling technique is one of the most well-known methods that try to balance the dataset by increasing the minority class of the data. This paper presents a new oversampling model using an improved deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to produce samples that improve classifier performance. In previous DCGAN structures, the feature extraction took place only in the convolution layer, while in the proposed structure, it is done in both the convolution layer and the pooling layer. A Haar transform layer as the pooling layer tries to extract better features. Evaluation results on two hospital datasets express an accuracy of 95.8 and a loss criterion of 0.5354 for the suggested architecture. Moreover, compared to the standard DCGAN structure, the proposed model has superiority in all classification criteria. Therefore, the new model can assist radiologists in validating the initial screening.},

Crew scheduling has vital importance, especially in service sector, to manage the most unmeasurable and imponderable resource and cardinal element, human. Due to its NP-Hard structure, although mathematically modeling it is possible, it is nearly impossible to optimally solve it solely relying on mathematical modeling solution methodologies. This study proposes a tailor-made decision support system (DSS) to derive the optimal solution to crew scheduling problem as integer linear programming (ILP) models. The proposed DSS-based ILP approach was introduced on the optimal solution of a large-scaled real-world airline crew scheduling problem considering 189 daily flights and 14402 possible weekly routes. Additional computational experiments were performed to prove that the proposed DSS could be used for practical support with agility and efficiency on variant real-life scheduling decisions.},

The motivation is to help a fast access to the relevant literature, better capabilities to address suitable CW methods in real-world problems, and better communication among the MADM/CW researchers. The basic feature of the proposed approach is the identified underlying concepts (called rule) of the CW methods. Under the study, several rules were identified and coded. The paper also portrays a complete and up-to-date survey of the published literature on the original CW methods. In addition, to select appropriate methods in real-life situations, a set of brief guidelines are raised up.

Given a set Ω and a proximity function ϕ : Ω × Ω → ℝ + , we define a new metric for Ω by considering a path distance in Ω that is considered as a graph. We analyze the properties of such a distance, and several procedures for defining the initial proximity matrix ( ϕ ( a , b ) ) ( a , b ) ∈ Ω × Ω .

This is done to mitigate multicollinearity that may exist among different inventory criteria, which artificially inflates total data variance. Besides, and differently from previous research, information reliability techniques such as information entropy and gray relational analysis (GRA) are used as an auxiliary tool to differentiate alternative ABC methods proposed in the literature in terms of the principle of maximal entropy. This principle states that the probability distribution that best represents the current state of knowledge given prior data is the one with largest entropy. Results suggest that the proposed robust TOPSIS-AFEA provides an adequate representation of score ranks that may be computed on different datasets by using existing alternative ABC inventory classification models.},

  abstract     = {In the fuzzy multicriteria decision-making approach, a committee of decision-makers is usually involved in the assessment of the suitability of different alternatives based on the evaluation criteria by using linguistic terms and their equivalent fuzzy numbers. In this context, researchers have developed the Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) to overcome the limitation of intuitionistic fuzzy set in the description of decision-maker information such as imposing restrictions on the representation of membership and nonmembership grades. On the one hand, PFS still does not have sufficient ability and flexibility to deal with such issues. On the other hand, multipolar technology is used to operate large-scale systems in real-life situations, especially in dealing with dissatisfaction and indeterminacy grades for the alternatives of the reference set. Thus, m -polar fuzzy set is utilized and applied with other fuzzy sets because of its remarkable ability as a tool for depicting fuzziness and uncertainty under multipolar information in many circumstances. With the practical features of m -polar fuzzy set in combination with PFS, this paper employs it to extend two considerable MCDM methods, namely, fuzzy decision by opinion score method and fuzzy-weighted zero inconsistency. Such extensions, called Pythagorean m -polar fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (Pm-PFWZIC) method and Pythagorean m -polar fuzzy decision by opinion score method (Pm-PFDOSM), are formulated to weight the evaluation criteria followed by alternative ranking progressively. The research methodology is presented as follows. Firstly, the mechanisms of Pm-PFWZIC and Pm-PFDOSM are formulated and integrated into the development phase. Secondly, the description of the real-world case study of the evaluation and benchmarking of the sign language recognition systems is adapted and presented. The result of Pm-PFWZIC shows that the criterion of ‘finger movements’ has the highest weight amongst the rest of the criteria, whereas ‘misclassification error’ has the lowest weight. In the ranking results, a variation of ranking is scored by each expert, and group decision-making is applied to solve the individual ranking variety. The robustness of the formulated methods is evaluated using systematic ranking, sensitivity analysis and comparison analysis.},

Therefore, it generates an intermediate output, which is important to estimate the quantitative and qualitative returns to scale and for managers to make decisions. Estimates of scale elasticity have long been considered in two-stage technologies, many researchers have suggested methods to estimate it, but they were not investigated from the base, and the intermediate output was also ignored. There were no strong relationships between the total scale elasticity and the scale elasticity of both stages. The proposed method can estimate the scale elasticity from the base and from the production transfer function, which in turn has a stronger basic structure compared to previously proposed methods. It is much simpler and easier to be understood than previous methods. The scale elasticity of the entire network can be estimated by multiplying the scale elasticity of both stages. By expressing the parametric and nonparametric approaches of two-stage network scale elasticity, the ratio of the final output to primary input changes can be obtained according to the change of the intermediate output compared to primary input as well as the final output to intermediate input. Finally, the superiority of the proposed method is illustrated by practical examples.},

Innovation is very important to the sustainable development of enterprises. However, current knowledge on whether and how sustainable innovation and innovation adoption can be understood from the perspective of technology application behavior has not been examined empirically. Based on decision-making levels derived from the attitude-implementation-confirmation (A-I-C) framework and following rule conditions on front- and back-of-house processes, the aim of this study is to provide practical recommendations for the establishment of a pattern of green innovation action that influences the implementation of innovation among early adopters in the restaurant industry. Using 499 questionnaire responses and diverse statistical methods, we verify that the effect of innovation adoption is significant and positive on sustainable innovation, and the effects of innovation adoption and sustainability are both significant and positive on technology application and behavior, respectively. Moreover, the effects of technology application are significant and positive on behavior and mediate the link between innovation adoption and behavior. Finally, technology application is modestly moderated by green resource motivation techniques (GrRMT) to influence behavior. The empirical results proved that innovation adoption, sustainable innovation, technology application and GrRMT improve the mechanism of creative behavior in the food/ hospitality sector.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on two issues of group decision-making (GDM). First, the multiple rounds of feedback recommendations in the consensus reaching process (CRP) make GDM inefficient. The second is no involvement of heterogeneous decision-makers (DMs), possibly end-users as stakeholders apart from the experts. To address the first issue, a novel threshold-based feedback mechanism is introduced to improve the efficiency of the CRP that helps the experts reach consensus in at most one round of feedback. To address the second issue, end-users are invited to participate in decision-making where their majority group opinion is used. Then, a novel concept of tolerance degree of the moderator is proposed to obtain the final decision considering the consensual opinion of experts and cumulative opinion of end-users. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a case of healthcare service selection. Further, various experiments are conducted to show how the proposed work outperforms the existing works.},

  abstract     = {Combinatorial metaheuristic optimization algorithms have newly become a remarkable domain for handling real-world and engineering design optimization problems. In this paper, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Woodpecker Mating Algorithm (WMA) are combined as HWMWOA. WOA is an effective algorithm with the advantage of global searching ability, where the control parameters are very less. But WOA is more probable to get trapped in the local optimum points and miss diversity of population, therefore suffering from premature convergence. The fundamental goal of the HWMWOA algorithm is to overcome the drawbacks of WOA. This betterment includes three basic mechanisms. First, a modified position update equation of WMA by efficient exploration ability is embedded into HWMWOA. Second, a new self-regulation Cauchy mutation operator is allocated to the proposed hybrid method. Finally, an arithmetic spiral movement with a novel search guide pattern is used in the suggested HWMWOA algorithm. The efficiency of the suggested algorithm is appraised over 48 test functions, and the optimal outcomes are compared with 15 most popular and newest metaheuristic optimization algorithms. Moreover, the HWMWOA algorithm is applied for simultaneously optimizing the parameters of SVM (Support Vector Machine) and feature weighting to handle the data classification problem on several real-world datasets from the UCI database. The outcomes prove the superiority of the suggested hybrid algorithm compared to both WOA and WMA. In addition, the results represent that the HWMWOA algorithm outperforms other efficient techniques impressively.},

The RF signals are converted into two-dimensional (2D) spectrograms which are exploited as inputs for the CNN. To confirm the usefulness of RF ultrasound signals in the classification of microemboli, two in vitro setups are developed. For the two setups, a contrast agent consisting of microbubbles is used to imitate the acoustic behavior of gaseous microemboli. In order to imitate the acoustic behavior of solid microemboli, the tissue mimicking material surrounding the tube is used for the first setup. However, for the second setup, a Doppler fluid containing particles with scattering characteristics comparable to the red blood cells is used. Results have shown that the suggested approach achieved better classification rates compared to the results obtained in previous studies.},

  abstract     = {The digital divide first emerged as an important social and human rights issue in the 1990s. With the rapid development of wireless network technology (e.g., Wi-Fi and cellular networks) and mobile terminal devices (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and tablets), this issue has shifted to concern mobile Internet access. The three main Chinese telecom operators (China Mobile Communications Corporation, China Unicom Communications Corporation, and China Telecom Communications Corporation) have recently promoted unlimited data plans (UDPs) to reduce information usage costs and increase mobile data use. However, assessments of the impact of these policy changes on the mobile digital divide are limited. This study therefore offers insights into how a reduction in information costs can eliminate this divide. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach based on a monthly panel of system-generated mobile app data for subscribers, we find that the UDPs have various effects on promoting the use of mobile Internet and on the digital divide, depending on whether subscribers are of high or low socioeconomic status (i.e., urban versus rural and rich versus poor). We show that the relative differences are alleviated, but the absolute difference further increases after the implementation of a UDP subscription. In addition, a UDP subscription has heterogeneous effects on lifestyles. For the poor or those in rural areas, only promoting UDP does not effectively narrow the mobile digital divide because of insufficient cognition about and persistent weaknesses in the use of information technology.},

A case study of household appliances in a local market is used to demonstrate how the dynamics of preferences between domestic and foreign brands occurs.

  abstract     = {Context: Successful project management requires accurate estimation of maintenance effort and cost. Software Maintainability Prediction (SMP) plays a very important role in controlling software maintenance costs by detecting software modules with low maintainability. In previous research, numerous regression techniques were applied to predict software maintainability. The results with respect to various accuracy or performance measures are conflicting. Thus, there is a dire need to develop a method that can recommend regression techniques for predicting software maintainability in the presence of conflicting performance or accuracy measures. Objective: This paper aims to recommend suitable regression techniques for SMP based on the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach. Methodology: In our proposed approach, selecting a regression technique for SMP is modeled as the MCDM problem. To validate the proposed approach, an empirical study is done using three MCDM methods, 22 regression techniques, and eight performance measures over five software maintainability datasets. Before applying MCDM methods, a statistical test, namely the Friedman test, was conducted to ensure the significant difference between regression techniques. Results: The results of our study show that SVR, IBK, REPTree, and MLP-SVM achieve the highest-ranking score value one and are recommended as top-ranked approaches for SMP based on MCDM rankings. Conclusion: The main outcome of this study is that the proposed MCDM-based approach can be used as an efficient tool for selecting regression techniques among different available regression techniques for SMP modeling in the presence of more than one conflicting accuracy or performance measure.},

Accordingly, to determine which weighting method for which criterion group is more suitable, the selection procedure of KEMIRA-M was applied and alternative rankings were obtained for 81 different weight set combinations.

  abstract     = {Two-sided matching decision-making (TSMDM) problems widely exist in human being’s life. In practical TSMDM problems, subjects who are being matched with usually tend to provide linguistic evaluations for convenience. Owing to the fuzziness of decision-making environment, subjects may provide several linguistic terms associated with their probabilities as the evaluations, which can be described as the probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs). To model such scenarios, this paper proposes a TSMDM approach with probabilistic linguistic evaluations. The probabilistic linguistic evaluations are firstly normalized with the preservation of ignored probabilities. The normalized evaluations are then aggregated into the comprehensive evaluations by using the defined Choquet integral-based probabilistic linguistic aggregation (CIPLA) operator. Thereafter, the satisfaction degrees of two sides of subjects are calculated based on the closeness coefficient in TOPSIS method. On the basis of this, a multi-objective TSMDM model aiming to maximize the comprehensive satisfaction degree is built and transformed into a single-objective TSMDM model considering the weights of two sides. To solve the single-objective TSMDM model is to determine the optimal matching result. An illustrative example of matching enterprises and knowledge-sender universities is introduced to validate the proposed approach and compare it with other existing TSMDM approaches. The results illustrate that the proposed approach can not only avoid information loss, but also effectively integrate PLTSs with correlative criteria.},

RoBERTa, a transfer learning framework in conjunction with K -means-based unsupervised text clustering, was used to form a homogeneous grouping of Airbnb units across the cities. Subsequently, particle swarm optimization (PSO) driven advanced ensemble machine learning frameworks have been utilized for predicting rental prices across the formed clusters of respective cities using 32 offer-related features. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence (AI), an emerging field of AI, has been utilized to interpret the high-end predictive modeling to infer deeper insights into the nature and direction of influence of explanatory features on rental prices at respective locations. The rental prices of Airbnb units in Geneva and Brussels have appeared to be highly predictable, while the units in London and Milan have been found to be less predictable. Different types of amenity offerings largely explain the variation in rental prices across the cities.},

  abstract     = {In the chronic disease diagnosis with high-dimensional clinical features, feature selection (FS) algorithms are widely applied to avoid sparse data. In current FS algorithms, only population features, which are in strong relevance with states of all patients, are extracted, while subspace features, which are in weak relevance with states of all patients but in strong relevance with states of patients under a certain state, are ignored. Eliminated relevant information in subspace features worsens the performance of current classification models. To alleviate the conflict of feature extraction in sparse data, we propose a two-phase classification model with relevant information in both population and subspace features considered. For a patient, his probability under each state is estimated in a space whose dimensions are population features in Phase 1, and in a space whose dimensions are subspace features under that state in Phase 2. The final result of the classification model is based on results in both phases. With both population and subspace features considered and probabilities under each state estimated in a low-dimensional space, the two-phase classification model outperforms other benchmark models both in accuracy and mean absolute error in the hepatic fibrosis diagnosis for patients with chronic hepatitis B.},

  abstract     = {The exchange rate dynamics affect national economies because fluctuations in currency prices distort their economic activity. To maintain an optimal exchange rate policy, these dynamics are crucial for countries with a trade economy. Due to the difficulty in predicting the participants behavior in some complex economic systems, which might throw the system into chaos, a novel stochastic exchange rate dynamics (SERD) model is introduced and investigated in this paper. Furthermore, a neural network approach is proposed and examined as a control chaos method to address the problem of stabilizing SERD through central bank interventions. Derived from power activation feed-forward neuronets, a 2-input weights-and-structure-determination-based neuronet (2I-WASDBN) model for controlling chaos in SERD under central bank intervention is presented in this paper. Six simulation experiments on stabilizing the chaotic behavior of the SERD model show that the 2I-WASDBN model outperforms other well-performing neural network models and that it is more effective than traditional methods for controlling chaos. By examining the volume of necessary intervention predicted by the 2I-WASDBN model, central banks can better comprehend exchange rate fluctuations and, in conjunction with their monetary policies, can make more precise decisions regarding the strategy of their interventions.},

  abstract     = {The landmark achievements of AlphaGo Zero have created great research interest into self-play in reinforcement learning. In self-play, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is used to train a deep neural network, which is then used itself in tree searches. The training is governed by many hyper-parameters. There has been surprisingly little research on design choices for hyper-parameter values and loss functions, presumably because of the prohibitive computational cost to explore the parameter space. In this paper, we investigate 12 hyper-parameters in an AlphaZero-like self-play algorithm and evaluate how these parameters contribute to training. Through multi-objective analysis, we identify four important hyper-parameters to further assess. To start, we find surprising results where too much training can sometimes lead to lower performance. Our main result is that the number of self-play iterations subsumes MCTS-search simulations, game episodes and training epochs. As a consequence of our experiments, we provide recommendations on setting hyper-parameter values in self-play. The outer loop of self-play iterations should be emphasized, in favor of the inner loop. This means hyper-parameters for the inner loop, should be set to lower values. A secondary result of our experiments concerns the choice of optimization goals, for which we also provide recommendations.},

  abstract     = {Classification algorithm selection is an important concern for breast cancer diagnosis. The traditional routine of adopting a unique performance metric for evaluating classifiers is not adequate in the case of micro-array gene expression dataset. This paper introduces an MCDM technique to evaluate classification algorithms in breast cancer forecasting by seeing different performance measure along with feature space. An empirical study is designed to support an overall assessment of classifiers on micro-array datasets using well-known MCDM technique. TOPSIS is used to rank 11 prominent assessment criteria of different classifiers. First, the sequence order of 20 classifiers along with 11 assessment criteria is generated. Further topmost classifiers are grounded on their performances highlighting the role of feature selection in the overall process supporting the genuine assessment of classifiers over any solitary performance criteria. Result indicates that AdaBoostM1 and Iterative Classifier Optimizer are graded as topmost classifiers without and with feature selection, respectively, grounded on their performances on different measures. Furthermore, the proposed MCDM-based model can reconcile distinct or even inconsistent evaluation performance to grasp a group agreement in a complicated decision-making environment.},

  abstract     = {For the design process of mechanical or electrical devices it is often necessary to consider multiple objectives. The design problem can then be formulated as multi-objective optimization problem. Multiple objectives can be conflicting and to pick a design solution a trade-off between those is required. A good trade-off is important for a successful product. Different decision making methods are available aiming towards a successful design trade-off; a commonly used method is the VIKOR method. This paper focuses on aspects of this method and reveals some weaknesses. However, a different normalization method is introduced that overcomes these aspects. Next, a minimum weight margin is established that gives information about the stability of a design solution picked by the VIKOR method. The weight margin is helpful for elucidating the decision maker’s uncertainty in the original weight assignment. The modified VIKOR method is then applied to the design of a wearable body sensor network and the design of an EEG electrode. The two design examples show the strength of the new modified VIKOR method resolving shortcomings by the original VIKOR method. Finally, the modified VIKOR method is compared with the theory of fuzzy measures and integrals as a multi-criteria decision making method.},

In this paper, a model for SD is established and its variations are evaluated using different classifiers. The single models differ based on the pre-processing and the combination of features. To reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, analysis of variance (ANOVA) test is used. Then, two classifiers are employed as base learners including Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Experimental analyses are conducted on SemEval dataset that is used as a benchmark for SD. Finally, the base learners that resulted from different design alternatives, are combined into three ensemble models. Experimental results show the significance of the used features and the effectiveness of a manually built dictionary that is used in the pre-processing stage. Moreover, the proposed ensembles outperform the state-of-the-art models in the overall test score, which suggests that ensemble learning is the best tool for effective SD in tweets.},

  abstract     = {In Mobile Performance Marketing (MPM), monetary compensation only occurs when an advertisement results in a conversion (e.g., sale of a product or service). In this work, we propose an intelligent decision support system (IDSS) to automatically select mobile marketing campaigns for users. The IDSS is based on a computationally efficient mobile user conversion prediction model that assumes a novel Percentage Categorical Pruning (PCP) categorical preprocessing and an online deep multilayer perceptron (MLP) reuse model (MLPr). Using private (nonpublicly available) business MPM data provided by a marketing company, the MLPr model outperformed an offline multilayer perceptron and a logistic regression, obtaining a high quality class discrimination when applied to sampled (85% to 92%) and complete (90% to 94%) data. In addition, the MLPr compared favorably with other machine learning (ML) models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost), as well as with other deep neural networks (e.g., diamond shaped). Moreover, we designed two strategies (A — best campaign selection; and B — random selection among the top candidate campaigns) to build the IDSS, in which the predictive deep learning model is used to perform a real-time selection of advertisement campaigns for mobile users. Using recently collected big data (with millions of redirect events) from a worldwide MPM company, we performed a realistic IDSS evaluation that considered three criteria: response time, potential profit and advertiser diversity. Overall, competitive results were achieved by the IDSS B strategy when compared with the current marketing company ad assignment method.},

  abstract     = {One of the most remarkable subjects in multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) is determining the weight and importance of criteria. The weighting methods based on inputs are categorized in the manifold group. This paper presents a novel method for weighting the criteria in a network structure. This approach, namely MOWSCER, is used when the relationships among the criteria are modeled by a cause-and-effect directed graph. The directed graph demonstrates the cause and effect relationship among criteria. In the presented method, the criteria are divided into three groups. The basic idea of the criteria segmentation is derived from European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM). These groups include (1) effect criteria, (2) cause criteria, and (3) connector criteria. Then, the connector criteria are allocated fewer weights than the other two types. In other words, the introduced method follows two purposes of decreasing criteria number and appropriate allocating of weights among remaining criteria. Accordingly, first, the connector criteria are detected, so they are assigned less weight, and remained criteria are allocated a proper weight according to their importance. Furthermore, a new weighting method for determining the weights of decision makers (DMs) in group decision-making problems is presented to achieve a comprehensive manner. In the end, to prove the practicality of the proposed method, the weights of criteria and DMs are computed in a case study and two illustrative examples. Besides, to confirm the accuracy of that, it is compared with the DEMATEL method.},

  abstract     = {Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) employ sophisticated security techniques to detect malicious activities on hosts and/or networks. IDSs have been utilized to ensure the security of computer and network systems. However, numerous evaluation and selection issues related to several cybersecurity aspects of IDSs were solved using a decision support approach. The approach most often utilized for decision support in this regard is multi-attribute decision-making (MADM). MADM can aid in selecting the most optimal solution from a huge pool of available alternatives when the appropriate evaluation attributes are provided. The openness of the MADM methods in solving numerous cybersecurity issues makes it largely efficient for IDS applications. We must first understand the available solutions and gaps in this area of research to provide an insightful analysis of the combination of MADM techniques with IDS and support researchers. Therefore, this study conducts a systematic review to organize the research landscape into a consistent taxonomy. A total of 28 articles were considered for this taxonomy and were classified into three main categories: data analysis and detection ( n = 4 ), response selection ( n = 7 ) and IDS evaluation ( n = 1 7 ). Each category was thoroughly analyzed in terms of a variety of aspects, including the issues and challenges confronted, as well as the contributions of each study. Furthermore, the datasets, evaluation attributes, MADM methods, evaluation and validation and bibliography analysis used by the selected articles are discussed. In this study, we highlighted the existing perspective and opportunities for MADM in the IDS literature through a systematic review, providing researchers with a valuable reference.},

This study first performs feature engineering analysis to identify the indicators suitable for constructing the prediction model. The analysis then establishes a set of phrase rules to assign sentiment scores to the opinions expressed in replies and evaluates the effect on the accuracy of predictions. The results show that the major chip-based indicators affecting changes in the stock market differ before and after the pandemic. Hence, prediction models should be established separately for analysis in either period.

  abstract     = {When dealing with complex and redundant data classification problems, many classifiers cannot provide high predictive accuracy and interpretability. We also find that the least-squares support vector classifiers (LSSVCs) hardly identify important instances and features from data, so they cannot give an interpretable prediction. Although the LSSVC has the properties of low bias and high robustness, its high variance often gives a poor predictive performance. In this paper, we propose an alternating minimization-based sparse least-squares classifier (AMSLC) approach in the framework of LSSVCs to address the aforementioned problems. Based on the reconstructed row- and column-wise kernel matrices, the sparsity-induced ℓ 0 -norm approximation function is introduced to the LSSVC model. By alternately solving two unconstrained quadratic optimization problems or two systems of linear equations, AMSLC can predict the class labels of given instances and extract the least number of important instances and features to obtain the interpretable classification. Compared with SVC, LSSVC, ℓ 1 -norm SVC (L1SVC), ℓ 0 -norm SVC (L0SVC), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator classifier (LASSOC), and multiple kernel learning SVC (MKLSVC) on four real credit datasets, the experimental results show that the proposed AMSLC method generally obtains the best predictive accuracy and the interpretable classification with the minimum number of important instances and features.},

In this paper, a new binary hyper-heuristics feature ranks algorithm is designed to solve the feature selection problem in high-dimensional classification data called the BFRA algorithm. The initial strong population generation is done by ranking the features based on the initial Laplacian Score (ILR) method. A new operator called AHWF removes the zero-importance or redundant features from the population-based solutions. Another new operator, AHBF, selects the key features in population-based solutions. These two operators are designed to increase the exploitation of the BFRA algorithm. To ensure exploration, we introduced a new operator called BOM, a binary counter-mutation that increases the exploration and escape from the BFRA algorithm’s local trap. Finally, the BFRA algorithm was evaluated on 26 high-dimensional data with different statistical criteria. The BFRA algorithm has been tested with various meta-heuristic algorithms. The experiments’ different dimensions show that the BFRA algorithm works like a robust meta-heuristic algorithm in low dimensions. Nevertheless, by increasing the dataset dimensions, the BFRA performs better than other algorithms in terms of the best fitness function value, accuracy of the classifiers, and the number of selected features compared to different algorithms. However, a case study of sentiment analysis of movie viewers using BFRA proves that BFRA algorithms demonstrate affordable performance.},

An eight-step ontology development methodology was adopted and implemented to design the ontology. A corpus made up of one hundred and seventy-seven (177) documents was the starting point for the extraction of terms from the ontology and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) language is used as a description language of the ontology. This ontology is the starting point for a facilitation support system in a collaborative decision-making process.

  abstract     = {Computer-based image recognition systems rely on training with an initial training set to recognize similar images. However, when such training set is not available, individual features within a given image can be used to identify and compare with congruent features in database to find similarity among images. An experiment is implemented for extracting similar images using this technique of computer-based image recognition. For this study multiple features color, shape and texture have been extracted from Corel 10k database images. After manual selection of individual feature weightage, all features with equal weightage have been used to identify similar images from database. After observing class wise average precision and average recall of Corel 10k database images, it has been found that equal weightage approach yields satisfactory results and also better as compared with individual feature approach in maximum number of classes. In some of the classes, results are not satisfactory with equal weightage approach. In these classes, results vary with weights of feature according to nature of image. The average precision and recall of entire classes are 96.62% based on all feature equal weight. Now, the problem is to decide weights of features. For this, this study proposes the automatic determination of the weightage for features using pair-wise comparison method. The problem is formulated as multiple criteria decision-making (MCMD) problem and solved through analytic hierarchical process (AHP). Graphical user interface (GUI) is also designed. The proposed approach determines color dominant, shape dominant and texture dominant based on importance on respective features. The average precision and recall of 95 classes are 100% in all dominant features. The average precision and recall of remaining five classes are 59%, 53% and 46% in color dominant, shape dominant and texture dominant, respectively. Performance measure shows that the proposed method archives better results as compared to manual assignment of weights of features.},

  abstract     = {In the current data-driven digital economy, organizations attempt to harness big data power to make their decisions better. The big data analytics assist them not only to identify new opportunities but extract knowledge and obtain better performance. Despite a huge investment in big data analytics initiatives, the majority of organizations have failed to successfully exploit their power. Although big data analytics have received considerable research attention, a little has been done on how organizations implement strategies in order to integrate the different dimensions of big data analytics; hence, a roadmap is required to navigate these technological initiatives. This paper is also an attempt to overcome this challenge by developing a comprehensive big data analytics maturity model to help managers evaluate their existing capabilities and formulate an appropriate strategy for further progress. A mixed-method was applied in this research using a qualitative meta-synthesis approach. For this purpose, first, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify the capabilities and practices of big data analytics maturity. Then the proposed key capabilities and practices were assessed and prioritized based on the opinions of experts using the quantitative survey method. Finally, considering the architecture of the big data analytics maturity model, the capabilities were assigned to maturity levels according to their priority of implementation using a focus group. The proposed model is comprised of four main capabilities, nine key dimensions (KDs) and five maturity levels based on the capability maturity model integration (CMMI) architecture. A questionnaire and a focus group were used to present the big data maturity model. The capabilities and KDs, as well as their implementation order and weight in the proposed maturity model are presented as a roadmap for implementing big data analytics effectively. The proposed model enables organizations to assess their current big data analytics capabilities and navigate them to select appropriate strategies for their improvement. Due to its nature, it allows managers to find their strong and weak points and identify investment priorities. This study provides a comprehensive maturity model using a meta-synthesis which has not been used in this field so far. The proposed model is both descriptive and prescriptive and has a significant theoretical contribution to big data researches. The paper provides a mechanism to benchmark big data analytics projects and develop an appropriate strategy in terms of progress.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis has the potential to significantly impact several fields, such as trade, politics, and opinion extraction. Topic modeling is an intriguing concept used in emotion detection. Latent Dirichlet Allocation is an important algorithm in this subject. It investigates the semantic associations between terms in a text document and takes into account the influence of a subject on a word. Joint Sentiment-Topic model is a framework based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation method that investigates the influence of subjects and emotions on words. The emotion parameter is insufficient, and additional factors may be valuable in performance enhancement. This study presents two novel topic models that extend and improve Joint Sentiment-Topic model through a new parameter (the author’s view). The proposed methods care about the author’s inherent characteristics, which is the most important factor in writing a comment. The proposed models consider the effect of the author’s view on words in a text document. The author’s view means that the author creates an opinion in his mind about a product/thing before selecting the words for expressing the opinion. The new parameter has an immense effect on model accuracy regarding evaluation results. The first proposed method is author’s View-based Joint Sentiment-Topic model for Multi-domain. According to the evaluation results, the highest accuracy value in the first method is equal to 85%. It also has a lower perplexity value than other methods. The second proposed method is Author’s View-based Joint Sentiment-Topic model for Single-domain. According to the evaluation results, it achieves the highest accuracy with 95%. The proposed methods perform better than baseline methods with different topic number settings, especially the second method with 95% accuracy. The second method is a version of the first one, which outperforms baseline methods in terms of accuracy. These results demonstrate that the parameter of the author’s view improves sentiment classification at the document level. While not requiring labeled data, the proposed methods are more accurate than discriminative models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and logistic regression, based on the evaluation section’s outcomes. The proposed methods are simple with a low number of parameters. While providing a broad perception of connections between different words in documents of a single collection (single-domain) or multiple collections (multi-domain), the proposed methods have prepared solutions for two different situations (single-domain and multi-domain). The first proposed method is suitable for multi-domain datasets, but the second proposed method is suitable for single-domain datasets. While detecting emotion at the document level, the proposed models improve evaluation results compared to the baseline models. Eight datasets with different sizes have been used in implementations. For evaluations, this study uses sentiment analysis at the document level, perplexity, and topic coherency. Also, to see if the outcomes of the suggested models are statistically different from those of other algorithms, the Friedman test, a statistical analysis, is employed.},

The possible category ranges of alternatives are defined by mathematical models iteratively under the assumption that the preferences of the decision maker (DM) are consistent with an additive utility function. Simulation-based and model-based parameter generation methods are proposed to hypothetically assign the alternatives to categories. A practical approach to solve the incompatibility problem of the randomly generated parameters is developed. Based on the hypothetical assignments, the assignment frequencies of alternatives for each possible category are defined. Then, an information theoretic measure, relative entropy, is used in the selection of the alternative that will be assigned into a category by the DM. The performance of our approaches is tested on different problems with/without initial assignments and category size restrictions. The results show that relative entropy-based alternative selection methods work well in decreasing the assessment burden of DM.},

  abstract     = {Increasing demand for open-source software (OSS) has raised the value of efficient selection in terms of quality; usability is an essential quality factor that significantly affects system acceptability and sustainability. Most large and complex software packages partitioned across multiple portals and involve many users — each with their role in the software package; those users have different perspectives on the software package, defined by their knowledge, responsibilities, and commitments. Thus, a multi-perspective approach has been used in usability evaluation to overcome the challenge of inconsistency between users’ perspectives; the inconsistency challenge would lead to an ill-advised decision on the selection of a suitable OSS. This study aimed to assist the public and private organizations in evaluating and selecting the most suitable OSS. The evaluation of the OSS software packages to choose the best one is a challenging task owing to (a) multiple evaluation criteria, (b) criteria importance, and (c) data variation; thus, it is considered a sophisticated multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem; moreover, the multi-perspective usability evaluation framework for OSS selection lacks in the current literature. Hence, this study proposes a novel multi-perspective usability evaluation framework for the selection of OSS based on the multi-criteria analysis. Integration of best-worst method (BWM) and VIKOR MCDM techniques has been used for weighting and ranking OSS alternatives. BWM is utilized for weighting of evaluation criteria, whereas VIKOR is applied to rank OSS-LMS alternatives. Individual and group decision-making contexts, and the internal and external groups aggregation were used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework. A well-organized algorithmic procedure is presented in detail, and a case study was examined to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed framework. The results demonstrated that BWM and VIKOR integration works effectively to solve the OSS software package benchmarking/selection problems. Furthermore, the ranks of OSS software packages obtained from the VIKOR internal and external group decision making were similar; the best OSS-LMS based on the two ways was ‘Moodle’ software package. Among the scores of groups in the objective validation, significant differences were identified; this indicated that the ranking results of internal and external VIKOR group decision making were valid, which pointed to the validation of the framework.},

Next, we investigate the ranking and clusters among the 57 ESI research fronts using the MADM and k -means clustering method and uncover the evolution process of the research fronts in different clusters based on the representative indicators.

  abstract     = {The most important feature of decision problems is that they contain alternatives and criteria expressed both objectively and subjectively. Such problems are solved by multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. The difficulty, however, is that qualitative criteria cannot be modeled and measured quantitatively. There are many tools, fuzzy set, intuitionistic fuzzy set, neutrosophic set, and so on, to analyze the incompleteness and uncertainty in the data. The most important characteristic that distinguishes neutrosophic sets from these sets is that they use three membership values as truth, indeterminacy, and false. In this sense, it is superior to classical fuzzy sets. Therefore, in this study, a novel-integrated solution method based on Neutrosophic Criteria Importance Through Inter-Criteria Correlation (N-CRITIC) and Neutrosophic Additive Ratio ASsessment (N-ARAS) methods is developed for the MCDM problems by integrating Single-Valued Neutrosophic Numbers (SVNNs) into CRITIC and ARAS methods. A case study from the literature concerning the most appropriate technology forecasting method selection has been applied to present the computational details. First, N-CRITIC method is performed to find the weights of selection criteria. Then, N-ARAS method is used to determine the ranking order of technology forecasting methods and select the optimal one. The sensitivity and comparative analyses have also proved that the novel-integrated solution method gives a consistent ranking for the alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Neutrosophic matrices are more logical and feasible for the decision-makers, and they play a vital role in addressing multi-criteria decision making problems and dealing with indeterminacy. In this paper, we defined the multi-valued neutrosophic fuzzy matrix as well as its determinant, adjoint, and various operations. Under those operations, we defined several propositions. We prove that multi-valued neutrosophic matrices may not have to satisfy all of the properties of regular neutrosophic matrices but their application to multi-criteria decision-making problems is highly efficient. We introduced new linguistic variables for corresponding multi-valued neutrosophic numbers. The application of the proposed linguistic variable was numerically demonstrated by using the neutrosophic simplified-TOPSIS approach. The shown problem decides which sim card is best for the phone, which is evaluated by a team of decision-makers and the result is graphically displayed.},

  abstract     = {Big data starts booming in 2013 and has multiple applications in all walks of life. In such an environment, big data for information technology (BDI) and decision making (BDD) have formed some hot topics in common. This paper reviews the body of BDI and BDD research studies from 1994 to 2020, using bibliometrics analysis. The aim of this paper is to explore the current status, the correlation between BDI and BDD, the future trends and challenges. From time and space dimensions, CiteSpace and VOS viewer are used to obtain the annual trends of documents, the distribution of countries and sources, the citations and the h-index of BDI and BDD. The top three productive countries are the USA, China and the UK. From the perspective of h-index, the USA and the UK are at the forefront of the world. The value of big data is realized through information acquisition, storage, analysis, expression transmission and service sharing technologies, and the decision-making techniques exist throughout the process of big data analysis. “Business” and “Information science library science” are the latest hotspots of BDI. The appliances in the organization, supply chain management, education, and the environment are recent themes of BDD. Big data technology processing capabilities and network security issues are the main challenges in the future. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on BDI and BDD, and hops to help in understanding the evolution of them in relevant fields.},
