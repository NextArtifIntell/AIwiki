Here we report the perovskite Cs4AuIIAuIII2Cl12, an extended solid with mononuclear Au2+ sites, which is stable to ambient conditions and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The 2+ oxidation state of Au was assigned using 197Au Mössbauer spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and magnetic susceptibility measurements, with comparison to paramagnetic and diamagnetic analogues with Cu2+ and Pd2+, respectively, as well as to density functional theory calculations. This gold perovskite offers an opportunity to study the optical and electronic transport of the uncommon Au2+/3+ mixed-valence state and the characteristics of the elusive Au2+ ion coordinated to simple ligands. Compared with the perovskite Cs2AuIAuIIICl6, which has been studied since the 1920s, Cs4AuIIAuIII2Cl12 exhibits a 0.7 eV reduction in optical absorption onset and a 103-fold increase in electronic conductivity. The Au2+ oxidation state is rarely stable in molecules or extended solids, where extreme synthetic conditions or exotic ligands are often necessary. Now, Au2+ has been stabilized with simple Cl− ligands in Cs4AuIIAuIII2Cl12, an extended solid with a perovskite-derived structure that is readily synthesized under mild conditions and is stable to ambient conditions.},

Current recycling approaches are economically unattractive and/or lead to recycled products of inferior properties, making their large-scale implementation unviable. Here we report a highly efficient chemical strategy for upcycling thermoset polyurethane foams that yields products of much higher economic values than the original material. Starting from a commodity foam, we show that the polyurethane network is chemically fragmented into a dissolvable mixture under mild conditions. We demonstrate that three-dimensional photo-printable resins with tunable material mechanical properties—which are superior to commercial high-performance counterparts—can be formulated with the addition of various network reforming additives. Our direct upcycling of commodity foams is economically attractive and can be implemented with ease, and the principle can be expanded to other commodity thermosets. Current strategies for recycling cross-linked polyurethane foam waste are economically unattractive and/or lead to recycled products with inferior properties. Now it has been shown that a cost-effective chemical strategy can be used to turn the foam into high-performance value-added three-dimensional photo-printing resins.},

  abstract     = {Aromaticity is an established and widely used concept for the prediction of the reactivity of organic molecules. However, its role remains largely unexplored in on-surface chemistry, where the interaction with the substrate can alter the electronic and geometric structure of the adsorbates. Here we investigate how aromaticity affects the reactivity of alkyne-substituted porphyrin molecules in cyclization and coupling reactions on a Au(111) surface. We examine and quantify the regioselectivity in the reactions by scanning tunnelling microscopy and bond-resolved atomic force microscopy at the single-molecule level. Our experiments show a substantially lower reactivity of carbon atoms that are stabilized by the aromatic diaza[18]annulene pathway of free-base porphyrins. The results are corroborated by density functional theory calculations, which show a direct correlation between aromaticity and thermodynamic stability of the reaction products. These insights are helpful to understand, and in turn design, reactions with aromatic species in on-surface chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. While aromaticity is a useful concept for assessing the reactivity of organic compounds, the connection between aromaticity and on-surface chemistry remains largely unexplored. Now, scanning probe experiments on cyclization reactions of porphyrins on Au(111) show that the peripheral carbon atoms outside of the aromatic 18-π electron pathway exhibit a higher reactivity.},

  abstract     = {Biological membranes consist of two leaflets of phospholipid molecules that form a bilayer, each leaflet comprising a distinct lipid composition. This asymmetry is created and maintained in vivo by dedicated biochemical pathways, but difficulties in creating stable asymmetric membranes in vitro have restricted our understanding of how bilayer asymmetry modulates the folding, stability and function of membrane proteins. In this study, we used cyclodextrin-mediated lipid exchange to generate liposomes with asymmetric bilayers and characterize the stability and folding kinetics of two bacterial outer membrane proteins (OMPs), OmpA and BamA. We found that excess negative charge in the outer leaflet of a liposome impedes their insertion and folding, while excess negative charge in the inner leaflet accelerates their folding relative to symmetric liposomes with the same membrane composition. Using molecular dynamics, mutational analysis and bioinformatics, we identified a positively charged patch critical for folding and stability. These results rationalize the well-known ‘positive-outside’ rule of OMPs and suggest insights into the mechanisms that drive OMP folding and assembly in vitro and in vivo. Biological membranes are asymmetric bilayers, but little is known about how this asymmetry modulates membrane protein folding or stability. Now, folding and stability assays with bacterial outer membrane proteins reveal an exquisite sensitivity to asymmetric membrane charge distribution and a required matching of protein charge for efficient folding.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional organic semiconductor-incorporated perovskites are a promising family of hybrid materials for optoelectronic applications, owing in part to their inherent quantum well architecture. Tuning their structures and properties for specific properties, however, has remained challenging. Here we report a general method to tune the dimensionality of phase-pure organic semiconductor-incorporated perovskite single crystals during their synthesis, by judicious choice of solvent. The length of the conjugated semiconducting organic cations and the dimensionality (n value) of the inorganic layers can be manipulated at the same time. The energy band offsets and exciton dynamics at the organic–inorganic interfaces can therefore be precisely controlled. Furthermore, we show that longer and more planar π-conjugated organic cations induce a more rigid inorganic crystal lattice, which leads to suppressed exciton–phonon interactions and better optoelectronic properties as compared to conventional two-dimensional perovskites. As a demonstration, optically driven lasing behaviour with substantially lower lasing thresholds was realized. Two-dimensional hybrid perovskites have gained substantial interest recently due to their controllable optoelectronic properties; however precise control over layer thickness has been synthetically challenging. Now a crystal growth method is shown to achieve high-quality single crystals of organic semiconductor-incorporated perovskites with control over their thickness and length through judicious solvent choice, affording precisely tuned optoelectronic properties.},

Here we go beyond monomeric NHCs and report on the synthesis of NHC polymers on gold surfaces, consisting of ballbot-type repeating units bound to single Au adatoms. We designed, synthesized and deposited precursors containing different halogens on gold surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum. Conformational, electronic and charge transport properties were assessed by combining low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, first-principles calculations and reactive force field simulations. The confirmed ballbot-type nature of the NHCs explains the high surface mobility of the incommensurate NHC polymers, which is prerequisite for their desired spatial alignment. The delicate balance between mobility and polymerization rate allows essential parameters for controlling polymer directionality to be derived. These polymers open up new opportunities in the fields of nanoelectronics, surface functionalization and catalysis. Monomeric N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) can act as molecular modifiers of metal surfaces and thus affect heterogeneous catalytic behaviour. Now NHC polymers have been formed on gold surfaces, consisting of ballbot-type repeating units bound to single gold adatoms.

Until now, d6 complexes made from abundant first-row transition metals with competitive photophysical and photochemical properties have been elusive. While previous research efforts focused mostly on Fe(II), we disclose that isoelectronic Cr(0) gives access to higher photoluminescence quantum yields and excited-state lifetimes when compared with any other first-row d6 metal complex reported so far. The luminescence behaviour of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer excited states of these Cr(0) complexes is competitive with Os(II) polypyridines. With these Cr(0) complexes, the metal-to-ligand charge transfer states of first-row d6 metal complexes become exploitable in photoredox catalysis, and benchmark chemical reductions proceed efficiently under low-energy red illumination. Here we demonstrate that appropriate molecular design strategies open up new perspectives for photophysics and photochemistry with abundant first-row d6 metals. Although noble metal coordination complexes typically show promising photophysical properties that enable applications in lighting, photocatalysis and solar energy conversion, first-row transition metal complexes rarely display properties as attractive. Now, two Cr(0) complexes are shown to afford excited-state lifetimes of ~50 ns and photophysical properties analogous to noble metal complexes, enabling efficient photoredox catalysis.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) combine the electronic and mechanical properties of 2D inorganic crystals with chemically modifiable surfaces, which provides an ideal platform for both fundamental and applied studies of interfaces. Good progress has been achieved in the functionalization of MXenes with small inorganic ligands, but relatively little work has been reported on the covalent bonding of various organic groups to MXene surfaces. Here we synthesize a family of hybrid MXenes (h-MXenes) that incorporate amido- and imido-bonding between organic and inorganic parts by reacting halogen-terminated MXenes with deprotonated organic amines. The resulting hybrid structures unite tailorability of organic molecules with electronic connectivity and other properties of inorganic 2D materials. Describing the structure of h-MXene necessitates the integration of concepts from coordination chemistry, self-assembled monolayers and surface science. The optical properties of h-MXenes reveal coherent coupling between the organic and inorganic constituents. h-MXenes also exhibit superior stability against hydrolysis. Functionalizing two-dimensional transition-metal carbide (MXene) surfaces can alter their properties, but covalent functionalization has been synthetically challenging. Now, it has been shown that various organic groups can be covalently attached to MXene surfaces through amido and imido bonds. The resulting hybrid organic–inorganic structures exhibit Fano resonances and superior stability compared with traditional MXenes with a mixture of –F, –O and –OH surface terminations.},

Based on the electric field enhancement, we make a quantitative prediction of rate acceleration—50-fold faster than the wild-type enzyme—which was in close agreement with experimental measurements. The effects of the hydrogen bonding and metal coordination, two distinct chemical forces, are described by a unified physical quantity—electric field, which is quantitative, and shown here to be additive and predictive. These results suggest a new design paradigm for both biological and non-biological catalysts. The design and improvement of enzymes based on physical principles remain challenging.

  abstract     = {Molecules that covalently engage target proteins are widely used as activity-based probes and covalent drugs. The performance of these covalent inhibitors is, however, often compromised by the paradox of efficacy and risk, which demands a balance between reactivity and selectivity. The challenge is more evident when targeting protein–protein interactions owing to their low ligandability and undefined reactivity. Here we report sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) in vitro selection, a general platform for high-throughput discovery of covalent inhibitors from trillions of SuFEx-modified oligonucleotides. With SuFEx in vitro selection, we identified covalent inhibitors that cross-link distinct residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at its protein–protein interaction interface with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. A separate suite of covalent inhibitors was isolated for the human complement C5 protein. In both cases, we observed a clear disconnection between binding affinity and cross-linking reactivity, indicating that direct search for the aimed reactivity—as enabled by SuFEx in vitro selection—is vital for discovering covalent inhibitors of high selectivity and potency. Covalent inhibitors offer high potency but their potential is hindered by off-target reactivity. Now, an in vitro selection method has been developed to enable the discovery of covalent inhibitors from trillions of oligonucleotides endowed with the sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange chemistry. This strategy generates covalent inhibitors of protein–protein interactions with optimally balanced selectivity and reactivity.},

  abstract     = {Co-phase separation of RNAs and RNA-binding proteins drives the biogenesis of ribonucleoprotein granules. RNAs can also undergo phase transitions in the absence of proteins. However, the physicochemical driving forces of protein-free, RNA-driven phase transitions remain unclear. Here we report that various types of RNA undergo phase separation with system-specific lower critical solution temperatures. This entropically driven phase separation is an intrinsic feature of the phosphate backbone that requires Mg2+ ions and is modulated by RNA bases. RNA-only condensates can additionally undergo enthalpically favourable percolation transitions within dense phases. This is enabled by a combination of Mg2+-dependent bridging interactions between phosphate groups and RNA-specific base stacking and base pairing. Phase separation coupled to percolation can cause dynamic arrest of RNAs within condensates and suppress the catalytic activity of an RNase P ribozyme. Our work highlights the need to incorporate RNA-driven phase transitions into models for ribonucleoprotein granule biogenesis. The physicochemical driving forces of protein-free, RNA-driven phase transitions were previously unclear, but it is now shown that RNAs undergo entropically driven liquid–liquid phase separation upon heating in the presence of magnesium ions. In the condensed phase, RNAs can undergo an enthalpically favourable percolation transition that leads to arrested condensates.},

  abstract     = {Incorporation of fluoroalkyl motifs in pharmaceuticals can enhance the therapeutic profiles of the parent molecules. The hydrofluoroalkylation of alkenes has emerged as a promising route to diverse fluoroalkylated compounds; however, current methods require superstoichiometric oxidants, expensive/oxidative fluoroalkylating reagents and precious metals, and often exhibit limited scope, making a universal protocol that addresses these limitations highly desirable. Here we report the hydrofluoroalkylation of alkenes with cheap, abundant and available fluoroalkyl carboxylic acids as the sole reagents. Hydrotrifluoro-, difluoro-, monofluoro- and perfluoroalkylation are all demonstrated, with broad scope, mild conditions (redox neutral) and potential for late-stage modification of bioactive molecules. Critical to success is overcoming the exceedingly high redox potential of feedstock fluoroalkyl carboxylic acids such as trifluoroacetic acid by leveraging cooperative earth-abundant, inexpensive iron and redox-active thiol catalysis, enabling these reagents to be directly used as hydroperfluoroalkylation donors without pre-activation. Preliminary mechanistic studies support the radical nature of this cooperative process. Alkene hydrofluoroalkylation offers a promising route to diverse fluoroalkylated compounds but current methods have limitations, such as needing expensive fluoroalkylating reagents. Now, leveraging iron photocatalysis and hydrogen-atom-transfer catalysis, a hydrofluoroalkylation method has been developed that utilizes feedstock chemicals such as trifluoroacetic acid as direct fluoroalkyl radical precursors, providing a redox-neutral, general protocol to introduce fluoroalkyl moieties.},

  abstract     = {Stereoselective protonation is a challenge in asymmetric catalysis. The small size and high rate of transfer of protons mean that face-selective delivery to planar intermediates is hard to control, but it can unlock previously obscure asymmetric transformations. Particularly, when coupled with a preceding decarboxylation, enantioselective protonation can convert the abundant acid feedstocks into structurally diverse chiral molecules. Here an anchoring group strategy is demonstrated as a potential alternative and supplement to the conventional structural modification of catalysts by creating additional catalyst–substrate interactions. We show that a tailored benzamide group in aminomalonic acids can help build a coordinated network of non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonds, π–π interactions and dispersion forces, with a chiral acid catalyst. This allows enantioselective decarboxylative protonation to give α-amino acids. The malonate-based synthesis introduces side chains via a facile substitution of aminomalonic esters and thus can access structurally and functionally diverse amino acids. Asymmetric decarboxylation can transform abundant carboxylic acids into valuable chiral molecules but faces major limitations due to the challenging enantiocontrol of proton transfer. Now the use of Brønsted acid catalysis in conjunction with an anchoring group strategy has enabled the decarboxylative protonation of aminomalonic acids to access diverse amino acids.},

Here we describe a systematic approach to generating modular and rigid repeat protein oligomers with coincident C2 to C8 and superhelical symmetry axes that can be readily extended by repeat propagation. From these building blocks, we demonstrate that a wide range of unbounded fibres can be systematically designed by introducing hydrophilic surface patches that force staggering of the monomers; the geometry of such fibres can be precisely tuned by varying the number of repeat units in the monomer and the placement of the hydrophilic patches. Molecular systems with coincident cyclic and superhelical symmetry axes have considerable advantages for materials design as they can be lengthened or shortened by changing the length of the monomers.

So far, protein engineering has been the main approach to generate bsAbs and CiTEs, but improved chemical methods for their generation have recently been developed. Homogeneous fragment-based bsAbs constructed from fragment antigen-binding regions (Fabs) can be generated using click chemistry. Here we describe a chemical method to generate biotin-functionalized three-protein conjugates, which include two CiTE molecules, one containing an anti-PD-1 Fab and the other containing an immunomodulatory enzyme, Salmonella typhimurium sialidase. The CiTEs’ efficacy was shown to be superior to that of the simpler BiTE scaffold, with the sialidase-containing CiTE inducing substantially enhanced T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. The chemical method described here, more generally, enables the generation of multi-protein constructs with further biological applications. Three-protein conjugates, which have so far been produced using protein-engineering strategies, can now be generated using a chemical approach that enables the addition of small-molecule functionality.

  abstract     = {Transition metal catalysis plays a pivotal role in transforming unreactive C–H bonds. However, regioselective activation of distal aliphatic C–H bonds poses a tremendous challenge, particularly in the absence of directing templates. Activation of a methylene C–H bond in the presence of methyl C–H is underexplored. Here we show activation of a methylene C–H bond in the presence of methyl C–H bonds to form unsaturated bicyclic lactones. The protocol allows the reversal of the general selectivity in aliphatic C–H bond activation. Computational studies suggest that reversible C–H activation is followed by β-hydride elimination to generate the Pd-coordinated cycloalkene that undergoes stereoselective C–O cyclization, and subsequent β-hydride elimination to provide bicyclic unsaturated lactones. The broad generality of this reaction has been highlighted via dehydrogenative lactonization of mid to macro ring containing acids along with the C–H olefination reaction with olefin and allyl alcohol. The method substantially simplifies the synthesis of important bicyclic lactones that are important features of natural products as well as pharmacoactive molecules. Bicyclic lactones are valuable motifs for the synthesis of natural products and bioactive molecules. Now, a palladium-catalysed protocol has been developed to access unsaturated bicyclic lactones in one step from corresponding carboxylic acids. The method demonstrates reverse site selectivity for C(sp3)–H activation to form diverse bicyclic cores.},

Most chemoproteomic screening approaches are indirect, relying on competition between electrophilic fragments and a minimalist electrophilic probe with inherently limited proteome coverage. Here we develop a chemoproteomic platform for direct electrophile-site identification based on enantiomeric pairs of clickable arylsulfonyl fluoride probes. Using stereoselective site modification as a proxy for ligandability in intact cells, we identify 634 tyrosines and lysines within functionally diverse protein sites, liganded by structurally diverse probes. Among multiple validated sites, we discover a chiral probe that modifies Y228 in the MYC binding site of the epigenetic regulator WDR5, as revealed by a high-resolution crystal structure. A distinct chiral probe stimulates tumour cell phagocytosis by covalently modifying Y387 in the recently discovered immuno-oncology target APMAP. Our work provides a deep resource of ligandable tyrosines and lysines for the development of covalent chemical probes. Most chemoproteomic screening approaches are indirect.

  abstract     = {The photoisomerization reaction of a fluorescent protein chromophore occurs on the ultrafast timescale. The structural dynamics that result from femtosecond optical excitation have contributions from vibrational and electronic processes and from reaction dynamics that involve the crossing through a conical intersection. The creation and progression of the ultrafast structural dynamics strongly depends on optical and molecular parameters. When using X-ray crystallography as a probe of ultrafast dynamics, the origin of the observed nuclear motions is not known. Now, high-resolution pump–probe X-ray crystallography reveals complex sub-ångström, ultrafast motions and hydrogen-bonding rearrangements in the active site of a fluorescent protein. However, we demonstrate that the measured motions are not part of the photoisomerization reaction but instead arise from impulsively driven coherent vibrational processes in the electronic ground state. A coherent-control experiment using a two-colour and two-pulse optical excitation strongly amplifies the X-ray crystallographic difference density, while it fully depletes the photoisomerization process. A coherent control mechanism was tested and confirmed the wave packets assignment. Pump–probe measurements conventionally achieve femtosecond time resolution for X-ray crystallography of reactive processes, but the measured structural dynamics are complex. Using coherent control techniques, we show that the ultrafast crystallographic differences of a fluorescent protein are dominated by ground-state vibrational processes that are unconnected to the photoisomerization reaction of the chromophore.},

  abstract     = {The use of coordination complexes within covalent organic frameworks can significantly diversify the structures and properties of this class of materials. Here we combined coordination chemistry and reticular chemistry by preparing frameworks that consist of a ditopic (p-phenylenediamine) and mixed tritopic moieties—an organic ligand and a scandium coordination complex of similar sizes and geometries, both bearing terminal phenylamine groups. Changing the ratio of organic ligand to scandium complex enabled the preparation of a series of crystalline covalent organic frameworks with tunable levels of scandium incorporation. Removal of scandium from the material with the highest metal content subsequently resulted in a ‘metal-imprinted’ covalent organic framework that exhibits a high affinity and capacity for Sc3+ ions in acidic environments and in the presence of competing metal ions. In particular, the selectivity of this framework for Sc3+ over common impurity ions such as La3+ and Fe3+ surpasses that of existing scandium adsorbents. Scandium is challenging and expensive to isolate in pure form using conventional solvent extraction. Now a covalent organic framework (COF) has been synthesized that can incorporate scandium coordination complexes; subsequent removal of the scandium ions generates open coordination sites, and the resulting ‘metal-imprinted’ COF can be used for highly selective, cyclable scandium capture.},

  abstract     = {Allostery produces concerted functions of protein complexes by orchestrating the cooperative work between the constituent subunits. Here we describe an approach to create artificial allosteric sites in protein complexes. Certain protein complexes contain subunits with pseudo-active sites, which are believed to have lost functions during evolution. Our hypothesis is that allosteric sites in such protein complexes can be created by restoring the lost functions of pseudo-active sites. We used computational design to restore the lost ATP-binding ability of the pseudo-active site in the B subunit of a rotary molecular motor, V1-ATPase. Single-molecule experiments with X-ray crystallography analyses revealed that binding of ATP to the designed allosteric site boosts this V1’s activity compared with the wild-type, and the rotation rate can be tuned by modulating ATP’s binding affinity. Pseudo-active sites are widespread in nature, and our approach shows promise as a means of programming allosteric control over concerted functions of protein complexes. Allostery produces concerted functions of protein complexes by orchestrating the cooperative work between the constituent subunits. By restoring functions of pseudo-active sites that have been lost through evolution, allosteric sites have now been designed into a rotary molecular motor, V1-ATPase, resulting in its rotation being boosted allosterically.},

  abstract     = {Although their zero- to two-dimensional counterparts are well known, three-dimensional chiral hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite single crystals have remained difficult because they contain no chiral components and their crystal phases belong to centrosymmetric achiral point groups. Here we report a general approach to grow single-crystalline 3D lead halide perovskites with chiroptical activity. Taking MAPbBr3 (MA, methylammonium) perovskite as a representative example, whereas achiral MAPbBr3 crystallized from precursors in solution by inverse temperature crystallization method, the addition of micro- or nanoparticles as nucleating agents promoted the formation of chiral crystals under a near equilibrium state. Experimental characterization supported by calculations showed that the chirality of the 3D APbX3 (where A is an ammonium ion and X is Cl, Br or mixed Cl–Br or Br–I) perovskites arises from chiral patterns of the A-site cations and their interaction with the [PbX6]4− octahedra in the perovskite structure. The chiral structure obeys the lowest-energy principle and thereby thermodynamically stable. The chiral 3D hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites served in a circularly polarized light photodetector prototype successfully. While chiral hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications, the synthesis of three-dimensional single crystals has proven challenging. Now, a general strategy has been shown to synthesize chiral, three-dimensional perovskites by heterogeneous nucleation. The single-crystalline materials contain no chiral component; their chiroptical activity arises from supercells formed by chiral patterns of the A-site cations.},

Cobalt(II) complexes of porphyrins, as stable 15e-metalloradicals with a well-defined low-spin d7 configuration, have dominated the ongoing development of MRC. Here, to broaden MRC beyond the use of Co(II)-based metalloradical catalysts, we describe systematic studies that establish the operation of Fe(III)-based MRC and demonstrate an initial application for asymmetric radical transformations. Specifically, we report that five-coordinate iron(III) complexes of porphyrins with an axial ligand, which represent another family of stable 15e-metalloradicals with a d5 configuration, are potent metalloradical catalysts for olefin cyclopropanation with different classes of diazo compounds via a stepwise radical mechanism. This work lays a foundation and mechanistic blueprint for future exploration of Fe(III)-based MRC towards the discovery of diverse stereoselective radical reactions. Cobalt(II) complexes of porphyrins have dominated the development of metalloradical catalysts. Now it has been shown that five-coordinate iron(III) complexes of porphyrins with an axial ligand are also potent metalloradical catalysts for olefin cyclopropanation.

Synthetic frameworks capable of convergently locking functional groups with minimized conformational uncertainty—leading to similar properties—are highly desirable but rare. Here we report C5-symmetric aromatic pentaamide macrocycles synthesized in one pot from the corresponding monomers. Their crystal structures reveal a star-shaped, fully constrained backbone that causes ten alternating NH/CH hydrogen-bond donors and five large amide dipoles to orient towards the centre of the macrocycle. With a highly electropositive cavity in a high-energy unbound state, the macrocycles bind anions in a 1:1 stoichiometry in solution, with high affinity for halides and very high affinity for oxoanions. We demonstrate that such macrocycles are able to transport anions across lipid bilayers with a high chloride selectivity and restore the depleted airway surface liquid of cystic fibrosis airway cell cultures. Effective synthetic anion receptors are challenging to design. Now, star-shaped macrocycles, with a cavity defined by multiple convergent amide NH and phenyl CH groups, have been synthesized in one pot from their monomeric building blocks. These macrocycles strongly bind a variety of anions, selectively transport chloride across cell membranes and restore the function of cystic fibrosis cells.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and controlling protein motion at atomic resolution is a hallmark challenge for structural biologists and protein engineers because conformational dynamics are essential for complex functions such as enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation. Time-resolved crystallography offers a window into protein motions, yet without a universal perturbation to initiate conformational changes the method has been limited in scope. Here we couple a solvent-based temperature jump with time-resolved crystallography to visualize structural motions in lysozyme, a dynamic enzyme. We observed widespread atomic vibrations on the nanosecond timescale, which evolve on the submillisecond timescale into localized structural fluctuations that are coupled to the active site. An orthogonal perturbation to the enzyme, inhibitor binding, altered these dynamics by blocking key motions that allow energy to dissipate from vibrations into functional movements linked to the catalytic cycle. Because temperature jump is a universal method for perturbing molecular motion, the method demonstrated here is broadly applicable for studying protein dynamics. Shifts in temperature alter the structure and dynamics of macromolecules. Now, infra-red laser-induced temperature jump is combined with X-ray crystallography to observe protein structural dynamics in real time. Using this method, motions related to the catalytic cycle of lysozyme, a model enzyme, are visualized at atomic resolution and across broad timescales.},

  abstract     = {Electronic and steric effects are known to greatly influence the structure, characteristics and reactivity of organic compounds. A typical π bond is weakened by oxidation (corresponding to the removal of electrons from bonding orbitals), by reduction (through addition of electrons to antibonding orbitals) and by unpairing of the bonding electrons, such as in the triplet state. Here we describe tetrafluorenofulvalene (TFF), a twisted, open-shell alkene for which these general rules do not hold. Through the synthesis, experimental characterization and computational analysis of its charged species spanning seven redox states, the central alkene bond in TFF is shown to become substantially stronger in the tri- and tetraanion, generated by chemical reduction. Furthermore, although its triplet state contains a weaker alkene bond than the singlet, in the quintet state its bond order increases substantially, yielding a flatter structure. This behaviour originates from the doubly bifurcated topology of the underlying spin system and can be rationalized by the balancing effects of benzenoid aromaticity and spin pairing. Tetrafluorenofulvalene (TFF) defies conventional rules of bond strength in organic chemistry. In particular, the central alkene bond of TFF becomes stronger in the quintet state and in the tetraanion. These changes arise from the unusual interplay between the twist, aromaticity and spin pairing in the π-electron system of TFF.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and manipulating gas bubble evolution during electrochemical water splitting is a crucial strategy for optimizing the electrode/electrolyte/gas bubble interface. Here gas bubble dynamics are investigated during the hydrogen evolution reaction on a well-defined platinum microelectrode by varying the electrolyte composition. We find that the microbubble coalescence efficiency follows the Hofmeister series of anions in the electrolyte. This dependency yields very different types of H2 gas bubble evolution in different electrolytes, ranging from periodic detachment of a single H2 gas bubble in sulfuric acid to aperiodic detachment of small H2 gas bubbles in perchloric acid. Our results indicate that the solutal Marangoni convection, induced by the anion concentration gradient developing during the reaction, plays a critical role at practical current density conditions. The resulting Marangoni force on the H2 gas bubble and the bubble departure diameter therefore depend on how surface tension varies with concentration for different electrolytes. This insight provides new avenues for controlling bubble dynamics during electrochemical gas bubble formation. Although gas bubble dynamics during electrochemical processes dramatically affect performance, the fundamental understanding and manipulation of such dynamics have been limited. Now, electrolyte composition is found to be a key factor in inducing a solutal Marangoni instability that impacts both H2 gas detachment and coalescence between H2 microbubbles.},

In vitro-selected ribozymes are attractive tools for RNA research and have the potential to overcome some of the limitations of chemoenzymatic approaches with repurposed methyltransferases. Here we report an alkyltransferase ribozyme that uses a synthetic, stabilized S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) analogue and catalyses the transfer of a propargyl group to a specific adenosine in the target RNA. Almost quantitative conversion was achieved within 1 h under a wide range of reaction conditions in vitro, including physiological magnesium ion concentrations. A genetically encoded version of the SAM analogue-utilizing ribozyme (SAMURI) was expressed in HEK293T cells, and intracellular propargylation of the target adenosine was confirmed by specific fluorescent labelling. SAMURI is a general tool for the site-specific installation of the smallest tag for azide-alkyne click chemistry, which can be further functionalized with fluorophores, affinity tags or other functional probes. Ribozyme-mediated post-transcriptional RNA modification is a powerful method for site-specific RNA labelling and analysis of RNA functions. Now, an alkyltransferase ribozyme—termed SAMURI—has been shown to catalyse the transfer of a propargyl group from a stabilized synthetic S-adenosylmethionine analogue to a specific adenosine on the target RNA within cells.},

These organocatalysis paradigms often emulate metal-based processes by engaging the π bond and, in the case of styrenes, facilitating fluorinative phenonium-ion rearrangements to generate difluoromethylene units. Here we demonstrate that enynes are competent proxies for styrenes, thereby mitigating the recurrent need for aryl substituents, and enabling highly versatile homopropargylic difluorides to be generated in an operationally simple manner. The scope of the method is disclosed, together with application in target synthesis (&amp;gt;30 examples, up to &amp;gt;90% yield). Hypervalent iodine catalysis remains a powerful method to enable geminal difluoromethylenation of alkenes. However, the scope is mainly limited to styrene derivatives. Now, enynes have been validated as competent substrates where a formal 1,2-shift of the alkyne occurs, thereby enabling highly versatile homopropargylic difluorides to be generated.},

  abstract     = {Conical intersections often control the reaction products of photochemical processes and occur when two electronic potential energy surfaces intersect. Theory predicts that the conical intersection will result in a geometric phase for a wavepacket on the ground potential energy surface, and although conical intersections have been observed experimentally, the geometric phase has not been directly observed in a molecular system. Here we use a trapped atomic ion system to perform a quantum simulation of a conical intersection. The ion’s internal state serves as the electronic state, and the motion of the atomic nuclei is encoded into the motion of the ions. The simulated electronic potential is constructed by applying state-dependent optical forces to the ion. We experimentally observe a clear manifestation of the geometric phase using adiabatic state preparation followed by motional state measurement. Our experiment shows the advantage of combining spin and motion degrees for quantum simulation of chemical reactions. Geometric phase interference has been predicted to appear around conical intersections but has been experimentally illusive owing to competing effects in molecular systems. Now, this effect has been demonstrated in chains of trapped ions using state-of-the-art quantum simulation and read-out techniques.},

  abstract     = {Conical intersections are ubiquitous in chemistry and physics, often governing processes such as light harvesting, vision, photocatalysis and chemical reactivity. They act as funnels between electronic states of molecules, allowing rapid and efficient relaxation during chemical dynamics. In addition, when a reaction path encircles a conical intersection, the molecular wavefunction experiences a geometric phase, which can affect the outcome of the reaction through quantum-mechanical interference. Past experiments have measured indirect signatures of geometric phases in scattering patterns and spectroscopic observables, but there has been no direct observation of the underlying wavepacket interference. Here we experimentally observe geometric-phase interference in the dynamics of a wavepacket travelling around an engineered conical intersection in a programmable trapped-ion quantum simulator. To achieve this, we develop a technique to reconstruct the two-dimensional wavepacket densities of a trapped ion. Experiments agree with the theoretical model, demonstrating the ability of analogue quantum simulators—such as those realized using trapped ions—to accurately describe nuclear quantum effects. Wavepacket dynamics around conical intersections are influenced by geometric phase, which can affect chemical reaction outcomes but has only been observed through indirect signatures. Now, by engineering a controllable conical intersection in a trapped-ion quantum simulator, the destructive wavepacket interference caused by a geometric phase has been observed.},

  abstract     = {Over the past few years, evidence has accrued that demonstrates that terrestrial photochemical reactions could have provided numerous (proto)biomolecules with implications for the origin of life. This chemistry simply relies on UV light, inorganic sulfur species and hydrogen cyanide. Recently, we reported that, under the same conditions, reduced phosphorus species, such as those delivered by meteorites, can be oxidized to orthophosphate, generating thiophosphate in the process. Here we describe an investigation of the properties of thiophosphate as well as additional possible means for its formation on primitive Earth. We show that several reported prebiotic reactions, including the photoreduction of thioamides, carbonyl groups and cyanohydrins, can be markedly improved, and that tetroses and pentoses can be accessed from hydrogen cyanide through a Kiliani–Fischer-type process without progressing to higher sugars. We also demonstrate that thiophosphate allows photochemical reductive aminations, and that thiophosphate chemistry allows a plausible prebiotic synthesis of the C5 moieties used in extant terpene and terpenoid biosynthesis, namely dimethylallyl alcohol and isopentenyl alcohol. The streamlined synthesis of multiple (proto)biomolecules from common starting materials is a key goal of prebiotic chemistry. Now, a one-pot synthesis of ribo-aminooxazoline (a precursor for prebiotic nucleotide synthesis) from HCN has been achieved. Additionally, the two moieties used in extant terpenoid biosynthesis have been accessed, with all carbon atoms also originating from HCN.},

Inspired by natural biopolymers, peptide and nucleic acid sequences have been designed to adopt particular three-dimensional (3D) shapes and programmed to exert specific functions. In contrast, synthetic glycans capable of autonomously folding into defined 3D conformations have so far not been explored owing to their structural complexity and lack of design rules. Here we generate a glycan that adopts a stable secondary structure not present in nature, a glycan hairpin, by combining natural glycan motifs, stabilized by a non-conventional hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. Automated glycan assembly enabled rapid access to synthetic analogues, including site-specific 13C-labelled ones, for nuclear magnetic resonance conformational analysis. Long-range inter-residue nuclear Overhauser effects unequivocally confirmed the folded conformation of the synthetic glycan hairpin. The capacity to control the 3D shape across the pool of available monosaccharides has the potential to afford more foldamer scaffolds with programmable properties and functions. Inspired by the design of peptide and nucleic acid sequences to adopt particular three-dimensional shapes, natural glycan motifs have now been combined to construct a glycan that adopts a hairpin conformation in water.

  abstract     = {Molecular species containing multiple bonds to aluminium have long been challenging synthetic targets. Despite recent landmark discoveries in this area, heterodinuclear Al–E multiple bonds (where E is a group-14 element) have remained rare and limited to highly polarized π-interactions (Al=E ↔ +Al–E–). Here we report the isolation of three alumanyl silanide anions that feature an Al–Si core stabilized by bulky substituents and a Si–Na interaction. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations show that the Al–Si interaction possesses partial double bond character. Preliminary reactivity studies support this description of the compounds through two resonance structures: one that displays a predominant nucleophilic character of the sodium-coordinated silicon centre in the Al–Si core, as shown by silanide-like reactivity towards halosilane electrophiles and the CH-insertion of phenylacetylene. Moreover, we report an alumanyl silanide with a sequestered sodium cation. Cleavage of the Si–Na bond by [2.2.2]cryptand increases the double bond character of the Al–Si core to produce an anion with high aluminata-silene (–Al=Si) character. Aluminium and silicon, two Earth-abundant, well-understood elements, typically form weak Al–Si bonds. Now, complexes featuring an anionic Al–Si core stabilized by bulky substituents and a Si–Na interaction have been isolated. This Al–Si interaction possesses partial double bond character, which can be increased by sequestration of the sodium counterion.},

  abstract     = {The visualization of single-molecule reactions provides crucial insights into chemical processes, and the ability to do so has grown with the advances in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. There is currently a limited mechanistic understanding of chemical reactions under the electron beam. However, such reactions may enable synthetic methodologies that cannot be accessed by traditional organic chemistry methods. Here we demonstrate the synthetic use of the electron beam, by in-depth single-molecule, atomic-resolution, time-resolved transmission electron microscopy studies, in inducing the formation of a doubly holed fullerene-porphyrin cage structure from a well-defined benzoporphyrin precursor deposited on graphene. Through real-time imaging, we analyse the hybrid’s ability to host up to two Pb atoms, and subsequently probe the dynamics of the Pb–Pb binding motif in this exotic metallo-organic cage structure. Through simulation, we conclude that the secondary electrons, which accumulate in the periphery of the irradiated area, can also initiate chemical reactions. Consequently, designing advanced carbon nanostructures by electron-beam lithography will depend on the understanding and limitations of molecular radiation chemistry. Visualizing single-molecule reactions using electron microscopy can be difficult because of potential radiation damage from the electron beam. Now, however, it has been shown that a high-energy electron beam can be used to synthesize metallo-azafullerenes. Atomic-resolution, time-resolved transmission electron microscopy, with the help of computational calculations, is used to monitor the metal-encapsulation dynamics.},

However, screening campaigns often fail if the molecular arrangement of the building blocks is not conducive to an efficient interaction with a protein target. Here we postulated that the use of rigid, compact and stereo-defined central scaffolds for DEL synthesis may facilitate the discovery of very specific ligands capable of discriminating between closely related protein targets. We synthesized a DEL comprising 3,735,936 members, featuring the four stereoisomers of 4-aminopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid as central scaffolds. The library was screened in comparative selections against pharmaceutically relevant targets and their closely related protein isoforms. Hit validation results revealed a strong impact of stereochemistry, with large affinity differences between stereoisomers. We identified potent isozyme-selective ligands against multiple protein targets. Some of these hits, specific to tumour-associated antigens, demonstrated tumour-selective targeting in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, constructing DELs with stereo-defined elements contributed to high library productivity and ligand selectivity. The design and construction of a stereo-defined DNA-encoded chemical library, featuring the four different 4-amino-proline stereoisomers as a central scaffold, has now enabled the discovery of potent ligands to proteins of pharmaceutical interest. Parallel screening with closely related isoforms (anti-targets) facilitated the isolation of hits with high selectivity ratios.},

  abstract     = {The tetrazine ligation is an inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder reaction widely used for bioorthogonal modifications due to its versatility, site specificity and fast reaction kinetics. A major limitation has been the incorporation of dienophiles in biomolecules and organisms, which relies on externally added reagents. Available methods require the incorporation of tetrazine-reactive groups by enzyme-mediated ligations or unnatural amino acid incorporation. Here we report a tetrazine ligation strategy, termed TyrEx (tyramine excision) cycloaddition, permitting autonomous dienophile generation in bacteria. It utilizes a unique aminopyruvate unit introduced by post-translational protein splicing at a short tag. Tetrazine conjugation occurs rapidly with a rate constant of 0.625 (15) M−1 s−1 and was applied to produce a radiolabel chelator-modified Her2-binding Affibody and intracellular, fluorescently labelled cell division protein FtsZ. We anticipate the labelling strategy to be useful for intracellular studies of proteins, as a stable conjugation method for protein therapeutics, as well as other applications. An enzymatic reaction installs endogenous β-amino acids in proteins with unique reactivity. Now it has been shows that this reaction can be used for site-specific modification with tetrazine dienophiles to introduce labels onto target proteins.

  abstract     = {Glutathione (GSH) is the main determinant of intracellular redox potential and participates in multiple cellular signalling pathways. Achieving a detailed understanding of intracellular GSH homeostasis depends on the development of tools to map GSH compartmentalization and intra-organelle fluctuations. Here we present a GSH-sensing platform for live-cell imaging, termed targetable ratiometric quantitative GSH (TRaQ-G). This chemogenetic sensor possesses a unique reactivity turn-on mechanism, ensuring that the small molecule is only sensitive to GSH in a desired location. Furthermore, TRaQ-G can be fused to a fluorescent protein to give a ratiometric response. Using TRaQ-G fused to a redox-insensitive fluorescent protein, we demonstrate that the nuclear and cytosolic GSH pools are independently regulated during cell proliferation. This sensor was used in combination with a redox-sensitive fluorescent protein to quantify redox potential and GSH concentration simultaneously in the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, by exchanging the fluorescent protein, we created a near-infrared, targetable and quantitative GSH sensor. Fluorescent sensors that are responsive only in a specific subcellular location have remained elusive. Now, a chemogenetic sensing platform has been developed to sense glutathione in a user-defined organelle of interest. These tools enable quantitative studies of subcellular glutathione homeostasis using visible or near-infrared wavelengths.},

It was speculated that such an extensive, localized water ionization can be caused by ultrafast processes following excitation by core-level ionization of hydrated metal ions. In this model, ions relax via a cascade of local Auger–Meitner and, importantly, non-local charge- and energy-transfer processes involving the water environment. Here, we experimentally and theoretically show that, for solvated paradigmatic intermediate-mass Al3+ ions, electronic relaxation involves two sequential solute–solvent electron transfer-mediated decay processes. The electron transfer-mediated decay steps correspond to sequential relaxation from Al5+ to Al3+ accompanied by formation of four ionized water molecules and two low-energy electrons. Such charge multiplication and the generated highly reactive species are expected to initiate cascades of radical reactions. Radiation damage in biology is largely mediated by radicals and low-energy electrons formed by water ionization and extensive, localized water ionization can be caused by ultrafast processes following the core-level ionization of hydrated metal ions.

Improving the electron transport at the nano–bio interface and inside cells is important for boosting conversion efficiencies, yet the underlying mechanism is challenging to study by bulk measurements owing to the heterogeneities of both constituents. Here we develop a generalizable, quantitative multimodal microscopy platform that combines multi-channel optical imaging and photocurrent mapping to probe such biohybrids down to single- to sub-cell/particle levels. We uncover and differentiate the critical roles of different hydrogenases in the lithoautotrophic bacterium Ralstonia eutropha for bioplastic formation, discover this bacterium’s surprisingly large nanoampere-level electron-uptake capability, and dissect the cross-membrane electron-transport pathways. This imaging platform, and the associated analytical framework, can uncover electron-transport mechanisms in various types of biohybrid, and potentially offers a means to use and engineer R. eutropha for efficient chemical production coupled with photocatalytic materials. Understanding interfacial and cellular electron transport is essential for guiding efficiency optimization in microbe–semiconductor biohybrids for energy conversion.

However, direct and site-selective installation of oxygen groups to common aromatic compounds remains challenging, especially when additional arene functionalization is simultaneously required. Current arene C−H oxidation strategies generally require directing groups or precisely prefunctionalized substrates to control site-selectivity. While palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis is promising for site-specific arene vicinal difunctionalization through simultaneous reactions with an electrophile and a nucleophile, the electrophile scope has been limited to species based on relatively ‘soft’ elements, such as carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. Here we report the development of an ortho oxygenation reaction with common aryl halides to rapidly deliver diverse aryl ethers. The coupling of the ‘hard’ oxygen electrophile is enabled by a stable, polarity-reversed, conformationally predistorted N−O reagent and facilitated by a C7-bromo-substituted norbornene mediator. Mechanistic studies reveal a unique SN2-type pathway between the N−O reagent as the oxygen electrophile and an electron-rich Pd(II) nucleophile. Pd/norbornene cooperative catalysis provides a strategy for arene functionalization, but the electrophile scope is typically limited to ‘soft’ elements such as carbon, nitrogen and sulfur.

  abstract     = {The off-target toxicity of drugs targeted to proteins imparts substantial health and economic costs. Proteome interaction studies can reveal off-target effects with unintended proteins; however, little attention has been paid to intracellular RNAs as potential off-targets that may contribute to toxicity. To begin to assess this, we developed a reactivity-based RNA profiling methodology and applied it to uncover transcriptome interactions of a set of Food and Drug Administration-approved small-molecule drugs in vivo. We show that these protein-targeted drugs pervasively interact with the human transcriptome and can exert unintended biological effects on RNA functions. In addition, we show that many off-target interactions occur at RNA loci associated with protein binding and structural changes, allowing us to generate hypotheses to infer the biological consequences of RNA off-target binding. The results suggest that rigorous characterization of drugs’ transcriptome interactions may help assess target specificity and potentially avoid toxicity and clinical failures. Now a reactivity-based RNA profiling strategy can measure the global off-target transcriptome interactions of small-molecule drugs at single-nucleotide resolution. Using this approach, three FDA-approved drugs were evaluated, uncovering pervasive drug–RNA interactions and interactions that perturb RNA functions in cells.},

Although redox-active pyridiniums exhibit exceptional persistence in multiple redox states at low potentials (desirable properties for energy storage applications), their solubility in non-aqueous media remains low, and few practical molecular design strategies exist to improve solubility. Here we convey the extent to which discrete, attractive interactions between C–H groups and π electrons of an aromatic ring (C–H···π interactions) can describe the solubility of N-substituted pyridinium salts in a non-aqueous solvent. We find a direct correlation between the number of C–H···π interactions for each pyridinium salt and its solubility in acetonitrile. The correlation presented in this work highlights a consequence of disrupting strong electrostatic interactions with weak dispersion interactions, showing how minimal structural change can dramatically impact pyridinium solubility. The energy density in redox flow batteries is currently limited by the solubility of dissolved redox species. Now it has been shown that intermolecular C–H···π interactions can disrupt electrostatic forces in these organic electrolytes to improve their solubility in non-aqueous solvents.},

  abstract     = {Interpenetrated metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) comprise two or more lattices that are mutually entangled. Interpenetration can be used to tune the structures and pore architectures of MOFs to influence, for example, their stability or interactions with guest molecules. The interpenetrating sublattices are typically identical, but hetero-interpenetrated MOFs, which consist of sublattices that are different from one another, have also been serendipitously produced. Here we describe a strategy for the deliberate synthesis of hetero-interpenetrated MOFs. We use the cubic α-MUF-9 framework as a host sublattice to template the growth of a second sublattice within its pores. Three different secondary sublattices are grown—two of which are not known as standalone MOFs—leading to three different hetero-interpenetrated MOFs. This strategy may serve to combine different properties into one material. We produce an asymmetric catalysis by allocating separate roles to the interpenetrating sublattices in a hetero-interpenetrated MOF: an achiral secondary amine on one sublattice provides the catalytic activity, while the chiral α-MUF-10 host imparts asymmetry to aldol and Henry reactions. Interpenetration—in which two or more lattices are catenated—is common in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). Now a deliberate synthesis of hetero-interpenetrated MOFs, with two distinct lattices, has been developed. It can combine the different properties of the two sublattices in one material, as demonstrated with chirality and catalytic activity, delivering an asymmetric catalyst.},

  abstract     = {Formaldehyde, HCHO, is the highest-volume carbonyl in the atmosphere. It absorbs sunlight at wavelengths shorter than 330 nm and photolyses to form H and HCO radicals, which then react with O2 to form HO2. Here we show HCHO has an additional HO2 formation pathway. At photolysis energies below the energetic threshold for radical formation we directly detect HO2 at low pressures by cavity ring-down spectroscopy and indirectly detect HO2 at 1 bar by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy end-product analysis. Supported by electronic structure theory and master equation simulations, we attribute this HO2 to photophysical oxidation (PPO): photoexcited HCHO relaxes non-radiatively to the ground electronic state where the far-from-equilibrium, vibrationally activated HCHO molecules react with thermal O2. PPO is likely to be a general mechanism in tropospheric chemistry and, unlike photolysis, PPO will increase with increasing O2 pressure. In the atmosphere, photolysis of formaldehyde generates H and HCO radicals, which then react with O2 to form HO2 (important in converting atmospheric carbon to CO2). Now it has been shown that internally excited formaldehyde can also react with atmospheric O2 to make HO2 in a direct, one-step ‘photophysical oxidation’, a mechanism likely to be general in the troposphere.},

  abstract     = {The maturation of liquid-like protein condensates into amyloid fibrils has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this liquid-to-solid transition have remained largely unclear. Here we analyse the amyloid formation mediated by condensation of the low-complexity domain of hnRNPA1, a protein involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We show that phase separation and fibrillization are connected but distinct processes that are modulated by different regions of the protein sequence. By monitoring the spatial and temporal evolution of amyloid formation we demonstrate that the formation of fibrils does not occur homogeneously inside the droplets but is promoted at the interface of the condensates. We further show that coating the interface of the droplets with surfactant molecules inhibits fibril formation. Our results reveal that the interface of biomolecular condensates of hnRNPA1 promotes fibril formation, therefore suggesting interfaces as a potential novel therapeutic target against the formation of aberrant amyloids mediated by condensation. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the maturation of protein condensates into amyloid fibrils associated with neurodegenerative diseases has so far remained elusive. Now it has been shown that in condensates formed by the low-complexity domain of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated protein hnRNPA1, fibril formation is promoted at the interface, which provides a potential therapeutic target for counteracting aberrant protein aggregation.},

  abstract     = {Protein liquid–liquid phase separation can lead to disease-related amyloid fibril formation. The mechanisms of conversion of monomeric protein into condensate droplets and of the latter into fibrils remain elusive. Here, using mass photometry, we demonstrate that the Parkinson’s disease-related protein, α-synuclein, can form dynamic nanoscale clusters at physiologically relevant, sub-saturated concentrations. Nanoclusters nucleate in bulk solution and promote amyloid fibril formation of the dilute-phase monomers upon ageing. Their formation is instantaneous, even under conditions where macroscopic assemblies appear only after several days. The slow growth of the nanoclusters can be attributed to a kinetic barrier, probably due to an interfacial penalty from the charged C terminus of α-synuclein. Our findings reveal that α-synuclein phase separation occurs at much wider ranges of solution conditions than reported so far. Importantly, we establish mass photometry as a promising methodology to detect and quantify nanoscale precursors of phase separation. We also demonstrate its general applicability by probing the existence of nanoclusters of a non-amyloidogenic protein, Ddx4n1. The mechanism of α-synuclein amyloid aggregation via liquid–liquid phase separation has so far remained elusive. Now, the existence of nanoscale clusters of α-synuclein in sub-saturated concentrations is observed using mass photometry. These nanoscale clusters can act as precursors to both macroscopic condensate droplets as well as amyloid fibrils.},

  abstract     = {The presence of a hydroxyl group at the 2′-position in its ribose makes RNA susceptible to hydrolysis. Stabilization of RNAs for storage, transport and biological application thus remains a serious challenge, particularly for larger RNAs that are not accessible by chemical synthesis. Here we present reversible 2′-OH acylation as a general strategy to preserve RNA of any length or origin. High-yield polyacylation of 2′-hydroxyls (‘cloaking’) by readily accessible acylimidazole reagents effectively shields RNAs from both thermal and enzymatic degradation. Subsequent treatment with water-soluble nucleophilic reagents removes acylation adducts quantitatively (‘uncloaking’) and recovers a remarkably broad range of RNA functions, including reverse transcription, translation and gene editing. Furthermore, we show that certain α-dimethylamino- and α-alkoxy- acyl adducts are spontaneously removed in human cells, restoring messenger RNA translation with extended functional half-lives. These findings support the potential of reversible 2′-acylation as a simple and general molecular solution for enhancing RNA stability and provide mechanistic insights for stabilizing RNA regardless of length or origin. Stabilization of RNAs for storage, transport and biological application remains a profound challenge. Now, it has been shown that reversible 2′-OH acylation with easily accessible acylimidazoles unlocks efficient protection of RNA. RNA can be deprotected by non-basic nucleophiles or spontaneously in cells to restore RNA functions.},

  abstract     = {The acylhydrazone unit is well represented in screening databases used to find ligands for biological targets, and numerous bioactive acylhydrazones have been reported. However, potential E/Z isomerization of the C=N bond in these compounds is rarely examined when bioactivity is assayed. Here we analysed two ortho-hydroxylated acylhydrazones discovered in a virtual drug screen for modulators of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and other bioactive hydroxylated acylhydrazones with structurally defined targets reported in the Protein Data Bank. We found that ionized forms of these compounds, which are populated under laboratory conditions, photoisomerize readily and the isomeric forms have markedly different bioactivity. Furthermore, we show that glutathione, a tripeptide involved with cellular redox balance, catalyses dynamic E⇄Z isomerization of acylhydrazones. The ratio of E to Z isomers in cells is determined by the relative stabilities of the isomers regardless of which isomer was applied. We conclude that E/Z isomerization may be a common feature of the bioactivity observed with acylhydrazones and should be routinely analysed. Acylhydrazones are often found in compounds across screening databases, and numerous bioactive acylhydrazones exist. This functional group can isomerize between E and Z in response to light or upon exposure to thiols. Now, E/Z isomerization is found to impact activities of bioactive acylhydrazones and should be routinely analysed.},

  abstract     = {The composition, sequence, length and type of glycosidic linkage of polysaccharides profoundly affect their biological and physical properties. However, investigation of the structure–function relationship of polysaccharides is hampered by difficulties in accessing well-defined polysaccharides in sufficient quantities. Here we report a chemical approach to precision polysaccharides with native glycosidic linkages via living cationic ring-opening polymerization of 1,6-anhydrosugars. We synthesized well-defined polysaccharides with tunable molecular weight, low dispersity and excellent regio- and stereo-selectivity using a boron trifluoride etherate catalyst and glycosyl fluoride initiators. Computational studies revealed that the reaction propagated through the monomer α-addition to the oxocarbenium and was controlled by the reversible deactivation of the propagating oxocarbenium to form the glycosyl fluoride dormant species. Our method afforded a facile and scalable pathway to multiple biologically relevant precision polysaccharides, including d-glucan, d-mannan and an unusual l-glucan. We demonstrated that catalytic depolymerization of precision polysaccharides efficiently regenerated monomers, suggesting their potential utility as a class of chemically recyclable materials with tailored thermal and mechanical properties. The inability to access well-defined polysaccharides in sufficient quantities has hampered our understanding of their structure–function relationships. Now it has been shown that native precision polysaccharides can be readily prepared via living polymerization of 1,6-anhydrosugars. The obtained polymers display excellent chemical recyclability, suggesting their potential utility as a class of sustainable materials.},

  abstract     = {Target identification involves deconvoluting the protein target of a pharmacologically active, small-molecule ligand, a process that is critical for early drug discovery yet technically challenging. Photoaffinity labelling strategies have become the benchmark for small-molecule target deconvolution, but covalent protein capture requires the use of high-energy ultraviolet light, which can complicate downstream target identification. Thus, there is a strong demand for alternative technologies that allow for controlled activation of chemical probes to covalently label their protein target. Here we introduce an electroaffinity labelling platform that leverages the use of a small, redox-active diazetidinone functional group to enable chemoproteomic-based target identification of pharmacophores within live cell environments. The underlying discovery to enable this platform is that the diazetidinone can be electrochemically oxidized to reveal a reactive intermediate useful for covalent modification of proteins. This work demonstrates the electrochemical platform to be a functional tool for drug-target identification. The covalent capture of a ligand by its target protein(s) is important for drug-target identification. Now an electrochemically active warhead—diazetidinone—can be leveraged in a chemoproteomics platform for electroaffinity labelling of a ligand’s target protein to afford target-ligand identification in live cells.},

  abstract     = {Ozonolysis is a widely used and practical synthetic technique for the deconstructive oxidation of olefins using ozone. While there are numerous ozonolysis reactions that give a myriad of products and functionalities, almost all of them involve scission at the olefin double bond. Using ozone as a constructive reagent rather than a deconstructive one would open new domains of chemical reactivity and amplify molecular complexity in synthetic methodology. Here we report the use of primary ozonides as preparative synthetic intermediates for a safe and green olefin syn-dihydroxylation reaction. Furthermore, we have demonstrated this method using a continuous flow reactor that virtually eliminates peroxide accumulation and extended these applications towards the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules such as guaifenesin, the active ingredient in Mucinex, and a precursor to ponesimod, a drug to treat multiple sclerosis. Traditionally, ozone has been primarily used to oxidatively deconstruct carbon–carbon bonds. Now, it has been shown that ozone can be used for the construction of carbon–oxygen bonds without oxidative cleavage of the olefin substrate through capturing primary ozonides. Furthermore, intercepting primary ozonides with nucleophiles in continuous flow enabled the green, syn-dihydroxylation of olefins to be realized.},

  abstract     = {Charge-transfer reactions are ubiquitous and play important roles in various gaseous environments, but, despite a long history of extensive research, our understanding of their dynamics at the quantum state-to-state level is still lacking. Here we report quantum-state-resolved experiments for the paradigmatic charge-transfer reaction Ar+ + N2 → Ar + N2+ using a three-dimensional velocity-map imaging crossed-beam apparatus with the Ar+ beam prepared exclusively in the spin–orbit state 2P3/2. High-resolution scattering images show strong dependence of rotational and angular distributions on the vibrational quantum number of the N2+ product. Trajectory surface-hopping calculations, which semi-quantitatively reproduce the experimental observations, support the existence of two distinct charge-transfer mechanisms. One of these, in the dominant N2+(v′ = 1) channel, is the well-known long-distance harpooning mechanism. However, the highly rotationally excited products in the forward direction are attributed to a hard-collision glory scattering mechanism, which occurs on account of the strong attraction between the collisional partners counterbalanced by the short-range repulsive interaction. Quantum state-to-state understanding of collisional charge transfer is a long-time goal of chemical dynamics. Now, using high-resolution molecular-beam experiments with spin–orbit state-selected ions and surface-hopping calculations, a vibrational-state-specific mechanism has been observed for the reaction Ar+(2P3/2) + N2 → Ar + N2+(v′, J′). Besides the well-known long-range harpooning mechanism, a hard-collision glory scattering mechanism was also identified.},

  abstract     = {A major impediment to Li–O2 battery commercialization is the low discharge capacities resulting from electronically insulating Li2O2 film growth on carbon electrodes. Redox mediation offers an effective strategy to drive oxygen chemistry into solution, avoiding surface-mediated Li2O2 film growth and extending discharge lifetimes. As such, the exploration of diverse redox mediator classes can aid the development of molecular design criteria. Here we report a class of triarylmethyl cations that are effective at enhancing discharge capacities up to 35-fold. Surprisingly, we observe that redox mediators with more positive reduction potentials lead to larger discharge capacities because of their improved ability to suppress the surface-mediated reduction pathway. This result provides important structure–property relationships for future improvements in redox-mediated O2/Li2O2 discharge capacities. Furthermore, we applied a chronopotentiometry model to investigate the zones of redox mediator standard reduction potentials and the concentrations needed to achieve efficient redox mediation at a given current density. We expect this analysis to guide future redox mediator exploration. Although Li–O2 batteries offer high theoretical capacities, redox mediators are necessary to control intermediate reaction kinetics and to limit electrode passivation. Now it has been shown that a family of triarylmethyl cations can rival top-performing quinone-based redox mediators. Cations with sluggish catalytic rates were found to suppress surface-mediated O2 reduction and achieve higher capacitances.},

However, an efficient synthetic method is required to better explore its biological utility. Here we elucidate the 11 missing steps for the celastrol biosynthetic route to enable its de novo biosynthesis in yeast. First, we reveal the cytochrome P450 enzymes that catalyse the four oxidation steps that produce the key intermediate celastrogenic acid. Subsequently, we show that non-enzymatic decarboxylation-triggered activation of celastrogenic acid leads to a cascade of tandem catechol oxidation-driven double-bond extension events that generate the characteristic quinone methide moiety of celastrol. Using this acquired knowledge, we have developed a method for producing celastrol starting from table sugar. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining plant biochemistry with metabolic engineering and chemistry for the scalable synthesis of complex specialized metabolites. Celastrol is a potent anti-obesity agent found in the root of Tripterygium wilfordii, but its medicinal application is compromised by limited availability.

Here we observe and characterize the ultrafast formation dynamics of D3+ from a bimolecular reaction, using pump–probe experiments that employ ultrashort laser pulses to probe its formation from a D2–D2 dimer. Our molecular dynamics simulations provide an intuitive representation of the reaction dynamics, which agree well with the experimental observation. We also show that the emission direction of D3+ can be controlled using a tailored two-colour femtosecond laser field. The underlying control mechanism is in line with what is known from the light control of electron localization in the bond breaking of single molecules. H3+ and D3+ serve as initiators of many chemical reactions in interstellar clouds. Now the ultrafast formation dynamics of D3+ from a light-driven bimolecular reaction starting from D2–D2 dimers have been measured.

However, the unexpected high abundance of H3+ in molecular clouds remains challenging to explain. Here using near-infrared, femtosecond laser pulses and coincidence momentum imaging, we find that the dominant channel after photoionization of a deuterium molecular dimer (D2–D2) is the ejection of a deuterium atom within a few hundred femtoseconds, leading to the formation of D3+. The formation mechanism is supported and well-reproduced by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. This pathway of D3+ formation from ultracold D2–D2 gas may provide insights into the high abundance of H3+ in the interstellar medium.

The sequence of molecular events preceding chain fracture is poorly understood, because such events cannot be visualized directly but must be inferred from changes in the bulk composition of the flowing solution. Here we describe how analysis of same-chain competition between fracture of a polystyrene chain and isomerization of a chromophore embedded in its backbone yields detailed characterization of the distribution of molecular geometries of mechanochemically reacting chains in sonicated solutions. In our experiments the overstretched (mechanically loaded) chain segment grew and drifted along the backbone on the same timescale as, and in competition with, the mechanochemical reactions. Consequently, only &amp;lt;30% of the backbone of a fragmenting chain is overstretched, with both the maximum force and the maximum reaction probabilities located away from the chain centre. We argue that quantifying intrachain competition is likely to be mechanistically informative for any flow fast enough to fracture polymer chains. Rapid solvent flows stretch dissolved polymer chains to their breaking point by hitherto-elusive molecular mechanisms. Now, analysis of competing mechanochemical reactions suggests a broad distribution of molecular geometries of fracturing chains. This occurs because, in each chain, fracture and kinetically destabilizing backbone stretching compete on submillisecond timescales.},

Inter- and intramolecular cooperative effects in the homodimer strongly depend on the provided metal ions and regulate the biosynthetic flux of terpene precursors to either biological defence or physiological development. Strikingly, a unique chain length determination domain adapts to form geranyl or farnesyl pyrophosphate by altering enzyme symmetry and ligand affinity between both subunits. In addition, we identify an allosteric geranyl-pyrophosphate-specific binding site that shares similarity with end-product inhibition in human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. Our combined findings elucidate a deeply intertwined reaction mechanism in the P. cochleariae isoprenyl diphosphate synthase that integrates substrate, product and metal-ion concentrations to harness its dynamic potential. The metal-dependent, bifunctional isoprenyl diphosphate synthase PcIDS1 from the leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae integrates substrate, product and metal-ion concentrations to tune its dynamic reactivity.

  abstract     = {Microtubules, a critical component of the cytoskeleton, carry post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are important for the regulation of key cellular processes. Long-lived microtubules, in neurons particularly, exhibit both detyrosination of α-tubulin and polyglutamylation. Dysregulation of these PTMs can result in developmental defects and neurodegeneration. Owing to a lack of tools to study the regulation and function of these PTMs, the mechanisms that govern such PTM patterns are not well understood. Here we produce fully functional tubulin carrying precisely defined PTMs within its C-terminal tail. We ligate synthetic α-tubulin tails—which are site-specifically glutamylated—to recombinant human tubulin heterodimers by applying a sortase- and intein-mediated tandem transamidation strategy. Using microtubules reconstituted with these designer tubulins, we find that α-tubulin polyglutamylation promotes its detyrosination by enhancing the activity of the tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase vasohibin/small vasohibin-binding protein in a manner dependent on the length of polyglutamyl chains. We also find that modulating polyglutamylation levels in cells results in corresponding changes in detyrosination, corroborating the link between the detyrosination cycle to polyglutamylation. Microtubules carry patterns of post-translational modifications that are important for the regulation of key cellular processes. Now a semi-synthetic method facilitates the production of tubulins with defined post-translational modifications. Using these designer tubulins, polyglutamylation of α-tubulin is found to promote its detyrosination by enhancing the activity of the carboxypeptidase vasohibin/small vasohibin-binding protein.},

The electronic coupling between these materials is typically weak, leading photoexcited charge carriers to spatially localize to the dot or to a molecule at its surface. However, we show that by converting a chemical linker that covalently binds anthracene molecules to silicon quantum dots from a carbon–carbon single bond to a double bond, we access a strong coupling regime where excited carriers spatially delocalize across both anthracene and silicon. By pushing the system to delocalize, we design a photon upconversion system with a higher efficiency (17.2%) and lower threshold intensity (0.5 W cm–2) than that of a corresponding weakly coupled system. Our results show that strong coupling between molecules and nanostructures achieved through targeted linking chemistry provides a complementary route for tailoring properties in materials for light-driven applications. Hybrid structures made up of quantum dots functionalized with molecules are highly tunable platforms for light-driven applications; however, the interaction between their components is often weak. Now it has been shown that by connecting molecules to silicon quantum dots via p-conjugated tethers, strongly coupled exciton states can be generated that prove advantageous for photon upconversion.},

  abstract     = {Terpenes constitute the largest class of natural products. Their skeletons are formed by terpene cyclases (TCs) from acyclic oligoprenyl diphosphates through sophisticated enzymatic conversions. These enzyme reactions start with substrate ionization through diphosphate abstraction, followed by a cascade reaction via cationic intermediates. Based on isotopic-labelling experiments in combination with a computational study, the cyclization mechanism for sodorifen, a highly methylated sesquiterpene from the soil bacterium Serratia plymuthica, was resolved. A peculiar problem in its biosynthesis lies in the formation of several methyl groups from chain methylene carbons. The underlying mechanism involves a methyltransferase-mediated cyclization and unprecedented ring contraction with carbon extrusion from the chain to form a methyl group. A terpene cyclase subsequently catalyses a fragmentation into two reactive intermediates, followed by hydrogen transfers between them and recombination of the fragments by [4 + 3] cycloaddition. This study solves the intricate mechanistic problem of extra methyl group formation in sodorifen biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of the methylated sesquiterpene sodorifen, which features a cryptic methylation pattern, has now been studied through extensive labelling experiments and computational chemistry. The methyl group formation is now understood to come from methylene carbons of the substrate farnesyl diphosphate and the absolute configuration of the biosynthetic intermediate presodorifen diphosphate has been revised.},

During the past decade, scientists have tried to replace the phenyl ring in bioactive compounds with saturated bioisosteres to obtain novel patentable structures. However, most of the research in this area has been devoted to the replacement of the para-substituted phenyl ring. Here we have developed saturated bioisosteres of the ortho-substituted phenyl ring with improved physicochemical properties: 2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes. Crystallographic analysis revealed that these structures and the ortho-substituted phenyl ring indeed have similar geometric properties. Replacement of the phenyl ring in marketed agrochemicals fluxapyroxad (BASF) and boscalid (BASF) with 2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes dramatically improved their water solubility, reduced lipophilicity and most importantly retained bioactivity. This work suggests an opportunity for chemists to replace the ortho-substituted phenyl ring in bioactive compounds with saturated bioisosteres in medicinal chemistry and agrochemistry.

  abstract     = {Biomolecular condensates, protein-rich and dynamic membrane-less organelles, play critical roles in a range of subcellular processes, including membrane trafficking and transcriptional regulation. However, aberrant phase transitions of intrinsically disordered proteins in biomolecular condensates can lead to the formation of irreversible fibrils and aggregates that are linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the implications, the interactions underlying such transitions remain obscure. Here we investigate the role of hydrophobic interactions by studying the low-complexity domain of the disordered ‘fused in sarcoma’ (FUS) protein at the air/water interface. Using surface-specific microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, we find that a hydrophobic interface drives fibril formation and molecular ordering of FUS, resulting in solid-like film formation. This phase transition occurs at 600-fold lower FUS concentration than required for the canonical FUS low-complexity liquid droplet formation in bulk. These observations highlight the importance of hydrophobic effects for protein phase separation and suggest that interfacial properties drive distinct protein phase-separated structures. Protein solutions can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation, by condensing into a dense phase that often resembles liquid droplets, which coexist with a dilute phase. Now it is shown that hydrophobic interactions, specifically at interfaces, can trigger a liquid–solid phase separation of a protein solution.},

However, the use of main-group elements to harness this type of reactivity has been little explored. Here we show how a low-valency bismuth complex is able to undergo one-electron oxidative addition with redox-active alkyl-radical precursors, mimicking the behaviour of first-row transition metals. This reactivity paradigm for bismuth gives rise to well-defined oxidative addition complexes, which could be fully characterized in solution and in the solid state. The resulting Bi(III)–C(sp3) intermediates display divergent reactivity patterns depending on the α-substituents of the alkyl fragment. Mechanistic investigations of this reactivity led to the development of a bismuth-catalysed C(sp3)–N cross-coupling reaction that operates under mild conditions and accommodates synthetically relevant NH-heterocycles as coupling partners. The use of main-group elements in radical cross-coupling reactions has been little explored. Now, a low-valency bismuth complex has been shown to emulate the behaviour of first-row transition metals and undergo single-electron-transfer oxidative addition to redox-active electrophiles, leading to the development of a bismuth-catalysed C–N coupling reaction between amines and carboxylic acids.},

  abstract     = {There is considerable uncertainty about the mechanism by which the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is activated. Here we use molecular metadynamics computations to predict the mechanism by which an agonist induces the activation of the β2AR and its cognate Gs protein. We found that binding agonist alone to the inactive β2AR does not break the ionic lock and hence does not drive the β2AR towards the activated conformation. However, we found that attaching the inactive Gs protein to the agonist-bound inactive β2AR (containing the ionic lock) leads to partial insertion of Gαs-α5 into the core of β2AR, which breaks the ionic lock, leading to activation of the Gs protein coupled to β2AR. Upon activation, the Gαs protein undergoes a remarkable opening of the GDP binding pocket, making the GDP available for exchange or release. Concomitantly, Gαs-α5 undergoes a remarkable expansion in the β2AR cytoplasmic region after the ionic lock is broken, inducing TM6 to displace outward by ~5 Å from TM3. Contrary to agonist binding being the sole driver for β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) activation, molecular metadynamics simulations now reveal a distinct activation mechanism. Coupling β2AR with its cognate Gs protein induces considerable structural changes, activating both proteins. Gs opens its GDP binding pocket while β2AR undergoes expansion.},

  abstract     = {Exciton–exciton annihilation (EEA), an important loss channel in optoelectronic devices and photosynthetic complexes, has conventionally been assumed to be an incoherent, diffusion-limited process. Here we challenge this assumption by experimentally demonstrating the ability to control EEA in molecular aggregates using the quantum phase relationships of excitons. We employed time-resolved photoluminescence microscopy to independently determine exciton diffusion constants and annihilation rates in two substituted perylene diimide aggregates featuring contrasting excitonic phase envelopes. Low-temperature EEA rates were found to differ by more than two orders of magnitude for the two compounds, despite comparable diffusion constants. Simulated rates based on a microscopic theory, in excellent agreement with experiments, rationalize this EEA behaviour based on quantum interference arising from the presence or absence of spatial phase oscillations of delocalized excitons. These results offer an approach for designing molecular materials using quantum interference where low annihilation can coexist with high exciton concentrations and mobilities. Exciton–exciton annihilation is conventionally assumed to be limited by diffusion. Now, using time-resolved photoluminescence microscopy to determine exciton diffusion constants and annihilation rates in two substituted perylene diimide aggregates, along with a microscopic model, it has been shown that annihilation can be suppressed through quantum interference of the spatial phase of delocalized excitons.},

Synthetic access to large collections of well defined, structurally diverse GAG oligosaccharides would provide critical insights into this important class of biomolecules and represent a major advance in glycoscience. Here we report a new platform for synthesizing large heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide libraries displaying comprehensive arrays of sulfation patterns. Library synthesis is made possible by improving the overall synthetic efficiency through universal building blocks derived from natural heparin and a traceless fluorous tagging method for rapid purification with minimal manual manipulation. Using this approach, we generated a complete library of 64 HS oligosaccharides displaying all possible 2-O-, 6-O- and N-sulfation sequences in the tetrasaccharide GlcN–IdoA–GlcN–IdoA. These diverse structures provide an unprecedented view into the sulfation code of GAGs and identify sequences for modulating the activities of important growth factors and chemokines. Large collections of defined glycosaminoglycan (GAG) structures have been synthetically challenging to obtain but are required to understand this important class of biomolecules. Now, an efficient platform for synthesizing large libraries of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides has been developed, providing a detailed view into the sulfation code of GAGs.},

This coordination environment has been found to elicit strong magnetic anisotropy, but lanthanide-based SMMs with low coordination numbers have remained synthetically elusive species. Here we report a cationic 4f complex bearing only two bis-silylamide ligands, Yb(III)[{N(SiMePh2)2}2][Al{OC(CF3)3}4], which exhibits slow relaxation of its magnetization. The combination of the bulky silylamide ligands and weakly coordinating [Al{OC(CF3)3}4]− anion provides a sterically hindered environment that suitably stabilizes the pseudotrigonal geometry necessary to elicit strong ground-state magnetic anisotropy. The resolution of the mJ states by luminescence spectroscopy is supported by ab initio calculations, which show a large ground-state splitting of approximately 1,850 cm−1. These results provide a facile route to access a bis-silylamido Yb(III) complex, and further underline the desirability of axially coordinated ligands with well-localized charges for high-performing SMMs. A trivalent 4f cationic complex bearing two bis-silylamide ligands has been prepared that displays slow magnetic relaxation.

  abstract     = {Photocycloaddition is a powerful reaction to enable the conversion of alkenes into high-value synthetic materials that are normally difficult to obtain under thermal conditions. Lactams and pyridines, both prominent in pharmaceutical applications, currently lack effective synthetic strategies to combine them within a single molecular structure. Here we describe an efficient approach to diastereoselective pyridyl lactamization via a photoinduced [3+2] cycloaddition, based on the unique triplet-state reactivity of N–N pyridinium ylides in the presence of a photosensitizer. The corresponding triplet diradical intermediates allow the stepwise radical [3+2] cycloaddition with a broad range of activated and unactivated alkenes under mild conditions. This method exhibits excellent efficiency, diastereoselectivity and functional group tolerance, providing a useful synthon for ortho-pyridyl γ- and δ-lactam scaffolds with syn-configuration in a single step. Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that the energy transfer process leads to a triplet-state diradical of N–N pyridinium ylides, which promotes the stepwise cycloaddition. There is currently a lack of effective synthetic strategies for combining lactams and pyridines within a single molecular structure. Now, diastereoselective pyridyl lactamization has been developed using a photoinduced [3+2] cycloaddition of triplet diradical N–N pyridinium ylides with pendant alkenes. This method provides a useful synthon for preparing pyridyl γ- and δ-lactam scaffolds with syn-configuration.},

  abstract     = {Tandem Diels–Alder reactions are frequently used in the construction of polycyclic ring systems in complex organic compounds. Unlike the many Diels−Alderases (DAases) that catalyse a single cycloaddition, enzymes for multiple Diels–Alder reactions are rare. Here we demonstrate that two calcium-ion-dependent glycosylated enzymes, EupfF and PycR1, independently catalyse sequential, intermolecular Diels–Alder reactions in the biosynthesis of bistropolone-sesquiterpenes. We elucidate the origins of catalysis and stereoselectivity within these DAases through analysis of enzyme co-crystal structures, together with computational and mutational studies. These enzymes are secreted as glycoproteins with diverse N-glycans. The N-glycan at N211 in PycR1 significantly increases the affinity to the calcium ion, which in turn regulates the active cavity, making it specifically interact with substrates to accelerate the tandem [4 + 2] cycloaddition. The synergistic effect of the calcium ion and N-glycan on the catalytic centre of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism, especially for complex tandem reactions, can extend our understanding of protein evolution and improve the artificial design of biocatalysts. Two glycosylated enzymes, EupfF and PycR1, have now been characterized and shown to independently catalyse the tandem intermolecular [4 + 2] cycloaddition in the biosynthesis of bistropolone-sesquiterpenes.

Specific structures are usually preformed to build these rigid segments at the middle or late stage in the synthesis of polycyclic molecules, resulting in decreased synthetic efficiency and target-specific syntheses. As a logically distinct synthetic strategy, we constructed an allene/ketone-equipped morphan core at the outset through an enantioselective α-allenylation of ketones. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that the high reactivity and enantioselectivity of this reaction are attributed to the cooperative effects of the organocatalyst and metal catalyst. The bridged backbone generated was employed as a structural platform to guide and facilitate the assembly of up to five fusing rings, and the allene and ketone groups thereon were used to precisely install various functionalities at C16 and C20 at the late stage, leading to a concise, collective total synthesis of nine strychnan alkaloids. The morphan core is central to strychnan alkaloid synthesis and is typically formed during the middle or later stages of the process. Now it has been shown that an allene/ketone-equipped morphan core can be constructed early in the synthesis through ketone α-allenylation and then used to introduce other rings and functionalities, enabling access to nine targets including strychnine and geissolosimine.},

  abstract     = {The use of metal catalysts to produce and control the reactivity of carbenes has long offered a powerful approach to organic synthesis; however, difluorocarbene transfer catalysed by metal is an outlier and remains a substantial challenge. In that context, copper difluorocarbene chemistry has been elusive so far. Here we report the design, synthesis, characterization and reactivity of isolable copper(I) difluorocarbene complexes, which enable the development of a copper-catalysed difluorocarbene transfer reaction. The method offers a strategy for the modular synthesis of organofluorine compounds from simple and readily available components. This strategy facilitates a modular difluoroalkylation by coupling difluorocarbene with two inexpensive feedstocks, silyl enol ethers and allyl/propargyl bromides, in a one-pot reaction via copper catalysis, providing a diversity of difluoromethylene-containing products without laborious multistep synthesis. The approach enables access to various fluorinated skeletons of medicinal interest. Mechanistic and computational studies consistently reveal a mechanism involving nucleophilic addition to an electrophilic copper(I) difluorocarbene. Although several transition-metal carbene complexes have been isolated and used for catalytic carbene transfer reactions, few metal difluorocarbene complexes have been reported. Now, the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of isolable copper(I) difluorocarbene complexes has been reported, which has enabled the development of a copper-catalysed difluorocarbene transfer reaction to access fluorinated compounds from simple chemical feedstocks.},

Here we present a strategy for editing phospholipids, the most abundant lipids in biological membranes. Our membrane editor is based on a bacterial phospholipase D (PLD), which exchanges phospholipid head groups through hydrolysis or transphosphatidylation of phosphatidylcholine with water or exogenous alcohols. Exploiting activity-dependent directed enzyme evolution in mammalian cells, we have developed and structurally characterized a family of ‘superPLDs’ with up to a 100-fold enhancement in intracellular activity. We demonstrate the utility of superPLDs for both optogenetics-enabled editing of phospholipids within specific organelle membranes in live cells and biocatalytic synthesis of natural and unnatural designer phospholipids in vitro. Beyond the superPLDs, activity-based directed enzyme evolution in mammalian cells is a generalizable approach to engineer additional chemoenzymatic biomolecule editors. Cellular membranes contain numerous lipids, and efforts to understand the biological functions of individual lipids demand approaches for controlled modulation of membrane composition in situ. Now, click chemistry-based directed evolution of a microbial phospholipase within mammalian cells affords an editor for optogenetic, targeted modification of phospholipids in cell membranes.},

  abstract     = {Although Li–air rechargeable batteries offer higher energy densities than lithium-ion batteries, the insulating Li2O2 formed during discharge hinders rapid, efficient re-charging. Redox mediators are used to facilitate Li2O2 oxidation; however, fast kinetics at a low charging voltage are necessary for practical applications and are yet to be achieved. We investigate the mechanism of Li2O2 oxidation by redox mediators. The rate-limiting step is the outer-sphere one-electron oxidation of Li2O2 to LiO2, which follows Marcus theory. The second step is dominated by LiO2 disproportionation, forming mostly triplet-state O2. The yield of singlet-state O2 depends on the redox potential of the mediator in a way that does not correlate with electrolyte degradation, in contrast to earlier views. Our mechanistic understanding explains why current low-voltage mediators (&amp;lt;+3.3 V) fail to deliver high rates (the maximum rate is at +3.74 V) and suggests important mediator design strategies to deliver sufficiently high rates for fast charging at potentials closer to the thermodynamic potential of Li2O2 oxidation (+2.96 V). Ultra-high-capacity Li–air batteries have low Coulombic efficiency and degrade during re-charging, resulting in a poor cycle life. Redox mediators enable improvements but only at undesirably high potentials. The origin of this high potential and the impact of purported reactive intermediates has now been elucidated by resolving the charging mechanism using Marcus theory.},

Protons are conducted along hydrogen-bonded ‘wires’ of water molecules and polar side chains, which, somewhat surprisingly, are often interrupted by dry apolar stretches in the conduction pathways, inferred from static protein structures. Here we hypothesize that protons are conducted through such dry spots by forming transient water wires, often highly correlated with the presence of the excess protons in the water wire. To test this hypothesis, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to design transmembrane channels with stable water pockets interspersed by apolar segments capable of forming flickering water wires. The minimalist designed channels conduct protons at rates similar to viral proton channels, and they are at least 106-fold more selective for H+ over Na+. These studies inform the mechanisms of biological proton conduction and the principles for engineering proton-conductive materials. Incorporating polar residues into hydrophobic protein channel pores facilitates selective proton transport. Now, classical and multiscale reactive molecular dynamics simulations of designed channels reveal dynamic water wires within the channel lumen that are proton conductive according to structural and functional validation. These results provide some guiding principles for biological and engineered proton conduction.},

  abstract     = {The formation of two-electron chemical bonds requires the alignment of spins. Hence, it is well established for gas-phase reactions that changing a molecule’s electronic spin state can dramatically alter its reactivity. For reactions occurring at surfaces, which are of great interest during, among other processes, heterogeneous catalysis, there is an absence of definitive state-to-state experiments capable of observing spin conservation and therefore the role of electronic spin in surface chemistry remains controversial. Here we use an incoming/outgoing correlation ion imaging technique to perform scattering experiments for O(3P) and O(1D) atoms colliding with a graphite surface, in which the initial spin-state distribution is controlled and the final spin states determined. We demonstrate that O(1D) is more reactive with graphite than O(3P). We also identify electronically nonadiabatic pathways whereby incident O(1D) is quenched to O(3P), which departs from the surface. With the help of molecular dynamics simulations carried out on high-dimensional machine-learning-assisted first-principles potential energy surfaces, we obtain a mechanistic understanding for this system: spin-forbidden transitions do occur, but with low probabilities. Electronic spin influences chemistry profoundly, but its role in surface chemistry is poorly established. Now the spin-dependent reaction probabilities of oxygen atoms with a graphite surface have been studied. Molecular dynamics simulations help elucidate the mechanism for spin-flipping, which is observed to occur with low probability in surface scattering experiments.},

Here we report how a selection campaign employing a non-canonical peptide library containing cyclic γ2,4-amino acids resulted in the discovery of very potent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Two kinds of cyclic γ2,4-amino acids, cis-3-aminocyclobutane carboxylic acid (γ1) and (1R,3S)-3-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid (γ2), were ribosomally introduced into a library of thioether-macrocyclic peptides. One resultant potent Mpro inhibitor (half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 50 nM), GM4, comprising 13 residues with γ1 at the fourth position, manifests a 5.2 nM dissociation constant. An Mpro:GM4 complex crystal structure reveals the intact inhibitor spans the substrate binding cleft. The γ1 interacts with the S1′ catalytic subsite and contributes to a 12-fold increase in proteolytic stability compared to its alanine-substituted variant. Knowledge of interactions between GM4 and Mpro enabled production of a variant with a 5-fold increase in potency. In vitro screening of a ribosomally synthesized macrocyclic peptide library containing cyclic γ2,4-amino acids (cγAA) afforded the discovery of potent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). A co-crystal structure revealed the contribution of this cγAA to Mpro binding and the proteolytic stability of these macrocycles.},

  abstract     = {Direct and selective functionalization of hydrocarbon chains is a fundamental problem in synthetic chemistry. Conventional functionalization of C=C double bonds and C(sp3)–H bonds provides some solutions, but site diversity remains an issue. The merging of alkene isomerization with (oxidative) functionalization provides an ideal method for remote functionalization, which would provide more opportunities for site diversity. However, the reported functionalized sites are still limited and focus on a specific terminal position and internal site; new site-selective functionalization, including multi-functionalization, remains a largely unmet challenge. Here we describe a palladium-catalysed aerobic oxidative method for the multi-site programmable functionalization, involving the C=C double bond and multiple C(sp3)–H bonds, of terminal olefins via a strategy that controls the reaction sequence between alkene isomerization and oxidative functionalization. Specifically, 1-acetoxylation (anti-Markovnikov), 2-acetoxylation, 1,2-diacetoxylation and 1,2,3-triacetoxylation have been realized, accompanied by controllable remote alkenylation. This method enables available terminal olefins from petrochemical feedstocks to be readily converted into unsaturated alcohols and polyalcohols and particularly into different monosaccharides and C-glycosides. The diverse site-selective functionalization, including multi-functionalization, of C=C double bonds and C(sp3)–H bonds remains a largely unmet challenge. Now, a palladium-catalysed aerobic oxidative method has been developed for the multi-site programmable functionalization of terminal olefins via a strategy that controls the reaction sequence between alkene isomerization and oxidative functionalization.},

Green light activation leads to efficient tumour destruction due to the type I photodynamic effect generated by the self-assembled palladium complexes, as demonstrated in vitro by an up to 96-fold cytotoxicity increase upon irradiation. This work demonstrates that metallophilic interactions are well suited to generating stable supramolecular nanotherapeutics in vivo with exceptional tumour-targeting properties. The metallophilic interaction between cyclometalated palladium complexes can facilitate supramolecular nanostructure formation in living mice, providing a phototoxic prodrug with a long circulation time and high tumour-targeting efficiency.

In situ chirality identification and asymmetric synthesis are non-trivial tasks, especially for single-molecule systems. However, going beyond the chiral characterization of a large number of molecules (which inevitably leads to ensemble averaging) is crucial for elucidating the different properties induced by the chiral nature of the molecules. Here we report direct monitoring of chirality variations during a Michael addition followed by proton transfer and keto–enol tautomerism in a single molecule. Taking advantage of the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect, continuous current measurements through a single-molecule junction revealed in situ chirality variations during the reaction. Chirality identification at a high sensitivity level provides a promising tool for the study of symmetry-breaking reactions and sheds light on the origin of the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect itself. In situ chirality identification for single-molecule systems is not a straightforward task. Now, real-time chirality identification during a Michael addition reaction has been realized by continuous measurements of spin-polarized currents through a single-molecule junction, providing a promising method for studying symmetry-breaking reactions.},

Here we report that pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) and certain PylRS variants accept α-hydroxy, α-thio and N-formyl-l-α-amino acids, as well as α-carboxy acid monomers that are precursors to polyketide natural products. These monomers are accommodated and accepted by the translation apparatus in vitro; those with reactive nucleophiles are incorporated into proteins in vivo. High-resolution structural analysis of the complex formed between one PylRS enzyme and a m-substituted 2-benzylmalonic acid derivative revealed an active site that discriminates prochiral carboxylates and accommodates the large size and distinct electrostatics of an α-carboxy substituent. This work emphasizes the potential of PylRS-derived enzymes for acylating tRNA with monomers whose α-substituent diverges substantially from the α-amine of proteinogenic amino acids. These enzymes or derivatives thereof could synergize with natural or evolved ribosomes and/or translation factors to generate diverse sequence-defined non-protein heteropolymers. Ribosomal incorporation of non-α-amino acid monomers into proteins is largely restricted to in vitro translation. Now, pyrrolysyl-transfer RNA synthetase variants have been shown to acylate tRNAs with α-thio acids, malonic acids, and N-formyl amino acids. This work represents a key step towards the programmed ribosomal synthesis of sequence-defined non-protein polymers in cellulo.},

  abstract     = {Mutually orthogonal aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase/transfer RNA pairs provide a foundation for encoding non-canonical amino acids into proteins, and encoded non-canonical polymer and macrocycle synthesis. Here we discover quintuply orthogonal pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/pyrrolysyl-tRNA (tRNAPyl) pairs. We discover empirical sequence identity thresholds for mutual orthogonality and use these for agglomerative clustering of PylRS and tRNAPyl sequences; this defines numerous sequence clusters, spanning five classes of PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs (the existing classes +N, A and B, and newly defined classes C and S). Most of the PylRS clusters belong to classes that were unexplored for orthogonal pair generation. By testing pairs from distinct clusters and classes, and pyrrolysyl-tRNAs with unusual structures, we resolve 80% of the pairwise specificities required to make quintuply orthogonal PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs; we control the remaining specificities by engineering and directed evolution. Overall, we create 924 mutually orthogonal PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs, 1,324 triply orthogonal pairs, 128 quadruply orthogonal pairs and 8 quintuply orthogonal pairs. These advances may provide a key foundation for encoded polymer synthesis. Mutually orthogonal aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase/transfer RNA pairs are required for genetically encoding non-canonical amino acids into proteins, as well as for the encoded cellular synthesis of polymers and macrocycles; however, the scalable discovery of such pairs is challenging. A quintuply orthogonal set of pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/pyrrolysyl-tRNA pairs has now been generated through tRNA screening, engineering and directed evolution.},

  abstract     = {The surfaces of metal nanoclusters, including their interface with metal oxides, exhibit a high reactivity that is attractive for practical purposes. This high reactivity, however, has also hindered the synthesis of structurally well-defined hybrids of metal nanoclusters and metal oxides with exposed surfaces and/or interfaces. Here we report the sequential synthesis of structurally well-defined {Ag30} nanoclusters in the cavity of ring-shaped molecular metal oxides known as polyoxometalates. The {Ag30} nanoclusters possess exposed silver surfaces yet are stabilized both in solution and the solid state by the surrounding ring-shaped polyoxometalate species. The clusters underwent a redox-induced structural transformation without undesirable agglomeration or decomposition. Furthermore, {Ag30} nanoclusters showed high catalytic activity for the selective reduction of several organic functional groups using H2 under mild reaction conditions. We believe that these findings will serve for the discrete synthesis of surface-exposed metal nanoclusters stabilized by molecular metal oxides, which may in turn find applications in, for example, the fields of catalysis and energy conversion. Atomically precise metal nanoclusters can serve a variety of purposes, yet their high reactivity also makes them difficult to synthesize. Now, well-defined {Ag30} nanoclusters have been prepared within ring-shaped polyoxometalates. These nanoclusters show good stability in solution and the solid state, can undergo redox-induced structural transformation, and possess exposed surfaces that can serve as catalytically active sites.},

Here we report the use of near-infrared-activated small-molecule Pt(IV) photooxidants to directly oxidize intracellular biomolecules in an oxygen-independent manner, achieving controllable and effective elimination of cancer stem cells. These Pt(IV) complexes accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum and show low toxicity in the dark. Upon irradiation, the resultant metal-enhanced photooxidation effect causes them to robustly photooxidize survival-related biomolecules, induce intense oxidative stress, disrupt intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis and initiate nonclassical necrosis. In vivo experiments confirm that the lead photooxidant can effectively inhibit tumour growth, suppress metastasis and activate the immune system. Our study validates the concept of metal-enhanced photooxidation and the subsequent chemotherapeutic applications, supporting the development of such localized photooxidants to directly damage intracellular biomolecules and decrease pHi as a strategy for effective metal-based drugs. Conventional photo-driven cancer treatment agents require oxygen and visible light to induce cell death, limiting their efficacy in deep, oxygen-poor tumours. Now, a class of NIR-activatable Pt(IV) photooxidants that target the endoplasmic reticulum have been shown to effectively overcome these limitations by directly oxidizing intracellular biomolecules in an oxygen-independent fashion, presenting a promising new direction for next-generation metal-based drug development.},

Here we show the stepwise synthesis of block supramolecular polymers from metal–porphyrin derivatives (in which the metal centre is Zn, Cu or Ni) functionalized with fluorinated alkyl chains. These monomers first undergo a one-dimensional supramolecular polymerization and cyclization process to form a toroidal structure. Subsequently, successive secondary nucleation, elongation and cyclization steps result in two-dimensional assemblies with concentric toroidal morphologies. The site selectivity endowed by the fluorinated chains, reminiscent of regioselectivity in covalent synthesis, enables the precise control of the compositions and sequences of the supramolecular structures, as demonstrated by the synthesis of several triblock supramolecular terpolymers. Supramolecular structures are typically formed by the one-step self-assembly of building blocks. Now, a greater level of control has been achieved using stepwise non-covalent reactions under kinetic control. Two-dimensional block supramolecular polymers with tailored compositions and sequences were synthesized, and a site selectivity that is reminiscent of regioselectivity in covalent synthesis was observed.},

The Escherichia coli ribosome tolerates non-l-α-amino acids in vitro, but few structural insights that explain how are available, and the boundary conditions for efficient bond formation are so far unknown. Here we determine a high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the E. coli ribosome containing α-amino acid monomers and use metadynamics simulations to define energy surface minima and understand incorporation efficiencies. Reactive monomers across diverse structural classes favour a conformational space where the aminoacyl-tRNA nucleophile is &amp;lt;4 Å from the peptidyl-tRNA carbonyl with a Bürgi–Dunitz angle of 76–115°. Monomers with free energy minima that fall outside this conformational space do not react efficiently. This insight should accelerate the in vivo and in vitro ribosomal synthesis of sequence-defined, non-peptide heterooligomers. Genetic code expansion to incorporate non-α-amino acid monomers is limited by predictability of monomer reactivities in the context of the ribosome. Now the use of metadynamics simulations of pre-attack monomers in the ribosomal peptidyl transferase centre provides insight on whether an A-site monomer is likely to be reactive.},

As well as holding fundamental interest, molecular clathrates serve practical purposes, such as for gas storage, and their colloidal counterparts also appear promising for host–guest applications. Here using Monte Carlo simulations, we report the entropy-driven self-assembly of hard truncated triangular bipyramids into seven different host–guest colloidal clathrate crystals with unit cells ranging from 84 to 364 particles. The structures consist of cages that are either empty or occupied by guest particles, which can be different from or identical to the host particles. The simulations point to crystallization occurring through the compartmentalization of entropy between low- and high-entropy subsystems for the host and the guest particles, respectively. We use entropic bonding theory to design host–guest colloidal clathrates with explicit interparticle attraction, providing a route to realize such systems in the laboratory. Clathrates—open crystals with a hierarchy of polyhedral cages—are mostly found in atomic and molecular systems. Now, it has been shown through Monte Carlo simulations that the formation of colloidal host–guest clathrates can be driven by entropy alone, through entropy compartmentalization.},

  abstract     = {The three-dimensional structure of carbohelicenes has fascinated generations of molecular chemists and has been exploited in a wide range of applications. Their strong circularly polarized luminescence has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to promising applications in new optical materials. Although the enantioselective synthesis of fused carbo- and heterohelicenes has been achieved, a direct catalytic enantioselective method allowing the synthesis of lower, non-fused carbo[n]helicenes (n = 4–6) is still lacking. We report here that Pd-catalysed enantioselective C–H arylation in the presence of a unique bifunctional phosphine-carboxylate ligand provides a simple and general access to these lower carbo[n]helicenes. Computational mechanistic studies indicate that both the C–H activation and reductive elimination steps contribute to the overall enantioselectivity. The observed enantio-induction seems to arise from a combination of non-covalent interactions and steric repulsion between the substrate and ligand during the two key reductive elimination steps. The photophysical and chiroptical properties of the synthesized scalemic [n]helicenes have been systematically studied. A simple and general enantioselective method for the synthesis of non-fused lower carbo[n]helicenes (n = 4–6) is reported. The helicene scaffold is constructed with high enantioselectivity by Pd0-catalysed C–H arylation with aryl bromides. A bifunctional ligand provides a precise chiral environment that allows fine control of the enantioselectivity.},

Regioselectivity, however, remains a formidable challenge in the functionalization of internal alkenes. Here we report a palladium-catalysed highly regio- and enantioselective remote 1,n-dioxygenation (n ≥ 4) of internal alkenes with engineered pyridine-oxazoline (Pyox) ligands. The reactions proceed efficiently and exhibit a broad substrate scope with excellent regio- and enantioselectivity, affording optically pure 1,n-diol acetates as the key synthons for important bioactive molecules. Experimental studies and density functional theory calculations provide evidence that the regioselectivity is governed by the reactivity disparity of two allylic C–H bonds, where the oxypalladation is reversible and the first palladium migration step proves to be the regioselectivity-determining step, enabled by the modified phenyl-substituted Pyox ligands. Functionalization of unsymmetrical internal alkenes usually takes place with low regioselectivity, giving a mixture of isomers. Now, a highly regio- and enantioselective remote 1,n-dioxygenation of internal alkenes using a palladium catalyst has been developed for the synthesis of chiral 1,n-diols. Regioselectivity tuning was demonstrated by altering the rate-determining step, enabled by the phenyl-substituted Pyox ligand.},

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are biodegradable substitutes for polyolefins, but their high cost and thermal instability are impediments to their widespread application. Here we report a series of methylated polyhydroxybutyrates, poly(3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate)s, which are structurally inspired by natural PHAs. The cis homopolymers exhibit tacticity-independent crystallinity, which allows for the discovery of high-melting, thermally stable and mechanically tough copolymers, and a full range of polyolefin-like properties can be further achieved by tailoring the cis/trans ratio of the repeating units. Moreover, these materials can be synthesized from inexpensive carbon monoxide and 2-butene feedstocks, and they can be chemically recycled or upcycled at their end of life. The versatile properties, abundant feedstocks and end-of-life utility of this family of polyesters will enable a powerful platform for the discovery of sustainable alternatives to polyolefin plastics. Polyhydroxyalkanoates are potential substitutes for non-degradable polyolefin plastics. Now, it has been shown that structurally related methylated polyhydroxybutyrates, synthesized from carbon monoxide and 2-butenes, can provide a full suite of polyolefin-like polymers. These materials can be recycled or upcycled, and their properties can be easily tuned by varying the cis/trans ratio of the starting materials.},

  abstract     = {Continuous-rotation 3D electron diffraction methods are increasingly popular for the structure analysis of very small organic molecular crystals and crystalline inorganic materials. Dynamical diffraction effects cause non-linear deviations from kinematical intensities that present issues in structure analysis. Here, a method for structure analysis of continuous-rotation 3D electron diffraction data is presented that takes multiple scattering effects into account. Dynamical and kinematical refinements of 12 compounds—ranging from small organic compounds to metal–organic frameworks to inorganic materials—are compared, for which the new approach yields significantly improved models in terms of accuracy and reliability with up to fourfold reduction of the noise level in difference Fourier maps. The intrinsic sensitivity of dynamical diffraction to the absolute structure is also used to assign the handedness of 58 crystals of 9 different chiral compounds, showing that 3D electron diffraction is a reliable tool for the routine determination of absolute structures. Continuous-rotation 3D electron diffraction is a powerful technique to determine structures from nanocrystals. A data treatment method that takes into account dynamical diffraction effects has now been shown to lead to more accurate structure models, better sensitivity to weak signals and a reliable determination of absolute configuration—even for materials containing only light atoms.},

Here we report a strategy to produce single-crystal imine-linked COFs in aqueous solutions under ambient conditions using amphiphilic amino-acid derivatives with long hydrophobic chains. We propose that these amphiphilic molecules self-assemble into micelles that serve as dynamic barriers to separate monomers in aqueous solution (nodes) and hydrophobic compartments of the micelles (linkers), thereby regulating the polymerization and crystallization processes. Disordered polyimines were obtained in the micelle, which were then converted into crystals in a step-by-step fashion. Five different three-dimensional COFs and a two-dimensional COF were obtained as single crystals on the gram scale, with yields of 92% and above. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have remained difficult to grow as single crystals. Now, amphiphilic amino-acid derivatives that assemble in micelles in aqueous solutions have been shown to promote the growth of a variety of imine-bridged COFs into single crystals, in a step-by-step fashion, within their hydrophobic compartment.},

Here we demonstrate an emulsion-oriented assembly approach for the fabrication of highly uniform Janus double-spherical MSN&amp;amp;mPDA (MSN, mesoporous silica nanoparticle; mPDA, mesoporous polydopamine) nanoparticles. The delicate Janus nanoparticle possesses a spherical MSN with a diameter of ~150 nm and an mPDA hemisphere with a diameter of ~120 nm. In addition, the mesopore size in the MSN compartment is tunable from ~3 to ~25 nm, while those in the mPDA compartments range from ~5 to ~50 nm. Due to the different chemical properties and mesopore sizes in the two compartments, we achieve selective loading of guests in different compartments, and successfully establish single-particle-level biological logic gates. The dual-mesoporous structure enables consecutive valve-opening and matter-releasing reactions within one single nanoparticle, facilitating the design of single-particle-level logic systems. Large biomolecules cannot be loaded into conventional Janus nanoparticles with small mesopores, preventing the establishment of efficient logic-gate systems in single Janus nanoparticles.

The recently developed living crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) method has emerged as a promising route to one-dimensional (1D) and 2D core–shell micellar assemblies by seeded growth of polymeric and molecular amphiphiles. However, the general limitation of the epitaxial growth process to a single core-forming chemistry is an important obstacle to the creation of complex nanoparticles with segmented cores of spatially varied composition that can be subsequently exploited in selective transformations or responses to external stimuli. Here we report the successful use of a seeded growth approach that operates for a variety of different crystallizable polylactone homopolymer/block copolymer blend combinations to access 2D platelet micelles with compositionally distinct segmented cores. To illustrate the utility of controlling internal core chemistry, we demonstrate spatially selective hydrolytic degradation of the 2D platelets—a result that may be of interest for the design of complex stimuli-responsive particles for programmed-release and cargo-delivery applications. The synthesis of two-dimensional nanostructures with controlled dimensions from polymeric precursors remains challenging.

Here we report a modular platform for the construction of planar chirality in 1,3-disubstituted ferrocenes/ruthenocenes via an enantioselective relay remote C–H activation strategy. This method demonstrates a mechanism for remote enantiocontrol via enantiodetermining initial C‒H activation at the C2 position, enabled by a chiral mono-N-protected natural amino-acid ligand, and subsequent relay to the remote C3 position by a bridgehead-substituted norbornene mediator. A wide variety of 1,3-disubstituted planar chiral metallocenes are prepared with high enantioselectivity (96‒99% e.e.). The reaction shows good functional-group tolerance and high step-economy, and aryl iodides/bromides are compatible as coupling partners. The resulting metallocenes can be readily derivatized to yield planar chiral ligands and catalysts for asymmetric catalysis as well as building blocks for other applications. Methods for the direct construction of 1,3-disubstituted planar chiral ferrocenes are elusive. Now, a modular platform enables the construction of planar chirality in 1,3-disubstituted ferrocenes/ruthenocenes via enantioselective relay remote C–H arylation.

Harnessing unique abilities to capture weak and transient DNA–protein interactions, we demonstrate that LIKE-XL enables the discovery of low-affinity transcription-factor/DNA interactions via sequence-specific DNA baits, determining the binding sites for transcription factors that have been previously unknown. More importantly, we successfully decipher the dynamics of the transcription factor subproteome in response to drug treatment in a time-resolved manner, and find downstream target transcription factors from drug perturbations, providing insight into their dynamic transcriptional networks. The LIKE-XL strategy offers a complementary method to expand the DNA–protein profiling toolbox and map accurate DNA–protein interactomes that were previously inaccessible via non-covalent strategies, for better understanding of protein function in health and disease. Precise analysis of DNA–protein interactions can help to better understand various biological processes.

  abstract     = {Increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere is a problem that must be urgently resolved if the rise in current global temperatures is to be slowed. Chemically reducing CO2 into compounds that are useful as energy sources and carbon-based materials could be helpful in this regard. However, for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to be operational on a global scale, the catalyst system must: use only renewable energy, be built from abundantly available elements and not require high-energy reactants. Although light is an attractive renewable energy source, most existing CO2RR methods use electricity and many of the catalysts used are based on rare heavy metals. Here we present a transition-metal-free catalyst system that uses an organohydride catalyst based on benzimidazoline for the CO2RR that can be regenerated using a carbazole photosensitizer and visible light. The system is capable of producing formate with a turnover number exceeding 8,000 and generates no other reduced products (such as H2 and CO). Photochemical reduction of CO2 is a significant challenge and many existing methods use catalysts containing rare metals. Now a metal-free version of this reaction—with high selectivity for formate generation over H2 or CO—has been achieved that features a combination of carbazole photosensitizer and organohydride catalyst.},

  abstract     = {Melanins are ubiquitous biopolymers produced from phenols and catechols by oxidation. They provide photoprotection, pigmentation and redox activity to most life forms, and inspire synthetic materials with desirable optical, electronic and mechanical properties. The chemical structures of melanins remain elusive, however, creating uncertainty about their roles, and preventing the design of synthetic mimics with tailored properties. Indole-5,6-quinone (IQ) has been implicated as a biosynthetic intermediate and structural subunit of mammalian eumelanin pigments, but its instability has prevented its isolation and unambiguous characterization. Here we use steric shielding to stabilize IQ and show that ‘blocked’ derivatives exhibit eumelanin’s characteristic ultrafast nonradiative decay and its ability to absorb light from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. These new compounds are also redox-active and a source of paramagnetism, emulating eumelanin’s unique electronic properties, which include persistent radicals. Blocked IQs are atomistically precise and tailorable molecules that can offer a bottom–up understanding of emergent properties in eumelanin and have the potential to advance the rational design of melanin-inspired materials. Indole-5,6-quinone (IQ) is a long-sought intermediate and structural subunit of eumelanin pigments whose instability has precluded isolation and characterization. It has now been shown that a sterically shielded derivative of IQ exhibits hallmark eumelanin properties, including near-infrared absorption, ultrafast nonradiative decay and a persistent semiquinone radical formed by comproportionation.},

  abstract     = {Catenanes—molecules comprising two interlocking rings held together like links in a chain—are topologically non-trivial: a catenane is a topological isomer of its separated rings, but the rings cannot be disconnected without bond scission. Catenanes can exist as topological enantiomers if both rings have directionality conferred by a defined atom sequence, but this has led to the assumption that the stereochemistry of chiral catenanes composed of oriented rings is inherently topological in nature. Here we show that this assumption is incorrect by synthesizing an example that contains the same fundamental stereogenic unit but whose stereochemistry is Euclidean. One ring in this chiral catenane is oriented by the geometry of an exocyclic double rather than determined by atom sequence within the ring. Isomerization of the exocyclic double bond results in racemization of the catenane, confirming that the stereochemistry is not topological in nature. Thus, we can unite the stereochemistry of catenanes with that of their topologically trivial cousins, the rotaxanes, enabling a more unified approach to their discussion. Catenanes are topologically non-trivial and, perhaps for this reason, molecules composed of two oriented rings have always simply been referred to as ‘topologically chiral’. Now it has been shown that the same stereogenic unit can arise in systems whose stereochemistry is Euclidean, suggesting a need to rethink this fundamental form of mechanical chirality.},

  abstract     = {Aptamers are being applied as affinity reagents in analytical applications owing to their high stability, compact size and amenability to chemical modification. Generating aptamers with different binding affinities is desirable, but systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), the standard for aptamer generation, is unable to quantitatively produce aptamers with desired binding affinities and requires multiple rounds of selection to eliminate false-positive hits. Here we introduce Pro-SELEX, an approach for the rapid discovery of aptamers with precisely defined binding affinities that combines efficient particle display, high-performance microfluidic sorting and high-content bioinformatics. Using the Pro-SELEX workflow, we were able to investigate the binding performance of individual aptamer candidates under different selective pressures in a single round of selection. Using human myeloperoxidase as a target, we demonstrate that aptamers with dissociation constants spanning a 20-fold range of affinities can be identified within one round of Pro-SELEX. Generating aptamers for use as affinity reagents in analytical applications is important, but SELEX, the standard method for aptamer generation, is unable to select for pre-defined binding affinities. Now, by combining efficient particle display, high-performance microfluidic sorting and high-content bioinformatics, the method ‘Pro-SELEX’ can afford the quantitative generation of aptamers with programmable binding affinities.},

  abstract     = {The venerable 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition has been widely used in organic synthesis for the construction of various heterocycles. However, in its century-long history, the simple and omnipresent aromatic phenyl ring has remained a stubbornly unreactive dipolarophile. Here we report 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between aromatic groups and diazoalkenes, generated in situ from lithium acetylides and N-sulfonyl azides. The reaction results in densely functionalized annulated cyclic sulfonamide-indazoles that can be further converted into stable organic molecules that are important in organic synthesis. The involvement of aromatic groups in the 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions broadens the synthetic utility of diazoalkenes, a family of dipoles that have been little explored so far and are otherwise difficult to access. The process described here provides a route for the synthesis of medicinally relevant heterocycles and can be extended to other arene-containing starting materials. Computational examination of the proposed reaction pathway revealed a series of finely orchestrated bond-breaking and bond-forming events that ultimately lead to the annulated products. 1,3-Dipolar cycloadditions are well-known transformations in organic synthesis. However, the reactivity of benzene rings in these processes is underexplored. In situ-generated diazoalkenes have now been shown to undergo intramolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions with aromatic rings. The transformation results in an unaromatized benzene ring that enables the synthesis of functionalized heterocycles.},

  abstract     = {The development of hyperpolarized bioresponsive probes for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications is an emerging and rapidly growing topic in chemistry. A wide range of hyperpolarized molecular biosensors for functional MRI have been developed in recent years. These probes comprise many different types of small-molecule reporters that can be hyperpolarized using dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization and parahydrogen-induced polarization or xenon-chelated macromolecular conjugates hyperpolarized using spin-exchange optical pumping. In this Perspective, we discuss how the amplified magnetic resonance signals of these agents are responsive to biologically relevant stimuli such as target proteins, reactive oxygen species, pH or metal ions. We examine how functional MRI using these systems allows a great number of biological processes to be monitored rapidly. Consequently, hyperpolarized bioresponsive probes may play a critical role in functional molecular imaging for observing physiology and pathology in real time. Bioresponsive hyperpolarized probes contain magnetic resonance signals that can be many orders of magnitude larger than those of common, thermally polarized probes. This Perspective discusses how bioresponsive hyperpolarized probes can be directly linked to biological events to give functional information, enabling the mapping of physiological processes and diseases in real time using magnetic resonance.},

The resulting net negative charge, however, often renders these fluorophores cell-membrane-impermeant. Here we report the design and development of our biologically compatible, water-soluble and cell-membrane-permeable fluorophores, termed OregonFluor (ORFluor). By adapting previously established ratiometric imaging methodology using bio-affinity agents, it is now possible to use small-molecule ORFluor-labelled therapeutic inhibitors to quantitatively visualize their intracellular distribution and protein target-specific binding, providing a chemical toolkit for quantifying drug target availability in live cells and tissues. Water-soluble, cell-permeable, inert fluorescent tags called OregonFluors have been developed to withstand environmental changes while resistant towards non-specific binding with subcellular structures.

  abstract     = {The actinides, from californium to nobelium (Z = 98–102), are known to have an accessible +2 oxidation state. Understanding the origin of this chemical behaviour requires characterizing CfII materials, but investigations are hampered by the fact that they have remained difficult to isolate. This partly arises from the intrinsic challenges of manipulating this unstable element, as well as a lack of suitable reductants that do not reduce CfIII to Cf°. Here we show that a CfII crown–ether complex, Cf(18-crown-6)I2, can be prepared using an Al/Hg amalgam as a reductant. Spectroscopic evidence shows that CfIII can be quantitatively reduced to CfII, and rapid radiolytic re-oxidation in solution yields co-crystallized mixtures of CfII and CfIII complexes without the Al/Hg amalgam. Quantum-chemical calculations show that the Cf‒ligand interactions are highly ionic and that 5f/6d mixing is absent, resulting in weak 5f→5f transitions and an absorption spectrum dominated by 5f→6d transitions. Californium is difficult to prepare in its divalent state. Now, crystals of a Cf(II) crown–ether complex have been synthesized by reduction of a Cf(III) precursor with an Al/Hg amalgam. They exhibit 5f→6d transitions in the visible region and near-infrared emission that are highly sensitive to changes in the coordination environment.},

  abstract     = {Molecules that contain a stereogenic phosphorus atom are crucial to medicine, agrochemistry and catalysis. While methods are available for the selective construction of various chiral organophosphorus compounds, catalytic enantioselective approaches for their synthesis are far less common. Given the vastness of possible substituent combinations around a phosphorus atom, protocols for their preparation should also be divergent, providing facile access not only to one but to many classes of phosphorus compounds. Here we introduce a catalytic and enantioselective strategy for the preparation of an enantioenriched phosphorus(V) centre that can be diversified enantiospecifically to a wide range of biologically relevant phosphorus(V) compounds. The process, which involves an enantioselective nucleophilic substitution catalysed by a superbasic bifunctional iminophosphorane catalyst, can accommodate a wide range of carbon substituents at phosphorus. The resulting stable, yet versatile, synthetic intermediates can be combined with a multitude of medicinally relevant O-, N- and S-based nucleophiles. Catalytic enantioselective approaches to access chiral organophosphorus compounds are rare. A two-stage catalytic strategy for the synthesis of diverse enantioenriched P(V) compounds has now been developed: a bifunctional iminophosphorane superbase enables enantioselective nucleophilic desymmetrization, followed by downstream enantiospecific diversification of the resulting intermediate by substitution with medicinally relevant O-, N- and S-based nucleophiles.},

  abstract     = {The conversion of carbon dioxide to value-added products using renewable electricity would potentially help to address current climate concerns. The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to propylene, a critical feedstock, requires multiple C–C coupling steps with the transfer of 18 electrons per propylene molecule, and hence is kinetically sluggish. Here we present the electrosynthesis of propylene from carbon dioxide on copper nanocrystals with a peak geometric current density of −5.5 mA cm−2. The metallic copper nanocrystals formed from CuCl precursor present preponderant Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets, likely to favour the adsorption of key *C1 and *C2 intermediates. Strikingly, the production rate of propylene drops substantially when carbon monoxide is used as the reactant. From the electrochemical reduction of isotope-labelled carbon dioxide mixed with carbon monoxide, we infer that the key step for propylene formation is probably the coupling between adsorbed/molecular carbon dioxide or carboxyl with the *C2 intermediates that are involved in the ethylene pathway. The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to propylene requires multiple C–C coupling steps and the transfer of 18 electrons, posing kinetic and thermodynamic barriers. Now the electrosynthesis of propylene from carbon dioxide using copper nanocrystals has been demonstrated, with analysis revealing that the key step for its formation is probably the coupling between carbon dioxide or carboxyl with intermediates involved in the ethylene pathway.},

  abstract     = {Proteins provide essential functional regulation of many bioprocesses across all scales of life; however, new techniques to specifically modulate protein activity within living systems and in engineered biomaterials are needed to better interrogate fundamental cell signalling and guide advanced decisions of biological fate. Here we establish a generalizable strategy to rapidly and irreversibly activate protein function with full spatiotemporal control. Through the development of a genetically encoded and light-activated SpyLigation (LASL), bioactive proteins can be stably reassembled from non-functional split fragment pairs following brief exposure (typically minutes) to cytocompatible light. Employing readily accessible photolithographic processing techniques to specify when, where and how much photoligation occurs, we demonstrate precise protein activation of UnaG, NanoLuc and Cre recombinase using LASL in solution, biomaterials and living mammalian cells, as well as optical control over protein subcellular localization. Looking forward, we expect that these photoclick-based optogenetic approaches will find tremendous utility in probing and directing complex cellular fates in both time and three-dimensional space. Techniques to specifically modulate protein activity are needed to interrogate spatial effects in cellular processes. A genetically encoded method for site-specific protein–protein conjugation based on a photoclick chemical reaction has now been developed. This method permits rapid and irreversible reassembly of bioactive proteins from non-functional split fragment pairs with full spatiotemporal control in solution, biomaterials and living mammalian cells.},

This reaction is highly selective for the formation of bridgehead boronic esters and is compatible with a broad range of functional groups (&amp;gt;35 examples). The method is applicable to the late-stage modification of pharmaceuticals containing this substructure and the synthesis of novel bicyclic building blocks. Kinetic and computational studies suggest that C–H bond cleavage occurs with a modest barrier and that the turnover-limiting step of this reaction is an isomerization that occurs prior to reductive elimination that forms the C–B bond. Borylated bicyclopentanes and bicyclohexanes are valuable compounds in drug research but are difficult to prepare. Now, an iridium-catalysed method has been developed for the borylation of the bridgehead tertiary C–H bonds in bicyclopentanes and bicyclohexanes, providing access to a variety of highly decorated bicyclic cores.},

Here we report that the gradual widening of parallel microchannels on a surface of a slowly subliming hexachlorobenzene crystal can promote the autonomous and bidirectional transduction of condensed aerial water. Driven by topology changes on the surface of the crystal and water exchange with the gas phase, droplets of condensed water migrate over the crystal. These droplets are also able to transport silver particles and other particulate matter, such as dust. The velocity of the particles was shown to be dependent on both the sublimation rate of the crystal and the relative humidity of its environment. This example of a sublimation-powered water flow demonstrates that topological surface changes accompanying crystal phase transitions can be harnessed to transport liquid and solid matter over surfaces. Crystals of hexachlorobenzene have now been shown to support the autonomous motion of water and particulate matter over their surface. Parallel microchannels present at the surface of the crystal gradually widen by sublimation, propelling droplets of condensed ambient water that can also transport microscopic amounts of material such as silver microparticles.},

  abstract     = {Organosilanes are of vital importance for modern human society, having found widespread applications in functional materials, organic synthesis, drug discovery and life sciences. However, their preparation remains far from trivial, and on-demand synthesis of heteroleptic substituted silicon reagents is a formidable challenge. The generation of silyl radicals from hydrosilanes via direct hydrogen-atom-transfer (HAT) photocatalysis represents the most atom-, step-, redox- and catalyst-economic pathway for the activation of hydrosilanes. Here, in view of the green characteristics of neutral eosin Y (such as its abundance, low cost, metal-free nature, absorption of visible light and excellent selectivity), we show that using it as a direct HAT photocatalyst enables the stepwise custom functionalization of multihydrosilanes, giving access to fully substituted silicon compounds. By exploiting this strategy, we realize preferable hydrogen abstraction of Si–H bonds in the presence of active C–H bonds, diverse functionalization of hydrosilanes (for example, alkylation, vinylation, allylation, arylation, deuteration, oxidation and halogenation), and remarkably selective monofunctionalization of di- and trihydrosilanes. The controlled functionalization of multihydrosilanes is challenging. Now, using a hydrogen-atom-transfer photocatalyst based on neutral eosin Y, a method for the diverse functionalization of hydrosilanes has been developed, enabling the stepwise on-demand decoration of silicon atoms. This approach is distinguished by its atom-, step-, redox- and catalyst-economy, metal-free nature, its versatility (&amp;gt;150 examples), modularity, selectivity and scalability.},

A persistent obstacle towards this goal has been that the 57Fe-based spectroscopic data—although rich with information—combines responses from all seven Fe sites, and it has therefore not been possible to map individual spectroscopic responses to specific sites in the three-dimensional structure. Here we have addressed this challenge by incorporating 57Fe into a single site of FeMo-co. Spectroscopic analysis of the resting state informed on the local electronic structure of the terminal Fe1 site, including its oxidation state and spin orientation, and, in turn, on the spin-coupling scheme for the entire cluster. The oxidized resting state and the first intermediate in nitrogen fixation were also characterized, and comparisons with the resting state provided molecular-level insights into the redox chemistry of FeMo-co. The molybdenum nitrogenase catalytic cofactor is composed of seven high-spin Fe sites making it difficult to study spectroscopically. Now it has been shown that 57Fe can be incorporated into a single site and that such site-selectively labelled samples provide insights into the cofactor’s electronic structure and the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation.},

As a convergent method, the synthesis of stereoenriched β-amino amides through the asymmetric Mannich reaction requires specialized amide substrates or a metal catalyst for enolate formation. By a redesign of the Ugi reaction, a conceptually different solution to prepare chiral β-amino amides was established using ambiphilic ynamides as two-carbon synthons. The modulation of ynamides or oxygen nucleophiles concisely furnished three classes of β-amino amides with generally good efficiency as well as excellent chemo- and stereo-control. The utility is verified in the preparation of over 100 desired products that bear one or two contiguous carbon stereocentres, including those that directly incorporate drug molecules. This advance also provides a synthetic shortcut to other valuable structures. The amino amides could be elaborated into β-amino acids, anti-vicinal diamines, γ-amino alcohols and β-lactams or undergo transamidation with amino acids and amine-containing pharmaceuticals. β-Amino acids are broadly found in biomimetic drugs and therapeutics, but the general synthesis of chiral β-amino amides remains limited. An organocatalytic four-component reaction has now been developed for their asymmetric synthesis with notable efficiency, chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity. This protocol shows broad product scope and provides a shortcut to other important structures.},

Here we present the synthesis of this species, realized in the high-pressure potassium nitrogen compound K9N56 formed at high pressures (46 and 61 GPa) and high temperature (estimated to be above 2,000 K) by direct reaction between nitrogen and KN3 in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. The complex structure of K9N56—composed of 520 atoms per unit cell—was solved based on synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction and corroborated by density functional theory calculations. The observed hexazine anion [N6]4− is planar and proposed to be aromatic. Aromatic polynitrogen units can display both high stability and high energy content. A hexazine anion has now been identified in a complex compound, K9N56, which is formed at high pressures and temperatures under laser-heating in a diamond anvil cell.

Spectroscopic, crystallographic and computational studies provide insight into the nature of the Sb=O/Sb+–O− bond. Moreover, isolation of Dipp3SbO allows the chemistry of the stiboryl group to be explored. Here we show that Dipp3SbO can act as a Brønsted base, a hydrogen-bond acceptor and a transition-metal ligand, in addition engaging in 1,2-addition, O-for-F2 exchange and O-atom transfer. In all cases, the reactivity of Dipp3SbO differed from that of the lighter congeners Dipp3AsO and Dipp3PO. In contrast to phosphine and arsine oxides, stibine oxides have been challenging to isolate in monomeric forms as they tend to polymerize.

Unlike previous dodecagonal quasicrystals based on random tiling, a honeycomb structure based on a strictly quasiperiodic tessellation of tiles is observed. The structure consists of dodecagonal clusters made up of triangular, square and trapezoidal cells that are optimal for local packing. To maximize the presence of such dodecagonal clusters, the system abandons periodicity but adopts a quasiperiodic structure that follows strict packing rules. The stability of random-tiling dodecagonal quasicrystals is often attributed to the entropy of disordering when strict tiling rules are broken, at the sacrifice of the long-range positional order. However, our results demonstrate that quasicrystal stability may rest on energy minimization alone, or with only minimal entropic intervention. Quasicrystals are intriguing structures that exhibit long-range positional correlations but no periodicity in real space. Now, T-shaped amphiphilic molecules featuring rigid cores have been found to self-assemble into a columnar liquid quasicrystal with dodecagonal symmetry. The honeycomb structure observed arises from a strictly quasiperiodic tessellation of square, triangular and trapezoidal tiles, rather than from random tiling.},

  abstract     = {Stereogenic sp3-hybridized carbon centres are fundamental building blocks of chiral molecules. Unlike dynamic stereogenic motifs, such as sp3-nitrogen centres or atropisomeric biaryls, sp3-carbon centres are usually fixed, requiring intermolecular reactions to undergo configurational changes. Here we report the internal enantiomerization of fluxional carbon cages and the consequences of their adaptive configurations for the transmission of stereochemical information. The sp3-carbon stereochemistry of the rigid tricyclic cages is inverted through strain-assisted Cope rearrangements, emulating the low-barrier configurational dynamics typical for sp3-nitrogen inversion or conformational isomerism. This dynamic enantiomerization can be stopped, restarted or slowed by external reagents, while the configuration of the cage is controlled by neighbouring, fixed stereogenic centres. As part of a phosphoramidite–olefin ligand, the fluxional cage acts as a conduit to transmit stereochemical information from the ligand while also transferring its dynamic properties to chiral-at-metal coordination environments, influencing catalysis, ion pairing and ligand exchange energetics. Stereogenic sp3-hybridized carbon centres are the principal building blocks of chiral organic molecules. Usually, these centres are configurationally fixed. Now, low-energy pericyclic rearrangements have been used to create rigid cage molecules with fluxional sp3-stereochemistry, influencing chiral information transfer. The sp3-carbon stereochemistry of the cages is inverted through strain-assisted Cope rearrangements.},

  abstract     = {The development of miniaturized electronics has led to the design and construction of powerful experimental platforms capable of measuring electronic properties to the level of single molecules, along with new theoretical concepts to aid in the interpretation of the data. A new area of activity is now emerging concerned with repurposing the tools of molecular electronics for applications in chemical and biological analysis. Single-molecule junction techniques, such as the scanning tunnelling microscope break junction and related single-molecule circuit approaches have a remarkable capacity to transduce chemical information from individual molecules, sampled in real time, to electrical signals. In this Review, we discuss single-molecule junction approaches as emerging analytical tools for the chemical and biological sciences. We demonstrate how these analytical techniques are being extended to systems capable of probing chemical reaction mechanisms. We also examine how molecular junctions enable the detection of RNA, DNA, and traces of proteins in solution with limits of detection at the zeptomole level. The ability to detect and quantify a given analyte at the molecular level is a long-lasting goal for analytical and bioanalytical chemistry. This Review highlights how single-molecule junctions (SMJs) have been used for analytical purposes, from the detection of isomers and reaction intermediates to the detection of proteins and nucleic acids. Different SMJ approaches are discussed, along with their advantages and limitations over bulk analytical techniques.},

Here we report a nanopore framework to quantitatively determine the effect of the hidden crosstalk between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on RAS. By developing an engineered aerolysin nanopore capable of single-amino-acid resolution, we show that the ACE can be selectively inhibited by ACE2 to prevent cleavage of angiotensin I, even when the concentration of ACE is more than 30-fold higher than that of ACE2. We also show that the activity of ACE2 for cleaving angiotensin peptides is clearly suppressed by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This leads to the relaxation of ACE and the increased probability of accumulation of the principal effector angiotensin II. The spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is demonstrated to have a much greater impact on the crosstalk than the wild type. A nanopore framework has been developed to reveal the crosstalk effect on the renin–angiotensin system. By reading the single-amino-acid differences in angiotensin peptides with high accuracy and high efficiency, the selective inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was revealed.

  abstract     = {A major challenge in developing recyclable polymeric materials is the inherent conflict between the properties required during and after their life span. In particular, materials must be strong and durable when in use, but undergo complete and rapid degradation, ideally under mild conditions, as they approach the end of their life span. We report a mechanism for degrading polymers called cyclization-triggered chain cleavage (CATCH cleavage) that achieves this duality. CATCH cleavage features a simple glycerol-based acyclic acetal unit as a kinetic and thermodynamic trap for gated chain shattering. Thus, an organic acid induces transient chain breaks with oxocarbenium ion formation and subsequent intramolecular cyclization to fully depolymerize the polymer backbone at room temperature. With minimal chemical modification, the resulting degradation products from a polyurethane elastomer can be repurposed into strong adhesives and photochromic coatings, demonstrating the potential for upcycling. The CATCH cleavage strategy for low-energy input breakdown and subsequent upcycling may be generalizable to a broader range of synthetic polymers and their end-of-life waste streams. Extensive crosslinking in thermosetting polymers provides their desirable durability but makes them difficult to recycle. Now acetal-based monomers containing nucleophilic pendant groups have been incorporated into polyurethanes, which are stable in aqueous acid yet degradable at room temperature under organic acidic conditions. The degradation products were upcycled into higher-value, long-lasting materials.},

This includes the intriguing alkaloids crocagins, which possess a tetracyclic core structure and whose biosynthesis has remained enigmatic. Here we use in vitro experiments to demonstrate that three proteins, CgnB, CgnC and CgnE, are sufficient for the production of the hallmark tetracyclic crocagin core from the precursor peptide CgnA. The crystal structures of the homologues CgnB and CgnE reveal them to be the founding members of a peptide-binding protein family and allow us to rationalize their distinct functions. We further show that the hydrolase CgnD liberates the crocagin core scaffold, which is subsequently N-methylated by CgnL. These insights allow us to propose a biosynthetic scheme for crocagins. Bioinformatic analyses based on these data led to the discovery of related biosynthetic pathways that may provide access to a structurally diverse family of peptide-derived pyrroloindoline alkaloids. The alkaloids crocagins are derived from a ribosomal peptide through a series of enzymatic post-translational modifications. A combination of biochemistry and structural biology techniques has now been used to elucidate this biosynthetic pathway, propose a mechanism for the formation of the tetracyclic core structure and enable genome mining for related natural products.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, a variety of cycloalkyl groups with quaternary carbons, in particular cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl trifluoromethyl groups, have emerged as promising bioisosteres in drug-like molecules. The modular installation of such bioisosteres remains challenging to synthetic chemists. Alkyl sulfinate reagents have been developed as radical precursors to prepare functionalized heterocycles with the desired alkyl bioisosteres. However, the innate (radical) reactivity of this transformation poses reactivity and regioselectivity challenges for the functionalization of any aromatic or heteroaromatic scaffold. Here we showcase the ability of alkyl sulfinates to engage in sulfurane-mediated C(sp3)–C(sp2) cross-coupling, thereby allowing for programmable and stereospecific installation of these alkyl bioisosteres. The ability of this method to simplify retrosynthetic analysis is exemplified by the improved synthesis of multiple medicinally relevant scaffolds. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations for the mechanism of this sulfur chemistry reveal a ligand-coupling trend under alkyl Grignard activation via the sulfurane intermediate, stabilized by solvation of tetrahydrofuran. Direct and stereospecific C(sp3)–C(sp2) cross-coupling reactions are highly desirable for the construction of complex molecular scaffolds. Now, using stable and easily accessible alkyl sulfinates as coupling reagents, a modular and programmable sulfurane-mediated coupling method has been developed for the installation of various hindered alkyl bioisosteres, such as trifluoromethyl cyclopropyl, to (hetero)aromatics.},

  abstract     = {Flexible metal–organic materials that exhibit stimulus-responsive switching between closed (non-porous) and open (porous) structures induced by gas molecules are of potential utility in gas storage and separation. Such behaviour is currently limited to a few dozen physisorbents that typically switch through a breathing mechanism requiring structural contortions. Here we show a clathrate (non-porous) coordination network that undergoes gas-induced switching between multiple non-porous phases through transient porosity, which involves the diffusion of guests between discrete voids through intra-network distortions. This material is synthesized as a clathrate phase with solvent-filled cavities; evacuation affords a single-crystal to single-crystal transformation to a phase with smaller cavities. At 298 K, carbon dioxide, acetylene, ethylene and ethane induce reversible switching between guest-free and gas-loaded clathrate phases. For carbon dioxide and acetylene at cryogenic temperatures, phases showing progressively higher loadings were observed and characterized using in situ X-ray diffraction, and the mechanism of diffusion was computationally elucidated. Sorbent materials that reversibly transform between closed (non-porous) and open (porous) phases on the uptake and release of guests are relevant to gas storage and separation applications. Now, a coordination network has been prepared that exhibits gas-induced transformations between multiple non-porous phases. This phenomenon is attributed to subtle structural rearrangements that enable transient porosity.},

  abstract     = {C(sp3)-rich bicyclic hydrocarbon scaffolds, as exemplified by bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes, play an increasingly high-profile role as saturated bioisosteres of benzenoids in medicinal chemistry and crop science. Substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) are emerging bicyclic hydrocarbon bioisosteres for ortho- and meta-substituted benzenes, but are difficult to access. Therefore, a general synthetic route to BCHs is needed if their potential as bioisosteres is to be realized. Here we describe a broadly applicable catalytic approach that delivers substituted BCHs by intermolecular coupling between olefins and bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl (BCB) ketones. The SmI2–catalysed process works for a wide range of electron-deficient alkenes and substituted BCB ketones, operates with SmI2 loadings as low as 5 mol% and is underpinned by a radical relay mechanism that is supported by density functional theory calculations. The product BCH ketones have been shown to be versatile synthetic intermediates through selective downstream manipulation and the expedient synthesis of a saturated hydrocarbon analogue of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial, phthalylsulfathiazole. Substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) are emerging bicyclic hydrocarbon bioisosteres for ortho- and meta-substituted benzenes, but are difficult to access. Now a SmI2-catalysed intermolecular coupling of bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl ketones and alkenes provides a general approach to access substituted BCHs, thus promoting their widespread use in medicinal chemistry and crop science.},

  abstract     = {The Diels–Alder cycloaddition is one of the most powerful approaches in organic synthesis and is often used in the synthesis of important pharmaceuticals. Yet, strictly controlling the stereoselectivity of the Diels–Alder reactions is challenging, and great efforts are needed to construct complex molecules with desired chirality via organocatalysis or transition-metal strategies. Nature has evolved different types of enzymes to exquisitely control cyclization stereochemistry; however, most of the reported Diels–Alderases have been shown to only facilitate the energetically favourable diastereoselective cycloadditions. Here we report the discovery and characterization of CtdP, a member of a new class of bifunctional oxidoreductase/Diels–Alderase, which was previously annotated as an NmrA-like transcriptional regulator. We demonstrate that CtdP catalyses the inherently disfavoured cycloaddition to form the bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane scaffold with a strict α-anti-selectivity. Guided by computational studies, we reveal a NADP+/NADPH-dependent redox mechanism for the CtdP-catalysed inverse electron demand Diels–Alder cycloaddition, which serves as the first example of a bifunctional Diels–Alderase that utilizes this mechanism. A Diels–Alderase that catalyses the inherently disfavoured cycloaddition and forms a bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane scaffold with a strict α-anti-selectivity has now been discovered. This Diels–Alderase, called CtdP, is an NmrA-like protein. Isotopic labelling, structural biology and computational studies reveal that the CtdP-catalysed Diels–Alder reaction involves a NADP+/NADPH-dependent redox mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The balance between strain relief and aromatic stabilization dictates the form and function of non-planar π-aromatics. Overcrowded systems are known to undergo geometric deformations, but the energetically favourable π-electron delocalization of their aromatic ring(s) is typically preserved. In this study we incremented the strain energy of an aromatic system beyond its aromatic stabilization energy, causing it to rearrange and its aromaticity to be ruptured. We noted that increasing the steric bulk around the periphery of π-extended tropylium rings leads them to deviate from planarity to form contorted conformations in which aromatic stabilization and strain are close in energy. Under increasing strain, the aromatic π-electron delocalization of the system is broken, leading to the formation of a non-aromatic, bicyclic analogue referred to as ‘Dewar tropylium’. The aromatic and non-aromatic isomers have been found to exist in rapid equilibrium with one another. This investigation demarcates the extent of steric deformation tolerated by an aromatic carbocycle and thus provides direct experimental insights into the fundamental nature of aromaticity. Stabilization from aromatic electron delocalization is highly favourable so it is typically preserved in even grossly distorted molecules. Now, peripheral overcrowding of an aromatic tropylium has been shown to cause sufficient geometric strain to rupture aromaticity, forming a non-aromatic bicyclic system that is in rapid equilibrium with its aromatic counterpart.},

  abstract     = {Stereochemistry can alter small-molecule pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy. However, it is unclear whether the stereochemistry of a single compound within a multicomponent colloid such as a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) can influence its activity in vivo. Here we report that LNPs containing stereopure 20α-hydroxycholesterol (20α) delivered mRNA to liver cells up to 3-fold more potently than LNPs containing a mixture of both 20α- and 20β-hydroxycholesterols (20mix). This effect was not driven by LNP physiochemical traits. Instead, in vivo single-cell RNA sequencing and imaging revealed that 20mix LNPs were sorted into phagocytic pathways more than 20α LNPs, resulting in key differences between LNP biodistribution and subsequent LNP functional delivery. These data are consistent with the fact that nanoparticle biodistribution is necessary, but not sufficient, for mRNA delivery, and that stereochemistry-dependent interactions between LNPs and target cells can improve mRNA delivery. Stereochemistry can affect the reactivity and transport properties of small molecules; however, it is unclear whether the stereochemistry of components in a lipid nanoparticle influences its activity in vivo. Now, it has been shown that lipid nanoparticles made with a stereopure component can increase delivery of mRNA. A biological mechanism driving the effect is also proposed.},

  abstract     = {Although they offer great potentials, the high reactivity and diverse pathways of radical chemistry pose difficult problems for applications in organic synthesis. In addition to the differentiation of multiple competing pathways, the control of various selectivities in radical reactions presents both formidable challenges and great opportunities. To regulate chemoselectivity and regioselectivity, as well as diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity, calls for the formulation of conceptually new approaches and fundamentally different governing principles. Here we show that Co(II)-based metalloradical catalysis enables the radical chemoselective intermolecular amination of allylic C−H bonds through the employment of modularly designed D2-symmetric chiral amidoporphyrins with a tunable pocket-like environment as the supporting ligand. The reaction exhibits a remarkable convergence of regioselectivity, diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity in a single catalytic operation. In addition to demonstrating the unique opportunities of metalloradical catalysis in controlling homolytic radical reactions, the Co(II)-catalysed convergent C–H amination offers a route to synthesize valuable chiral α-tertiary amines directly from an isomeric mixture of alkenes. Controlling various selectivities in radical reactions presents both formidable challenges and great opportunities. Now, Co(II)-based metalloradical catalysis has enabled the concurrent control of multiple convergences and selectivities in intermolecular radical allylic C−H amination. The reaction provides access to valuable chiral α-tertiary amines directly from an isomeric mixture of alkenes.},

Here we present the detailed characterization of the structure of an organic molecule, rhodamine-6G, determined at a resolution of 0.82 Å by an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). Direct comparison of this structure with that obtained by electron crystallography from the same sample batch of microcrystals shows that both methods can accurately distinguish the position of some of the hydrogen atoms, depending on the type of chemical bond in which they are involved. Variations in the distances measured by XFEL and electron diffraction reflect the expected differences in X-ray and electron scatterings. The reliability for atomic coordinates was found to be better with XFEL, but the electron beam showed a higher sensitivity to charges. The structural analysis of small crystals has remained challenging. Now, the structure of a small organic molecule, rhodamine-6G, has been resolved from microcrystals using an X-ray free-electron laser and electron diffraction. The former showed better reliability for atomic coordinates, whereas the latter was more sensitive to charges; both techniques accurately determined the position of hydrogen atoms.},

Yet, the size and quantity of many crystalline phases are too small for routine X-ray diffraction analysis. This has become a workflow bottleneck in materials development, especially in high-throughput synthesis screening. Here we demonstrate the application of serial rotation electron diffraction (SerialRED) for high-throughput phase identification of complex polycrystalline zeolite products. The products were prepared from a combination of multiple framework T atoms ([Si,Ge,Al] or [Si,Ge,B]) and a simple organic structure-directing agent. We show that using SerialRED, five zeolite phases can be identified from a highly complex mixture. This includes phases with ultra-low contents undetectable using X-ray diffraction and phases with identical crystal morphology and similar unit cell parameters. By automatically and rapidly examining hundreds of crystals, SerialRED enables high-throughput phase analysis and allows the exploration of complex synthesis systems. It provides new opportunities for rapid development of polycrystalline materials. X-ray diffraction is crucial for the phase elucidation of polycrystalline materials but remains challenging for complex multiphase systems. Now serial rotation electron diffraction has been shown to enable rapid, reliable and semiquantitative phase analysis of such systems, facilitating high-throughput screening of complex synthesis systems and providing new opportunities for materials development.},

Recent advances in light-induced olefin metathesis have led to new applications in polymer and material science, but further improvements to reaction scope and efficiency are desired. Herein, we present the activation of latent ruthenium-based olefin metathesis catalysts via the photothermal response of plasmonic gold nanobipyramids. Simple synthetic control over gold nanobipyramid size results in tunable localized surface plasmon resonance bands enabling catalyst initiation with low-energy visible and infrared light. This approach was applied to the ROMP of dicyclopentadiene, affording plasmonic polymer composites with exceptional photoresponsive and mechanical properties. Moreover, this method of catalyst activation was proven to be remarkably more efficient than activation through conventional heating in all the metathesis processes tested. This study paves the way for providing a wide range of photoinduced olefin metathesis processes in particular and photoinduced latent organic reactions in general by direct photothermal activation of thermally latent catalysts. Current strategies for photoinduced olefin metathesis lack wavelength tunability. Now, plasmonic nanoparticles have been used to activate latent ruthenium catalysts, enabling light-induced olefin metathesis in the infrared range with several advantages when compared with conventional heating. Implementing this approach in ring-opening metathesis polymerization resulted in photoresponsive polymer–nanoparticle composites with enhanced mechanical properties.},

Emissive iron compounds are scarce and dual emission has not been observed before. Here we report the FeIII complex [Fe(ImP)2][PF6] (HImP = 1,1′-(1,3-phenylene)bis(3-methyl-1-imidazol-2-ylidene)), showing a Janus-type dual emission from ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT)- and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT)-dominated states. This behaviour is achieved by a ligand design that combines four N-heterocyclic carbenes with two cyclometalating aryl units. The low-lying π* levels of the cyclometalating units lead to energetically accessible MLCT states that cannot evolve into LMCT states. With a lifetime of 4.6 ns, the strongly reducing and oxidizing MLCT-dominated state can initiate electron transfer reactions, which could constitute a basis for future applications of iron in photoredox catalysis. Noble metals dominate the field of photosensitizers and luminophores. Now, an approach incorporating cyclometalating and carbene functions into FeIII complexes has been shown to enable dual emission from the opposing ligand-to-metal and metal-to-ligand charge-transfer states. The latter shows an exceptionally long lifetime of 4.6 ns and is quenched by oxygen and other quenchers.},

However, the advantages and disadvantages of building nanosystems using multiple molecular components remain relatively unexplored at the thermodynamic, kinetic and functional levels. In this study we used theory and a simple DNA-based model that forms the same nanostructures with different numbers of components to advance our knowledge in this area. Despite its lower assembly rate, we found that a system built with three components may undergo a more cooperative assembly transition from less preorganized components, which facilitates the emergence of functionalities. Using simple variations of its components, we also found that trimeric nanosystems display a much higher level of programmability than their dimeric counterparts because they can assemble with various levels of cooperativity, self-inhibition and time-dependent properties. We show here how two simple strategies (for example, cutting and adding components) can be employed to efficiently programme the regulatory function of a more complex, artificially selected, RNA-cleaving catalytic nanosystem. The advantages and disadvantages of building a nanosystem using one, two or more molecular components are poorly understood. Now, using structural and catalytic DNA-based nanosystems and theoretical simulations, it has been shown that the assembly of trimeric nanosystems displays much higher levels of programmability and functionality than the monomeric or dimeric counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Site-selective functionalization is a core synthetic strategy that has broad implications in organic synthesis. Particularly, exploiting chiral catalysis to control site selectivity in complex carbohydrate functionalizations has emerged as a leading method to unravel unprecedented routes into biologically relevant glycosides. However, robust catalytic systems available to overcome multiple facets of stereoselectivity challenges to this end still remain scarce. Here we report a synergistic chiral Rh(I)- and organoboron-catalysed protocol, which enables access into synthetically challenging but biologically relevant arylnaphthalene glycosides. Our method depicts the employment of chiral Rh(I) catalysis in site-selective carbohydrate functionalization and showcases the utility of boronic acid as a compatible co-catalyst. Crucial to the success of our method is the judicious choice of a suitable organoboron catalyst. We also determine that exquisite multiple aspects of stereocontrol, including enantio-, diastereo-, regio- and anomeric control and dynamic kinetic resolution, are concomitantly operative. Asymmetric systems for catalytic carbohydrate functionalization are mostly limited to chiral copper complexes and organocatalysts. Now, a synergistic chiral Rh(I)- and organoboron-catalysed site-selective functionalization of carbohydrate polyols has been developed, giving stereocontrolled access to biologically relevant arylhydronaphthalene glycosides. Enantio-, diastereo-, regio- and anomeric control and dynamic kinetic resolution were found to be concomitantly operative.},

  abstract     = {Mechanically interlocked structures, such as catenanes and rotaxanes, are fascinating synthetic targets and some are used for molecular switches and machines. Today, the vast majority of catenated structures are built upon macrocycles and only a very few examples of three-dimensional shape-persistent organic cages forming such structures have been reported. However, the catenation in all these cases was based on a thermodynamically favoured π–π-stacking under certain reaction conditions. Here, we show that catenane formation can be induced by adding methoxy or thiomethyl groups to one of the precursors during the synthesis of chiral [8 + 12] imine cubes, giving dimeric and trimeric catenated organic cages. To elucidate the underlying driving forces, we reacted 11 differently 1,4-disubstituted terephthaldehydes with a chiral triamino tribenzotriquinacene under various conditions to study whether monomeric cages or catenated cage dimers are the preferred products. We find that catenation is mainly directed by weak interactions derived from the substituents rather than by π-stacking. Interlocked shape-persistent organic cages are rare structures and the majority are formed using π-stacking as the driving force. Now it is shown that weak dispersion interactions—which are modulated by changing the 1,4-substituents of the constituent dialdehyde linkers—can be used to form interlocked dimeric and trimeric catenated cages.},

Metal–organic cages have served as masks to effect the regioselective functionalization of C60. However, it is difficult to control the stereochemistry of the resulting fullerene adducts through this method. Here we report a means of defining up to six stereocentres on C60, achieving enantioselective fullerene functionalization. This method involves the use of a metal–organic cage built from a chiral formylpyridine. Fullerenes hosted within the cavity of the cage can be converted into a series of C60 adducts through chemo-, regio- and stereo-selective Diels–Alder reactions with the edges of the cage. The chiral formylpyridine ultimately dictates the stereochemistry of these chiral fullerene adducts without being incorporated into them. Such chiral fullerene adducts may become useful in devices requiring circularly polarized light manipulation. The enantioselective functionalization of C60 is highly challenging, typically requiring complex chiral tethers or demanding chromatography. Fullerenes have now been shown to undergo Diels–Alder reactions in a chemo-, regio- and enantio-selective fashion through confinement within an enantiopure metal–organic cage functionalized with a chiral formylpyridine group.},

  abstract     = {The transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling reaction has established itself as one of the most reliable and practical synthetic tools for the efficient construction of carbon–carbon/heteroatom (p-block elements other than carbon) bonds in both racemic and enantioselective manners. In contrast, development of the corresponding heteroatom–heteroatom cross-couplings has so far remained elusive, probably due to the under-investigated and often challenging heteroatom–heteroatom reductive elimination. Here we demonstrate the use of single-electron reductive elimination as a strategy for developing enantioselective S–O coupling under Cu catalysis, based on both experimental and theoretical results. The reaction manifests its synthetic potential by the ready preparation of challenging chiral alcohols featuring congested stereocentres, the expedient valorization of the biomass-derived feedstock glycerol, and the remarkable catalytic 4,6-desymmetrization of inositol. These results demonstrate the potential of enantioselective radical heteroatomic cross-coupling as a general chiral heteroatom–heteroatom formation strategy. Heteroatom–heteroatom cross-couplings have so far remained elusive. Now, a copper-catalysed enantioselective S–O cross-coupling of diverse diols or triols with sulfonyl chlorides has been realized via a single-electron reductive elimination manifold. The reaction provides access to value-added chiral C3 building blocks and inositol phosphates through enantioselective desymmetrization of biomass-derived alcohols.},

  abstract     = {Electrophilic aromatic substitution is among the most widely used mechanistic manifolds in organic chemistry. Access to certain substitution patterns is, however, precluded by intrinsic and immutable substituent effects that ultimately restrict the diversity of the benzenoid chemical space. Here we demonstrate that the established regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution can be overcome simply by diverting the key σ-complex intermediate towards otherwise inaccessible substitution products. This ‘regiodiversion’ strategy is realized through the development of a general and concise method for the meta-selective C–H arylation of sterically congested phenols. Consisting of a Bi(V)-mediated electrophilic arylation and a subsequent aryl migration/rearomatization, our process is orthogonal to conventional C–H activation and cross-coupling approaches, and does not require prefunctionalization of the substrate. Mechanistically informed applications in synthesis showcase its utility as a versatile and enabling route to highly functionalized, contiguously substituted aromatic building blocks that defy synthesis via existing methods. The strong regiochemical preferences of electrophilic aromatic substitution have played a key role in defining the diversity of accessible chemical space. Now, it has been shown that the electrophilic arylation of phenols can be achieved at the electronically disfavoured meta-position via a formal 1,2-migration of a key σ-complex intermediate.},

  abstract     = {Homoaromatic compounds possess an interrupted π system but display aromatic properties due to through-space or through-bond interactions. Stable neutral homoaromatic hydrocarbons have remained rare and are typically unstable. Here we present the preparation of a class of stable neutral homoaromatic molecules, supported by experimental evidence (ring current observed by NMR spectroscopy and equalization of bond lengths by X-ray structure analysis) and computational analysis via nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS) and anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID). We also show that one homoaromatic hydrocarbon is a photoswitch through a reversible photochemical [1, 11] sigmatropic rearrangement. Our computational analysis suggests that, upon photoswitching, the nature of the homoaromatic state changes in its perimeter from a more pronounced local 6π homoaromatic state to a global 10π homoaromatic state. These demonstrations of stable and accessible homoaromatic neutral hydrocarbons and their photoswitching behaviour provide new understanding and insights into the study of homoconjugative interactions in organic molecules, and for the design of new responsive molecular materials. Neutral homoaromatic hydrocarbons—which possess an interrupted π-system yet display aromatic properties owing to through-space or through-bond interactions—have remained rare as they are typically unstable. Now a class of stable neutral homoaromatic homoannulenes has been synthesized, including one that acts as a photoswitch through a reversible [1, 11] sigmatropic rearrangement.},

  abstract     = {The existing catalyst/initiator systems and methodologies used for the synthesis of polymers can access only a few cyclic polymers composed entirely of a single monomer type, and the synthesis of such authentic cyclic polar vinyl polymers (acrylics) devoid of any foreign motifs remains a challenge. Here we report that a tethered B-P-B trifunctional, intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair catalyst enables the synthesis of an authentic cyclic acrylic polymer, cyclic poly(γ-methyl-α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone) (c-PMMBL), from the bio-based monomer MMBL. Detailed studies have revealed an initiation and propagation mechanism through pairwise monomer enchainment enabled by the cooperative and synergistic initiator/catalyst sites of the trifunctional catalyst. We propose that macrocyclic intermediates and transition states comprising two catalyst molecules are involved in the catalyst-regulated ring expansion and eventual cyclization, forming authentic c-PMMBL rings and concurrently regenerating the catalyst. The cyclic topology of the c-PMMBL polymers imparts an ~50 °C higher onset decomposition temperature and a much narrower degradation window compared with their linear counterparts of similar molecular weight and dispersity, while maintaining high chemical recyclability. The synthesis of cyclic polymers remains challenging. Now a trifunctional B-P-B frustrated Lewis pair has been shown to enable easy access to cyclic acrylic polymers through a bimolecular mechanism. These cyclic polymers have enhanced thermodynamic properties compared with their linear counterparts, while maintaining high chemical recyclability.},

  abstract     = {Heterobiaryl compounds that exhibit axial chirality are of increasing value and interest across several fields, but direct oxidative methods for their enantioselective synthesis remain elusive. Here we disclose that an iron catalyst in the presence of a chiral PyBOX ligand and an oxidant enables direct coupling between naphthols and indoles to yield atropisomeric heterobiaryl compounds with high levels of enantioselectivity. The reaction exhibits remarkable chemoselectivity and exclusively yields cross-coupled products without competing homocoupling. Mechanistic investigations enable us to postulate that an indole radical is generated in the reaction but that this is probably an off-cycle event, and that the reaction proceeds through formation of a chiral Fe-bound naphthoxy radical that is trapped by a nucleophilic indole. We envision that this simple, cheap and sustainable catalytic manifold will facilitate access to a range of heterobiaryl compounds and enable their application across the fields of materials science, medicinal chemistry and catalysis. Direct oxidative methods for the enantioselective synthesis of heterobiaryl compounds that exhibit axial chirality remain elusive. Now, the use of an iron catalyst in the presence of a chiral PyBOX ligand and an oxidant enables the direct coupling of naphthols and indoles with high levels of enantio- and cross-selectivity.},

  abstract     = {The occurrence of aromaticity in organic molecules is widely accepted, but its occurrence in purely metallic systems is less widespread. Molecules comprising only metal atoms (M) are known to be able to exhibit aromatic behaviour, sustaining ring currents inside an external magnetic field along M–M connection axes (σ-aromaticity) or above and below the plane (π-aromaticity) for cyclic or cage-type compounds. However, all-metal compounds provide an extension of the electrons’ mobility also in other directions. Here, we show that regular {Bi6} prisms exhibit a non-localizable molecular orbital of f-type symmetry and generate a strong ring current that leads to a behaviour referred to as φ-aromaticity. The experimentally observed heterometallic cluster [{CpRu}3Bi6]–, based on a regular prismatic {Bi6} unit, displays aromatic behaviour; according to quantum chemical calculations, the corresponding hypothetical Bi62− prism shows a similar behaviour. By contrast, [{(cod)Ir}3Bi6] features a distorted Bi6 moiety that inhibits φ-aromaticity. Aromaticity is a ubiquitous concept in organic chemistry yet it is less widespread for inorganic species. Now the cluster [(CpRu)3Bi6]–, obtained as part of a soluble salt, has been shown to exhibit aromatic behaviour referred to as φ-type, owing to a highly regular {Bi6} substructure causing a non-localizable molecular orbital of $$f_{z^3}$$ -like symmetry.},

  abstract     = {Quantum interference (QI)—the constructive or destructive interference of conduction pathways through molecular orbitals—plays a fundamental role in enhancing or suppressing charge and spin transport in organic molecular electronics. Graphical models were developed to predict constructive versus destructive interference in polyaromatic hydrocarbons and have successfully estimated the large conductivity differences observed in single-molecule transport measurements. A major challenge lies in extending these models to excitonic (photoexcited) processes, which typically involve distinct orbitals with different symmetries. Here we investigate how QI models can be applied as bridging moieties in intramolecular singlet-fission compounds to predict relative rates of triplet pair formation. In a series of bridged intramolecular singlet-fission dimers, we found that destructive QI always leads to a slower triplet pair formation across different bridge lengths and geometries. A combined experimental and theoretical approach reveals the critical considerations of bridge topology and frontier molecular orbital energies in applying QI conductance principles to predict rates of multiexciton generation. Principles of quantum interference can guide the design of chromophores that undergo singlet fission. Now, ‘pencil and paper’ graphical models can be used to understand and predict the dynamics of triplet pairs generated through singlet fission in bridged dimers.},

  abstract     = {Stress-sensitive molecules called mechanophores undergo productive chemical transformations in response to mechanical force. A variety of mechanochromic mechanophores, which change colour in response to stress, have been developed, but modulating the properties of the dyes generally requires the independent preparation of discrete derivatives. Here we introduce a mechanophore platform enabling mechanically gated multicolour chromogenic reactivity. The mechanophore is based on an activated furan precursor to donor–acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) masked as a hetero-Diels–Alder adduct. Mechanochemical activation of the mechanophore unveils the DASA precursor, and subsequent reaction with a secondary amine generates an intensely coloured DASA. Critically, the properties of the DASA are controlled by the amine, and thus a single mechanophore can be differentiated post-activation to produce a wide range of functionally diverse DASAs. We highlight this system by establishing the concept of mechanochemical multicolour soft lithography whereby a complex multicolour composite image is printed into a mechanochemically active elastomer through an iterative process of localized compression followed by reaction with different amines. Mechanochemical generation of dyes with different photophysical properties generally requires the use of discrete mechanophore derivatives with unique chemical structures. Now it has been shown that diverse donor–acceptor Stenhouse adducts can be produced via a mechanically gated chromogenic reaction, enabling mechanochemical multicolour lithography.},

  abstract     = {The Born–Oppenheimer approximation is the keystone of modern computational chemistry and there is wide interest in understanding under what conditions it remains valid. Hydrogen atom scattering from insulator, semi-metal and metal surfaces has helped provide such information. The approximation is adequate for insulators and for metals it fails, but not severely. Here we present hydrogen atom scattering from a semiconductor surface: Ge(111)c(2 × 8). Experiments show bimodal energy-loss distributions revealing two channels. Molecular dynamics trajectories within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation reproduce one channel quantitatively. The second channel transfers much more energy and is absent in simulations. It grows with hydrogen atom incidence energy and exhibits an energy-loss onset equal to the Ge surface bandgap. This leads us to conclude that hydrogen atom collisions at the surface of a semiconductor are capable of promoting electrons from the valence to the conduction band with high efficiency. Our current understanding fails to explain these observations. Inelastic hydrogen atom scattering from surfaces provides a good benchmark for the validity of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation in surface chemistry. Now it has been shown that hydrogen atoms colliding with a semiconductor surface can efficiently excite electrons above the surface bandgap, representing a clear example of the failure of the approximation.},

However, due to their high reactivity, low temperatures, inert atmospheres and strictly dried solvents are usually necessary for their use. Here we report an encapsulating method for the stabilization of sensitive organolithium reagents—PhLi, n-BuLi and s-BuLi—in a low-cost hexatriacontane (C36H74) organogel. The use of this technology is showcased in nucleophilic addition reactions under ambient conditions, low-temperature bromine–lithium exchange, ortho-lithiation and C–H functionalization. The gel substantially enhances organolithium stability, allows simple storage, handling and delivery, and enables reproducible reagent portioning. The use of gels as easily divided delivery vehicles for hazardous organometallics has the potential to transform this area of synthetic chemistry, making these powerful reactions safer and more accessible to non-specialist researchers, and enabling the more widespread use of these common synthetic methods. Organolithium compounds are important reagents but are often hazardous due to their high reactivity. Now, encapsulating organolithium reagents within a supramolecular organogel has been found to enhance their stability, facilitating their storage and handling under ambient conditions. The homogeneous gels can be easily subdivided and dosed into a wide range of synthetic reactions.},

  abstract     = {The specific activity of enzymes can be altered over long timescales in cells by synonymous mutations that alter a messenger RNA molecule’s sequence but not the encoded protein’s primary structure. How this happens at the molecular level is unknown. Here, we use multiscale modelling of three Escherichia coli enzymes (type III chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, d-alanine–d-alanine ligase B and dihydrofolate reductase) to understand experimentally measured changes in specific activity due to synonymous mutations. The modelling involves coarse-grained simulations of protein synthesis and post-translational behaviour, all-atom simulations to test robustness and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations to characterize enzymatic function. We show that changes in codon translation rates induced by synonymous mutations cause shifts in co-translational and post-translational folding pathways that kinetically partition molecules into subpopulations that very slowly interconvert to the native, functional state. Structurally, these states resemble the native state, with localized misfolding near the active sites of the enzymes. These long-lived states exhibit reduced catalytic activity, as shown by their increased activation energies for the reactions they catalyse. Enzymes with identical sequences of amino acids can display varying activities when encoded with mRNA with different properties, but why this is the case has been a mystery. Now, it has been shown that synonymous mutations in mRNA alter the partitioning of proteins into long-lived soluble misfolded states with varying activities.},

  abstract     = {The design of highly electron-active and stable heterogeneous catalysts for the ambient nitrogen reduction reaction is challenging due to the inertness of the N2 molecule. Here, we report the synthesis of a zinc-based coordination polymer that features bridging dinitrogen anionic ligands, {[Zn(L)(N2)0.5(TCNQ–TCNQ)0.5]·(TCNQ)0.5}n (L is tetra(isoquinolin-6-yl)tetrathiafulvalene and TCNQ is tetracyanoquinodimethane), and show that it is an efficient photocatalyst for nitrogen fixation under an ambient atmosphere. It exhibits an ammonia conversion rate of 140 μmol g−1 h−1 and functions well also with unpurified air as the feeding gas. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the active [Zn2+–(N≡N)−–Zn2+] sites can promote the formation of NH3 and the detachment of the NH3 formed creates unsaturated [Zn2+···Zn+] intermediates, which in turn can be refilled by external N2 sequestration and fast intermolecular electron migration. The [Zn2+···Zn+] intermediates stabilized by the sandwiched cage-like donor–acceptor–donor framework can sustain continuous catalytic cycles. This work presents an example of a molecular active site embedded within a coordination polymer for nitrogen fixation under mild conditions. The nitrogen reduction reaction is an extremely valuable but energy-intensive process. Now, a coordination polymer based on a [Zn–N2–Zn] unit has been shown to promote the formation of ammonia under ambient conditions by a photocatalytic reaction. The N2 moieties within the framework are reduced, creating unsaturated [Zn2+···Zn+] intermediates that are able to capture external N2 and sustain the cycle.},

Here we present synergistic use of gem-α,α-disubstitution of available at-scale, bio-based δ-valerolactones to yield gem-dialkyl-substituted valerolactones ( $${\rm{VL}}^{{\rm{R}}_{2}}$$ ), which generate polymers that solve not only the poor chemical recyclability but also the low melting temperature and mechanical performance of the parent poly(δ-valerolactone); the gem-disubstituted polyesters ( $${\rm{PVL}}^{{\rm{R}}_{2}}$$ ) therefore not only exhibit complete chemical recyclability but also thermal, mechanical and transport properties that rival or exceed those of polyethylene. Through a fundamental structure–property study that reveals intriguing impacts of the alkyl chain length on materials performance of $${\rm{PVL}}^{{\rm{R}}_{2}}$$ , this work establishes a simple circular, high-performance polyester platform based on $${\rm{VL}}^{{\rm{R}}_{2}}$$ and highlights the importance of synergistic utilization of gem-disubstitution for enhancing both chemical recyclability and materials performance of sustainable polyesters. Geminal disubstitution of cyclic monomers is known to improve the chemical recyclability of their polymers, but usually at the expense of performance properties.

  abstract     = {Although the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) involves multiple proton-coupled electron transfer processes, early studies reported the absence of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) on polycrystalline platinum, probably due to the use of unpurified D2O. Here we developed a methodology to prepare ultra-pure D2O, which is indispensable for reliably investigating extremely surface-sensitive platinum single crystals. We find that Pt(111) exhibits much higher ORR activity in D2O than in H2O, with potential-dependent inverse KIEs of ~0.5, whereas Pt(100) and Pt(110) exhibit potential-independent inverse KIEs of ~0.8. Such inverse KIEs are closely correlated to the lower *OD coverage and weakened *OD binding strength relative to *OH, which, based on theoretical calculations, are attributed to the differences in their zero-point energies. This study suggests that the competing adsorption between *OH/*OD and *O2 probably plays an important role in the ORR rate-determining steps that involve a chemical step preceding an electrochemical step (CE mechanism). Kinetic isotope effect studies can provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms of the oxygen reduction reaction; however, inaccessibility to ultra-high-purity D2O has made this difficult. Now, a methodology to prepare ultra-pure D2O has been developed and inverse kinetic isotope effects have subsequently been measured for the oxygen reduction reaction on platinum single-crystal surfaces, providing mechanistic insights.},

Here we report modular construction of precise sequence-defined amphiphilic polymers that self-assemble into digital micelles with contour lengths strictly regulated by oligourethane sequences. Direct sequence reading is accomplished with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) tandem mass spectrometry, facilitated by high-affinity binding of alkali metal ions with poly(ethylene glycol) dendrons and selective cleavage of benzyl-carbamate linkages. A mixture of four types of digital micelles could be identified, sequence-decoded and quantified by MALDI and MALDI imaging at cellular, organ and tissue slice levels upon in vivo administration, enabling direct comparison of biological properties for each type of digital micelle in the same animal. The concept of digital micelles and encoded amphiphiles capable of direct sequencing and high-throughput label-free quantification could be exploited for next-generation precision nanomedicine designs (such as digital lipids) and protein corona studies. Identifying and quantifying the biodistribution of synthetic polymeric nanoparticles in biological milieu is crucial for biomedical applications. Now, it has been shown that encoded polymeric amphiphiles with discrete molar masses undergo sequence- and length-dependent self-assembly into precise digital micelles that can be used in direct sequence reading and ex vivo label-free quantification assays.},

  abstract     = {Polyketide natural products often contain common repeat motifs, for example, propionate, acetate and deoxypropionate, and so can be synthesized by iterative processes. We report here a highly efficient iterative strategy for the synthesis of polyacetates based on boronic ester homologation that does not require functional group manipulation between iterations. This process involves sequential asymmetric diboration of a terminal alkene, forming a 1,2-bis(boronic ester), followed by regio- and stereoselective homologation of the primary boronic ester with a butenyl metallated carbenoid to generate a 1,3-bis(boronic ester). Each transformation independently controls the stereochemical configuration, making the process highly versatile, and the sequence can be iterated prior to stereospecific oxidation of the 1,3-polyboronic ester to yield the 1,3-polyol. This methodology has been applied to a 14-step synthesis of the oxopolyene macrolide bahamaolide A, and the versatility of the 1,3-polyboronic esters has been demonstrated in various stereospecific transformations, leading to polyalkenes, -alkynes, -ketones and -aromatics with full stereocontrol. Polyketide natural products often contain common repeat motifs that are synthesized using iterative processes. Now a masked 1,3-diol motif, generated by a two-step process based on boronic ester homologation, has enabled the efficient iterative synthesis of polyacetates, including bahamaolide A. In addition to oxidation, the 1,3-polyboronic esters were shown to undergo various stereospecific transformations.},

However, the lack of responsiveness and requirement for specific binding groups makes spatiotemporal control challenging. Here, we report the adaptive insertion of a hydrophobic anchor into a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) host as a non-covalent binding strategy for surface functionalization. By using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as the hydrophobic anchor, hydrophilic charged and non-charged functional modules were spontaneously loaded onto PEG corona in 2 min without the assistance of any catalysts and binding groups. The thermodynamically favourable insertion of the hydrophobic anchor can be reversed by pulling the functional module, enabling programmable surface functionalization. We anticipate that the adaptive molecular recognition between the hydrophobic anchor and the PEG host will challenge the hydrophilic understanding of PEG and enhance the progress in nanomedicine, advanced materials and nanotechnology. Modulation of surface properties and functions can be achieved through covalent and non-covalent molecular binding, but the lack of responsiveness and requirement for specific binding groups makes spatiotemporal control challenging.

  abstract     = {The controllable packing of functional nanoparticles (NPs) into crystalline lattices is of interest in the development of NP-based materials. Here we demonstrate that the size, morphology and symmetry of such supercrystals can be tailored by adjusting the surface dynamics of their constituent NPs. In the presence of excess tetraethylammonium cations, atomically precise [Au25(SR)18]− NPs (where SR is a thiolate ligand) can be crystallized into micrometre-sized hexagonal rod-like supercrystals, rather than as face-centred-cubic superlattices otherwise. Experimental characterization supported by theoretical modelling shows that the rod-like crystals consist of polymeric chains in which Au25 NPs are held together by a linear SR–[Au(I)–SR]4 interparticle linker. This linker is formed by conjugation of two dynamically detached SR–[Au(I)–SR]2 protecting motifs from adjacent Au25 particles, and is stabilized by a combination of CH⋯π and ion-pairing interactions between tetraethylammonium cations and SR ligands. The symmetry, morphology and size of the resulting supercrystals can be systematically tuned by changing the concentration and type of the tetraalkylammonium cations. Gold nanoparticles typically exhibit hard-sphere-like assembly behaviour, but now the size, morphology and symmetry of crystals of Au25 nanoparticles have been tuned. The presence of excess tetraethylammonium cations has been shown to promote the one-dimensional assembly of the nanoparticles, which in turn form rod-like crystals, by stabilizing dynamically detached ligands from adjacent particles into interparticle linkers through CH⋯π and ion-pairing interactions.},

In this context, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is an appealing target as it is the least recycled high-production-volume polymer due to its facile release of plasticizers and corrosive HCl gas. Herein, these limitations become advantageous in a paired-electrolysis reaction in which HCl is intentionally generated from PVC to chlorinate arenes in an air- and moisture-tolerant process that is mediated by the plasticizer. The reaction proceeds efficiently with other plastic waste present and a commercial plasticized PVC product (laboratory tubing) can be used directly. A simplified life-cycle assessment reveals that using PVC waste as the chlorine source in the paired-electrolysis reaction has a lower global warming potential than HCl. Overall, this method should inspire other strategies for repurposing waste PVC and related polymers using electrosynthetic reactions, including those that take advantage of existing polymer additives. The facile release of corrosive HCl gas and plasticizers from poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) makes it a challenging material to recycle. Now, it has been shown that PVC waste can be directly used as a halogen source to synthesize chloroarenes.

  abstract     = {Molecular photoelectrochemical devices are hampered by electron–hole recombination after photoinduced electron transfer, causing losses in power conversion efficiency. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, we demonstrate the use of supramolecular machinery as a strategy to inhibit recombination through an organization of molecular components that enables unbinding of the final electron acceptor upon reduction. We show that preorganization of a macrocyclic electron acceptor to a dye yields a pseudorotaxane that undergoes a fast (completed within ~50 ps) ‘ring-launching’ event upon electron transfer from the dye to the macrocycle, releasing the anionic macrocycle and thus reducing charge recombination. Implementing this system into p-type dye-sensitized solar cells yielded a 16-fold and 5-fold increase in power conversion efficiency compared to devices based on the two control dyes that are unable to facilitate pseudorotaxane formation. The active repulsion of the anionic macrocycle with concomitant reformation of a neutral pseudorotaxane complex circumvents recombination at both the semiconductor–electrolyte and semiconductor–dye interfaces, enabling a threefold enhancement in hole lifetime. Photoelectrochemical cells are hampered by electron–hole recombination. Now, supramolecular machinery has enabled the docking of macrocyclic electron-accepting redox mediators to a dye through pseudorotaxane formation. Upon electron transfer from the dye, the anionic redox-mediator rings are launched away from the surface, reducing charge recombination, establishing charge separation and improving the efficiency of the solar cells in which they feature.},

  abstract     = {The formation of C–N bonds—of great importance to the pharmaceutical industry—can be facilitated enzymatically using nucleophilic and nitrene transfer mechanisms. However, neither natural nor engineered enzymes are known to generate and control nitrogen-centred radicals, which serve as valuable species for C–N bond formation. Here we use flavin-dependent ‘ene’-reductases with an exogenous photoredox catalyst to selectively generate amidyl radicals within the protein active site. These enzymes are engineered through directed evolution to catalyse 5-exo, 6-endo, 7-endo, 8-endo, and intermolecular hydroamination reactions with high levels of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that radical initiation occurs via an enzyme-gated mechanism, where the protein thermodynamically activates the substrate for reduction by the photocatalyst. Molecular dynamics studies indicate that the enzymes bind substrates using non-canonical binding interactions, which may serve as a handle to further manipulate reactivity. This approach demonstrates the versatility of these enzymes for controlling the reactivity of high-energy radical intermediates and highlights the opportunity for synergistic catalyst strategies to unlock previously inaccessible enzymatic functions. Expanding the biocatalysis toolbox for C–N bond formation is of great value. Now, a biocatalytic amination strategy using a new-to-nature mechanism involving nitrogen-centred radicals has been developed. The transformations are enabled by synergistic photoenzymatic catalysis, providing intra- and intermolecular hydroamination products with high yields and levels of enantioselectivity.},

  abstract     = {Carbynes (R– $${{{\dot{\mathrm C:}}}}$$ ), species that bear a monovalent carbon atom with three non-bonding valence electrons, are important intermediates and potentially useful in organic synthetic chemistry. However, free species of the type R– $${{{\dot{\mathrm E:}}}}$$ of any group 14 element (E) have eluded isolation in the condensed phase due to their high reactivity. Here we report the isolation, characterization and reactivity of a crystalline germylyne radical by using a sterically hindered hydrindacene ligand. The germylyne radical bears an essentially one-coordinate germanium atom as shown by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations show that the germylyne radical features a doublet ground state, and the three non-bonding valence electrons at the germanium atom contribute to the lone pair of electrons as the highest occupied molecular orbital-3 and one unpaired electron as the singly occupied molecular orbital. Heavy analogues of carbynes of the type R– $${{{\dot{\mathrm E:}}}}$$ , where E is a group 14 element, are difficult to isolate in the condensed phase due to their high reactivity. Now, a germylyne radical supported by a sterically hindered hydrindacene ligand has been prepared and structurally characterized. Theoretical calculations show that the spin density mainly resides at the germanium centre.},

  abstract     = {The transition state of a chemical reaction is a dividing surface on the reaction potential energy surface (PES) between reactants and products and is thus of fundamental interest in understanding chemical reactivity. The transient nature of the transition state presents challenges to its experimental characterization. Transition-state spectroscopy experiments based on negative-ion photodetachment can provide a direct probe of this region of the PES, revealing the detailed vibrational structure associated with the transition state. Here we study the F + NH3 → HF + NH2 reaction using slow photoelectron velocity-map imaging spectroscopy of cryogenically cooled FNH3− anions. Reduced-dimensionality quantum dynamical simulations performed on a global PES show excellent agreement with the experimental results, enabling the assignment of spectral structure. Our combined experimental–theoretical study reveals a manifold of vibrational Feshbach resonances in the product well of the F + NH3 PES. At higher energies, the spectra identify features attributed to resonances localized across the transition state and into the reactant complex that may impact the bimolecular reaction dynamics. The transition state, a transient species where bond transformation occurs, fundamentally controls reaction dynamics. This important species can be probed through the photodetachment of an anionic precursor, as has now been shown in the F + NH3 reaction. A combination of theory and experiment reveals resonances that span the transition state.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decades, many efficient methodologies have been developed that allow for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral sulfinyl compounds. However, the enantioselective deoxygenation of hexavalent sulfones for the formation of chiral sulfinyl compounds still remains one of the major challenges in the fields of asymmetric synthesis and organosulfur chemistry. Here we have demonstrated that a synergistic combination of organocatalysis and the incorporation of a cyano group into the sulfone generates a chiral sulfinic species as an active intermediate. A wide range of chiral sulfinates with high enantioselectivities could then be acquired using alcohols as nucleophiles, and the subsequent transformations allowed the collective preparation of a variety of chiral sulfinyl compounds. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the catalytic cycle involves a quinuclidine-assisted stepwise 1,2-cyano group transfer, base-assisted intermolecular substitution with alcohol and regeneration of the active catalyst. The enantioselectivity was determined by the cyano migration step. The direct conversion of sulfones to chiral sulfinyl compounds is one of the major challenges in the fields of asymmetric synthesis and organosulfur chemistry. Now, through incorporation of a cyano group into the sulfone, an organocatalytic asymmetric deoxygenation strategy has been developed that enables the synthesis of chiral sulfinyl compounds.},

Nature achieves these cyclization reactions with a variety of enzymes, including Diels–Alderases that catalyse concerted 4 + 2 cycloadditions, but biosynthetic enzymes with 2 + 2 cyclase activity have yet to be discovered. Here we report that PloI4, a β-barrel-fold protein homologous to the exo-selective 4 + 2 cyclase that functions in the biosynthesis of pyrroindomycins, catalyses competitive 2 + 2 and 4 + 2 cycloaddition reactions. PloI4 is believed to catalyse an endo-4 + 2 cycloaddition in the biosynthesis of pyrrolosporin A; however, when the substrate precursor of pyrroindomycins was treated with PloI4, an exo-2 + 2 adduct was produced in addition to the exo- and endo-4 + 2 adducts. Biochemical characterizations, computational analyses, (co)crystal structures and mutagenesis outcomes have allowed the catalytic versatility of PloI4 to be rationalized. Mechanistic studies involved the directed engineering of PloI4 to variants that produced the exo-4 + 2, endo-4 + 2 or exo-2 + 2 product preferentially. This work illustrates an enzymatic thermal 2 + 2 cycloaddition and provides evidence of a process through which an enzyme evolves along with its substrate for specialization and activity improvement. Cycloaddition reactions are among the most useful reactions in chemical synthesis, but biosynthetic enzymes with 2 + 2 cyclase activity have yet to be observed. Now it is shown that a β-barrel-fold protein catalyses competitive 2 + 2 and 4 + 2 cycloaddition reactions. This protein can be engineered to preferentially produce the exo-2 + 2, exo-4 + 2 or endo-4 + 2 product.},

  abstract     = {Mechanically interlocked carbon nanostructures represent a relatively unexplored frontier in carbon nanoscience due to the difficulty in preparing these unusual topological materials. Here we illustrate an active-template method in which a [n]cycloparaphenylene precursor macrocycle is decorated with two convergent pyridine donors that coordinate to a metal ion. The metal ion catalyses alkyne–alkyne cross-coupling reactions within the central cavity of the macrocycle, and the resultant interlocked products can be converted into fully π-conjugated structures in subsequent synthetic steps. Specifically, we report the synthesis of a family of catenanes that comprise two or three mutually interpenetrating [n]cycloparaphenylene-derived macrocycles of various sizes. Additionally, a fully π-conjugated [3]rotaxane was synthesized by the same method. The development of synthetic methods to access mechanically interlocked carbon nanostructures of varying topology can help elucidate the implications of mechanical bonding for this emerging class of nanomaterials and allow structure–property relationships to be established. An active-template approach has been used to prepare π-conjugated interlocked nanocarbons derived from [n]cycloparaphenylenes. A metal ion bound within the central cavity of a precursor macrocycle first catalyses cross-coupling reactions and then the resulting mechanically interlocked intermediates are further transformed into π-conjugated species—[2] and [3]catenanes as well as a conjugated [3]rotaxane.},

While arrested ribosome–nascent chain complexes (RNCCs) have been extensively studied structurally, the lack of a simple procedure for the large-scale preparation of peptidyl-tRNAs, intermediates in polypeptide synthesis that carry the growing chain, means that little attention has been given to RNCCs representing functionally active states of the ribosome. Here we report the facile synthesis of stably linked peptidyl-tRNAs through a chemoenzymatic approach based on native chemical ligation and use them to determine several structures of RNCCs in the functional pre-attack state of the peptidyl transferase centre. These structures reveal that C-terminal parts of the growing peptides adopt the same uniform β-strand conformation stabilized by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds with the universally conserved 23S rRNA nucleotides, and explain how the ribosome synthesizes growing peptides containing various sequences with comparable efficiencies. Synthesis of peptidyl-tRNAs is challenging because there are no enzymes that can directly attach the desired peptide to tRNA. Now it has been shown that a chemoenzymatic approach based on native chemical ligation can be used for the semi-synthesis of peptidyl-tRNAs for structural/biochemical studies of arrested and non-arrested ribosome complexes.},

  abstract     = {Substituting carbon with silicon in organic molecules and materials has long been an attractive way to modify their electronic structure and properties. Silicon-doped graphene-based materials are known to exhibit exotic properties, yet conjugated organic materials with atomically precise Si substitution have remained difficult to prepare. Here we present the on-surface synthesis of one- and two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks whose backbones contain 1,4-disilabenzene (C4Si2) linkers. Silicon atoms were first deposited on a Au(111) surface, forming a AuSix film on annealing. The subsequent deposition and annealing of a bromo-substituted polyaromatic hydrocarbon precursor (triphenylene or pyrene) on this surface led to the formation of the C4Si2-bridged networks, which were characterized by a combination of high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy supported by density functional theory calculations. Each Si in a hexagonal C4Si2 ring was found to be covalently linked to one terminal Br atom. For the linear structure obtained with the pyrene-based precursor, the C4Si2 rings were converted into C4Si pentagonal siloles by further annealing. Incorporating silicon into organic molecules and materials leads to interesting changes in electronic structure and properties; silabenzenes are attractive species for this purpose, but their high reactivity in solution poses challenges. Now, 1D and 2D covalent organic frameworks featuring disilabenzene rings (C4Si2) as linkers have been prepared by reacting silicon atoms and polyaromatic hydrocarbon precursors on a Au(111) surface.},

  abstract     = {Iodine is a reactive trace element in atmospheric chemistry that destroys ozone and nucleates particles. Iodine emissions have tripled since 1950 and are projected to keep increasing with rising O3 surface concentrations. Although iodic acid (HIO3) is widespread and forms particles more efficiently than sulfuric acid, its gas-phase formation mechanism remains unresolved. Here, in CLOUD atmospheric simulation chamber experiments that generate iodine radicals at atmospherically relevant rates, we show that iodooxy hypoiodite, IOIO, is efficiently converted into HIO3 via reactions (R1) IOIO + O3 → IOIO4 and (R2) IOIO4 + H2O → HIO3 + HOI + (1)O2. The laboratory-derived reaction rate coefficients are corroborated by theory and shown to explain field observations of daytime HIO3 in the remote lower free troposphere. The mechanism provides a missing link between iodine sources and particle formation. Because particulate iodate is readily reduced, recycling iodine back into the gas phase, our results suggest a catalytic role of iodine in aerosol formation. Iodic acid (HIO3) forms aerosols very efficiently, but its gas-phase formation mechanism is not well understood. Atmospheric simulation chamber experiments, quantum chemical calculations and kinetic modelling have now revealed that HIO3 forms as an early iodine oxidation product from hypoiodite. The mechanism explains field measurements and suggests a catalytic role for iodine in particle formation.},

  abstract     = {Interactions between the microbiota and their colonized environments mediate critical pathways from biogeochemical cycles to homeostasis in human health. Here we report a soil-inspired chemical system that consists of nanostructured minerals, starch granules and liquid metals. Fabricated via a bottom-up synthesis, the soil-inspired chemical system can enable chemical redistribution and modulation of microbial communities. We characterize the composite, confirming its structural similarity to the soil, with three-dimensional X-ray fluorescence and ptychographic tomography and electron microscopy imaging. We also demonstrate that post-synthetic modifications formed by laser irradiation led to chemical heterogeneities from the atomic to the macroscopic level. The soil-inspired material possesses chemical, optical and mechanical responsiveness to yield write–erase functions in electrical performance. The composite can also enhance microbial culture/biofilm growth and biofuel production in vitro. Finally, we show that the soil-inspired system enriches gut bacteria diversity, rectifies tetracycline-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis and ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced rodent colitis symptoms within in vivo rodent models. Creating hierarchical synthetic materials that can modulate microbial communities remains a great challenge due to the complex interactions between microbiota and their colonized environments. Now, a soil-inspired chemical system that responds to chemical, optical and mechanical stimuli has been developed. The soil-inspired chemical system can enhance microbial cultures and biofuel production, enrich gut bacterial diversity and alleviate ulcerative colitis symptoms.},

Here we describe a non-equilibrium nanosystem comprising a binary population of enzyme-containing polymersomes capable of light-gated chemical communication, controllable feedback and coupling to macroscopic oscillations. The populations consist of esterase-containing polymersomes functionalized with photo-responsive donor–acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASA) and light-insensitive semipermeable urease-loaded polymersomes. The DASA–polymersome membrane becomes permeable under green light, switching on esterase activity and decreasing the pH, which in turn initiates the production of alkali in the urease-containing population. A pH-sensitive pigment that absorbs green light when protonated provides a negative feedback loop for deactivating the DASA–polymersomes. Simultaneously, increased alkali production deprotonates the pigment, reactivating esterase activity by opening the membrane gate. We utilize light-mediated fluctuations of pH to perform non-equilibrium communication between the nanoreactors and use the feedback loops to induce work as chemomechanical swelling/deswelling oscillations in a crosslinked hydrogel. We envision possible applications in artificial organelles, protocells and soft robotics. The circadian rhythm generates out-of-equilibrium metabolite oscillations controlled by feedback loops under light/dark cycles. Now, it has been shown that these life-like properties can emerge from a non-equilibrium nanosystem comprising a binary population of enzyme-containing polymersomes capable of light-gated chemical communication, controllable feedback and coupling to macroscopic oscillations.},

However, using high-energy light (λ &amp;lt; 500 nm) for substrate or photocatalyst sensitization can lead to background activation of photoactive small-molecule probes and reduce its efficacy in complex biological environments. Here we describe the development of targeted aryl azide activation via deep red-light (λ = 660 nm) photoredox catalysis and its use in photocatalysed proximity labelling. We demonstrate that aryl azides are converted to triplet nitrenes via a redox-centric mechanism and show that its spatially localized formation requires both red light and a photocatalyst-targeting modality. This technology was applied in different colon cancer cell systems for targeted protein environment labelling of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). We identified a small subset of proteins with previously known and unknown association to EpCAM, including CDH3, a clinically relevant protein that shares high tumour-selective expression with EpCAM. Technologies for profiling biological environments with high spatiotemporal resolution are in demand to enable the discovery of new targets for addressing unmet clinical needs. Now, a deep red light-mediated photocatalytic strategy for the targeted activation of aryl azides has been developed. This platform enables mapping of protein microenvironments in physiologically relevant systems.},

  abstract     = {Steric exclusion is a key element of enzyme substrate specificity, including in polymerases. Such substrate specificity restricts the enzymatic synthesis of 2′-modified nucleic acids, which are of interest in nucleic-acid-based drug development. Here we describe the discovery of a two-residue, nascent-strand, steric control ‘gate’ in an archaeal DNA polymerase. We show that engineering of the gate to reduce steric bulk in the context of a previously described RNA polymerase activity unlocks the synthesis of 2′-modified RNA oligomers, specifically the efficient synthesis of both defined and random-sequence 2′-O-methyl-RNA (2′OMe-RNA) and 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl)-RNA (MOE-RNA) oligomers up to 750 nt. This enabled the discovery of RNA endonuclease catalysts entirely composed of 2′OMe-RNA (2′OMezymes) for the allele-specific cleavage of oncogenic KRAS (G12D) and β-catenin CTNNB1 (S33Y) mRNAs, and the elaboration of mixed 2′OMe-/MOE-RNA aptamers with high affinity for vascular endothelial growth factor. Our results open up these 2′-modified RNAs—used in several approved nucleic acid therapeutics—for enzymatic synthesis and a wider exploration in directed evolution and nanotechnology. Sterically demanding 2′-modified nucleotides used in antisense therapeutics have thus far been challenging to synthesise enzymatically. Now, it has been shown that mutation of two gatekeeper residues in an archaeal DNA polymerase unlocks efficient synthesis of the modified nucleic acid oligomers 2′-O-methyl-RNA and 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl)-RNA and enables the evolution of 2′-O-methyl-RNA enzymes.},

  abstract     = {Organic room-temperature phosphorescence, a spin-forbidden radiative process, has emerged as an interesting but rare phenomenon with multiple potential applications in optoelectronic devices, biosensing and anticounterfeiting. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with accessible nanoscale porosity and precisely engineered topology can offer unique benefits in the design of phosphorescent materials, but these are presently unexplored. Here, we report an approach of covalent doping, whereby a COF is synthesized by copolymerization of halogenated and unsubstituted phenyldiboronic acids, allowing for random distribution of functionalized units at varying ratios, yielding highly phosphorescent COFs. Such controlled halogen doping enhances the intersystem crossing while minimizing triplet–triplet annihilation by diluting the phosphors. The rigidity of the COF suppresses vibrational relaxation and allows a high phosphorescence quantum yield (ΦPhos ≤ 29%) at room temperature. The permanent porosity of the COFs and the combination of the singlet and triplet emitting channels enable a highly efficient COF-based oxygen sensor, with an ultra-wide dynamic detection range (~103–10−5 torr of partial oxygen pressure). Room-temperature phosphorescence in organic solids is attractive for practical applications but remains rare. Now, highly phosphorescent boroxine-linked covalent organic frameworks have been prepared by covalent doping with halogen atoms through the use of halogenated precursors. The resulting porous COFs exhibited oxygen-sensing capabilities with millisecond response time over a wide range of partial oxygen pressures.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of the DNA double helix has revolutionized our understanding of data processing in living systems, with the complementarity of the two DNA strands providing a reliable mechanism for the storage of hereditary information. Here I reveal the ‘strand commutation’ phenomenon—a fundamentally different mechanism of information storage and processing by DNA/RNA based on the reversible low-affinity interactions of essentially non-complementary nucleic acids. I demonstrate this mechanism by constructing a memory circuit, a 5-min square-root circuit for 4-bit inputs comprising only nine processing ssDNAs, simulating a 572-input AND gate (surpassing the bitness of current electronic computers), and elementary algebra systems with continuously changing variables. Most importantly, I show potential pathways of gene regulation with strands of maximum non-complementarity to the gene sequence that may be key to the reduction of off-target therapeutic effects. This Article uncovers the information-processing power of the low-affinity interactions that may underlie major processes in an organism—from short-term memory to cancer, ageing and evolution. The complementarity of the two strands in the DNA double helix provides a mechanism for the storage and processing of genetic information.

We further demonstrate that pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs from distinct classes can be engineered to direct the co-translational incorporation of diverse alpha hydroxy acids, with both aliphatic and aromatic side chains. We define 49 engineered mutually orthogonal pairs that recognize distinct non-canonical amino acids or alpha hydroxy acids and decode distinct codons.

Macrocyclic peptides can be genetically encoded and synthesized in cells; however, the programmable diversity is limited.

  abstract     = {Unlike classic spins, quantum magnets are spin systems that interact via the exchange interaction and exhibit collective quantum behaviours, such as fractional excitations. Molecular magnetism often stems from d/f-transition metals, but their spin–orbit coupling and crystal field induce a significant magnetic anisotropy, breaking the rotation symmetry of quantum spins. Thus, it is of great importance to build quantum nanomagnets in metal-free systems. Here we have synthesized individual quantum nanomagnets based on metal-free multi-porphyrin systems. Covalent chains of two to five porphyrins were first prepared on Au(111) under ultrahigh vacuum, and hydrogen atoms were then removed from selected carbons using the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope. The conversion of specific porphyrin units to their radical or biradical state enabled the tuning of intra- and inter-porphyrin magnetic coupling. Characterization of the collective magnetic properties of the resulting chains showed that the constructed S = 1/2 antiferromagnets display a gapped excitation, whereas the S = 1 antiferromagnets exhibit distinct end states between even- and odd-numbered spin chains, consistent with Heisenberg model calculations. Quantum nanomagnets, which display collective quantum behaviours, serve as important components in modern quantum technologies, but their fabrication has remained challenging. Quantum nanomagnets have now been constructed spin by spin in metal-free porphyrin chains, using on-surface synthesis and hydrogen manipulation using a scanning tunnelling microscope, and their collective quantum behaviours have been clearly resolved.},

  abstract     = {The photoactivation of electron donor–acceptor complexes has emerged as a sustainable, selective and versatile strategy for the generation of radical species. However, when it comes to aryl radical formation, this strategy remains hamstrung by the electronic properties of the aromatic radical precursors, and electron-deficient aryl halide acceptors are required. This has prevented the implementation of a general synthetic platform for aryl radical formation. Our study introduces triarylsulfonium salts as acceptors in photoactive electron donor–acceptor complexes, used in combination with catalytic amounts of newly designed amine donors. The sulfonium salt label renders inconsequential the electronic features of the aryl radical precursor and, more importantly, it is installed regioselectively in native aromatic compounds by C–H sulfenylation. Using this general, site-selective aromatic C–H functionalization approach, we developed metal-free protocols for the alkylation and cyanation of arenes, and showcased their application in both the synthesis and the late-stage modification of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Photoactivation of EDA complexes was previously limited to electronically biased partners to secure productive charge-transfer interactions. Now, the participation of triarylsulfonium salts—formed by selective C–H sulfenylation—in photoactive EDA complexes with catalytic triarylamine donors provides a site-selective and metal-free strategy for the generation of aryl radicals and the formal C–H functionalization of native arenes.},

We show that sulfonyl fluoride reacts with glycans via a proximity-enabled reactivity, and to harness this a bioreactive unnatural amino acid (SFY) that contains sulfonyl fluoride was genetically encoded into proteins. SFY-incorporated Siglec-7 crosslinked with its sialoglycan ligand specifically in vitro and on the surface of cancer cells. Through irreversible cloaking of sialoglycan at the cancer cell surface, SFY-incorporated Siglec-7 enhanced the killing of cancer cells by natural killer cells. Genetically encoding the chemical crosslinking of proteins to carbohydrates (GECX-sugar) offers a solution to address the low affinity and weak strength of protein–sugar interactions. Protein–carbohydrate interactions remain challenging to study due to their low binding affinity and non-covalent nature. Now, a genetically encoded bioreactive unnatural amino acid containing sulfonyl fluoride has been shown to crosslink a protein with its bound glycan, offering a solution to probe and exploit protein–carbohydrate interactions.},

  abstract     = {Protein–RNA interactions regulate RNA fate and function, and defects can lead to various disorders. Such interactions have mainly been studied by nucleoside-based UV crosslinking methods, which lack broad in vivo compatibility and the ability to resolve specific amino acids. In this study we genetically encoded latent bioreactive unnatural amino acids into proteins to react with bound RNA by proximity-enabled reactivity and demonstrated genetically encoded chemical crosslinking of proteins with target RNA (GECX-RNA) in vivo. Applying GECX-RNA to the RNA chaperone Hfq in Escherichia coli identified target RNAs with amino acid specificity. Combining GECX-RNA with immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing of an N6-methyladenosine reader protein in mammalian cells allowed the in vivo identification of unknown N6-methyladenosine on RNA with single-nucleotide resolution throughout the transcriptome. GECX-RNA thus affords resolution at the nucleotide and amino acid level for interrogating protein–RNA interactions in vivo. It also enables the precise engineering of covalent linkages between a protein and RNA, which will inspire innovative solutions for RNA-related research and therapeutics. Protein–RNA interactions regulate RNA fate and function, and are generally non-covalent and reversible. Genetically introducing a latent bioreactive amino acid into a protein is now shown to enable the protein to covalently crosslink a bound RNA molecule in vivo. This method offers innovative avenues for developing protein–RNA research and applications.},

  abstract     = {The cis/trans geometry of olefins is known to dramatically influence the thermal and mechanical properties of polyalkenamers. Yet, polymerization methods that efficiently control this parameter are scarce. Here we report the development of a stereoretentive acyclic diene metathesis polymerization that uses the reactivity of dithiolate Ru carbenes combined with cis monomers. These Ru catalysts exhibit exquisite retention of the cis geometry and tolerate many polar functional groups, enabling the synthesis of all-cis polyesters, polycarbonates, polyethers and polysulfites. The stereoretentive acyclic diene metathesis polymerization is also characterized by low catalyst loadings and tolerance towards trans impurities in the monomer batch, which should facilitate large-scale implementation. Modulation of the reaction temperature and time leads to an erosion of stereoretention, permitting a stereocontrolled synthesis of polyalkenamers with predictable cis:trans ratios. The impact of the stereochemistry of the repeating alkenes on the thermal properties is clearly demonstrated through differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. Polymerization methods that control the cis/trans stereochemistry of repeating alkenes in polyalkenamers remain scarce. Now, an acyclic diene metathesis process has been developed that enables control over the stereochemistry of the polymer backbone. The method harnesses the reactivity of dithiolate Ru carbenes, in combination with cis,cis-diene monomers, to access several classes of polymers with tailored properties.},
