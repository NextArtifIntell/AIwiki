  abstract     = {Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell immunotherapy is successful at treating many cancers. However, it often induces life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Here, we show that in situ conjugation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the surface of CAR T cells (‘PEGylation’) creates a polymeric spacer that blocks cell-to-cell interactions between CAR T cells, tumour cells and monocytes. Such blockage hinders intensive tumour lysing and monocyte activation by CAR T cells and, consequently, decreases the secretion of toxic cytokines and alleviates CRS-related symptoms. Over time, the slow expansion of CAR T cells decreases PEG surface density and restores CAR T cell–tumour-cell interactions to induce potent tumour killing. This occurs before the restoration of CAR T cell–monocyte interactions, opening a therapeutic window for tumour killing by CAR T cells before monocyte overactivation. Lethal neurotoxicity is also lower when compared with treatment with the therapeutic antibody tocilizumab, demonstrating that in situ PEGylation of CAR T cells provides a materials-based strategy for safer cellular immunotherapy. Polyethylene glycol conjugation to chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells creates a physical block between CAR T cell interactions and other immune and tumour cells, controlling tumour lysis and immune response stimulation to mitigate cytokine release syndrome.},

  abstract     = {Cosmic large-scale structures, animal flocks and living tissues can be considered non-equilibrium organized systems created by dissipative processes. Replicating such properties in artificial systems is still difficult. Herein we report a dissipative network formation process in a dilute polymer–water mixture that leads to percolation-induced gel–gel phase separation. The dilute system, which forms a monophase structure at the percolation threshold, spontaneously separates into two co-continuous gel phases with a submillimetre scale (a dilute-percolated gel) during the deswelling process after the completion of the gelation reaction. The dilute-percolated gel, which contains 99% water, exhibits unexpected hydrophobicity and induces the development of adipose-like tissues in subcutaneous tissues. These findings support the development of dissipative structures with advanced functionalities for distinct applications, ranging from physical chemistry to tissue engineering. A dilute water–polymer mixture exhibits a percolation-induced gel–gel phase separation, resulting in a two gel co-continuous substrate, which is used for adipose tissue development.},

  abstract     = {Protein crystallization plays a central role in structural biology. Despite this, the process of crystallization remains poorly understood and highly empirical, with crystal contacts, lattice packing arrangements and space group preferences being largely unpredictable. Programming protein crystallization through precisely engineered side-chain–side-chain interactions across protein–protein interfaces is an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into &amp;gt;100 µm three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein–protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable. Our approach enables the computational design of protein crystals with high accuracy, and the designed protein crystals, which have both structural and assembly information encoded in their primary sequences, provide a powerful platform for biological materials engineering. The process of protein crystallization is poorly understood and difficult to program through the primary sequence. Here the authors develop a computational approach to designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures with high accuracy.},

Plastrons have typically been considered impractical for underwater engineering applications due to their metastable performance. Here, we describe aerophilic titanium alloy (Ti) surfaces with extended plastron lifetimes that are conserved for months underwater. Long-term stability is achieved by the formation of highly rough hierarchically structured surfaces via electrochemical anodization combined with a low-surface-energy coating produced by a fluorinated surfactant. Aerophilic Ti surfaces drastically reduce blood adhesion and, when submerged in water, prevent adhesion of bacteria and marine organisms such as barnacles and mussels. Overall, we demonstrate a general strategy to achieve the long-term stability of plastrons on aerophilic surfaces for previously unattainable underwater applications. Trapped films of air known as plastrons are promising for underwater engineering but typically have short lifetimes.

  abstract     = {The thermal distillation of crude oil mixtures is an energy-intensive process, accounting for nearly 1% of global energy consumption. Membrane-based separations are an appealing alternative or tandem process to distillation due to intrinsic energy efficiency advantages. We developed a family of spirocyclic polytriazoles from structurally diverse monomers for membrane applications. The resulting polymers were prepared by a convenient step-growth method using copper-catalysed azide–alkyne cycloaddition, providing very fast reaction rates, high molecular weights and solubilities in common organic solvents and non-interconnected microporosity. Fractionation of whole Arabian light crude oil and atmospheric tower bottom feeds using these materials enriched the low-boiling-point components and removed trace heteroatom and metal impurities (comparable performance with the lighter feed as the commercial polyimide, Matrimid), demonstrating opportunities to reduce the energy cost of crude oil distillation with tandem membrane processes. Membrane-based molecular separation under these demanding conditions is made possible by high thermal stability and a moderate level of dynamic chain mobility, leading to transient interconnections between micropores, as revealed by the calculations of static and swollen pore structures. Thermal fractionation of petroleum consumes large amounts of energy. Here stable microporous polymers are synthesized using click chemistry, which have similar performance to commercial polyimides for the fractionation of light crude oils and successful application to heavy feeds under realistic conditions.},

Here, we reveal a unique micelle-like structure in a localized high-concentration electrolyte, in which the solvent acts as a surfactant between an insoluble salt in a diluent. The miscibility of the solvent with the diluent and simultaneous solubility of the salt results in a micelle-like structure with a smeared interface and an increased salt concentration at the centre of the salt–solvent clusters that extends the salt solubility. These intermingling miscibility effects have temperature dependencies, wherein a typical localized high-concentration electrolyte peaks in localized cluster salt concentration near room temperature and is used to form a stable solid–electrolyte interphase on a Li metal anode. These findings serve as a guide to predicting a stable ternary phase diagram and connecting the electrolyte microstructure with electrolyte formulation and formation protocols of solid–electrolyte interphases for enhanced battery cyclability. Liquid electrolytes in batteries are considered to be macroscopically homogeneous ionic transport media despite having a complex chemical composition and atomistic solvation structures.

  abstract     = {The advantage of a membrane/catalyst system in the oxidative coupling of methane compared with conventional reactive systems is that by introducing oxygen into the catalytic sites through a membrane, the parasitic gas-phase reactions of O2(g)—responsible for lowering product selectivity—can be avoided. The design and fabrication of membrane/catalyst systems has, however, been hampered by low volumetric chemical conversion rates, high capital cost and difficulties in co-designing membrane and catalyst properties to optimize the performance. Here we solve these issues by developing a dual-layer additive manufacturing process, based on phase inversion, to design, fabricate and optimize a hollow-fibre membrane/catalyst system for the oxidative coupling of methane. We demonstrate the approach through a case study using BaCe0.8Gd0.2O3–δ as the basis of both catalyst and separation layers. We show that by using the manufacturing approach, we can co-design the membrane thickness and catalyst surface area so that the flux of oxygen transport through the membrane and methane activation rates in the catalyst layer match each other. We demonstrate that this ‘rate matching’ is critical for maximizing the performance, with the membrane/catalyst system substantially overperforming conventional reactor designs under identical conditions. Membrane/catalyst systems in the oxidative coupling of methane are promising for their high product selectivity but suffer from low volumetric chemical conversion rates, high capital cost and optimizing performance. A dual-layer additive manufacturing process, based on phase inversion, is now proposed to optimize a hollow-fibre membrane/catalyst system.},

The size of the chemical space of PH anions (&amp;gt;106 molecules) has so far limited attempts to explore the full family of candidate molecules. We created a machine learning workflow to speed up the discovery process using full-density functional theory calculations for training the model. The physics-informed machine learning model allowed us to pinpoint promising molecules with a head group that prevents lattice distortion and anti-site defect formation, and a tail group optimized for strong attachment to the surface. We identified 15 potential bifunctional PH anions with the ability to passivate both donors and acceptors, and through experimentation, discovered that sodium thioglycolate was the most effective passivant. This strategy resulted in a power-conversion efficiency of 24.56% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.19 volts (24.04% National Renewable Energy Lab-certified quasi-steady-state) in inverted perovskite solar cells. Encapsulated devices maintained 96% of their initial power-conversion energy during 900 hours of one-sun operation at the maximum power point. Pseudo-halide anion engineering is an effective surface passivation strategy for perovskite-based optoelectronics but the large chemical space of molecules limits its potential.

Although dedicated electronic hardware has inspired the development of in-memory computing and in-sensor computing, folding the entire signal chain into one device remains challenging. Here an in-memory sensing and computing architecture is demonstrated using ferroelectric-defined reconfigurable two-dimensional photodiode arrays. High-level cognitive computing is realized based on the multiplications of light power and photoresponsivity through the photocurrent generation process and Kirchhoff’s law. The weight is stored and programmed locally by the ferroelectric domains, enabling 51 (&amp;gt;5 bit) distinguishable weight states with linear, symmetric and reversible manipulation characteristics. Image recognition can be performed without any external memory and computing units. The three-in-one paradigm, integrating high-level computing, weight memorization and high-performance sensing, paves the way for a computing architecture with low energy consumption, low latency and reduced hardware overhead. It remains challenging to integrate memory, sensing and computing in one device.

  abstract     = {Material surfaces encompass structural and chemical discontinuities that often lead to the loss of the property of interest in so-called dead layers. It is particularly problematic in nanoscale oxide electronics, where the integration of strongly correlated materials into devices is obstructed by the thickness threshold required for the emergence of their functionality. Here we report the stabilization of ultrathin out-of-plane ferroelectricity in oxide heterostructures through the design of an artificial flux-closure architecture. Inserting an in-plane-polarized ferroelectric epitaxial buffer provides the continuity of polarization at the interface; despite its insulating nature, we observe the emergence of polarization in our out-of-plane-polarized model of ferroelectric BaTiO3 from the very first unit cell. In BiFeO3, the flux-closure approach stabilizes a 251° domain wall. Its unusual chirality is probably associated with the ferroelectric analogue to the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction. We, thus, see that in an adaptively engineered geometry, the depolarizing-field-screening properties of an insulator can even surpass those of a metal and be a source of functionality. This could be a useful insight on the road towards the next generation of oxide electronics. Ferroelectric dead layers can form at perovskite interfaces—a major challenge in integrating oxide thin films into devices. Here, by depositing an in-plane-polarized epitaxial buffer layer of Bi5FeTi3O15, out-of-plane polarization is demonstrated in ultrathin films down to the single-unit-cell level.},

  abstract     = {Van der Waals (vdW) materials have opened up many avenues for discovery through layer assembly, as epitomized by interlayer dipolar excitons that exhibit electrically tunable luminescence, lasing and exciton condensation. Extending interlayer excitons to more vdW layers, however, raises fundamental questions concerning coherence within excitons and coupling between moiré superlattices at multiple interfaces. Here, by assembling angle-aligned WSe2/WS2/WSe2 heterotrilayers, we demonstrate the emergence of quadrupolar excitons. We confirm the exciton’s quadrupolar nature by the decrease in its energy of 12 meV from coherent hole tunnelling between the two outer layers, its tunable static dipole moment under an external electric field and the reduced exciton–exciton interactions. At high exciton density, we also see signatures of a phase of oppositely aligned dipolar excitons, consistent with a staggered dipolar phase predicted to be driven by attractive dipolar interactions. Our demonstration paves the way for discovering emergent exciton orderings for three vdW layers and beyond. The authors report the emergence of quadrupolar excitons in angle-aligned WSe2/WS2/WSe2 heterotrilayers characterized by a delocalized hole residing in both outer WSe2 layers, electric-field tunability and reduced exciton–exciton interactions.},

  abstract     = {Strongly bound excitons determine light–matter interactions in van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional semiconductors. Unlike fundamental particles, quasiparticles in condensed matter, such as excitons, can be tailored to alter their interactions and realize emergent quantum phases. Here, using a WS2/WSe2/WS2 heterotrilayer, we create a quantum superposition of oppositely oriented dipolar excitons—a quadrupolar exciton—wherein an electron is layer-hybridized in WS2 layers while the hole localizes in WSe2. In contrast to dipolar excitons, symmetric quadrupolar excitons only redshift in an out-of-plane electric field. At higher densities and a finite electric field, the nonlinear Stark shift of quadrupolar excitons becomes linear, signalling a transition to dipolar excitons resulting from exciton–exciton interactions, while at a vanishing electric field, the reduced exchange interaction suggests antiferroelectric correlations between dipolar excitons. Our results present van der Waals heterotrilayers as a field-tunable platform to engineer light–matter interactions and explore quantum phase transitions between spontaneously ordered many-exciton phases. The authors report the emergence of quadrupolar excitons in WS2/WSe2/WS2 trilayer heterostructures where the electron is layer-hybridized in WS2 layers and the hole localizes in WSe2. Quadrupolar excitons exhibit distinct behaviour under electric fields, enriching exciton–exciton interactions.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional (3D) hetero-integration technology is poised to revolutionize the field of electronics by stacking functional layers vertically, thereby creating novel 3D circuity architectures with high integration density and unparalleled multifunctionality. However, the conventional 3D integration technique involves complex wafer processing and intricate interlayer wiring. Here we demonstrate monolithic 3D integration of two-dimensional, material-based artificial intelligence (AI)-processing hardware with ultimate integrability and multifunctionality. A total of six layers of transistor and memristor arrays were vertically integrated into a 3D nanosystem to perform AI tasks, by peeling and stacking of AI processing layers made from bottom-up synthesized two-dimensional materials. This fully monolithic-3D-integrated AI system substantially reduces processing time, voltage drops, latency and footprint due to its densely packed AI processing layers with dense interlayer connectivity. The successful demonstration of this monolithic-3D-integrated AI system will not only provide a material-level solution for hetero-integration of electronics, but also pave the way for unprecedented multifunctional computing hardware with ultimate parallelism. Monolithic 3D integration of electronics based on fully 2D materials is demonstrated in the performance of artificial intelligence tasks.},

  abstract     = {Twist angle between two-dimensional layers is a critical parameter that determines their interfacial properties, such as moiré excitons and interfacial ferro-electricity. To achieve better control over these properties for fundamental studies and various applications, considerable efforts have been made to manipulate twist angle. However, due to mechanical limitations and the inevitable formation of incommensurate regions, there remains a challenge in attaining perfect alignment of crystalline orientation. Here we report a thermally induced atomic reconstruction of randomly stacked transition metal dichalcogenide multilayers into fully commensurate heterostructures with zero twist angle by encapsulation annealing, regardless of twist angles of as-stacked samples and lattice mismatches. We also demonstrate the selective formation of R- and H-type fully commensurate phases with a seamless lateral junction using chemical vapour-deposited transition metal dichalcogenides. The resulting fully commensurate phases exhibit strong photoluminescence enhancement of the interlayer excitons, even at room temperature, due to their commensurate structure with aligned momentum coordinates. Our work not only demonstrates a way to fabricate zero-twisted, two-dimensional bilayers with R- and H-type configurations, but also provides a platform for studying their unexplored properties. Encapsulation annealing leads to atomic reconstruction of transition metal dichalcogenide layers into fully commensurate structures with zero twist angle, enabling control over interfacial properties.},

Colloidal robots are particles capable of functions such as sensing, computation, communication, locomotion and energy management that are all controlled by the particle itself. Their design and synthesis is an emerging area of interdisciplinary research drawing from materials science, colloid science, self-assembly, robophysics and control theory. Many colloidal robot systems approach synthetic versions of biological cells in autonomy and may find ultimate utility in bringing these specialized functions to previously inaccessible locations. This Perspective examines the emerging literature and highlights certain design principles and strategies towards the realization of colloidal robots.

  abstract     = {X-ray-induced afterglow and radiodynamic therapy tackle the tissue penetration issue of optical imaging and phototherapy. However, inorganic nanophosphors used in this therapy have their radio afterglow dynamic function as always on, limiting the detection specificity and treatment efficacy. Here we report organic luminophores (IDPAs) with near-infrared afterglow and 1O2 production after X-ray irradiation for cancer theranostics. The in vivo radio afterglow of IDPAs is &amp;gt;25.0 times brighter than reported inorganic nanophosphors, whereas the radiodynamic production of 1O2 is &amp;gt;5.7 times higher than commercially available radio sensitizers. The modular structure of IDPAs permits the development of a smart molecular probe that only triggers its radio afterglow dynamic function in the presence of a cancer biomarker. Thus, the probe enables the ultrasensitive detection of a diminutive tumour (0.64 mm) with superb contrast (tumour-to-background ratio of 234) and tumour-specific radiotherapy for brain tumour with molecular precision at low dosage. Our work reveals the molecular guidelines towards organic radio afterglow agents and highlights new opportunities for cancer radio theranostics. Organic luminophores emit a bright near-infrared afterglow after X-ray irradiation and outperform commercially available radio sensitizers by producing higher levels of singlet oxygen, having potential applications in precision cancer theranostics.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix dictate tissue behaviour. In epithelial tissues, laminin is a very abundant extracellular matrix component and a key supporting element. Here we show that laminin hinders the mechanoresponses of breast epithelial cells by shielding the nucleus from mechanical deformation. Coating substrates with laminin-111—unlike fibronectin or collagen I—impairs cell response to substrate rigidity and YAP nuclear localization. Blocking the laminin-specific integrin β4 increases nuclear YAP ratios in a rigidity-dependent manner without affecting the cell forces or focal adhesions. By combining mechanical perturbations and mathematical modelling, we show that β4 integrins establish a mechanical linkage between the substrate and keratin cytoskeleton, which stiffens the network and shields the nucleus from actomyosin-mediated mechanical deformation. In turn, this affects the nuclear YAP mechanoresponses, chromatin methylation and cell invasion in three dimensions. Our results demonstrate a mechanism by which tissues can regulate their sensitivity to mechanical signals. Laminin, an important component of the extracellular matrix supporting the epithelium, hinders the typical mechanoresponse of epithelial cells to an increase in substrate stiffness, by protecting the cell nucleus from mechanical deformation.},

  abstract     = {Demixing binary liquids is a ubiquitous transition explained using a well-established thermodynamic formalism that requires the equality of intensive thermodynamics parameters across phase boundaries. Demixing transitions also occur when binary fluid mixtures are driven away from equilibrium, but predicting and designing such out-of-equilibrium transitions remains a challenge. Here we study the liquid–liquid phase separation of attractive DNA nanostars driven away from equilibrium using a microtubule-based active fluid. We find that activity lowers the critical temperature and narrows the range of coexistence concentrations, but only in the presence of mechanical bonds between the liquid droplets and reconfiguring active fluid. Similar behaviours are observed in numerical simulations, suggesting that the activity suppression of the critical point is a generic feature of active liquid–liquid phase separation. Our work describes a versatile platform for building soft active materials with feedback control and providing an insight into self-organization in cell biology. The rational design of out-of-equilibrium demixing transitions remains challenging. Active fluids are used to control the liquid–liquid phase separation of passive DNA nanostars and establish the activity-based control of the phase diagram.},

  abstract     = {Our lives cannot be imagined without polymer networks, which range widely, from synthetic rubber to biological tissues. Their properties—elasticity, strain-stiffening and stretchability—are controlled by a convolution of chemical composition, strand conformation and network topology. Yet, since the discovery of rubber vulcanization by Charles Goodyear in 1839, the internal organization of networks has remained a sealed ‘black box’. While many studies show how network properties respond to topology variation, no method currently exists that would allow the decoding of the network structure from its properties. We address this problem by analysing networks’ nonlinear responses to deformation to quantify their crosslink density, strand flexibility and fraction of stress-supporting strands. The decoded structural information enables the quality control of network synthesis, comparison of targeted to actual architecture and network classification according to the effectiveness of stress distribution. The developed forensic approach is a vital step in future implementation of artificial intelligence principles for soft matter design. Extracting information about polymer network topology from mechanical properties alone remains challenging. Here the authors develop a forensic approach to quantify network structural information by analysing their nonlinear mechanics.},

ZIF thin films have been intensively pursued, motivated by the desire to prepare membranes for selective gas and liquid separations. To achieve membranes with high throughput, as in ångström-scale biological channels with nanometre-scale path lengths, ZIF films with the minimum possible thickness—down to just one unit cell—are highly desired. However, the state-of-the-art methods yield membranes where ZIF films have thickness exceeding 50 nm. Here we report a crystallization method from ultradilute precursor mixtures, which exploits registry with the underlying crystalline substrate, yielding (within minutes) crystalline ZIF films with thickness down to that of a single structural building unit (2 nm). The film crystallized on graphene has a rigid aperture made of a six-membered zinc imidazolate coordination ring, enabling high-permselective H2 separation performance. The method reported here will probably accelerate the development of two-dimensional metal–organic framework films for efficient membrane separation. Unit-cell-thick films of metal–organic frameworks with ordered porosity would be attractive for membrane applications as these thin systems combine large molecular flux with high selectivity. Here crystalline ZIF films are grown on a crystalline substrate with high H2/N2 gas separation performance.},

PET tape is selected since it has suitable mechanical and electrical properties, but its chemical stability has been largely overlooked. In the absence of effective electrolyte additives, PET can depolymerize into its monomer dimethyl terephthalate, which is an unwanted redox shuttle that induces substantial self-discharge in a lithium-ion cell. This study presents a chemical screening experiment to probe the PET decomposition mechanism involving in situ generated methanol and lithium methoxide from dimethyl carbonate, one of the most common electrolyte solvents in lithium-ion cells. By screening other polymers, it is found that polypropylene and polyimide (Kapton) are stable in the electrolyte. Finally, it is demonstrated that reversible self-discharge of LiFePO4–graphite cells can be virtually eliminated by replacing PET jellyroll tape with chemically stable polypropylene tape. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) tape is widely used for lithium-ion batteries but its chemical stability has been largely overlooked.

Although their anionic redox mechanisms have been much investigated, the roles of cationic redox processes remain underexplored, hindering further performance improvement. Here we decoupled the effects of nickel and cobalt in lithium-rich NMCs via a comprehensive study of two typical compounds, Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 and Li1.2Co0.4Mn0.4O2. We discovered that both Ni3+/4+ and Co4+, generated during cationic redox processes, are actually intermediate species for triggering oxygen redox through a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer process. However, cobalt is better than nickel in mediating the kinetics of ligand-to-metal charge transfer by favouring more transition metal migration, leading to less cationic redox but more oxygen redox, more O2 release, poorer cycling performance and more severe voltage decay. Our work highlights a compositional optimization pathway for lithium-rich NMCs by deviating from using cobalt to using nickel, providing valuable guidelines for future high-capacity cathode design. Lithium-rich nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathodes are widely explored due to their high capacities related to their anionic redox chemistry. A compositional optimization pathway for these materials investigating the variation of using cobalt and nickel now provides valuable guidelines for future high-capacity cathode design.},

  abstract     = {Evidence shows that charge carriers in organic semiconductors self-localize because of dynamic disorder. Nevertheless, some organic semiconductors feature reduced mobility at increasing temperature, a hallmark for delocalized band transport. Here we present the temperature-dependent mobility in two record-mobility organic semiconductors: dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene (DNTT) and its alkylated derivative, C8-DNTT-C8. By combining terahertz photoconductivity measurements with atomistic non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, we show that while both crystals display a power-law decrease of the mobility (μ) with temperature (T) following μ ∝ T −n, the exponent n differs substantially. Modelling reveals that the differences between the two chemically similar semiconductors can be traced to the delocalization of the different states that are thermally accessible by charge carriers, which in turn depends on their specific electronic band structure. The emerging picture is that of holes surfing on a dynamic manifold of vibrationally dressed extended states with a temperature-dependent mobility that provides a sensitive fingerprint for the underlying density of states. Dynamic disorder reduces the carrier mobility in organic semiconductors (OSs) to an extent that depends on their specific electronic band structure. Here the authors study the temperature-dependent hole mobility of two structurally similar OSs and find that thermal access to transiently delocalized states enhances hole mobility in C8-DNTT-C8 compared to DNTT.},

Instead, inspired by the air entrapment phenomenon on the surfaces of submerged lotus leaves, we designed a pressure sensor that uses the solid–liquid–liquid–gas multiphasic interfaces and the trapped elastic air layer to modulate capacitance changes with pressure at the interfaces. By creating an ultraslippery interface and structuring the electrodes at the nanoscale and microscale, we achieve near-friction-free contact line motion and thus near-ideal pressure-sensing performance. Using a closed-cell pillar array structure in synergy with the ultraslippery electrode surface, our sensor achieved outstanding linearity (R2 = 0.99944 ± 0.00015; nonlinearity, 1.49 ± 0.17%) while simultaneously possessing ultralow hysteresis (1.34 ± 0.20%) and very high sensitivity (79.1 ± 4.3 pF kPa−1). The sensor can operate under turbulent flow, in in vivo biological environments and during laparoscopic procedures. We anticipate that such a strategy will enable ultrasensitive and ultraprecise pressure monitoring in complex fluid environments with performance beyond the reach of the current state-of-the-art. Solid-state pressure sensors have performance limitations in liquid environments.

  abstract     = {The tunability of materials properties by light promises a wealth of future applications in energy conversion and information technology. Strongly correlated materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides offer optical control of electronic phases, charge ordering and interlayer correlations by photodoping. Here, we find the emergence of a transient hexatic state during the laser-induced transformation between two charge-density wave phases in a thin-film transition metal dichalcogenide, 1T-type tantalum disulfide (1T-TaS2). Introducing tilt-series ultrafast nanobeam electron diffraction, we reconstruct charge-density wave rocking curves at high momentum resolution. An intermittent suppression of three-dimensional structural correlations promotes a loss of in-plane translational order caused by a high density of unbound topological defects, characteristic of a hexatic intermediate. Our results demonstrate the merit of tomographic ultrafast structural probing in tracing coupled order parameters, heralding universal nanoscale access to laser-induced dimensionality control in functional heterostructures and devices. The authors report the emergence of a transient hexatic state during laser-induced transformation between two charge-density wave (CDW) phases in a thin film of the CDW material 1T-TaS2.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state quantum emitters have emerged as a leading quantum memory for quantum networking applications. However, standard optical characterization techniques are neither efficient nor repeatable at scale. Here we introduce and demonstrate spectroscopic techniques that enable large-scale, automated characterization of colour centres. We first demonstrate the ability to track colour centres by registering them to a fabricated machine-readable global coordinate system, enabling a systematic comparison of the same colour centre sites over many experiments. We then implement resonant photoluminescence excitation in a widefield cryogenic microscope to parallelize resonant spectroscopy, achieving two orders of magnitude speed-up over confocal microscopy. Finally, we demonstrate automated chip-scale characterization of colour centres and devices at room temperature, imaging thousands of microscope fields of view. These tools will enable the accelerated identification of useful quantum emitters at chip scale, enabling advances in scaling up colour centre platforms for quantum information applications, materials science and device design and characterization. Employing a widefield cryogenic microscope to parallelize resonant spectroscopy, chip-scale automated optical characterization of solid-state quantum emitters is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Identifying the essential components of superconductivity in graphene-based systems remains a critical problem in two-dimensional materials research. This field is connected to the mysteries that underpin investigations of unconventional superconductivity in condensed-matter physics. Superconductivity has been observed in magic-angle twisted stacks of monolayer graphene but conspicuously not in twisted stacks of bilayer graphene, although both systems host topological flat bands and symmetry-broken states. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity in twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) in proximity to WSe2. Samples with twist angles 1.24° and 1.37° superconduct in small pockets of the gate-tuned phase diagram within the valence and conduction band, respectively. Superconductivity emerges from unpolarized phases near van Hove singularities and next to regions with broken isospin symmetry. Our results show the correlation between a high density of states and the emergence of superconductivity in TDBG while revealing a possible role for isospin fluctuations in the pairing. The authors use low-temperature transport measurements to report superconductivity in a twisted double bilayer graphene system.},

However, the lab to fab transition of 2D semiconductors is still in its preliminary stages, and it has been challenging to meet manufacturing standards of stability and repeatability. Thus, there is a natural eagerness to grow wafer-level, high-quality films with industrially acceptable scale–cost–performance metrics. Here we report an improved chemical vapour deposition synthesis method in which the controlled release of precursors and substrates predeposited with amorphous Al2O3 ensure the uniform synthesis of monolayer MoS2 as large as 12 inches while also enabling fast and non-toxic growth to reduce manufacturing costs. Transistor arrays were fabricated to further confirm the high quality of the film and its integrated circuit application potential. This work achieves the co-optimization of scale–cost–performance metrics and lays the foundation for advancing the integration of 2D semiconductors in industry-standard pilot lines. A route to the rapid and batch production of 12 inch MoS2 monolayers is reported, which shows a synergistic optimization of scale–cost–performance metrics for a transition from lab to fab.},

  abstract     = {Materials that possess the ability to self-heal cracks at room temperature, akin to living organisms, are highly sought after. However, achieving crack self-healing in inorganic materials, particularly with covalent bonds, presents a great challenge and often necessitates high temperatures and considerable atomic diffusion. Here we conducted a quantitative evaluation of the room-temperature self-healing behaviour of a fractured nanotwinned diamond composite, revealing that the self-healing properties of the composite stem from both the formation of nanoscale diamond osteoblasts comprising sp2- and sp3-hybridized carbon atoms at the fractured surfaces, and the atomic interaction transition from repulsion to attraction when the two fractured surfaces come into close proximity. The self-healing process resulted in a remarkable recovery of approximately 34% in tensile strength for the nanotwinned diamond composite. This discovery sheds light on the self-healing capability of nanostructured diamond, offering valuable insights for future research endeavours aimed at enhancing the toughness and durability of brittle ceramic materials. The room-temperature self-healing behaviour of a nanotwinned diamond composite is quantitatively evaluated and found to stem from both the formation of nanoscale diamond osteoblasts and the atomic interaction transition from repulsion to attraction.},

  abstract     = {Quantum light emitters capable of generating single photons with circular polarization and non-classical statistics could enable non-reciprocal single-photon devices and deterministic spin–photon interfaces for quantum networks. To date, the emission of such chiral quantum light relies on the application of intense external magnetic fields, electrical/optical injection of spin-polarized carriers/excitons or coupling with complex photonic metastructures. Here we report the creation of free-space chiral quantum light emitters via the nanoindentation of monolayer WSe2/NiPS3 heterostructures at zero external magnetic field. These quantum light emitters emit with a high degree of circular polarization (0.89) and single-photon purity (95%), independent of pump laser polarization. Scanning diamond nitrogen-vacancy microscopy and temperature-dependent magneto-photoluminescence studies reveal that the chiral quantum light emission arises from magnetic proximity interactions between localized excitons in the WSe2 monolayer and the out-of-plane magnetization of defects in the antiferromagnetic order of NiPS3, both of which are co-localized by strain fields associated with the nanoscale indentations. Proximity-induced chiral quantum emission is generated by applying nanoindentation on monolayer WSe2 on an antiferromagnetic van der Waals material (NiPS3) at zero external magnetic fields, reporting a degree of circular polarization of 0.89 and a single-photon purity of 95%.},

While markets, including the Internet of Things, transparent solar and flexible displays, gain momentum, organic light-emitting diode displays lead the way, with a current market size of over $25 billion, helping to create the infrastructure and ecosystem for other applications to follow. It is imperative to design built-in sustainability into the materials selection, processing and device architectures of all of these emerging applications, and to close the loop for a circular approach. In this Perspective, we evaluate the status of embedded carbon in organic electronics, as well as options for more sustainable materials and manufacturing, including engineered recycling solutions that can be applied within the product architecture and at the end of life. This emerging industry has a responsibility to ensure a ‘cradle-to-cradle’ approach. We highlight that ease of dismantling and recycling needs to closely relate to the product lifetime, and that regeneration should be facilitated in product design. Materials choices should consider the environmental effects of synthesis, processing and end-product recycling as well as performance. It is imperative that sustainability issues are considered throughout the life cycle of modern organic electronic devices. Here McCulloch and colleagues evaluate the status of embedded carbon, options for more sustainable materials, and recycling solutions both during manufacturing and at the end of life in organic electronic products.},

To realize the transformational impact of wearable e-textiles, materials innovations can pave the way for effective user adoption and the creation of a sustainable circular economy. We propose a repair, recycle, replacement and reduction circular e-textile paradigm. We envisage a systematic design framework embodying material selection and biofabrication concepts that can unify environmental friendliness, market viability, supply-chain resilience and user experience quality. This framework establishes a set of actionable principles for the industrialization and commercialization of future sustainable e-textile products.

  abstract     = {Nanoparticles enter tumours through endothelial cells, gaps or other mechanisms, but how they exit is unclear. The current paradigm states that collapsed tumour lymphatic vessels impair the exit of nanoparticles and lead to enhanced retention. Here we show that nanoparticles exit the tumour through the lymphatic vessels within or surrounding the tumour. The dominant lymphatic exit mechanism depends on the nanoparticle size. Nanoparticles that exit the tumour through the lymphatics are returned to the blood system, allowing them to recirculate and interact with the tumour in another pass. Our results enable us to define a mechanism of nanoparticle delivery to solid tumours alternative to the enhanced permeability and retention effect. We call this mechanism the active transport and retention principle. This delivery principle provides a new framework to engineer nanomedicines for cancer treatment and detection. Nanoparticle retention inside tumours has been associated with lymphatic vessel collapse. It is now shown that nanoparticles exit from solid tumours through lymphatic vessels in or surrounding the tumour by a nanoparticle-size-dependent mechanism.},

Despite advances in hydrogel technology in recent years, their application is often severely limited by inadequate mechanical properties and time-consuming fabrication processes. Here we report a rapid hydrogel preparation strategy that achieves the simultaneous photo-crosslinking and establishment of biomimetic soft–hard material interface microstructures. These biomimetic interfacial-bonding nanocomposite hydrogels are prepared within seconds and feature clearly separated phases but have a strongly bonded interface. Due to effective interphase load transfer, biomimetic interfacial-bonding nanocomposite gels achieve an ultrahigh toughness (138 MJ m−3) and exceptional tensile strength (15.31 MPa) while maintaining a structural stability that rivals or surpasses that of commonly used elastomer (non-hydrated) materials. Biomimetic interfacial-bonding nanocomposite gels can be fabricated into arbitrarily complex structures via three-dimensional printing with micrometre-level precision. Overall, this work presents a generalizable preparation strategy for hydrogel materials and acrylic elastomers that will foster potential advances in soft materials. Hydrogels are promising materials but are often limited by inadequate mechanical properties and time-consuming fabrication processes.

However, using existing transformation mechanisms to program a single geometry to transform into diverse final configurations remains challenging, imposing crucial design restrictions on achieving versatile functionalities. Here, we present a programmable strategy for wide-spectrum reconfigurable micro-metastructures using linearly responsive transparent hydrogels as artificial muscles. Actuated by the hydrogel, the transformation of micro-metastructures arises from the collaborative buckling of their building blocks. Rationally designing the three-dimensional printing parameters and geometry features of the metastructures enables their locally isotropic or anisotropic deformation, allowing controllable wide-spectrum pattern transformation with programmable chirality and optical anisotropy. This reconfiguration mechanism can be applied to various materials with a wide range of mechanical properties. Our strategy enables a thermally reconfigurable printed metalattice with pixel-by-pixel mapping of different printing powers and angles for displaying or hiding complex information, providing opportunities for encryption, miniature robotics, photonics and phononics applications. It is difficult to program a single stimuli-responsive geometry to transform into diverse final configurations in a systematic manner.

However, only indirect and ensemble measurements operate in such extreme confinement, calling for novel optical approaches that enable direct imaging at the molecular level. Here we harness fluorescence originating from single-photon emitters at the surface of hexagonal boron nitride for molecular imaging and sensing in nanometrically confined liquids. The emission originates from the chemisorption of organic solvent molecules onto native surface defects, revealing single-molecule dynamics at the interface through the spatially correlated activation of neighbouring defects. Emitter spectra further offer a direct readout of the local dielectric properties, unveiling increasing dielectric order under nanometre-scale confinement. Liquid-activated native hexagonal boron nitride defects bridge the gap between solid-state nanophotonics and nanofluidics, opening new avenues for nanoscale sensing and optofluidics. Two-dimensional crystals of hexagonal boron nitride become fluorescent when immersed in common solvents. Now, this phenomenon is used in the design of in-liquid sensors operating at the nanometre scale.},

  abstract     = {Organic electronics can be biocompatible and conformable, enhancing the ability to interface with tissue. However, the limitations of speed and integration have, thus far, necessitated reliance on silicon-based technologies for advanced processing, data transmission and device powering. Here we create a stand-alone, conformable, fully organic bioelectronic device capable of realizing these functions. This device, vertical internal ion-gated organic electrochemical transistor (vIGT), is based on a transistor architecture that incorporates a vertical channel and a miniaturized hydration access conduit to enable megahertz-signal-range operation within densely packed integrated arrays in the absence of crosstalk. These transistors demonstrated long-term stability in physiologic media, and were used to generate high-performance integrated circuits. We leveraged the high-speed and low-voltage operation of vertical internal ion-gated organic electrochemical transistors to develop alternating-current-powered conformable circuitry to acquire and wirelessly communicate signals. The resultant stand-alone device was implanted in freely moving rodents to acquire, process and transmit neurophysiologic brain signals. Such fully organic devices have the potential to expand the utility and accessibility of bioelectronics to a wide range of clinical and societal applications. Organic electronic devices enhance biocompatibility, but have to rely on silicon-based technologies to improve limited speed and integration. This problem is overcome by creating a stand-alone, wireless, conformable, fully organic bioelectronic device with high electronic performance, scalability, stability and conformability in physiologic media.},

Membrane technology could be a desirable alternative with potentially lower energy consumption. However, the current key obstacle for industrial implementation of membrane technology is the low mixed-gas selectivity of polymeric, inorganic or hybrid membrane materials, arising from the similar sizes of ethylene (3.75 Å) and ethane (3.85 Å). Here we report precise molecular sieving and plasticization-resistant carbon membranes made by pyrolysing a shape-persistent three-dimensional triptycene-based ladder polymer of intrinsic microporosity with unparalleled mixed-gas performance for ethylene/ethane separation, with a selectivity of ~100 at 10 bar feed pressure, and with long-term continuous stability for 30 days demonstrated. These submicroporous carbon membranes offer opportunities for membrane technology in a wide range of notoriously difficult separation applications in the petrochemical and natural gas industry. Ethylene separation from ethane is the most energy-intensive separation in the chemical process industry, but so far membranes have not exceeded an ethylene/ethane selectivity of &amp;gt;20 in mixed gases. Here a carbon molecular sieve with an ethylene selectivity of ~100 and long-term stability under high-pressure gas is reported.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots are robust emitters implemented in numerous prototype and commercial optoelectronic devices. However, active fluorescence colour tuning, achieved so far by electric-field-induced Stark effect, has been limited to a small spectral range, and accompanied by intensity reduction due to the electron–hole charge separation effect. Utilizing quantum dot molecules that manifest two coupled emission centres, we present a unique electric-field-induced instantaneous colour-switching effect. Reversible emission colour switching without intensity loss is achieved on a single-particle level, as corroborated by correlated electron microscopy imaging. Simulations establish that this is due to the electron wavefunction toggling between the two centres, induced by the electric field, and affected by the coupling strength. Quantum dot molecules manifesting two coupled emission centres may be tailored to emit distinct colours, opening the path for sensitive field sensing and colour-switchable devices such as a novel pixel design for displays or an electric-field-induced colour-tunable single-photon source. Current quantum dot emitters are limited to small-spectral-range colour tuning accompanied by intensity reduction. Electric-field-induced reversible emission colour switching without intensity loss can be achieved on a single-particle level in quantum dot molecules with two coupled emission centres.},

  abstract     = {Topological photonics is rapidly expanding. However, discovering three-dimensional topological electromagnetic systems can be more challenging than electronic systems for two reasons. First, the vectorial nature of electromagnetic waves results in complicated band dispersions, and simple tight-binding-type predictions usually fail. Second, topological electromagnetic surface modes inside the light cone have very low quality factors (Q factors). Here, we propose the concept of scalar topological photonics to address these challenges. Our approach is experimentally validated by employing a nested meta-crystal configuration using connected coaxial waveguides. They exhibit scalar-wave-like band dispersions, making the search for photonic topological phases an easier task. Their surface states have skyrmion-like electric field distributions, resulting in a whole, bright surface state band inside the light cone continuum. As such, the topological surface states in our three-dimensional nested crystals can be exposed to air, making such systems well-suited for practical applications. Employing connected coaxial waveguides on a nested meta-crystal configuration, the authors design photonic crystals with scalar-wave-like band dispersions, facilitating the search for topological phases in three-dimensional photonic crystals.},

However, experimentally realizing strong infrared non-reciprocal absorption remains an open challenge, and existing proposals of non-reciprocal absorbers are restricted to a narrow working waveband. Here we observe highly asymmetric absorption spectra over a broad mid-infrared band (nearly 10 μm) using doped InAs multilayers with gradient epsilon-near-zero frequencies. We reveal that the magnetized epsilon-near-zero behaviours and material loss play important roles in achieving strongly non-reciprocal absorption under a moderate external magnetic field using a thin epsilon-near-zero film (&amp;lt;λ/40, λ is the wavelength). Our approach enables flexible control over the working frequencies and non-reciprocal bandwidths by designing magnetized InAs films with different doping concentrations. The proposed principles can also be generalized to other III–V semiconductors, magnetized metals, topological Weyl semimetals, magnetized zero-index metamaterials and metasurfaces. Using doped InAs multilayers under moderate external magnetic fields with gradient epsilon-near-zero frequencies, broadband non-reciprocal absorption that can be tailored within the mid-infrared spectral region has been demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Glasses, unlike crystals, are intrinsically brittle due to the absence of microstructure-controlled toughening, creating fundamental constraints for their technological applications. Consequently, strategies for toughening glasses without compromising their other advantageous properties have been long sought after but elusive. Here we report exceptional toughening in oxide glasses via paracrystallization, using aluminosilicate glass as an example. By combining experiments and computational modelling, we demonstrate the uniform formation of crystal-like medium-range order clusters pervading the glass structure as a result of paracrystallization under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. The paracrystalline oxide glasses display superior toughness, reaching up to 1.99 ± 0.06 MPa m1/2, surpassing any other reported bulk oxide glasses, to the best of our knowledge. We attribute this exceptional toughening to the excitation of multiple shear bands caused by a stress-induced inverse transformation from the paracrystalline to amorphous states, revealing plastic deformation characteristics. This discovery presents a potent strategy for designing highly damage-tolerant glass materials and emphasizes the substantial influence of atomic-level structural variation on the properties of oxide glasses. Through the approach of paracrystallization under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, exceptional toughening has been achieved in oxide glasses by enhancing their crystal-like medium-range order structure. This discovery offers possibilities for the design of more resilient glass materials.},

  abstract     = {Since the first discovery of the fatigue phenomenon in the late 1830s, efforts to fight against fatigue failure have continued. Here we report a fatigue resistance phenomenon in nano-TiB2-decorated AlSi10Mg enabled by additive manufacturing. This fatigue resistance mechanism benefits from the three-dimensional dual-phase cellular nanostructure, which acts as a strong volumetric nanocage to prevent localized damage accumulation, thus inhibiting fatigue crack initiation. The intrinsic fatigue strength limit of nano-TiB2-decorated AlSi10Mg was proven to be close to its tensile strength through the in situ fatigue tests of a defect-free microsample. To demonstrate the practical applicability of this mechanism, printed bulk nano-TiB2-decorated AlSi10Mg achieved fatigue resistance more than double those of other additive manufacturing Al alloys and surpassed those of high-strength wrought Al alloys. This strategy of additive-manufacturing-assisted nanostructure engineering can be extended to the development of other dual-phase fatigue-resistant metals. An ultrahigh fatigue-resistant AlSi10Mg alloy is achieved by additive manufacturing, with its three-dimensional dual-phase cellular nanostructure acting as a strong volumetric nanocage to inhibit fatigue damage accumulation.},

  abstract     = {All-inorganic lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br or I) are becoming increasingly important for energy conversion and optoelectronics because of their outstanding performance and enhanced environmental stability. Morphing perovskites into specific shapes and geometries without damaging their intrinsic functional properties is attractive for designing devices and manufacturing. However, inorganic semiconductors are often intrinsically brittle at room temperature, except for some recently reported layered or van der Waals semiconductors. Here, by in situ compression, we demonstrate that single-crystal CsPbX3 micropillars can be substantially morphed into distinct shapes (cubic, L and Z shapes, rectangular arches and so on) without localized cleavage or cracks. Such exceptional plasticity is enabled by successive slips of partial dislocations on multiple $$\{110\}\langle 1\bar{1}0 \rangle$$ systems, as evidenced by atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and first-principles and atomistic simulations. The optoelectronic performance and bandgap of the devices were unchanged. Thus, our results suggest that CsPbX3 perovskites, as potential deformable inorganic semiconductors, may have profound implications for the manufacture of advanced optoelectronics and energy systems. In situ tests show that all-inorganic lead halide perovskite micropillars can morph into distinct shapes without affecting their optoelectronic properties and bandgap, which provides insights into the plastic deformation of semiconductors and also shows their potential for manufacturing relevant devices.},

However, bulk crystals with high structural ordering are severely limited in their flexibility, resulting in poor processibility and a tendency to fragment upon light exposure, while previous nano- or microcrystalline composites have lacked global alignment. Here we demonstrate a photon-fuelled macroscopic actuator consisting of diarylethene microcrystals in a polyethylene terephthalate host matrix. These microcrystals survive large deformations and show a high degree of three-dimensional ordering dictated by the anisotropic polyethylene terephthalate, which critically also has a similar stiffness. Overall, these ordered and compliant composites exhibit rapid response times, sustain a performance of over at least hundreds of cycles and generate work densities exceeding those of single crystals. Our composites represent the state-of-the-art for photochemical actuators and enable properties unattainable by single crystals, such as controllable, reversible and abrupt jumping (photosalient behaviour). Photomechanical crystals are promising materials for converting photon energy into macroscopic work via reversible structural changes when exposed to light. Here the authors demonstrate highly ordered and compliant microcrystalline composites with a photomechanical performance exceeding that of single crystals.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectricity in binary oxides including hafnia and zirconia has riveted the attention of the scientific community due to the highly unconventional physical mechanisms and the potential for the integration of these materials into semiconductor workflows. Over the last decade, it has been argued that behaviours such as wake-up phenomena and an extreme sensitivity to electrode and processing conditions suggest that ferroelectricity in these materials is strongly influenced by other factors, including electrochemical boundary conditions and strain. Here we argue that the properties of these materials emerge due to the interplay between the bulk competition between ferroelectric and structural instabilities, similar to that in classical antiferroelectrics, coupled with non-local screening mediated by the finite density of states at surfaces and internal interfaces. Via the decoupling of electrochemical and electrostatic controls, realized via environmental and ultra-high vacuum piezoresponse force microscopy, we show that these materials demonstrate a rich spectrum of ferroic behaviours including partial-pressure-induced and temperature-induced transitions between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric behaviours. These behaviours are consistent with an antiferroionic model and suggest strategies for hafnia-based device optimization. Ferroelectricity in hafnia-based systems seems to be correlated with oxygen vacancy dynamics, but the coupling of this and ferroelectric response is rarely studied. Here it is shown that Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 can be antiferroionic, with antiferroelectric behaviour coupled to surface electrochemistry.},

  abstract     = {The development of solid-state Li-metal batteries has been limited by the Li-metal plating and stripping rates and the tendency for dendrite shorts to form at commercially relevant current densities. To address this, we developed a single-phase mixed ion- and electron-conducting (MIEC) garnet with comparable Li-ion and electronic conductivities. We demonstrate that in a trilayer architecture with a porous MIEC framework supporting a thin, dense, garnet electrolyte, the critical current density can be increased to a previously unheard of 100 mA cm−2, with no dendrite-shorting. Additionally, we demonstrate that symmetric Li cells can be continuously cycled at a current density of 60 mA cm−2 with a maximum per-cycle Li plating and stripping capacity of 30 mAh cm−2, which is 6× the capacity of state-of-the-art cathodes. Moreover, a cumulative Li plating capacity of 18.5 Ah cm−2 was achieved with the MIEC/electrolyte/MIEC architecture, which if paired with a state-of-the-art cathode areal capacity of 5 mAh cm−2 would yield a projected 3,700 cycles, significantly surpassing requirements for commercial electric vehicle battery lifetimes. The development of solid-state Li-metal batteries has been limited by Li plating and stripping rates and the formation of dendrites at relevant current densities. Single-phase mixed ion- and electron-conducting garnet with comparable Li-ion and electronic conductivities is now proposed to tackle these issues.},

  abstract     = {The niobium oxide polymorph T-Nb2O5 has been extensively investigated in its bulk form especially for applications in fast-charging batteries and electrochemical (pseudo)capacitors. Its crystal structure, which has two-dimensional (2D) layers with very low steric hindrance, allows for fast Li-ion migration. However, since its discovery in 1941, the growth of single-crystalline thin films and its electronic applications have not yet been realized, probably due to its large orthorhombic unit cell along with the existence of many polymorphs. Here we demonstrate the epitaxial growth of single-crystalline T-Nb2O5 thin films, critically with the ionic transport channels oriented perpendicular to the film’s surface. These vertical 2D channels enable fast Li-ion migration, which we show gives rise to a colossal insulator–metal transition, where the resistivity drops by 11 orders of magnitude due to the population of the initially empty Nb 4d0 states by electrons. Moreover, we reveal multiple unexplored phase transitions with distinct crystal and electronic structures over a wide range of Li-ion concentrations by comprehensive in situ experiments and theoretical calculations, which allow for the reversible and repeatable manipulation of these phases and their distinct electronic properties. This work paves the way for the exploration of novel thin films with ionic channels and their potential applications. The two-dimensional layered crystal structure of niobium oxide polymorph T-Nb2O5 exhibits fast Li-ion diffusion that is promising for energy storage applications. Epitaxial growth of single-crystalline T-Nb2O5 thin films with ionic transport channels oriented perpendicular to the surface are now demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous transport and coupling of ionic and electronic charges is fundamental to electrochemical devices used in energy storage and conversion, neuromorphic computing and bioelectronics. While the mixed conductors enabling these technologies are widely used, the dynamic relationship between ionic and electronic transport is generally poorly understood, hindering the rational design of new materials. In semiconducting electrodes, electrochemical doping is assumed to be limited by motion of ions due to their large mass compared to electrons and/or holes. Here, we show that this basic assumption does not hold for conjugated polymer electrodes. Using operando optical microscopy, we reveal that electrochemical doping speeds in a state-of-the-art polythiophene can be limited by poor hole transport at low doping levels, leading to substantially slower switching speeds than expected. We show that the timescale of hole-limited doping can be controlled by the degree of microstructural heterogeneity, enabling the design of conjugated polymers with improved electrochemical performance. Electrochemical doping is assumed to be limited by ion motion due to large mass in mixed ionic-electronic conductors. Here, the authors reveal in a typical polythiophene that electrochemical doping speeds are limited by poor hole transport at low doping levels, leading to much slower switching speeds than expected.},

  abstract     = {A common obstacle of many organic semiconductors is that they show highly unipolar charge transport. This unipolarity is caused by trapping of either electrons or holes by extrinsic impurities, such as water or oxygen. For devices that benefit from balanced transport, such as organic light-emitting diodes, organic solar cells and organic ambipolar transistors, the energy levels of the organic semiconductors are ideally situated within an energetic window with a width of 2.5 eV where charge trapping is strongly suppressed. However, for semiconductors with a band gap larger than this window, as used in blue-emitting organic light-emitting diodes, the removal or disabling of charge traps poses a longstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate a molecular strategy where the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital are spatially separated on different parts of the molecules. By tuning their stacking by modification of the chemical structure, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals can be spatially protected from impurities that cause electron trapping, increasing the electron current by orders of magnitude. In this way, the trap-free window can be substantially broadened, opening a path towards large band gap organic semiconductors with balanced and trap-free transport. Extrinsic impurities may trap electrons or holes leading to imbalanced charge transport in wide band gap organic semiconductors. Here the authors propose a bottom-up design strategy by spatially separating HOMO and LUMO orbitals to avoid charge trapping, enhancing charge transport by orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {Non-collinear antiferromagnets are an emerging family of spintronic materials because they not only possess the general advantages of antiferromagnets but also enable more advanced functionalities. Recently, in an intriguing non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn, where the octupole moment is defined as the collective magnetic order parameter, spin–orbit torque (SOT) switching has been achieved in seemingly the same protocol as in ferromagnets. Nevertheless, it is fundamentally important to explore the unknown octupole moment dynamics and contrast it with the magnetization vector of ferromagnets. Here we report a handedness anomaly in the SOT-driven dynamics of Mn3Sn: when spin current is injected, the octupole moment rotates in the opposite direction to the individual moments, leading to a SOT switching polarity distinct from ferromagnets. By using second-harmonic and d.c. magnetometry, we track the SOT effect onto the octupole moment during its rotation and reveal that the handedness anomaly stems from the interactions between the injected spin and the unique chiral-spin structure of Mn3Sn. We further establish the torque balancing equation of the magnetic octupole moment and quantify the SOT efficiency. Our finding provides a guideline for understanding and implementing the electrical manipulation of non-collinear antiferromagnets, which in nature differs from the well-established collinear magnets. In the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn, a spin–orbit torque makes the collective octupole moment and individual moments rotate in opposite directions, leading to a sign-reversed switching polarity compared with collinear magnets.},

  abstract     = {A quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator is characterized by quantized Hall and vanishing longitudinal resistances at zero magnetic field that are protected against local perturbations and independent of sample details. This insensitivity makes the microscopic details of the local current distribution inaccessible to global transport measurements. Accordingly, the current distributions that give rise to transport quantization are unknown. Here we use magnetic imaging to directly visualize the transport current in the QAH regime. As we tune through the QAH plateau by electrostatic gating, we clearly identify a regime in which the sample transports current primarily in the bulk rather than along the edges. Furthermore, we image the local response of equilibrium magnetization to electrostatic gating. Combined, these measurements suggest that the current flows through incompressible regions whose spatial structure can change throughout the QAH regime. Identification of the appropriate microscopic picture of electronic transport in QAH insulators and other topologically non-trivial states of matter is a crucial step towards realizing their potential in next-generation quantum devices. Magnetic imaging reveals that a transport current flows in the interior of Cr-(Bi,Sb)2Te3 samples within the quantum anomalous Hall regime, contrary to the common assumption of current flow along the sample edge.},

Two-dimensional van der Waals materials are an excellent platform for such studies. Signatures of acoustic phonons and defect states have been observed in current-to-voltage measurements. These features can be explained by direct electron–phonon or electron–defect interactions. Here we use a tunnelling process that involves excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). We study tunnel junctions consisting of graphene and gold electrodes separated by hexagonal boron nitride with an adjacent TMD monolayer and observe prominent resonant features in current-to-voltage measurements appearing at bias voltages that correspond to TMD exciton energies. By placing the TMD outside of the tunnelling pathway, we demonstrate that this tunnelling process does not require any charge injection into the TMD. The appearance of such optical modes in electrical transport introduces additional functionality towards van der Waals material–based optoelectronic devices. The authors demonstrate exciton-assisted resonant electron tunnelling in van der Waals heterostructure tunnel junctions. Their study elucidates tunnelling mechanisms involving either indirect or direct excitons in the absence of charge injection and reveals excitonic light emission driven by inelastic electron tunnelling.},

Here we report on a spin-optical monolayer laser by incorporating a WS2 monolayer into a heterostructure microcavity supporting high-Q photonic spin-valley resonances. Inspired by the creation of valley pseudo-spins in monolayers, the spin-valley modes are generated from a photonic Rashba-type spin splitting of a bound state in the continuum, which gives rise to opposite spin-polarized ±K valleys due to emergent photonic spin–orbit interaction under inversion symmetry breaking. The Rashba monolayer laser shows intrinsic spin polarizations, high spatial and temporal coherence, and inherent symmetry-enabled robustness features, enabling valley coherence in the WS2 monolayer upon arbitrary pump polarizations at room temperature. Our monolayer-integrated spin-valley microcavities open avenues for further classical and non-classical coherent spin-optical light sources exploring both electron and photon spins. The authors introduce a spin-optical laser based on a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide coupled to a heterostructure microcavity supporting high-Q spin-valley resonances originating from photonic Rashba-type spin splitting of a bound state in the continuum.},

We report a versatile two-step approach to integrating high-quality dielectric film with sub-1 nm equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) on 2D semiconductors. Inorganic molecular crystal Sb2O3 is homogeneously deposited on 2D semiconductors as a buffer layer, which forms a high-quality oxide-to-semiconductor interface and offers a highly hydrophilic surface, enabling the integration of high-κ dielectrics via atomic layer deposition. Using this approach, we can fabricate monolayer molybdenum disulfide-based FETs with the thinnest EOT (0.67 nm). The transistors exhibit an on/off ratio of over 106 using an ultra-low operating voltage of 0.4 V, achieving unprecedently high gating efficiency. Our results may pave the way for the application of 2D materials in low-power ultrascaling electronics.

They also form as a final stage of accumulated damage. Only recently were shear bands found to form in undefected crystals, where they serve as the primary driver of plasticity without nucleating voids. Here we have discovered trends in materials properties that determine when amorphous shear bands will form and whether they will drive plasticity or lead to fracture. We have identified the materials systems that exhibit shear-band deformation, and by varying the composition, we were able to switch from ductile to brittle behaviour. Our findings are based on a combination of experimental characterization and atomistic simulations, and they provide a potential strategy for increasing the toughness of nominally brittle materials. Amorphous shear bands in crystalline materials are found to increase the toughness of brittle materials, in contrast to their traditional role as precursors to fracture. Criteria for this toughening have been identified.},

Metal-halide perovskite semiconductors are promising light emitters5–8, but the absence of an intrinsic spin-locking mechanism results in poor emission chirality. Further, device integration has undermined the efficiency and directionality of perovskite chiral emitters. Here we realize compact spin-valley-locked perovskite emitting metasurfaces where spin-dependent geometric phases are imparted into bound states in the continuum via Brillouin zone folding, and thus, photons with different spins are selectively addressed to opposite valleys. Employing this approach, chiral purity of 0.91 and emission angle of 41.0° are simultaneously achieved, with a beam divergence angle of 1.6°. With this approach, we envisage the realization of chiral light-emitting diodes, as well as the on-chip generation of entangled photon pairs.

The addition of prefabricated gelatin fibres to hydrogels enables the tailoring of the ink rheology, allowing for a controlled sol–gel transition to achieve precise printing of free-standing 3D structures without additional supporting materials. Shear-induced alignment of fibres during ink extrusion provides microscale geometric cues that promote the self-organization of cultured human cardiomyocytes into anisotropic muscular tissues in vitro. The resulting 3D-printed ventricle in vitro model exhibited biomimetic anisotropic electrophysiological and contractile properties. A gelatin–alginate hydrogel ink incorporating short gelatin fibres guides the self-organization of human cardiomyocytes into contractile tissues that can be 3D-printed into structures mimicking human organs.},

However, current strategies to create strong yet reversible adhesives needed for wearable devices, robotics and material disassembly lack independent control of strength and release, require complex fabrication or only work in specific conditions. Here we report metamaterial adhesives that simultaneously achieve strong and releasable adhesion with spatially selectable adhesion strength through programmed cut architectures. Nonlinear cuts uniquely suppress crack propagation by forcing cracks to propagate backwards for 60× enhancement in adhesion, while allowing crack growth in the opposite direction for easy release and reusability. This mechanism functions in numerous adhesives on diverse substrates in wet and dry conditions and enables highly tunable adhesion with independently programmable adhesion strength in two directions simultaneously at any location. We create these multifunctional materials in a maskless, digital fabrication framework to rapidly customize adhesive characteristics with deterministic control for next-generation adhesives. Strong yet releasable metamaterial adhesives are fabricated using nonlinear cut architectures to achieve control of the crack propagation interface for programmable, directional and spatially selective adhesion.},

Here we report a unique design of ‘Ni(OH)2-clothed Pt-tetrapods’ with an amorphous Ni(OH)2 shell as a water dissociation catalyst and a proton conductive encapsulation layer to isolate the Pt core from bulk alkaline electrolyte while ensuring efficient proton supply to the active Pt sites. This design creates a favourable local chemical environment to result in acidic-like hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics with a lowest Tafel slope of 27 mV per decade and a record-high specific activity and mass activity in alkaline electrolyte. The proton conductive Ni(OH)2 shell can also effectively reject impurity ions and retard the Oswald ripening, endowing a high tolerance to solution impurities and exceptional long-term durability that is difficult to achieve in the naked Pt catalysts. The markedly improved hydrogen evolution reaction activity and durability in an alkaline medium promise an attractive catalyst material for alkaline water electrolysers and renewable chemical fuel generation. Elaborated catalysts design can substantially enhance performance under unfavourable reaction conditions.

  abstract     = {Carrier multiplication is a process whereby a kinetic energy of a carrier relaxes via generation of additional electron–hole pairs (excitons). This effect has been extensively studied in the context of advanced photoconversion as it could boost the yield of generated excitons. Carrier multiplication is driven by carrier–carrier interactions that lead to excitation of a valence-band electron to the conduction band. Normally, the rate of phonon-assisted relaxation exceeds that of Coulombic collisions, which limits the carrier multiplication yield. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by exploiting not ‘direct’ but ‘spin-exchange’ Coulomb interactions in manganese-doped core/shell PbSe/CdSe quantum dots. In these structures, carrier multiplication occurs via two spin-exchange steps. First, an exciton generated in the CdSe shell is rapidly transferred to a Mn dopant. Then, the excited Mn ion undergoes spin-flip relaxation via a spin-conserving pathway, which creates two excitons in the PbSe core. Due to the extremely fast, subpicosecond timescales of spin-exchange interactions, the Mn-doped quantum dots exhibit an up-to-threefold enhancement of the multiexciton yield versus the undoped samples, which points towards the considerable potential of spin-exchange carrier multiplication in advanced photoconversion. Carrier multiplication generates multiple excitons for each absorbed photon but is normally limited by fast phonon-assisted relaxation. Here the authors achieve a threefold enhancement in multiexciton yields in Mn-doped PbSe/CdSe quantum dots, due to very fast spin-exchange interactions between Mn ions and the quantum dots that outpace energy losses arising from phonon emission.},

Here we developed a single-molecule photoelectron tunnelling spectroscopy approach for mapping transmission beyond the HOMO–LUMO gap of the single diketopyrrolopyrrole molecule junction using an ultrafast-laser combined scanning tunnelling microscope-based break junction set-up at room temperature. Two resonant transport channels of ultrafast photocurrent are found by our photoelectron tunnelling spectroscopy, ranging from 1.31 eV to 1.77 eV, consistent with the LUMO + 1 and LUMO + 2 in the transmission spectrum obtained by density functional theory calculations. Moreover, we observed the modulation of resonant peaks by varying bias voltages, which demonstrates the ability to quantitatively characterize the effect of the electric field on frontier molecular orbitals. Our single-molecule photoelectron tunnelling spectroscopy offers an avenue that allows us to explore the nature of energy-dependent charge transport through single-molecule junctions. The transmission spectrum reflects energy alignment between electrodes and frontier orbitals in single-molecule junctions but few experimental tools exist for characterization beyond the HOMO–LUMO gap.

  abstract     = {Ultralow thermal conductivity and fast ionic diffusion endow superionic materials with excellent performance both as thermoelectric converters and as solid-state electrolytes. Yet the correlation and interdependence between these two features remain unclear owing to a limited understanding of their complex atomic dynamics. Here we investigate ionic diffusion and lattice dynamics in argyrodite Ag8SnSe6 using synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering techniques along with machine-learned molecular dynamics. We identify a critical interplay of the vibrational dynamics of mobile Ag and a host framework that controls the overdamping of low-energy Ag-dominated phonons into a quasi-elastic response, enabling superionicity. Concomitantly, the persistence of long-wavelength transverse acoustic phonons across the superionic transition challenges a proposed ‘liquid-like thermal conduction’ picture. Rather, a striking thermal broadening of low-energy phonons, starting even below 50 K, reveals extreme phonon anharmonicity and weak bonding as underlying features of the potential energy surface responsible for the ultralow thermal conductivity (&amp;lt;0.5 W m−1 K−1) and fast diffusion. Our results provide fundamental insights into the complex atomic dynamics in superionic materials for energy conversion and storage. Superionic materials are of interest for solid-state batteries or thermoelectrics, yet a clear understanding of the atomistic mechanisms is lacking. Here it is shown that transverse acoustic phonons persist above the superionic transition in argyrodite Ag8SnSe6, and that the free-Se sublattice controls fast Ag cation diffusion.},

  abstract     = {Conventional antiferroelectric materials with atomic-scale anti-aligned dipoles undergo a transition to a ferroelectric (FE) phase under strong electric fields. The moiré superlattice formed in the twisted stacks of van der Waals crystals exhibits polar domains alternating in moiré length with anti-aligned dipoles. In this moiré domain antiferroelectic (MDAF) arrangement, the distribution of electric dipoles is distinguished from that of two-dimensional FEs, suggesting dissimilar domain dynamics. Here we performed an operando transmission electron microscopy investigation on twisted bilayer WSe2 to observe the polar domain dynamics in real time. We find that the topological protection, provided by the domain wall network, prevents the MDAF-to-FE transition. As one decreases the twist angle, however, this transition occurs as the domain wall network disappears. Exploiting stroboscopic operando transmission electron microscopy on the FE phase, we measure a maximum domain wall velocity of 300 μm s–1. Domain wall pinnings by various disorders limit the domain wall velocity and cause Barkhausen noises in the polarization hysteresis loop. Atomic-scale analysis of the pinning disorders provides structural insight on how to improve the switching speed of van der Waals FEs. Polar domains have been observed in twist-stacked van der Waals layers, but their dynamics are unexplored. Here, using operando electron microscopy, it is found that polar domains in an antiferroelectric arrangement cannot transition to a ferroelectric state due to topological protection of the domain wall network.},

  abstract     = {The origin of nematicity in FeSe remains a critical outstanding question towards understanding unconventional superconductivity in proximity to nematic order. To understand what drives the nematicity, it is essential to determine which electronic degree of freedom admits a spontaneous order parameter independent from the structural distortion. Here we use X-ray linear dichroism at the Fe K pre-edge to measure the anisotropy of the 3d orbital occupation as a function of in situ applied stress and temperature across the nematic transition. Along with using X-ray diffraction to precisely quantify the strain state, we reveal a lattice-independent, spontaneously ordered orbital polarization within the nematic phase, as well as an orbital polarizability that diverges as the transition is approached from above. These results provide strong evidence that spontaneous orbital polarization serves as the primary order parameter of the nematic phase. FeSe does not exhibit magnetic order and lacks a nematic quantum critical point coinciding with optimal superconductivity, suggesting that an orbital mechanism drives nematicity, but direct evidence is lacking. Here, combining X-ray linear dichroism with in situ uniaxial stress, the role of spontaneous orbital polarization in nematic-phase FeSe is determined.},

  abstract     = {Photoinduced spin–charge interconversion in semiconductors with spin–orbit coupling could provide a route to optically addressable spintronics without the use of external magnetic fields. However, in structurally disordered polycrystalline semiconductors, which are being widely explored for device applications, the presence and role of spin-associated charge currents remains unclear. Here, using femtosecond circular-polarization-resolved pump–probe microscopy on polycrystalline halide perovskite thin films, we observe the photoinduced ultrafast formation of spin domains on the micrometre scale formed through lateral spin currents. Micrometre-scale variations in the intensity of optical second-harmonic generation and vertical piezoresponse suggest that the spin-domain formation is driven by the presence of strong local inversion symmetry breaking via structural disorder. We propose that this leads to spatially varying Rashba-like spin textures that drive spin-momentum-locked currents, leading to local spin accumulation. Ultrafast spin-domain formation in polycrystalline halide perovskite films provides an optically addressable platform for nanoscale spin-device physics. The authors apply several advanced methods to probe spin dynamics in polycrystalline halide pervoskites.},

Here, we demonstrate intrinsic strong coupling in BIC-driven metasurfaces composed of nanostructured bulk tungsten disulfide (WS2) and exhibiting resonances with sharp, tailored linewidths and selective enhancement of light-matter interactions. Tuning of the BIC resonances across the exciton resonance in bulk WS2 is achieved by varying the metasurface unit cells, enabling strong coupling with an anticrossing pattern and a Rabi splitting of 116 meV. Crucially, the coupling strength itself can be controlled and is shown to be independent of material-intrinsic losses. Our self-hybridized metasurface platform can readily incorporate other TMDCs or excitonic materials to deliver fundamental insights and practical device concepts for polaritonic applications. The authors demonstrate strong coupling in bound state in the continuum metasurfaces on nanostructured bulk WS2 and exhibiting sharp resonances with tailored linewidths and controllable light-matter coupling strength.},

Here we show strong light–matter interaction enhancement and large exciton–polariton nonlinearities at room temperature by coupling monolayer tungsten disulfide excitons to a topologically protected bound state in the continuum moulded by a one-dimensional photonic crystal, and optimizing for the electric-field strength at the monolayer position through Bloch surface wave confinement. By a structured optimization approach, the coupling with the active material is maximized here in a fully open architecture, allowing to achieve a 100 meV photonic bandgap with the bound state in the continuum in a local energy minimum and a Rabi splitting of 70 meV, which results in very high cooperativity. Our architecture paves the way to a class of polariton devices based on topologically protected and highly interacting bound states in the continuum. Combining a tungsten disulfide monolayer and a topologically protected bound state in the continuum formed by a one-dimensional photonic crystal, strong light–matter interaction enhancement and large exciton–polariton nonlinearities at room temperature are demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Dislocation motion, an important mechanism underlying crystal plasticity, is critical for the hardening, processing and application of a wide range of structural and functional materials. For decades, the movement of dislocations has been widely observed in crystalline solids under mechanical loading. However, the goal of manipulating dislocation motion via a non-mechanical field alone remains elusive. Here we present real-time observations of dislocation motion controlled solely by using an external electric field in single-crystalline zinc sulfide—the dislocations can move back and forth depending on the direction of the electric field. We reveal the non-stoichiometric nature of dislocation cores and determine their charge characteristics. Both negatively and positively charged dislocations are directly resolved, and their glide barriers decrease under an electric field, explaining the experimental observations. This study provides direct evidence of dislocation dynamics controlled by a non-mechanical stimulus and opens up the possibility of modulating dislocation-related properties. A method to manipulate the dislocation motion via a non-mechanical field alone has remained elusive. Here, using in situ TEM, it is directly observed that dislocation motion can be controlled solely by an external electric field.},

  abstract     = {Uniform tensile ductility (UTD) is crucial for the forming/machining capabilities of structural materials. Normally, planar-slip induced narrow deformation bands localize the plastic strains and hence hamper UTD, particularly in body-centred-cubic (bcc) multi-principal element high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which generally exhibit early necking (UTD &amp;lt; 5%). Here we demonstrate a strategy to tailor the planar-slip bands in a Ti-Zr-V-Nb-Al bcc HEA, achieving a 25% UTD together with nearly 50% elongation-to-failure (approaching a ductile elemental metal), while offering gigapascal yield strength. The HEA composition is designed not only to enhance the B2-like local chemical order (LCO), seeding sites to disperse planar slip, but also to generate excess lattice distortion upon deformation-induced LCO destruction, which promotes elastic strains and dislocation debris to cause dynamic hardening. This encourages second-generation planar-slip bands to branch out from first-generation bands, effectively spreading the plastic flow to permeate the sample volume. Moreover, the profuse bands frequently intersect to sustain adequate work-hardening rate (WHR) to large strains. Our strategy showcases the tuning of plastic flow dynamics that turns an otherwise-undesirable deformation mode to our advantage, enabling an unusual synergy of yield strength and UTD for bcc HEAs. This work shows that by designing appropriate alloying elements in a body-centred-cubic high-entropy alloy, local chemical order and lattice distortion can be tuned, which influences the evolution of planar-slip bands, realizing pure-metal-like tensile ductility at gigapascal yield strength.},

  abstract     = {Microtubules are cytoskeleton components with unique mechanical and dynamic properties. They are rigid polymers that alternate phases of growth and shrinkage. Nonetheless, the cells can display a subset of stable microtubules, but it is unclear whether microtubule dynamics and mechanical properties are related. Recent in vitro studies suggest that microtubules have mechano-responsive properties, being able to stabilize their lattice by self-repair on physical damage. Here we study how microtubules respond to cycles of compressive forces in living cells and find that microtubules become distorted, less dynamic and more stable. This mechano-stabilization depends on CLASP2, which relocates from the end to the deformed shaft of microtubules. This process seems to be instrumental for cell migration in confined spaces. Overall, these results demonstrate that microtubules in living cells have mechano-responsive properties that allow them to resist and even counteract the forces to which they are subjected, being a central mediator of cellular mechano-responses. Microtubules respond to mechanical compression by deforming, becoming more stable, which results in CLASP2 recruitment to the distorted shaft—a process crucial for cell migration through confined spaces.},

In this work, we report a physical barrier against SARS-CoV-2 infection based on an inhalable bioadhesive hydrogel, named spherical hydrogel inhalation for enhanced lung defence (SHIELD). Conveniently delivered via a dry powder inhaler, SHIELD particles form a dense hydrogel network that coats the airway, enhancing the diffusional barrier properties and restricting virus penetration. SHIELD’s protective effect is first demonstrated in mice against two SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-viruses with different mutated spike proteins. Strikingly, in African green monkeys, a single SHIELD inhalation provides protection for up to 8 hours, efficiently reducing infection by the SARS-CoV-2 WA1 and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants. Notably, SHIELD is made with food-grade materials and does not affect normal respiratory functions. This approach could offer additional protection to the population against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.

Advanced membranes made from porous materials, such as metal–organic frameworks, can achieve a good gas separation performance, although they are typically formed on support layers or mixed with polymeric matrices, placing limitations on gas permeance. Here an amorphous glass foam, agfZIF-62, wherein a, g and f denote amorphous, glass and foam, respectively, was synthesized by a polymer-thermal-decomposition-assisted melting strategy, starting from a crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework, ZIF-62. The thermal decomposition of incorporated low-molecular-weight polyethyleneimine evolves CO2, NH3 and H2O gases, creating a large number and variety of pores. This greatly increases pore interconnectivity but maintains the crystalline ZIF-62 ultramicropores, allowing ultrahigh gas permeance and good selectivity. A self-supported circular agfZIF-62 with a thickness of 200–330 µm and area of 8.55 cm2 was used for membrane separation. The membranes perform well, showing a CH4 permeance of 30,000–50,000 gas permeance units, approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that of other reported membranes, with good CH4/N2 selectivity (4–6). Membranes formed from porous adsorbents can improve the economics of industrially difficult separations but require support materials that reduce gas permeance. Here an amorphous glassy foam membrane without a support is formed from ZIF-62 that shows high selectivity and permeance for CH4/N2 separations.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional conjugated polymers (2DCPs), composed of multiple strands of linear conjugated polymers with extended in-plane π-conjugation, are emerging crystalline semiconducting polymers for organic (opto)electronics. They are represented by two-dimensional π-conjugated covalent organic frameworks, which typically suffer from poor π-conjugation and thus low charge carrier mobilities. Here we overcome this limitation by demonstrating two semiconducting phthalocyanine-based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)-ladder-type 2DCPs (2DCP-MPc, with M = Cu or Ni), which are constructed from octaaminophthalocyaninato metal(ii) and naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride by polycondensation under solvothermal conditions. The 2DCP-MPcs exhibit optical bandgaps of ~1.3 eV with highly delocalized π-electrons. Density functional theory calculations unveil strongly dispersive energy bands with small electron–hole reduced effective masses of ~0.15m0 for the layer-stacked 2DCP-MPcs. Terahertz spectroscopy reveals the band transport of Drude-type free carriers in 2DCP-MPcs with exceptionally high sum mobility of electrons and holes of ~970 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, surpassing that of the reported linear conjugated polymers and 2DCPs. This work highlights the critical role of effective conjugation in enhancing the charge transport properties of 2DCPs and the great potential of high-mobility 2DCPs for future (opto)electronics. Linear π-conjugated polymers have attracted great attention as semiconductors for (opto)electronic devices, but charge transfer is only effective along polymer chains. Here poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)-ladder-type two-dimensional conjugated polymers are presented with high charge carrier mobilities.},

  abstract     = {The interconversion between electrical and mechanical energies is pivotal to ferroelectrics to enable their applications in transducers, actuators and sensors. Ferroelectric polymers exhibit a giant electric-field-induced strain (&amp;gt;4.0%), markedly exceeding the actuation strain (≤1.7%) of piezoelectric ceramics and crystals. However, their normalized elastic energy densities remain orders of magnitude smaller than those of piezoelectric ceramics and crystals, severely limiting their practical applications in soft actuators. Here we report the use of electro-thermally induced ferroelectric phase transition in percolative ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites to achieve high strain performance in electric-field-driven actuation materials. We demonstrate a strain of over 8% and an output mechanical energy density of 11.3 J cm−3 at an electric field of 40 MV m−1 in the composite, outperforming the benchmark relaxor single-crystal ferroelectrics. This approach overcomes the trade-off between mechanical modulus and electro-strains in conventional piezoelectric polymer composites and opens up an avenue for high-performance ferroelectric actuators. Piezoelectric actuators play a critical role in precision positioning devices; however, materials with high actuation strain and mechanical energy density are rare. Here a composite of poly(vinylidene fluoride) and TiO2 demonstrates superior performance in these metrics, with the ferroelectric transition driven by Joule heating.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of a topological transition of the polaritonic dispersion in twisted bilayers of anisotropic van der Waals materials at a given twist angle—the photonic magic angle—results in the diffractionless propagation of polaritons with deep-subwavelength resolution. This type of propagation, generally referred to as canalization, holds promise for the control of light at the nanoscale. However, the existence of a single photonic magic angle hinders such control since the canalization direction in twisted bilayers is unique and fixed for each incident frequency. Here we overcome this limitation by demonstrating multiple spectrally robust photonic magic angles in reconfigurable twisted α-phase molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO3) trilayers. We show that canalization of polaritons can be programmed at will along any desired in-plane direction in a single device with broad spectral ranges. These findings open the door for nanophotonics applications where on-demand control is crucial, such as thermal management, nanoimaging or entanglement of quantum emitters. The direction of polariton canalization—its diffractionless propagation—in twisted bilayers at the magic angle is hindered by the lack of multiple magic angles. By controlling the twist angles between three α-MoO3 layers, reconfigurable and spectrally robust polariton canalization along any in-plane direction is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Thin layers of in-plane anisotropic materials can support ultraconfined polaritons, whose wavelengths depend on the propagation direction. Such polaritons hold potential for the exploration of fundamental material properties and the development of novel nanophotonic devices. However, the real-space observation of ultraconfined in-plane anisotropic plasmon polaritons (PPs)—which exist in much broader spectral ranges than phonon polaritons—has been elusive. Here we apply terahertz nanoscopy to image in-plane anisotropic low-energy PPs in monoclinic Ag2Te platelets. The hybridization of the PPs with their mirror image—by placing the platelets above a Au layer—increases the direction-dependent relative polariton propagation length and the directional polariton confinement. This allows for verifying a linear dispersion and elliptical isofrequency contour in momentum space, revealing in-plane anisotropic acoustic terahertz PPs. Our work shows high-symmetry (elliptical) polaritons on low-symmetry (monoclinic) crystals and demonstrates the use of terahertz PPs for local measurements of anisotropic charge carrier masses and damping. Employing terahertz nanoscopy, we image highly confined, in-plane anisotropic acoustic terahertz plasmon polaritons in monoclinic Ag2Te platelets placed above a Au layer, verifying a linear dispersion and elliptical isofrequency contour in momentum space.},

  abstract     = {III-nitride wide bandgap semiconductors are promising materials for modern optoelectronics and electronics. Their application has progressed greatly thanks to the continuous quality improvements of heteroepitaxial films grown on large-lattice-mismatched foreign substrates. But compared with bulk single crystals, there is still tremendous room for the further improvement of the material quality. Here we show a paradigm to achieve high-quality III-nitride heteroepitaxial films by the controllable discretization and coalescence of columns. By adopting nano-patterned AlN/sapphire templates with regular hexagonal holes, discrete AlN columns coalesce with uniform out-of-plane and in-plane orientations guaranteed by sapphire nitridation pretreatment and the ordered lateral growth of cleavage facets, which efficiently suppresses the regeneration of threading dislocations during coalescence. The density of dislocation etch pits in the AlN heteroepitaxial film reaches 3.3 × 104 cm−2, close to the present available AlN bulk single crystals. This study facilitates the growth of bulk-class quality III-nitride films featuring low cost and scalability. High-quality AlN heteroepitaxial films are obtained by controllable discretization and coalescence of columns on nano-patterned AlN/sapphire templates with hexagonal holes, where the density of dislocation etch pits is greatly reduced to ~10 × 104 cm−2.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state electrolytes overcome many challenges of present-day lithium ion batteries, such as safety hazards and dendrite formation1,2. However, detailed understanding of the involved lithium dynamics is missing due to a lack of in operando measurements with chemical and interfacial specificity. Here we investigate a prototypical solid-state electrolyte using linear and nonlinear extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopies. Leveraging the surface sensitivity of extreme-ultraviolet-second-harmonic-generation spectroscopy, we obtained a direct spectral signature of surface lithium ions, showing a distinct blueshift relative to bulk absorption spectra. First-principles simulations attributed the shift to transitions from the lithium 1 s state to hybridized Li-s/Ti-d orbitals at the surface. Our calculations further suggest a reduction in lithium interfacial mobility due to suppressed low-frequency rattling modes, which is the fundamental origin of the large interfacial resistance in this material. Our findings pave the way for new optimization strategies to develop these electrochemical devices via interfacial engineering of lithium ions. Understanding lithium dynamics in solid-state electrolytes used for Li-ion batteries can be challenging. Using nonlinear extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopies, a direct spectral signature of surface lithium ions showing a distinct blueshift relative to the bulk absorption spectra is observed in a prototypical solid-state electrolyte.},

  abstract     = {Despite recent tremendous progress in optical imaging and metrology1–6, there remains a substantial resolution gap between atomic-scale transmission electron microscopy and optical techniques. Is optical imaging and metrology of nanostructures exhibiting Brownian motion possible with such resolution, beyond thermal fluctuations? Here we report on an experiment in which the average position of a nanowire with a thermal oscillation amplitude of ∼150 pm is resolved in single-shot measurements with subatomic precision of 92 pm, using light at a wavelength of λ = 488 nm, providing an example of such sub-Brownian metrology with ∼λ/5,300 precision. To localize the nanowire, we employ a deep-learning analysis of the scattering of topologically structured light, which is highly sensitive to the nanowire’s position. This non-invasive metrology with absolute errors down to a fraction of the typical size of an atom, opens a range of opportunities to study picometre-scale phenomena with light. The authors report subatomic precision in measuring the displacement of a nanowire. Such precision is achieved by employing deep-learning enabled analysis of single-shot scattering of topologically structured superoscillatory illumination.},

  abstract     = {Plasmon polaritons in van der Waals materials hold promise for various photonics applications1–4. The deterministic imprinting of spatial patterns of high carrier density in plasmonic cavities and nanoscale circuitry can enable the realization of advanced nonlinear nanophotonic5 and strong light–matter interaction platforms6. Here we demonstrate an oxidation-activated charge transfer strategy to program ambipolar low-loss graphene plasmonic structures. By covering graphene with transition-metal dichalcogenides and subsequently oxidizing the transition-metal dichalcogenides into transition-metal oxides, we activate charge transfer rooted in the dissimilar work functions between transition-metal oxides and graphene. Nano-infrared imaging reveals ambipolar low-loss plasmon polaritons at the transition-metal-oxide/graphene interfaces. Further, by inserting dielectric van der Waals spacers, we can precisely control the electron and hole densities induced by oxidation-activated charge transfer and achieve plasmons with a near-intrinsic quality factor. Using this strategy, we imprint plasmonic cavities with laterally abrupt doping profiles with nanoscale precision and demonstrate plasmonic whispering-gallery resonators based on suspended graphene encapsulated in transition-metal oxides. Employing an oxidation-activated charge transfer strategy to oxidize transition-metal dichalcogenides into transition-metal oxides, the authors imprint plasmonic cavities with laterally abrupt doping profiles and nanoscale precision demonstrating plasmonic whispering-gallery resonators.},

  abstract     = {The scaling of silicon-based transistors at sub-ten-nanometre technology nodes faces challenges such as interface imperfection and gate current leakage for an ultrathin silicon channel1,2. For next-generation nanoelectronics, high-mobility two-dimensional (2D) layered semiconductors with an atomic thickness and dangling-bond-free surfaces are expected as channel materials to achieve smaller channel sizes, less interfacial scattering and more efficient gate-field penetration1,2. However, further progress towards 2D electronics is hindered by factors such as the lack of a high dielectric constant (κ) dielectric with an atomically flat and dangling-bond-free surface3,4. Here, we report a facile synthesis of a single-crystalline high-κ (κ of roughly 16.5) van der Waals layered dielectric Bi2SeO5. The centimetre-scale single crystal of Bi2SeO5 can be efficiently exfoliated to an atomically flat nanosheet as large as 250 × 200 μm2 and as thin as monolayer. With these Bi2SeO5 nanosheets as dielectric and encapsulation layers, 2D materials such as Bi2O2Se, MoS2 and graphene show improved electronic performances. For example, in 2D Bi2O2Se, the quantum Hall effect is observed and the carrier mobility reaches 470,000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 1.8 K. Our finding expands the realm of dielectric and opens up a new possibility for lowering the gate voltage and power consumption in 2D electronics and integrated circuits. Large-size single-crystal van der Waals layered Bi2SeO5 has been synthesized with a high dielectric constant and high breakdown field strength for two-dimensional electronics applications.},

  abstract     = {RNA-based therapeutics have shown tremendous promise in disease intervention at the genetic level, and some have been approved for clinical use, including the recent COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccines. The clinical success of RNA therapy is largely dependent on the use of chemical modification, ligand conjugation or non-viral nanoparticles to improve RNA stability and facilitate intracellular delivery. Unlike molecular-level or nanoscale approaches, macroscopic hydrogels are soft, water-swollen three-dimensional structures that possess remarkable features such as biodegradability, tunable physiochemical properties and injectability, and recently they have attracted enormous attention for use in RNA therapy. Specifically, hydrogels can be engineered to exert precise spatiotemporal control over the release of RNA therapeutics, potentially minimizing systemic toxicity and enhancing in vivo efficacy. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of hydrogel loading of RNAs and hydrogel design for controlled release, highlights their biomedical applications and offers our perspectives on the opportunities and challenges in this exciting field of RNA delivery. RNA-based therapeutics hold promise for the treatment of several diseases. This Review provides an overview of hydrogels for RNA delivery, discussing how the chemical nature and physical properties of hydrogels can be explored for tailored RNA loading and release, and highlighting the use of these materials in biomedical applications.},

Although experimental evidence indicates that the crystalline core of these nanomaterials is highly ordered, a direct observation of their crystal lattice has not been successful. Here we report the high-resolution cryo-transmission electron microscopy studies of vitrified solutions of nanofibres made from a crystalline core of poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) (PFS) and a corona of polysiloxane grafted with 4-vinylpyridine groups. These studies show that poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) chains pack in an 8-nm-diameter core lattice with two-dimensional pseudo-hexagonal symmetry that is coated by a 27 nm 4-vinylpyridine corona with a 3.5 nm distance between each 4-vinylpyridine strand. We combine this structural information with a molecular modelling analysis to propose a detailed molecular model for solvated poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane)-b-4-vinylpyridine nanofibres. Detailed structures of both solvated corona chains and sub-nanometre crystalline core lattice of polymer-based nanofibres in solution are obtained using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy.},

Here we present photopolymerized hydrogels for expansion microscopy that enable optical clearance and tunable ×4.6–6.7 homogeneous expansion of not only monolayer cell cultures and tissue sections, but cells embedded within hydrogels. The photopolymerized hydrogels for expansion microscopy formulation relies on a rapid photoinitiated thiol/acrylate mixed-mode polymerization that is not inhibited by oxygen and decouples monomer diffusion from polymerization, which is particularly beneficial when expanding cells embedded within hydrogels. Using this technology, we visualize human mesenchymal stem cells and their interactions with nascently deposited proteins at &amp;lt;120 nm resolution when cultured in proteolytically degradable synthetic polyethylene glycol hydrogels. Results support the notion that focal adhesion maturation requires cellular fibronectin deposition; nuclear deformation precedes cellular spreading; and human mesenchymal stem cells display cell-surface metalloproteinases for matrix remodelling.

  abstract     = {Metal–organic framework (MOF) membranes are energy-efficient candidates for molecular separations, but it remains a considerable challenge to eliminate defects at the atomic scale. The enlargement of pores due to defects reduces the molecular-sieving performance in separations and hampers the wider application of MOF membranes, especially for liquid separations, owing to insufficient stability. Here we report the elimination of lattice defects in MOF membranes based on a high-probability theoretical coordination strategy that creates sufficient chemical potential to overcome the steric hindrance that occurs when completely connecting ligands to metal clusters. Lattice defect elimination is observed by real-space high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and studied with a mathematical model and density functional theory calculations. This leads to a family of high-connectivity MOF membranes that possess ångström-sized lattice apertures that realize high and stable separation performance for gases, water desalination and an organic solvent azeotrope. Our strategy could enable a platform for the regulation of nanoconfined molecular transport in MOF pores. MOF membranes can present exceptional molecular-sieving properties, but lattice defects arising from incomplete cluster coordination can hinder this. Here a strategy for the elimination of lattice defects by increasing the ligand to secondary building unit ratio is proposed and demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {The generation of methane fuel using surplus renewable energy with CO2 as the carbon source enables both the decarbonization and substitution of fossil fuel feedstocks. However, high temperatures are usually required for the efficient activation of CO2. Here we present a solid catalyst synthesized using a mild, green hydrothermal synthesis that involves interstitial carbon doped into ruthenium oxide, which enables the stabilization of Ru cations in a low oxidation state and a ruthenium oxycarbonate phase to form. The catalyst shows an activity and selectivity for the conversion of CO2 into methane at lower temperatures than those of conventional catalysts, with an excellent long-term stability. Furthermore, this catalyst is able to operate under intermittent power supply conditions, which couples very well with electricity production systems based on renewable energies. The structure of the catalyst and the nature of the ruthenium species were acutely characterized by combining advanced imaging and spectroscopic tools at the macro and atomic scales, which highlighted the low-oxidation-state Ru sites (Run+, 0 &amp;lt; n &amp;lt; 4) as responsible for the high catalytic activity. This catalyst suggests alternative perspectives for materials design using interstitial dopants. Activating CO2 to form methane is a potential strategy for energy decarbonization, but to activate CO2 typically requires high temperatures. Here a ruthenium oxycarbonate is presented that forms by carbon interstitial doping of RuO2, and this catalyst enables CO2 activation at 50 °C.},

These dynamic structural relationships directly inform the design of strain-engineered nanocatalysts for energy storage and conversion applications.

  abstract     = {Although organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors are widely proposed for use in bioelectronics, energy generation/storage and neuromorphic computing, our fundamental understanding of the charge-compensating interactions between the ionic and electronic carriers and the dynamics of ions remains poor, particularly for hydrated devices and on electrochemical cycling. Here we show that operando 23Na and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can quantify cation and water movement during the doping/dedoping of films comprising the widely used mixed conductor poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). A distinct 23Na quadrupolar splitting is observed due to the partial ordering of the PSS chains within the PEDOT:PSS-rich domains, with respect to the substrate. Operando 23Na NMR studies reveal a close-to-linear correlation between the quadrupolar splitting and the charge stored, which is quantitatively explained by a model in which the holes on the PEDOT backbone are bound to the PSS SO3− groups; an increase in hole concentration during doping inversely correlates with the number of Na+ ions bound to the PSS chains within the PEDOT-rich ordered domains, leading to a decrease in ions within the ordered regions and a decrease in quadrupolar splitting. The Na+-to-electron coupling efficiency, measured via 23Na NMR intensity changes, is close to 100% when using a 1 M NaCl electrolyte. Operando 1H NMR spectroscopy confirms that the Na+ ions injected into/extracted from the wet films are hydrated. These findings shed light on the working principles of organic mixed conductors and demonstrate the utility of operando NMR spectroscopy in revealing structure–property relationships in electroactive polymers. Understanding charge-compensating interactions and ionic dynamics in organic mixed conductors can be challenging. Operando NMR spectroscopy is now used to quantify cation and water movement during doping/dedoping in mixed conductor films.},

All the stretchable emitters reported to date, to the best of our knowledge, have been based on electroluminescent polymers that only harness singlet excitons, limiting their theoretical quantum yield to 25%. Here we present a design concept for imparting stretchability onto electroluminescent polymers that can harness all the excitons through thermally activated delayed fluorescence, thereby reaching a near-unity theoretical quantum yield. We show that our design strategy of inserting flexible, linear units into a polymer backbone can substantially increase the mechanical stretchability without affecting the underlying electroluminescent processes. As a result, our synthesized polymer achieves a stretchability of 125%, with an external quantum efficiency of 10%. Furthermore, we demonstrate a fully stretchable organic light-emitting diode, confirming that the proposed stretchable thermally activated delayed fluorescence polymers provide a path towards simultaneously achieving desirable electroluminescent and mechanical characteristics, including high efficiency, brightness, switching speed and stretchability as well as low driving voltage. We synthesized stretchable electroluminescent polymers capable of reaching a near-unity theoretical quantum yield through thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Their polymers show 125% stretchability with 10% external quantum efficiency and demonstrate a fully stretchable organic light-emitting diode.},

Here we establish twisted double-bilayer WSe2 as an experimental platform to study electronic correlations within Γ-valley moiré bands. Through local and global electronic compressibility measurements, we identify charge-ordered phases at multiple integer and fractional moiré fillings. By measuring the magnetic field dependence of their energy gaps and the chemical potential upon doping, we reveal spin-polarized ground states with spin-polaron quasiparticle excitations. In addition, an applied displacement field induces a metal–insulator transition driven by tuning between Γ- and K-valley moiré bands. Our results demonstrate control over the spin and valley character of the correlated ground and excited states in this system. Electronic compressibility measurements of twisted double-bilayer WSe2 reveal correlated insulators with spin-polaron charged excitations, as well as close competition between moiré bands at Γ and K valleys.},

So far, these methods of magnetization manipulation have mostly been developed independently within the fields of spintronics and ultrafast magnetism. Here we show optically induced ultrafast magnetization reversal taking place within less than a picosecond in rare-earth-free archetypal spin valves of [Pt/Co]/Cu/[Co/Pt] commonly used for current-induced STT switching.

  abstract     = {Black phosphorus (BP), a fascinating semiconductor with high mobility and a tunable direct bandgap, has emerged as a candidate beyond traditional silicon-based devices for next-generation electronics and optoelectronics. The ability to grow large-scale, high-quality BP films is a prerequisite for scalable integrated applications but has thus far remained a challenge due to unmanageable nucleation events. Here we develop a sustained feedstock release strategy to achieve subcentimetre-size single-crystal BP films by facilitating the lateral growth mode under a low nucleation rate. The as-grown single-crystal BP films exhibit high crystal quality, which brings excellent field-effect electrical properties and observation of pronounced Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations, with high mobilities up to ~6,500 cm2 V−1 s−1 at low temperatures. We further extend this approach to the growth of single-crystal BP alloy films, which broaden the infrared emission regime of BP from 3.7 μm to 6.9 μm at room temperature. This work will greatly facilitate the development of high-performance electronics and optoelectronics based on BP family materials. Subcentimetre-size black phosphorous and its alloy films have been achieved on conventional substrates through sustained feedstock release design, and exhibit high crystalline quality and composition-dependent bandgap tunability.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen embrittlement jeopardizes the use of high-strength steels in critical load-bearing applications. However, uncertainty regarding how hydrogen affects dislocation motion, owing to the lack of quantitative experimental evidence, hinders our understanding of hydrogen embrittlement. Here, by studying the well-controlled, cyclic, bow-out motions of individual screw dislocations in α-iron, we find that the critical stress for initiating dislocation motion in a 2 Pa electron-beam-excited H2 atmosphere is 27–43% lower than that in a vacuum environment, proving that hydrogen enhances screw dislocation motion. Moreover, we find that aside from vacuum degassing, cyclic loading and unloading facilitates the de-trapping of hydrogen, allowing the dislocation to regain its hydrogen-free behaviour. These findings at the individual dislocation level can inform hydrogen embrittlement modelling and guide the design of hydrogen-resistant steels. Screw dislocations in α-iron move more easily in the presence of hydrogen, as evidenced by real-time imaging using quantitative transmission electron microscopy.},

  abstract     = {The cuprate high-temperature superconductors exhibit many unexplained electronic phases, but the superconductivity at high doping is often believed to be governed by conventional mean-field Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory1. However, it was shown that the superfluid density vanishes when the transition temperature goes to zero2,3, in contradiction to expectations from Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory. Our scanning tunnelling spectroscopy measurements in the overdoped regime of the (Pb,Bi)2Sr2CuO6+δ high-temperature superconductor show that this is due to the emergence of nanoscale superconducting puddles in a metallic matrix4,5. Our measurements further reveal that this puddling is driven by gap filling instead of gap closing. The important implication is that it is not a diminishing pairing interaction that causes the breakdown of superconductivity. Unexpectedly, the measured gap-to-filling correlation also reveals that pair breaking by disorder does not play a dominant role and that the mechanism of superconductivity in overdoped cuprate superconductors is qualitatively different from conventional mean-field theory. The authors present scanning tunnelling spectroscopy data that show that the mechanism of superconductivity in overdoped cuprate superconductors is qualitatively different from conventional mean-field theory.},

Ex situ defect formation systems prevent real-time analysis, and previous in situ methods are limited to bulk substrates or require further processing to improve the emitter properties1–6. Here we demonstrate the direct laser writing of cavity-integrated spin defects using a nanosecond pulsed above-bandgap laser. Photonic crystal cavities in 4H-silicon carbide serve as a nanoscope monitoring silicon-monovacancy defect formation within the approximately 200 nm3 cavity-mode volume. We observe spin resonance, cavity-integrated photoluminescence and excited-state lifetimes consistent with conventional defect formation methods, without the need for post-irradiation thermal annealing. We further find an exponential reduction in excited-state lifetime at fluences approaching the cavity amorphization threshold and show the single-shot annealing of intrinsic background defects at silicon-monovacancy formation sites. This real-time in situ method of localized defect formation, paired with cavity-integrated defect spins, is necessary towards engineering cavity–emitter coupling for quantum networking. Using direct laser writing with a nanosecond pulsed laser operating at above-bandgap photon energies, we demonstrate the selective formation of spin defects in photonic crystal cavities in 4H-silicon carbide and their in situ characterization.},

So far, antiferromagnet-enabled spin–orbitronics, spin-transfer electronics and spin caloritronics have formed the bases of antiferromagnetic spintronics. Spin transport and manipulation based on coherent antiferromagnetic dynamics have recently emerged, pushing the developing field of antiferromagnetic spintronics towards a new stage distinguished by the features of spin coherence. In this Review, we categorize and analyse the critical effects that harness the coherence of antiferromagnets for spintronic applications, including spin pumping from monochromatic antiferromagnetic magnons, spin transmission via phase-correlated antiferromagnetic magnons, electrically induced spin rotation and ultrafast spin–orbit effects in antiferromagnets. We also discuss future opportunities in research and applications stimulated by the principles, materials and phenomena of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics.

  abstract     = {Tumour-derived exosomes (T-EXOs) impede immune checkpoint blockade therapies, motivating pharmacological efforts to inhibit them. Inspired by how antiviral curvature-sensing peptides disrupt membrane-enveloped virus particles in the exosome size range, we devised a broadly useful strategy that repurposes an engineered antiviral peptide to disrupt membrane-enveloped T-EXOs for synergistic cancer immunotherapy. The membrane-targeting peptide inhibits T-EXOs from various cancer types and exhibits pH-enhanced membrane disruption relevant to the tumour microenvironment. The combination of T-EXO-disrupting peptide and programmed cell death protein-1 antibody-based immune checkpoint blockade therapy improves treatment outcomes in tumour-bearing mice. Peptide-mediated disruption of T-EXOs not only reduces levels of circulating exosomal programmed death-ligand 1, but also restores CD8+ T cell effector function, prevents premetastatic niche formation and reshapes the tumour microenvironment in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that peptide-induced T-EXO depletion can enhance cancer immunotherapy and support the potential of peptide engineering for exosome-targeting applications. A curvature-sensing antiviral peptide is repurposed to disrupt tumour-derived exosomes and used in combination with immune checkpoint blockade cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {The process in which locally confined epithelial malignancies progressively evolve into invasive cancers is often promoted by unjamming, a phase transition from a solid-like to a liquid-like state, which occurs in various tissues. Whether this tissue-level mechanical transition impacts phenotypes during carcinoma progression remains unclear. Here we report that the large fluctuations in cell density that accompany unjamming result in repeated mechanical deformations of cells and nuclei. This triggers a cellular mechano-protective mechanism involving an increase in nuclear size and rigidity, heterochromatin redistribution and remodelling of the perinuclear actin architecture into actin rings. The chronic strains and stresses associated with unjamming together with the reduction of Lamin B1 levels eventually result in DNA damage and nuclear envelope ruptures, with the release of cytosolic DNA that activates a cGAS–STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–signalling adaptor stimulator of interferon genes)-dependent cytosolic DNA response gene program. This mechanically driven transcriptional rewiring ultimately alters the cell state, with the emergence of malignant traits, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal plasticity phenotypes and chemoresistance in invasive breast carcinoma.

  abstract     = {Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging crystalline porous polymers, showing great potential for applications but lacking gas-triggered flexibility. Atropisomerism was experimentally discovered in 1922 but has rarely been found in crystals with infinite framework structures. Here we report atropisomerism in COF single crystals. The obtained COF atropisomers, namely COF-320 and COF-320-A, have identical chemical and interpenetrated structures but differ in the spatial arrangement of repeating units. In contrast to the rigid COF-320 structure, its atropisomer (COF-320-A) exhibits unconventional gas sorption behaviours with one or more sorption steps in isotherms at different temperatures. Single-crystal structures determined from continuous rotation electron diffraction and in situ powder X-ray diffraction demonstrate that these adsorption steps originate from internal pore expansion with or without changing the crystal space group. COF-320-A recognizes different gases by expanding its internal pores continuously (crystal-to-amorphous transition) or discontinuously (crystal-to-crystal transition) or having mixed transition styles, distinguishing COF-320-A from existing soft/flexible porous crystals. These findings extend atropisomerism from molecules to crystals and propel COFs into the covalently linked soft porous crystal regime, further advancing applications of soft porous crystals in gas sorption, separation and storage. Soft porous crystals combine high crystallinity with structural transformability, potentially enabling applications. Here, an atropisomeric covalent organic framework is reported, which demonstrates different structural transformations upon exposure to different gases.},

  abstract     = {Alternative solid electrolytes are the next key step in advancing lithium batteries with better thermal and chemical stability. A soft solid electrolyte, (Adpn)2LiPF6 (Adpn, adiponitrile), is synthesized and characterized that exhibits high thermal and electrochemical stability and good ionic conductivity, overcoming several limitations of conventional organic and ceramic materials. The surface of the electrolyte possesses a liquid nano-layer of Adpn that links grains for a facile ionic conduction without high pressure/temperature treatments. Further, the material can quickly self-heal if fractured and provides liquid-like conduction paths via the grain boundaries. A substantially high ion conductivity (~10−4 S cm–1) and lithium-ion transference number (0.54) are obtained due to weak interactions between ‘hard’ (charge dense) Li+ ions and the ‘soft’ (electronically polarizable) –C≡N group of Adpn. Molecular simulations predict that Li+ ions migrate at the co-crystal grain boundaries with a (preferentially) lower activation energy Ea and within the interstitial regions between the co-crystals with higher Ea values, where the bulk conductivity is a smaller but extant contribution. These co-crystals establish a special concept of crystal design to increase the thermal stability of LiPF6 by separating ions in the Adpn solvent matrix, and also exhibit a unique mechanism of ion conduction via low-resistance grain boundaries, which contrasts with ceramics or gel electrolytes. Alternative solid electrolytes with enhanced thermal and chemical stability are key for advancing lithium batteries. A soft solid electrolyte with improved stability and ionic conductivity, overcoming several limitations of conventional materials, is now reported.},

  abstract     = {Methanol with 12.5 wt% H2 content is widely considered a liquid hydrogen medium. Taking into account water with 11.1 wt% H2 content, H2 synthesis from the mixture of water and methanol is a promising method for on-demand hydrogen production. We demonstrate an atomic-level catalyst design strategy using the synergy between single atoms and nanodots for H2 production. The PtCu–TiO2 sandwich photocatalyst achieves a remarkable H2 formation rate (2,383.9 µmol h–1) with a high apparent quantum efficiency (99.2%). Furthermore, the oxidation product is a high-value chemical formaldehyde with 98.6% selectivity instead of CO2, leading to a nearly zero-carbon-emission process. Detailed investigations indicate a dual role of the copper atoms: an electron acceptor to facilitate photoelectron transfer to Pt, and a hole acceptor for the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde, thus avoiding over-oxidation to CO2. The synergy between Pt nanodots and Cu single atoms together reduces the activation energy of this process to 13.2 kJ mol–1. Liquid water reforming of methanol is a promising method for on-demand hydrogen production. An atomic-level catalyst design strategy, using synergy between single atoms and nanodots, is now shown to demonstrate a high quantum efficiency for hydrogen production.},

Recent developments in vibrational spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope have enabled direct measurements of local phonon modes at defects and interfaces by combining high spatial and energy resolution. However, pushing the ultimate limit of vibrational spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope to reveal the impact of chemical bonding on local phonon modes requires extreme sensitivity of the experiment at the chemical-bond level. Here we demonstrate that, with improved instrument stability and sensitivity, the specific vibrational signals of the same substitutional impurity and the neighbouring carbon atoms in monolayer graphene with different chemical-bonding configurations are clearly resolved, complementary with density functional theory calculations. The present work opens the door to the direct observation of local phonon modes with chemical-bonding sensitivity, and provides more insights into the defect-induced physics in graphene. Vibrational spectroscopy now allows for the exploration of lattice vibrational properties at the chemical-bond level, revealing the impact of chemical-bonding configurations and atomic mass on local phonon modes in graphene with a new level of sensitivity.},

Unlike the phenomena where the interaction involves only electrons in one layer, the interaction of distinct phases in two or more layers represents a new horizon forward, such as the one in the Kondo lattice model. Here, using interlayer excitons as a probe, we show that the interlayer interactions in heterobilayers of tungsten diselenide and molybdenum disulfide (WSe2/MoS2) can be electrically switched on and off, resulting in a layer-dependent correlated phase diagram, including single-layer, layer-selective, excitonic-insulator and layer-hybridized regions. We demonstrate that these correlated phases affect the interlayer exciton non-radiative decay pathways. These results reveal the role of strong correlation on interlayer exciton dynamics and pave the way for studying the layer-resolved strong correlation behaviour in moiré heterostructures. The authors demonstrate electrical on/off switching of interlayer interactions in tungsten diselenide/molybdenum disulfide heterobilayers, the phase diagram of which contains layer-dependent correlated regions that reveal the role of strong correlations in interlayer exciton dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Excitons, Coulomb-bound electron–hole pairs, play a crucial role in both optical excitation and correlated phenomena in solids. When excitons interact with other quasiparticles, few- and many-body excited states can appear. Here we report an interaction between exciton and charges enabled by unusual quantum confinement in two-dimensional moiré superlattices, which results in many-body ground states composed of moiré excitons and correlated electron lattices. In an H-stacked (60o-twisted) WS2/WSe2 heterobilayer, we found an interlayer moiré exciton whose hole is surrounded by its partner electron’s wavefunction distributed among three adjacent moiré traps. This three-dimensional excitonic structure enables large in-plane electrical quadrupole moments in addition to the vertical dipole. Upon doping, the quadrupole facilitates the binding of interlayer moiré excitons to the charges in neighbouring moiré cells, forming intercell charged exciton complexes. Our work provides a framework for understanding and engineering emergent exciton many-body states in correlated moiré charge orders. The authors report on the emergence of intercell moiré exciton complexes where, in H-stacked WS2/WSe2 heterobilayers, the exciton’s hole from the WSe2 layer is surrounded by its bound electron’s wavefunction distributed among three adjacent moiré traps in the WS2 layer exhibiting an out-of-plane dipole and in-plane quadrupole.},

Here we circumvent the above limitation by utilizing unconventional spins generated in a MnPd3 thin film grown on an oxidized silicon substrate. We observe conventional SOT due to y spin, and out-of-plane and in-plane anti-damping-like torques originated from z spin and x spin, respectively, in MnPd3/CoFeB heterostructures. Notably, we have demonstrated complete field-free switching of perpendicular cobalt via out-of-plane anti-damping-like SOT. Density functional theory calculations show that the observed unconventional torques are due to the low symmetry of the (114)-oriented MnPd3 films. Altogether our results provide a path toward realization of a practical spin channel in ultrafast magnetic memory and logic devices.

Previous studies have demonstrated helicity-dependent optical control of chirality and magnetization, with important implications in asymmetric synthesis in chemistry; homochirality in biomolecules; and ferromagnetic spintronics. We report the surprising observation of helicity-dependent optical control of fully compensated antiferromagnetic order in two-dimensional even-layered MnBi2Te4, a topological axion insulator with neither chirality nor magnetization. To understand this control, we study an antiferromagnetic circular dichroism, which appears only in reflection but is absent in transmission. We show that the optical control and circular dichroism both arise from the optical axion electrodynamics. Our axion induction provides the possibility to optically control a family of $${{{\mathcal{PT}}}}$$ -symmetric antiferromagnets ( $${{{\mathcal{P}}}}$$ , inversion; $${{{\mathcal{T}}}}$$ , time-reversal) such as Cr2O3, even-layered CrI3 and possibly the pseudo-gap state in cuprates. In MnBi2Te4, this further opens the door for optical writing of a dissipationless circuit formed by topological edge states.

Large BCs typically arise when electronic states with different spin, orbital or sublattice quantum numbers hybridize at finite crystal momentum. In all the materials known to date, the BC is triggered by the hybridization of a single type of quantum number. Here we report the discovery of the first material system having both spin- and orbital-sourced BC: LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces grown along the [111] direction. We independently detect these two sources and probe the BC associated to the spin quantum number through the measurements of an anomalous planar Hall effect. The observation of a nonlinear Hall effect with time-reversal symmetry signals large orbital-mediated BC dipoles. The coexistence of different forms of BC enables the combination of spintronic and optoelectronic functionalities in a single material.

There is ample consensus that the observed switching does not obey the same mechanisms present in most other ferroelectrics, but its exact nature is still under debate. Next to this fundamental relevance, a large research effort is dedicated to optimizing the use of this extraordinary material, which already shows direct integrability in current semiconductor chips and potential for scalability to the smallest node architectures, in smaller and more reliable devices. Here we present a perspective on how, despite our incomplete understanding and remaining device endurance issues, the lessons learned from hafnium dioxide-based ferroelectrics offer interesting avenues beyond ferroelectric random-access memories and field-effect transistors. We hope that research along these other directions will stimulate discoveries that, in turn, will mitigate some of the current issues. Extending the scope of available systems will eventually enable the way to low-power electronics, self-powered devices and energy-efficient information processing. The discovery of ferroelectric switching in ultrathin layers of hafnium dioxide has aroused significant interest for low-power non-volatile memory technologies. This Perspective discusses how lessons learned from hafnium dioxide-based ferroelectrics can be applied to other applications, and other binary oxides.},

  abstract     = {Spherical ferroelectric domains, such as electrical bubbles, polar skyrmion bubbles and hopfions, share a single and unique feature—their homogeneously polarized cores are surrounded by a vortex ring of polarization whose outer shells form a spherical domain boundary. The resulting polar texture, typical of three-dimensional topological solitons, has an entirely new local symmetry characterized by a high polarization and strain gradients. Consequently, spherical domains represent a different material system of their own with emergent properties drastically different from that of their surrounding medium. Examples of new functionalities inherent to spherical domains include chirality, optical response, negative capacitance and giant electromechanical response. These characteristics, particularly given that the domains naturally have an ultrafine scale, offer new opportunities in high-density and low-energy nanoelectronic technologies. This Perspective gives an insight into the complex polar structure and physical origin of these spherical domains, which facilitates the understanding and development of spherical domains for device applications. Nanoscale ferroelectric topological solitons, such as polar bubbles, polar bubble skyrmions and hopfions, have garnered immense interest due to their emergent properties. This Perspective discusses how these structures form, advances in their study and how they can enable new devices and physics.},

  abstract     = {Activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCLs) are characterized by constitutive activation of nuclear factor κB driven by the B-cell receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways. However, BCR-pathway-targeted therapies have limited impact on DLBCLs. Here we used &amp;gt;1,100 DLBCL patient samples to determine immune and extracellular matrix cues in the lymphoid tumour microenvironment (Ly-TME) and built representative synthetic-hydrogel-based B-cell-lymphoma organoids accordingly. We demonstrate that Ly-TME cellular and biophysical factors amplify the BCR–MYD88–TLR9 multiprotein supercomplex and induce cooperative signalling pathways in ABC-DLBCL cells, which reduce the efficacy of compounds targeting the BCR pathway members Bruton tyrosine kinase and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1). Combinatorial inhibition of multiple aberrant signalling pathways induced higher antitumour efficacy in lymphoid organoids and implanted ABC-DLBCL patient tumours in vivo. Our studies define the complex crosstalk between malignant ABC-DLBCL cells and Ly-TME, and provide rational combinatorial therapies that rescue Ly-TME-mediated attenuation of treatment response to MALT1 inhibitors. A hydrogel-based modular lymphoma organoid identifies how lymphoid microenvironment cues dampen the effect of MALT1 inhibitors and informs effective combination therapies to rescue the treatment response},

  abstract     = {When an electrode contacts an electrolyte, an interfacial electric field forms. This interfacial field can polarize the electrode’s surface and nearby molecules, but its effect can be countered by an applied potential. Quantifying the value of this countering potential (‘potential of zero charge’ (pzc)) is, however, not straightforward. Here we present an optical method for determining the pzc at an electrochemical interface. Our approach uses phase-sensitive second-harmonic generation to determine the electrochemical potential where the interfacial electric field vanishes at an electrode–electrolyte interface with Pt–water as a model experiment. Our method reveals that the pzc of the Pt–water interface is 0.23 ± 0.08 V versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and is pH independent from pH 1 to pH 13. First-principles calculations with a hybrid explicit–implicit solvent model predict the pzc of the Pt(111)–water interface to be 0.23 V versus SHE and reveal how the interfacial water structure rearranges as the electrode potential is moved above and below the pzc. We further show that pzc is sensitive to surface modification; deposition of Ni on Pt shifts the interfacial pzc in the cathodic direction by ~360 mV. Our work demonstrates a materials-agnostic approach for quantifying the interfacial electrical field and water orientation at an electrochemical interface without requiring probe molecules and confirms the long-held view that the interfacial electric field is more intense during hydrogen electrocatalysis in alkaline than in acid. The electric field created at an electrode–electrolyte interface can polarize the electrode’s surface and nearby molecules. Although its effect can be countered by an applied potential, quantifying the value of this potential is difficult. An optical method for determining the potential of zero charge at an electrochemical interface is now presented.},

  abstract     = {Metal-free aqueous batteries can potentially address the projected shortages of strategic metals and safety issues found in lithium-ion batteries. More specifically, redox-active non-conjugated radical polymers are promising candidates for metal-free aqueous batteries because of the polymers’ high discharge voltage and fast redox kinetics. However, little is known regarding the energy storage mechanism of these polymers in an aqueous environment. The reaction itself is complex and difficult to resolve because of the simultaneous transfer of electrons, ions and water molecules. Here we demonstrate the nature of the redox reaction for poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-yl acrylamide) by examining aqueous electrolytes of varying chao-/kosmotropic character using electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring at a range of timescales. Surprisingly, the capacity can vary by as much as 1,000% depending on the electrolyte, in which certain ions enable better kinetics, higher capacity and higher cycling stability. Redox-active non-conjugated radical polymers are promising candidates for metal-free aqueous batteries but their energy storage mechanism in an aqueous environment remains unclear. The role of the electrolyte in such polymers for designing metal-free aqueous energy storage electrodes is now elucidated.},

  abstract     = {Pressure-induced magnetic phase transitions are attracting interest as a means to detect superconducting behaviour at high pressures in diamond anvil cells, but determining the local magnetic properties of samples is a challenge due to the small volumes of sample chambers. Optically detected magnetic resonance of nitrogen vacancy centres in diamond has recently been used for the in situ detection of pressure-induced phase transitions. However, owing to their four orientation axes and temperature-dependent zero-field splitting, interpreting these optically detected magnetic resonance spectra remains challenging. Here we study the optical and spin properties of implanted silicon vacancy defects in 4H-silicon carbide that exhibit single-axis and temperature-independent zero-field splitting. Using this technique, we observe the magnetic phase transition of Nd2Fe14B at about 7 GPa and map the critical temperature–pressure phase diagram of the superconductor YBa2Cu3O6.6. These results highlight the potential of silicon vacancy-based quantum sensors for in situ magnetic detection at high pressures. Optically detected magnetic resonance of nitrogen vacancy centres in diamond enables the detection of pressure-induced phase transitions, but interpreting their magnetic resonance spectra remains challenging.

Unravelling this intimate structure–property relationship is a key challenge that requires methods capable of addressing the light–matter interactions in van der Waals materials with ultimate spatial resolution. Here we use a low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscope to probe—with atomic-scale resolution—the excitonic luminescence of a van der Waals heterostructure, made of a transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer stacked onto a few-layer graphene flake supported by a Au(111) substrate. Sharp emission lines arising from neutral, charged and localized excitons are reported. Their intensities and emission energies vary as a function of the nanoscale topography of the van der Waals heterostructure, explaining the variability of the emission properties observed with diffraction-limited approaches.

Here we conduct a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the prototypical interface between Nd1−xSrxNiO2 and SrTiO3. Atomic-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy in the scanning transmission electron microscope reveals the formation of a single intermediate Nd(Ti,Ni)O3 layer. Density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard U term show how the observed structure alleviates the polar discontinuity. We explore the effects of oxygen occupancy, hole doping and cation structure to disentangle the contributions of each for reducing interface charge density. Resolving the non-trivial interface structure will be instructive for future synthesis of nickelate films on other substrates and in vertical heterostructures. Nickelate superconductivity has so far been limited to thin films, raising questions about the role of the polar substrate–film interface.

  abstract     = {Spin–valley locking is ubiquitous among transition metal dichalcogenides with local or global inversion asymmetry, in turn stabilizing properties such as Ising superconductivity, and opening routes towards ‘valleytronics’. The underlying valley–spin splitting is set by spin–orbit coupling but can be tuned via the application of external magnetic fields or through proximity coupling. However, only modest changes have been realized to date. Here, we investigate the electronic structure of the V-intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide V1/3NbS2 using microscopic-area spatially resolved and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our measurements and corresponding density functional theory calculations reveal that the bulk magnetic order induces a giant valley-selective Ising coupling exceeding 50 meV in the surface NbS2 layer, equivalent to application of a ~250 T magnetic field. This energy scale is of comparable magnitude to the intrinsic spin–orbit splittings, and indicates how coupling of local magnetic moments to itinerant states of a transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer provides a powerful route to controlling their valley–spin splittings. The authors study the electronic structure of the intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide V1/3NbS2, showing that its bulk magnetism can lead to a strong tunability of spin–valley locked states at its surface.},

  abstract     = {Materials capable of sustaining high radiation doses at a high temperature are required for next-generation fission and future fusion energy. To date, however, even the most promising structural materials cannot withstand the demanded radiation environment due to irreversible radiation-driven microstructure degradation. Here we report a counterintuitive strategy to achieve exceptionally high radiation tolerance at high temperatures by enabling reversible local disordering–ordering transition of the introduced superlattice nanoprecipitates in metallic materials. As particularly demonstrated in martensitic steel containing a high density of B2-ordered superlattices, no void swelling was detected even after ultrahigh-dose radiation damage at 400–600 °C. The reordering process of the low-misfit superlattices in highly supersaturated matrices occurs through the short-range reshuffling of radiation-induced point defects and excess solutes right after rapid, ballistic disordering. This dynamic process stabilizes the microstructure, continuously promotes in situ defect recombination and efficiently prevents the capillary-driven long-range diffusion process. The strategy can be readily applied into other materials and pave the pathway for developing materials with high radiation tolerance. The cycling disordering–ordering transition of low-misfit superlattice nanoprecipitates in metallic materials continuously annihilates radiation defects via a short-range atom-reshuffling process, giving rise to high radiation tolerance.},

  abstract     = {Lightweight design strategies and advanced energy applications call for high-strength Al alloys that can serve in the 300‒400 °C temperature range. However, the present commercial high-strength Al alloys are limited to low-temperature applications of less than ~150 °C, because it is challenging to achieve coherent nanoprecipitates with both high thermal stability (preferentially associated with slow-diffusing solutes) and large volume fraction (mostly derived from high-solubility and fast-diffusing solutes). Here we demonstrate an interstitial solute stabilizing strategy to produce high-density, highly stable coherent nanoprecipitates (termed the V phase) in Sc-added Al–Cu–Mg–Ag alloys, enabling the Al alloys to reach an unprecedented creep resistance as well as exceptional tensile strength (~100 MPa) at 400 °C. The formation of the V phase, assembling slow-diffusing Sc and fast-diffusing Cu atoms, is triggered by coherent ledge-aided in situ phase transformation, with diffusion-dominated Sc uptake and self-organization into the interstitial ordering of early-precipitated Ω phase. We envisage that the ledge-mediated interaction between slow- and fast-diffusing atoms may pave the way for the stabilization of coherent nanoprecipitates towards advanced 400 °C-level light alloys, which could be readily adapted to large-scale industrial production. High-density, highly stable coherent nanoprecipitates are created in Al alloys that enable high strength and creep resistance at 400 °C. This is realized via a growth-ledge-triggered in situ phase transformation assembling slow-diffusing solutes with high-solubility solutes into nanoprecipitates.},

However, long-range Coulomb interactions should push the phason energy up to the plasma energy of the charge-density-wave condensate, resulting in a massive phason and fully gapped spectrum1. Using time-domain terahertz emission spectroscopy, we investigate this issue in (TaSe4)2I, a quasi-one-dimensional charge-density-wave insulator. On transient photoexcitation at low temperatures, we find the material strikingly emits coherent, narrowband terahertz radiation. The frequency, polarization and temperature dependences of the emitted radiation imply the existence of a phason that acquires mass by coupling to long-range Coulomb interactions. Our observations underscore the role of long-range interactions in determining the nature of collective excitations in materials with modulated charge or spin order. We report the observation of narrowband terahertz emission from a quasi-one-dimensional charge-density-wave insulator, (TaSe4)2I.

  abstract     = {Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, with ~30% mediated by Sonic hedgehog signalling. Vismodegib-mediated inhibition of the Sonic hedgehog effector Smoothened inhibits tumour growth but causes growth plate fusion at effective doses. Here, we report a nanotherapeutic approach targeting endothelial tumour vasculature to enhance blood–brain barrier crossing. We use fucoidan-based nanocarriers targeting endothelial P-selectin to induce caveolin-1-dependent transcytosis and thus nanocarrier transport into the brain tumour microenvironment in a selective and active manner, the efficiency of which is increased by radiation treatment. In a Sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma animal model, fucoidan-based nanoparticles encapsulating vismodegib exhibit a striking efficacy and marked reduced bone toxicity and drug exposure to healthy brain tissue. Overall, these findings demonstrate a potent strategy for targeted intracranial pharmacodelivery that overcomes the restrictive blood–brain barrier to achieve enhanced tumour-selective penetration and has therapeutic implications for diseases within the central nervous system. Targeting of tumour vasculature endothelial P-selectin promotes caveolin-1-mediated transcytosis for enhanced blood–brain barrier crossing of therapeutic nanoparticles against medulloblastoma.},

  abstract     = {The ideal vaccine against viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 must provide a robust, durable and broad immune protection against multiple viral variants. However, antibody responses to current vaccines often lack robust cross-reactivity. Here we describe a polymeric Toll-like receptor 7 agonist nanoparticle (TLR7-NP) adjuvant, which enhances lymph node targeting, and leads to persistent activation of immune cells and broad immune responses. When mixed with alum-adsorbed antigens, this TLR7-NP adjuvant elicits cross-reactive antibodies for both dominant and subdominant epitopes and antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in mice. This TLR7-NP-adjuvanted influenza subunit vaccine successfully protects mice against viral challenge of a different strain. This strategy also enhances the antibody response to a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine against multiple viral variants that have emerged. Moreover, this TLR7-NP augments antigen-specific responses in human tonsil organoids. Overall, we describe a nanoparticle adjuvant to improve immune responses to viral antigens, with promising implications for developing broadly protective vaccines. A nanoparticle-based adjuvant incorporating a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist elicits cross-reactive antibodies for both dominant and subdominant epitopes and enhances immune responses against multiple variants of influenza and SARS-CoV-2.},

  abstract     = {Messenger RNA has now been used to vaccinate millions of people. However, the diversity of pulmonary pathologies, including infections, genetic disorders, asthma and others, reveals the lung as an important organ to directly target for future RNA therapeutics and preventatives. Here we report the screening of 166 polymeric nanoparticle formulations for functional delivery to the lungs, obtained from a combinatorial synthesis approach combined with a low-dead-volume nose-only inhalation system for mice. We identify P76, a poly-β-amino-thio-ester polymer, that exhibits increased expression over formulations lacking the thiol component, delivery to different animal species with varying RNA cargos and low toxicity. P76 allows for dose sparing when delivering an mRNA-expressed Cas13a-mediated treatment in a SARS-CoV-2 challenge model, resulting in similar efficacy to a 20-fold higher dose of a neutralizing antibody. Overall, the combinatorial synthesis approach allowed for the discovery of promising polymeric formulations for future RNA pharmaceutical development for the lungs. Screening of hundreds of nanoparticle polymers identifies an effective and low-toxicity formulation for the functional delivery of RNA to the lungs of distinct animal species.},

  abstract     = {Mixed conductors—materials that can efficiently conduct both ionic and electronic species—are an important class of functional solids. Here we demonstrate an organic nanocomposite that spontaneously forms when mixing an organic semiconductor with an ionic liquid and exhibits efficient room-temperature mixed conduction. We use a polymer known to form a semicrystalline microstructure to template ion intercalation into the side-chain domains of the crystallites, which leaves electronic transport pathways intact. Thus, the resulting material is ordered, exhibiting alternating layers of rigid semiconducting sheets and soft ion-conducting layers. This unique dual-network microstructure leads to a dynamic ionic/electronic nanocomposite with liquid-like ionic transport and highly mobile electronic charges. Using a combination of operando X-ray scattering and in situ spectroscopy, we confirm the ordered structure of the nanocomposite and uncover the mechanisms that give rise to efficient electron transport. These results provide fundamental insights into charge transport in organic semiconductors, as well as suggesting a pathway towards future improvements in these nanocomposites. A polymer semiconductor/ionic-liquid nanocomposite exhibiting mixed conduction is reported. Using operando X-ray scattering, dynamic structural changes are observed on electrochemical charging, which enables efficient electronic transport.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-rich cathodes are promising energy storage materials due to their high energy densities. However, voltage hysteresis, which is generally associated with transition metal migration, limits their energy efficiency and implementation in practical devices. Here we reveal that voltage hysteresis is related to the collective migration of metal ions, and that isolating the migration events from each other by creating partial disorder can create high-capacity reversible cathode materials, even when migrating transition metal ions are present. We demonstrate this on a layered Li-rich chromium manganese oxide that in its fully ordered state displays a substantial voltage hysteresis (&amp;gt;2.5 V) associated with collective transition metal migration into Li layers, but can be made to achieve high capacity (&amp;gt;360 mAh g−1) and energy density (&amp;gt;1,100 Wh kg−1) when the collective migration is perturbed by partial disorder. This study demonstrates that partially cation-disordered cathode materials can accommodate a high level of transition metal migration, which broadens our options for redox couples to those of mobile cations. The high energy densities of Li-rich cathodes are promising for Li-ion batteries, but voltage hysteresis limits their practical implementation. Voltage hysteresis is shown to be related to collective migration of metal ions, and isolating migration leads to high-capacity reversible cathodes.},

  abstract     = {Spatial modulation of electron beams is an essential tool for various applications such as nanolithography and imaging, yet its conventional implementations are severely limited and inherently non-tunable. Conversely, proposals of light-driven electron spatial modulation promise tunable electron wavefront shaping, for example, using the mechanism of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy. Here we present tunable photon-induced spatial modulation of electrons through their interaction with externally controlled surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Using recently developed methods of shaping SPP patterns, we demonstrate a dynamic control of the electron beam with a variety of electron distributions and verify their coherence through electron diffraction. Finally, the nonlinearity stemming from energy post-selection provides us with another avenue for controlling the electron shape, generating electron features far below the SPP wavelength. Our work paves the way to on-demand electron wavefront shaping at ultrafast timescales, with prospects for aberration correction, nanofabrication and material characterization. On-demand electron wavefront shaping is desirable for applications from nanolithography to imaging.

Such enhancement has far-reaching technological implications; however, the enhancement mechanism and the transport nature of these hybrid excitations remain elusive. Here we map the ultrafast spatiotemporal dynamics of polaritons formed by mixing surface-bound optical waves with Frenkel excitons in a self-assembled molecular layer, resolving polariton dynamics in energy/momentum space. We find that the interplay between the molecular disorder and long-range correlations induced by coherent mixing with light leads to a mobility transition between diffusive and ballistic transport, which can be controlled by varying the light–matter composition of the polaritons. Furthermore, we show that coupling to light enhances the diffusion coefficient of molecular excitons by six orders of magnitude and even leads to ballistic flow at two-thirds the speed of light. The authors study ultrafast spatiotemporal dynamics of polaritons formed by mixing surface-bound optical waves with excitons observing a mobility transition from diffusive to ballistic transport flow at two-thirds the speed of light.},

Both phenomena have been associated with ion migration, with anecdotal evidence that stable devices yield low hysteresis. However, the underlying mechanisms of the complex stability–hysteresis link remain elusive. Here we present a multiscale diffusion framework that describes vacancy-mediated halide diffusion in polycrystalline metal halide perovskites, differentiating fast grain boundary diffusivity from volume diffusivity that is two to four orders of magnitude slower. Our results reveal an inverse relationship between the activation energies of grain boundary and volume diffusions, such that stable metal halide perovskites exhibiting smaller volume diffusivities are associated with larger grain boundary diffusivities and reduced hysteresis. The elucidation of multiscale halide diffusion in metal halide perovskites reveals complex inner couplings between ion migration in the volume of grains versus grain boundaries, which in turn can predict the stability and hysteresis of metal halide perovskites, providing a clearer path to addressing the outstanding challenges of the field. This study identifies a fundamental link between slow-moving ions inside grains and fast-moving ions along grain boundaries in metal halide perovskites that governs their environmental stability and current–voltage responses.},

Here we show the observation of spin currents generated by chiral phonons in a two-dimensional layered hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite implanted with chiral cations when subjected to a thermal gradient. The generated spin current shows a strong dependence on the chirality of the film and external magnetic fields, of which the coefficient is orders of magnitude larger than that produced by the reported spin Seebeck effect. Our findings indicate the potential of chiral phonons for spin caloritronic applications and offer a new route towards spin generation in the absence of magnetic materials.

We uncover hard correlated gaps with C = 0 at integer moiré unit cell fillings of ν = 2 and 3 and reveal charge density wave states originating from van Hove singularities at fractional fillings ν = 5/3 and 11/3. In addition, we demonstrate displacement-field-driven first-order phase transitions at charge neutrality and ν = 2, which are consistent with a theoretical strong-coupling analysis, implying C2T symmetry breaking. Overall, these properties establish a diverse electrically tunable phase diagram of MATTG and provide an avenue for investigating other related systems hosting both steep and flat bands. The authors demonstrate a spectroscopic method, based on magnetotransport measurements, to quantitatively measure the size of the correlated gaps in twisted trilayer graphene and infer their topology.},

  abstract     = {Cubic energy materials such as thermoelectrics or hybrid perovskite materials are often understood to be highly disordered1,2. In GeTe and related IV–VI compounds, this is thought to provide the low thermal conductivities needed for thermoelectric applications1. Since conventional crystallography cannot distinguish between static disorder and atomic motions, we develop the energy-resolved variable-shutter pair distribution function technique. This collects structural snapshots with varying exposure times, on timescales relevant for atomic motions. In disagreement with previous interpretations3–5, we find the time-averaged structure of GeTe to be crystalline at all temperatures, but with anisotropic anharmonic dynamics at higher temperatures that resemble static disorder at fast shutter speeds, with correlated ferroelectric fluctuations along the &amp;lt;100&amp;gt;c direction. We show that this anisotropy naturally emerges from a Ginzburg–Landau model that couples polarization fluctuations through long-range elastic interactions6. By accessing time-dependent atomic correlations in energy materials, we resolve the long-standing disagreement between local and average structure probes1,7–9 and show that spontaneous anisotropy is ubiquitous in cubic IV–VI materials. Cubic materials such as GeTe have low lattice thermal conductivity, thought to arise from a non-cubic local structural transition. Here, using a variable-shutter pair distribution function method, the average structure is shown to be crystalline but with anisotropic dynamics at higher temperatures.},

In such van der Waals heterostructures, magnetic proximity interactions originate in the nanometre-scale coupling between spin-dependent electronic wavefunctions in the two materials, and typically their overall effect is regarded as an effective magnetic field acting on the semiconductor monolayer4–8. Here we demonstrate that magnetic proximity interactions in van der Waals heterostructures can in fact be markedly asymmetric. Valley-resolved reflection spectroscopy of MoSe2/CrBr3 van der Waals structures reveals strikingly different energy shifts in the K and K′ valleys of the MoSe2 due to ferromagnetism in the CrBr3 layer. Density functional calculations indicate that valley-asymmetric magnetic proximity interactions depend sensitively on the spin-dependent hybridization of overlapping bands and as such are likely a general feature of hybrid van der Waals structures. These studies suggest routes to control specific spin and valley states in monolayer semiconductors9,10. The authors demonstrate that magnetic proximity interactions in a hexagonal boron nitride-encapsulated MoSe2/CrBr3 van der Waals heterostructure have a striking difference in the two (K, K′) valleys of a monolayer MoSe2.},

This suggests the possibility to steer collective patterns by introducing and controlling defects in an active system. Here we show that a self-assembled, passive nematic is ideally suited to control the pattern formation process of an active fluid. To this end, we force microtubules to glide inside a passive nematic material made from actin filaments. The actin nematic features self-assembled half-integer defects that steer the active microtubules and lead to the formation of macroscopic polar patterns. Moreover, by confining the nematic in circular geometries, chiral loops form. We find that the exact positioning of nematic defects in the passive material deterministically controls the formation and the polarity of the active flow, opening the possibility of efficiently shaping an active material using passive defects. Defects of a passive nematic liquid crystal made from actin filaments pattern the collective behaviour of active microtubules, creating macroscopic polar patterns and chiral loops.},

Here we present a mechanically active gel–elastomer–nitinol tissue adhesive (MAGENTA) that generates and delivers muscle-contraction-mimicking stimulation to a target tissue with programmed strength and frequency. MAGENTA consists of a shape memory alloy spring that enables actuation up to 40% strain, and an adhesive that efficiently transmits the actuation to the underlying tissue. MAGENTA activates mechanosensing pathways involving yes-associated protein and myocardin-related transcription factor A, and increases the rate of muscle protein synthesis. Disuse muscles treated with MAGENTA exhibit greater size and weight, and generate higher forces compared to untreated muscles, demonstrating the prevention of atrophy. MAGENTA thus has promising applications in the treatment of muscle atrophy and regenerative medicine. An implantable tissue adhesive soft actuator adheres to muscle, generating mechanical stimulation, and activates mechanosensing pathways for prevention of atrophy in disuse muscles.},

Making such artificial neural circuits successful requires minimal device/circuit complexity and ion-based operating mechanisms akin to those found in biology. Artificial spiking neurons, based on silicon-based complementary metal-oxide semiconductors or negative differential resistance device circuits, can emulate several neural features but are complicated to fabricate, not biocompatible and lack ion-/chemical-based modulation features. Here we report a biorealistic conductance-based organic electrochemical neuron (c-OECN) using a mixed ion–electron conducting ladder-type polymer with stable ion-tunable antiambipolarity. The latter is used to emulate the activation/inactivation of sodium channels and delayed activation of potassium channels of biological neurons. These c-OECNs can spike at bioplausible frequencies nearing 100 Hz, emulate most critical biological neural features, demonstrate stochastic spiking and enable neurotransmitter-/amino acid-/ion-based spiking modulation, which is then used to stimulate biological nerves in vivo. These combined features are impossible to achieve using previous technologies. Silicon-based complementary metal-oxide semiconductors or negative differential resistance device circuits can emulate neural features, yet are complicated to fabricate and not biocompatible.

  abstract     = {High-Ni-content layered materials are promising cathodes for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However, investigating the atomic configurations of the delithiation-induced complex phase boundaries and their transitions remains challenging. Here, by using deep-learning-aided super-resolution electron microscopy, we resolve the intralayer transition motifs at complex phase boundaries in high-Ni cathodes. We reveal that an O3 → O1 transformation driven by delithiation leads to the formation of two types of O1–O3 interface, the continuous- and abrupt-transition interfaces. The interfacial misfit is accommodated by a continuous shear-transition zone and an abrupt structural unit, respectively. Atomic-scale simulations show that uneven in-plane Li+ distribution contributes to the formation of both types of interface, and the abrupt transition is energetically more favourable in a delithiated state where O1 is dominant, or when there is an uneven in-plane Li+ distribution in a delithiated O3 lattice. Moreover, a twin-like motif that introduces structural units analogous to the abrupt-type O1–O3 interface is also uncovered. The structural transition motifs resolved in this study provide further understanding of shear-induced phase transformations and phase boundaries in high-Ni layered cathodes. High-Ni-content layered cathodes are promising for lithium-ion batteries, but investigating their delithiation-induced phase boundaries is challenging. Intralayer transition motifs at complex phase boundaries in these high-Ni electrodes are now resolved using deep-learning-aided super-resolution electron microscopy.},

  abstract     = {Delivering inherently stable lithium-ion batteries is a key challenge. Electrochemical lithium insertion and extraction often severely alters the electrode crystal chemistry, and this contributes to degradation with electrochemical cycling. Moreover, electrodes do not act in isolation, and this can be difficult to manage, especially in all-solid-state batteries. Therefore, discovering materials that can reversibly insert and extract large quantities of the charge carrier (Li+), that is, high capacity, with inherent stability during electrochemical cycles is necessary. Here lithium-excess vanadium oxides with a disordered rocksalt structure are examined as high-capacity and long-life positive electrode materials. Nanosized Li8/7Ti2/7V4/7O2 in optimized liquid electrolytes deliver a large reversible capacity of over 300 mAh g−1 with two-electron V3+/V5+ cationic redox, reaching 750 Wh kg−1 versus metallic lithium. Critically, highly reversible Li storage and no capacity fading for 400 cycles were observed in all-solid-state batteries with a sulfide-based solid electrolyte. Operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction combined with high-precision dilatometry reveals excellent reversibility and a near dimensionally invariable character during electrochemical cycling, which is associated with reversible vanadium migration on lithiation and delithiation. This work demonstrates an example of an electrode/electrolyte couple that produces high-capacity and long-life batteries enabled by multi-electron transition metal redox with a structure that is near invariant during cycling. Delivering inherently stable lithium-ion batteries with electrodes that can reversibly insert and extract large quantities of Li+ with inherent stability during cycling are key. Lithium-excess vanadium oxides with a disordered rocksalt structure are now investigated as high-capacity and long-life cathodes.},

  abstract     = {Investigation of the inherent field-driven charge transport behaviour of three-dimensional lead halide perovskites has largely remained challenging, owing to undesirable ionic migration effects near room temperature and dipolar disorder instabilities prevalent specifically in methylammonium-and-lead-based high-performing three-dimensional perovskite compositions. Here, we address both these challenges and demonstrate that field-effect transistors based on methylammonium-free, mixed metal (Pb/Sn) perovskite compositions do not suffer from ion migration effects as notably as their pure-Pb counterparts and reliably exhibit hysteresis-free p-type transport with a mobility reaching 5.4 cm2 V–1 s−1. The reduced ion migration is visualized through photoluminescence microscopy under bias and is manifested as an activated temperature dependence of the field-effect mobility with a low activation energy (~48 meV) consistent with the presence of the shallow defects present in these materials. An understanding of the long-range electronic charge transport in these inherently doped mixed metal halide perovskites will contribute immensely towards high-performance optoelectronic devices. The study of the inherent charge transport behaviour of 3D lead halide perovskite is challenging, owing to entanglement with ionic migration effects and dipolar disorder instabilities. Here, the authors circumvented both challenges and found that ion migration is much suppressed in mixed metal perovskite compositions relative to pure-Pb counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Competition between ground states at phase boundaries can lead to significant changes in properties under stimuli, particularly when these ground states have different crystal symmetries. A key challenge is to stabilize and control the coexistence of symmetry-distinct phases. Using BiFeO3 layers confined between layers of dielectric TbScO3 as a model system, we stabilize the mixed-phase coexistence of centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric BiFeO3 phases at room temperature with antipolar, insulating and polar semiconducting behaviour, respectively. Application of orthogonal in-plane electric (polar) fields results in reversible non-volatile interconversion between the two phases, hence removing and introducing centrosymmetry. Counterintuitively, we find that an electric field ‘erases’ polarization, resulting from the anisotropy in octahedral tilts introduced by the interweaving TbScO3 layers. Consequently, this interconversion between centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric phases generates changes in the non-linear optical response of over three orders of magnitude, resistivity of over five orders of magnitude and control of microscopic polar order. Our work establishes a platform for cross-functional devices that take advantage of changes in optical, electrical and ferroic responses, and demonstrates octahedral tilts as an important order parameter in materials interface design. Electric fields typically break symmetry when applied as a stimulus to materials. Here, by forming a superlattice of BiFeO3 and TbScO3, it is shown that an electric field can repeatedly stabilize mixed-phase polar and antipolar BiFeO3.},

  abstract     = {Crystalline symmetries have played a central role in the identification and understanding of quantum materials. Here we investigate whether an amorphous analogue of a well known three-dimensional strong topological insulator has topological properties in the solid state. We show that amorphous Bi2Se3 thin films host a number of two-dimensional surface conduction channels. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data are consistent with a dispersive two-dimensional surface state that crosses the bulk gap. Spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy shows this state has an anti-symmetric spin texture, confirming the existence of spin-momentum locked surface states. We discuss these experimental results in light of theoretical photoemission spectra obtained with an amorphous topological insulator tight-binding model, contrasting it with alternative explanations. The discovery of spin-momentum locked surface states in amorphous materials opens a new avenue to characterize amorphous matter, and triggers the search for an overlooked subset of quantum materials outside of current classification schemes. The authors present evidence suggesting that amorphous Bi2Se3 displays topological properties, signalling a new regime for the pursuit of topological matter.},

  abstract     = {Mesoscopic Josephson junctions, consisting of overlapping superconducting electrodes separated by a nanometre-thin oxide layer, provide a precious source of nonlinearity for superconducting quantum circuits. Here we show that in a fluxonium qubit, the role of the Josephson junction can also be played by a lithographically defined, self-structured granular aluminium nanojunction: a superconductor–insulator–superconductor Josephson junction obtained in a single-layer, zero-angle evaporation. The measured spectrum of the resulting qubit, which we nickname gralmonium, is indistinguishable from that of a standard fluxonium. Remarkably, the lack of a mesoscopic parallel plate capacitor gives rise to an intrinsically large granular aluminium nanojunction charging energy in the range of tens of gigahertz, comparable to its Josephson energy. We measure coherence times in the microsecond range and we observe spontaneous jumps of the value of the Josephson energy on timescales from milliseconds to days, which offers a powerful diagnostics tool for microscopic defects in superconducting materials. The authors fabricate a fluxonium circuit using a granular aluminium nanoconstriction to replace the conventional superconductor–insulator–superconductor tunnel junction. Their characterization suggests that this approach will be a useful element in the superconducting qubit toolkit.},

Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to determine the microscopic structure of three-dimensional charge order in AV3Sb5 and its interplay with superconductivity. Our approach is based on identifying an unusual splitting of kagome bands induced by three-dimensional charge order, which provides a sensitive way to refine the spatial charge patterns in neighbouring kagome planes. We found a marked dependence of the three-dimensional charge order structure on composition and doping. The observed difference between CsV3Sb5 and the other compounds potentially underpins the double-dome superconductivity in CsV3(Sb,Sn)5 and the suppression of Tc in KV3Sb5 and RbV3Sb5. Our results provide fresh insights into the rich phase diagram of AV3Sb5.

  abstract     = {Only single-electron transistors with a certain level of cleanliness, where all states can be properly accessed, can be used for quantum experiments. To reveal their exceptional properties, carbon nanomaterials need to be stripped down to a single element: graphene has been exfoliated into a single sheet, and carbon nanotubes can reveal their vibrational, spin and quantum coherence properties only after being suspended across trenches1–3. Molecular graphene nanoribbons4–6 now provide carbon nanostructures with single-atom precision but suffer from poor solubility, similar to carbon nanotubes. Here we demonstrate the massive enhancement of the solubility of graphene nanoribbons by edge functionalization, to yield ultra-clean transport devices with sharp single-electron features. Strong electron–vibron coupling leads to a prominent Franck–Condon blockade, and the atomic definition of the edges allows identifying the associated transverse bending mode. These results demonstrate how molecular graphene can yield exceptionally clean electronic devices directly from solution. The sharpness of the electronic features opens a path to the exploitation of spin and vibrational properties in atomically precise graphene nanostructures. Molecular graphene nanoribbons hold promise for quantum experiments in single-electron transistors but require improvements in their debundling. Here, the authors demonstrate ultra-clean transport devices by enhancing nanoribbon solubility via bulky groups on the nanoribbon edges.},

  abstract     = {Strongly correlated bosons in a lattice are a platform that can realize rich bosonic states of matter and quantum phase transitions1. While strongly correlated bosons in a lattice have been studied in cold-atom experiments2–4, their realization in a solid-state system has remained challenging5. Here we trap interlayer excitons–bosons composed of bound electron–hole pairs, in a lattice provided by an angle-aligned WS2/bilayer WSe2/WS2 multilayer. The heterostructure supports Coulomb-coupled triangular moiré lattices of nearly identical period at the top and bottom interfaces. We observe correlated insulating states when the combined electron filling factor of the two lattices, with arbitrary partitions, equals $$\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3},\frac{4}{3}$$ and $$\frac{5}{3}$$ . These states can be interpreted as exciton density waves in a Bose–Fermi mixture of excitons and holes6,7. Because of the strong repulsive interactions between the constituents, the holes form robust generalized Wigner crystals8–11, which restrict the exciton fluid to channels that spontaneously break the translational symmetry of the lattice. Our results demonstrate that Coulomb-coupled moiré lattices are fertile ground for correlated many-boson phenomena12,13. The realization of strongly correlated bosons in a solid-state lattice is challenging. Here, the authors trap interlayer excitons in an angle-aligned WS2/bilayer WSe2/WS2 multilayer moiré lattice and observe correlated insulating states.},

Such collective states are accessible to bosonic and fermionic systems2,4–10,11,12. To expand further the spectrum of accessible quantum matter phases, mixing both species is theoretically appealing because density order then competes with phase separation13–16. Here we manipulate such a Bose–Fermi mixture by confining neutral (boson-like) and charged (fermion-like) dipolar excitons in an artificial square lattice of a GaAs bilayer. At unitary lattice filling, strong inter- and intraspecies interactions stabilize insulating phases when the fraction of charged excitons is around (1/3, 1/2, 2/3). We evidence that dual Bose–Fermi density waves are then realized, with species ordered in alternating stripes. Our observations highlight that dipolar excitons allow for controlled implementations of Bose–Fermi Hubbard models extended by off-site interactions. Both bosonic and fermionic collective states can emerge in two-dimensional semiconductor lattices, and mixing these species can further expand the landscape of quantum phases. Here, the authors report Bose–Fermi mixtures of neutral and charged excitons and the emergence of dual-density waves in an electrostatic lattice in a GaAs bilayer.},

In this Perspective, we describe the work so far on collective vibrations in nanocrystal solids and their as-of-yet untapped potential for phononic applications. With the ability to engineer vibrations in the hypersonic regime through the choice of nanocrystal and linker composition, as well as by controlling their size, shape and chemical interactions, such superstructures offer new opportunities for phononic crystals, acoustic metamaterials and optomechanical systems. Colloidal nanocrystals can form into periodic superlattices exhibiting collective vibrations from the correlated motion of the nanocrystals.

  abstract     = {Tissue morphogenesis, homoeostasis and repair require cells to constantly monitor their three-dimensional microenvironment and adapt their behaviours in response to local biochemical and mechanical cues. Yet the mechanical parameters of the cellular microenvironment probed by cells in vivo remain unclear. Here, we report the mechanics of the cellular microenvironment that cells probe in vivo and in situ during zebrafish presomitic mesoderm differentiation. By quantifying both endogenous cell-generated strains and tissue mechanics, we show that individual cells probe the stiffness associated with deformations of the supracellular, foam-like tissue architecture. Stress relaxation leads to a perceived microenvironment stiffness that decreases over time, with cells probing the softest regime. We find that most mechanical parameters, including those probed by cells, vary along the anteroposterior axis as mesodermal progenitors differentiate. These findings expand our understanding of in vivo mechanosensation and might aid the design of advanced scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. During mesodermal differentiation of living zebrafish embryos, individual cells probe the stiffness associated with the foam-like architecture of the tissue as a part of their mechanosensing responses.},

Despite recent successful efforts to imbue synthetic materials with some of these remarkable functionalities, many emerging properties of complex adaptive systems found in biology remain unexplored in engineered living materials. Here, we describe a three-dimensional printing approach that harnesses the emerging properties of fungal mycelia to create living complex materials that self-repair, regenerate and adapt to the environment while fulfilling an engineering function. Hydrogels loaded with the fungus Ganoderma lucidum are three-dimensionally printed into lattice architectures to enable mycelial growth in a balanced exploration and exploitation pattern that simultaneously promotes colonization of the gel and bridging of air gaps. To illustrate the potential of such mycelium-based living complex materials, we three-dimensionally print a robotic skin that is mechanically robust, self-cleaning and able to autonomously regenerate after damage. Complex living structures with self-healing and regeneration capabilities are 3D printed using bioinks composed of fungal mycelium and an agar-based hydrogel.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular and physical cues of the extracellular matrix environment regulate collective cell dynamics and tissue patterning. Nonetheless, how the viscoelastic properties of the matrix regulate collective cell spatial and temporal organization is not fully understood. Here we show that the passive viscoelastic properties of the matrix encapsulating a spheroidal tissue of breast epithelial cells guide tissue proliferation in space and in time. Matrix viscoelasticity prompts symmetry breaking of the spheroid, leading to the formation of invading finger-like protrusions, YAP nuclear translocation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition both in vitro and in vivo in a Arp2/3-complex-dependent manner. Computational modelling of these observations allows us to establish a phase diagram relating morphological stability with matrix viscoelasticity, tissue viscosity, cell motility and cell division rate, which is experimentally validated by biochemical assays and in vitro experiments with an intestinal organoid. Altogether, this work highlights the role of stress relaxation mechanisms in tissue growth dynamics, a fundamental process in morphogenesis and oncogenesis. Viscoelasticity is a universal mechanical feature of the extracellular matrix. Here the authors show that the extracellular matrix viscoelasticity guides tissue growth and symmetry breaking, a fundamental process in morphogenesis and oncogenesis.},

Here, structurally engineered CMS membranes derived from a tailor-made cross-linkable copolyimide with kinked structure are reported. We demonstrate that combining two features, kinked backbones and cross-linkable backbones, to engineer polyimide precursors while controlling pyrolysis conditions allows the creation of CMS membranes with improved gas separation performance. Our results indicate that the CMS membranes provide a versatile platform for a broad spectrum of challenging gas separations. The gas transport properties of the resulting CMS membranes are interpreted in terms of a model reflecting both molecular sieving Langmuir domains and a disordered continuous phase, thereby providing insight into structure evolution from the cross-linkable polyimide precursor to a final CMS membrane. With this understanding of CMS membrane structure and separation performance, these systems are promising for environmentally friendly gas separations. Carbon molecular sieves (CMS) are formed from pyrolysis of polymeric precursors, forming complex morphologies that enable gas separations. Here, by combining kinked and cross-linkable structures in the precursor, CMS membranes are reported that enable a broad spectrum of challenging gas separations.},

Here, we report a nickel-stabilized, ruthenium dioxide (Ni-RuO2) catalyst, a promising alternative to iridium, with high activity and durability in acidic OER for PEM water electrolysis. While pristine RuO2 showed poor acidic OER stability and degraded within a short period of continuous operation, the incorporation of Ni greatly stabilized the RuO2 lattice and extended its durability by more than one order of magnitude. When applied to the anode of a PEM water electrolyser, our Ni-RuO2 catalyst demonstrated &amp;gt;1,000 h stability under a water-splitting current of 200 mA cm−2, suggesting potential for practical applications. Density functional theory studies, coupled with operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, confirmed the adsorbate-evolving mechanism on Ni-RuO2, as well as the critical role of Ni dopants in stabilization of surface Ru and subsurface oxygen for improved OER durability. Iridium-based electrocatalysts are traditional anode catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis but suffer from high cost and low reserves. An alternative, nickel-stabilized ruthenium dioxide catalyst with high activity and durability in acidic oxygen evolution reaction for water electrolysis is reported.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical phase transformation in ion-insertion crystalline electrodes is accompanied by compositional and structural changes, including the microstructural development of oriented phase domains. Previous studies have identified prevailingly transformation heterogeneities associated with diffusion- or reaction-limited mechanisms. In comparison, transformation-induced domains and their microstructure resulting from the loss of symmetry elements remain unexplored, despite their general importance in alloys and ceramics. Here, we map the formation of oriented phase domains and the development of strain gradient quantitatively during the electrochemical ion-insertion process. A collocated four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy approach, coupled with data mining, enables the study. Results show that in our model system of cubic spinel MnO2 nanoparticles their phase transformation upon Mg2+ insertion leads to the formation of domains of similar chemical identity but different orientations at nanometre length scale, following the nucleation, growth and coalescence process. Electrolytes have a substantial impact on the transformation microstructure (‘island’ versus ‘archipelago’). Further, large strain gradients build up from the development of phase domains across their boundaries with high impact on the chemical diffusion coefficient by a factor of ten or more. Our findings thus provide critical insights into the microstructure formation mechanism and its impact on the ion-insertion process, suggesting new rules of transformation structure control for energy storage materials. Electrochemical phase transformation in ion-insertion crystalline electrodes is accompanied by compositional and structural changes. The formation of oriented phase domains and the development of strain gradient is now mapped quantitatively during the electrochemical ion-insertion process.},

  abstract     = {Landau band crossings typically stem from the intra-band evolution of electronic states in magnetic fields and enhance the interaction effect in their vicinity. Here in the extreme quantum limit of topological insulator HfTe5, we report the observation of a topological Lifshitz transition from inter-band Landau level crossings using magneto-infrared spectroscopy. By tracking the Landau level transitions, we demonstrate that band inversion drives the zeroth Landau bands to cross with each other after 4.5 T and forms a one-dimensional Weyl mode with the fundamental gap persistently closed. The unusual reduction of the zeroth Landau level transition activity suggests a topological Lifshitz transition at 21 T, which shifts the Weyl mode close to the Fermi level. As a result, a broad and asymmetric absorption feature emerges due to the Pauli blocking effect in one dimension, along with a distinctive negative magneto-resistivity. Our results provide a strategy for realizing one-dimensional Weyl quasiparticles in bulk crystals. The manuscript reports on the experimental observation of a Lifshitz transition in a topological insulator HfTe5 subject to a strong magnetic field, which results in the formation of topological one-dimensional Weyl modes in the bulk of a three-dimensional material.},

  abstract     = {Achieving the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells is arguably the most important challenge required to enable widespread commercialization. Understanding the perovskite crystallization process and its direct impact on device stability is critical to achieving this goal. The commonly employed dimethyl-formamide/dimethyl-sulfoxide solvent preparation method results in a poor crystal quality and microstructure of the polycrystalline perovskite films. In this work, we introduce a high-temperature dimethyl-sulfoxide-free processing method that utilizes dimethylammonium chloride as an additive to control the perovskite intermediate precursor phases. By controlling the crystallization sequence, we tune the grain size, texturing, orientation (corner-up versus face-up) and crystallinity of the formamidinium (FA)/caesium (FA)yCs1–yPb(IxBr1–x)3 perovskite system. A population of encapsulated devices showed improved operational stability, with a median T80 lifetime (the time over which the device power conversion efficiency decreases to 80% of its initial value) for the steady-state power conversion efficiency of 1,190 hours, and a champion device showed a T80 of 1,410 hours, under simulated sunlight at 65 °C in air, under open-circuit conditions. This work highlights the importance of material quality in achieving the long-term operational stability of perovskite optoelectronic devices. The stability of halide perovskite solar cells, determined by film morphology, is paramount to their commercialization. Here, the authors introduce a high-temperature DMSO-free method that enables better control of the grain size, texturing, orientation and crystallinity to achieve improved device operational stability.},

External stimuli, including an electric field and light itself, allow us to reconfigure these unusual light–matter interactions. Periodic arrays of vortices obtained by photo-patterning enable the vortex-mediated fission of optical solitons, yielding their lightning-like propagation patterns.

Our vortex lattices might find technological uses in beam steering, telecommunications, virtual reality implementations and anticounterfeiting, as well as possibly offering a model system for probing the interaction of light with defects, including the theoretically predicted, imagination-capturing light-steering action of cosmic strings, elusive defects in cosmology.

A particular route towards a QSL is via strongly bond-dependent interactions on the hexagonal lattice. A number of Ru- and Ir-based candidate Kitaev QSL materials have been pursued, but all have appreciable non-Kitaev interactions. Using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, we observed a broad magnetic continuum over a wide range of temperatures and fields in the honeycomb cobalt-based magnet BaCo2(AsO4)2, which has been proposed to be a more ideal version of a Kitaev QSL. Applying an in-plane magnetic field of ~0.5 T suppresses the magnetic order, and at higher fields, applying the field gives rise to a spin-polarized state. Under a 4 T magnetic field that was oriented principally out of plane, a broad magnetic continuum was observed that may be consistent with a field-induced QSL. Our results indicate BaCo2(AsO4)2 is a promising QSL candidate.

  abstract     = {Layered α-RuCl3 is a promising material to potentially realize the long-sought Kitaev quantum spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. While evidence of this state has been reported under a modest in-plane magnetic field, such behaviour is largely inconsistent with theoretical expectations of spin liquid phases emerging only in out-of-plane fields. These predicted field-induced states have been largely out of reach due to the strong easy-plane anisotropy of bulk crystals, however. We use a combination of tunnelling spectroscopy, magnetotransport, electron diffraction and ab initio calculations to study the layer-dependent magnons, magnetic anisotropy, structure and exchange coupling in atomically thin samples. Due to picoscale distortions, the sign of the average off-diagonal exchange changes in monolayer α-RuCl3, leading to a reversal of spin anisotropy to easy-axis anisotropy, while the Kitaev interaction is concomitantly enhanced. Our work opens the door to the possible exploration of Kitaev physics in the true two-dimensional limit. The authors report a crossover from easy-plane to easy-axis magnetic anisotropy in monolayer RuCl3, which they attribute to an in-plane distortion of the Cl atoms observed in electron diffraction that modify the non-Kitaev exchange terms. The results are useful for overcoming the challenge of realizing a quantum spin liquid.},

  abstract     = {Traditional ceramics or metals cannot simultaneously achieve ultrahigh strength and high electrical conductivity. The elemental carbon can form a variety of allotropes with entirely different physical properties, providing versatility for tuning mechanical and electrical properties in a wide range. Here, by precisely controlling the extent of transformation of amorphous carbon into diamond within a narrow temperature–pressure range, we synthesize an in situ composite consisting of ultrafine nanodiamond homogeneously dispersed in disordered multilayer graphene with incoherent interfaces, which demonstrates a Knoop hardness of up to ~53 GPa, a compressive strength of up to ~54 GPa and an electrical conductivity of 670–1,240 S m–1 at room temperature. With atomically resolving interface structures and molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that amorphous carbon transforms into diamond through a nucleation process via a local rearrangement of carbon atoms and diffusion-driven growth, different from the transformation of graphite into diamond. The complex bonding between the diamond-like and graphite-like components greatly improves the mechanical properties of the composite. This superhard, ultrastrong, conductive elemental carbon composite has comprehensive properties that are superior to those of the known conductive ceramics and C/C composites. The intermediate hybridization state at the interfaces also provides insights into the amorphous-to-crystalline phase transition of carbon. In situ composites consisting of nanodiamond homogeneously dispersed in disordered multilayer graphene with incoherent interfaces and complex bonding are synthesized that exhibit an ultrahigh hardness and compressive strength, and excellent electrical conductivity.},

  abstract     = {The honeycomb magnet α-RuCl3 has attracted considerable interest because it is proximate to the Kitaev Hamiltonian whose excitations are Majoranas and vortices. The thermal Hall conductivity κxy of Majorana fermions is predicted to be half-quantized. Half-quantization of κxy/T (T, temperature) was recently reported, but this observation has proven difficult to reproduce. Here, we report detailed measurements of κxy on α-RuCl3 with the magnetic field B ∥ a (zigzag axis). In our experiment, κxy/T is observed to be strongly temperature dependent between 0.5 and 10 K. We show that its temperature profile matches the distinct form expected for topological bosonic modes in a Chern-insulator-like model. Our analysis yields magnon band energies in agreement with spectroscopic experiments. At high B, the spin excitations evolve into magnon-like modes with a Chern number of ~1. The bosonic character is incompatible with half-quantization of κxy/T. The authors report a strongly temperature-dependent thermal conductivity at low temperature, consistent with topological bosonic modes in a Chern-insulator-like model.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation structural materials are expected to be lightweight, high-strength and tough composites with embedded functionalities to sense, adapt, self-repair, morph and restore. This Review highlights recent developments and concepts in bioinspired nanocomposites, emphasizing tailoring of the architecture, interphases and confinement to achieve dynamic and synergetic responses. We highlight cornerstone examples from natural materials with unique mechanical property combinations based on relatively simple building blocks produced in aqueous environments under ambient conditions. A particular focus is on structural hierarchies across multiple length scales to achieve multifunctionality and robustness. We further discuss recent advances, trends and emerging opportunities for combining biological and synthetic components, state-of-the-art characterization and modelling approaches to assess the physical principles underlying nature-inspired design and mechanical responses at multiple length scales. These multidisciplinary approaches promote the synergetic enhancement of individual materials properties and an improved predictive and prescriptive design of the next era of structural materials at multilength scales for a wide range of applications. This Review discusses recent progress in bioinspired nanocomposite design, emphasizing the role of hierarchical structuring at distinct length scales to create multifunctional, lightweight and robust structural materials for diverse technological applications.},
