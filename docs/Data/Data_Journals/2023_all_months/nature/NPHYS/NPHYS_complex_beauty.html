  abstract     = {Active nematics are the non-equilibrium analogue of passive liquid crystals. They consist of anisotropic units that consume free energy to drive emergent behaviour. As with liquid crystal molecules in displays, ordering and dynamics in active nematics are sensitive to boundary conditions. However, unlike passive liquid crystals, active nematics have the potential to regulate their boundaries through self-generated stresses. Here we show how a three-dimensional, living nematic can actively shape itself and its boundary to regulate its internal architecture through growth-induced stresses, using bacterial biofilms confined by a hydrogel as a model system. We show that biofilms exhibit a sharp transition in shape from domes to lenses in response to changing environmental stiffness or cell–substrate friction, which is explained by a theoretical model that considers the competition between confinement and interfacial forces. The growth mode defines the progression of the boundary, which in turn determines the trajectories and spatial distribution of cell lineages. We further demonstrate that the evolving boundary and corresponding stress anisotropy define the orientational ordering of cells and the emergence of topological defects in the biofilm interior. Our findings may provide strategies for the development of programmed microbial consortia with emergent material properties. Confined biofilms can shape themselves and their boundary to modify their internal organisation. This mechanism could inform the development of active materials that control their own geometry.},

The biophysical dynamics and spectral evolution of nuclear wrinkling during multicellular development remain poorly understood due to a lack of direct quantitative measurements. Here we characterize the onset and dynamics of nuclear wrinkling during egg development in the fruit fly when nurse cell nuclei increase in size and display stereotypical wrinkling behaviour. A spectral analysis of three-dimensional high-resolution live-imaging data from several hundred nuclei reveals a robust asymptotic power-law scaling of angular fluctuations consistent with renormalization and scaling predictions from a nonlinear elastic shell model. We further demonstrate that nuclear wrinkling can be reversed through osmotic shock and suppressed by microtubule disruption, providing tunable physical and biological control parameters for probing the mechanical properties of the nuclear envelope. Our findings advance the biophysical understanding of nuclear membrane fluctuations during early multicellular development. Wrinkling of cell nuclei is associated with disease. During development, the nucleus behaves like a sheet of paper and the wrinkling amplitude can be manipulated without changing its pattern.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of large-scale order in self-organized systems relies on local interactions between individual components. During bacterial cell division, FtsZ—a prokaryotic homologue of the eukaryotic protein tubulin—polymerizes into treadmilling filaments that further organize into a cytoskeletal ring. In vitro, FtsZ filaments can form dynamic chiral assemblies. However, how the active and passive properties of individual filaments relate to these large-scale self-organized structures remains poorly understood. Here we connect single-filament properties with the mesoscopic scale by combining minimal active matter simulations and biochemical reconstitution experiments. We show that the density and flexibility of active chiral filaments define their global order. At intermediate densities, curved, flexible filaments organize into chiral rings and polar bands. An effectively nematic organization dominates for high densities and for straight, mutant filaments with increased rigidity. Our predicted phase diagram quantitatively captures these features, demonstrating how the flexibility, density and chirality of the active filaments affect their collective behaviour. Our findings shed light on the fundamental properties of active chiral matter and explain how treadmilling FtsZ filaments organize during bacterial cell division. Filaments of the FtsZ protein can form chiral assemblies. Now, active matter tools link the microscopic structure of active filaments to the large-scale collective phase of these assemblies.},

  abstract     = {The boson peak is an excess in the phonon vibrational density of states relative to the Debye model. It has been observed in a wide range of amorphous materials, from inorganic glasses to polymers. Two-dimensional random matrix models and molecular dynamics simulations predict that the boson peak should also be present in amorphous two-dimensional materials, a notion that is of practical importance because it leads to an excess of heat capacity and influences transport properties. However, up until now, experimental observations in actual materials have not been possible due to the limited surface sensitivity of the methods usually applied to measure the boson peak. Here we present the experimental evidence of a boson peak in two-dimensional silica, through phonon spectra measured by means of inelastic helium-atom scattering. We identify the boson peak as a wavenumber-independent spectral maximum at a frequency similar to what has been observed in and predicted for bulk vitreous silica. Furthermore, we present a heterogeneous-elastic theory calculation in two dimensions, which shows how the vibrational coupling of the transversal and flexural shear vertical phonon modes produces the boson peak in two-dimensional materials at a frequency similar to that of the bulk, in agreement with our measurements. The boson peak refers to an excess in the phonon density of states seen in three-dimensional amorphous materials. Helium-atom scattering experiments have now revealed a boson peak in a two-dimensional material, too, at a frequency similar to that of the bulk material.},

  abstract     = {Spinning objects moving through air or a liquid experience a lift force—a phenomenon known as the Magnus effect. This effect is commonly exploited in ball sports but also is of considerable importance for applications in the aviation industry. Whereas Magnus forces are strong for large objects, they are weak at small scales and eventually vanish for overdamped micrometre-sized particles in simple liquids. Here we demonstrate a roughly one-million-fold enhanced Magnus force of spinning colloids in viscoelastic fluids. Such fluids are characterized by a time-delayed response to external perturbations, which causes a deformation of the fluidic network around the moving particle. When the particle also spins, the deformation field becomes misaligned relative to the particle’s moving direction, leading to a force perpendicular to the direction of travel and the spinning axis. Our uncovering of strongly enhanced memory-induced Magnus forces at microscales opens up applications for particle sorting and steering, and the creation and visualization of anomalous flows. The Magnus effect refers to rotating objects developing a lift force when travelling through a fluid. It normally vanishes at microscopic length scales but now a very large Magnus effect is demonstrated for spinning colloids in viscoelastic fluids.},

  abstract     = {The atomic-scale structural rearrangement of glasses on applied stress is central to the understanding of their macroscopic mechanical properties and behaviour. However, experimentally resolving the atomic-scale structural changes of a deformed glass remains challenging due to the disordered nature of the glass structure. Conventional structural analyses such as X-ray diffraction are based on the assumption of structural isotropy and hence cannot discern the subtle atomic-scale structural rearrangement induced by deformation. Here we show that structural anisotropy correlates with non-affine atomic displacements—meaning those that do not preserve parallel lines in the atomic structure—in various types of glass. This serves as an approach for identifying the atomic-scale non-affine deformation in glasses. We also uncover the atomic-level mechanism responsible for plastic flow, which differs between metallic glasses and covalent glasses. The non-affine structural rearrangements in metallic glasses are mediated through the stretching or contraction of atomic bonds. The non-affinity of covalent glasses that occurs in a less localized manner is mediated through the rotation of atomic bonds or chains without changing the bond length. These findings provide key ingredients for exploring the atomic-scale process governing the macroscopic deformation of amorphous solids. Resolving the structural changes of a deformed glass on the atomic scale is challenging due to its disordered nature. Now, high-energy diffraction measurements show that non-line-preserving atomic displacements in glasses correlate with structural anisotropy.},

  abstract     = {Many complex and disordered systems fail to reach equilibrium after they have been quenched or perturbed. Instead, they sluggishly relax toward equilibrium at an ever-slowing, history-dependent rate, a process termed physical aging. The microscopic processes underlying the dynamic slow-down during aging and the reason for its similar occurrence in different systems remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the structural mechanism underlying logarithmic aging in disordered mechanical systems through experiments in crumpled sheets and simulations of a disordered network of bistable elastic elements. We show that under load, the system self-organizes to a metastable state poised on the verge of an instability, where it can remain for long, but finite, times. The system’s relaxation is intermittent, advancing via rapid sequences of instabilities, grouped into self-similar, aging avalanches. Crucially, the quiescent dwell times between avalanches grow in proportion to the system’s age, due to a slow increase of the lowest effective energy barrier, which leads to logarithmic aging. Many complex systems relax slowly towards equilibrium after a perturbation, without ever reaching it. Experiments with crumpled sheets now show that these relaxations involve intermittent avalanches of localized instabilities, whose slow-down leads to logarithmic aging.},

  abstract     = {The magnetization of a quantum magnet can be pinned at a fraction of its saturated value by collective effects. One example of such a plateau phase is found in spin-1/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnets. They feature strong geometrical frustration and the plateau phase therein is often interpreted as arising from an order-by-disorder mechanism driven by quantum fluctuations. Here we observe a one-third magnetization plateau under an applied magnetic field in the spin-1 antiferromagnet Na3Ni2BiO6 with a honeycomb lattice, which, with conventional magnetic interactions, would not be geometrically frustrated. Based on our elastic neutron scattering measurements, we propose the spin structure of the plateau phase to be an unusual partial spin-flop ferrimagnetic order. Our theoretical calculations indicate that bond-anisotropic Kitaev interactions are the source of frustration that produces the plateau. These results suggest that Kitaev interactions provide a different route to frustration and phases driven by quantum fluctuations in high-spin magnets. Na3Ni2BiO6 with a honeycomb lattice is found to host a one-third magnetization plateau phase signifying frustrated interactions and indicates that Kitaev interactions can be realized in high-spin magnets.},

  abstract     = {The undoped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator naturally has one charge carrier per lattice site. When it is doped with additional carriers, they are unstable to spin-fluctuation-mediated Cooper pairing as well as other unconventional types of charge, spin and orbital current ordering. Photo-excitation can produce charge carriers in the form of empty (holons) and doubly occupied (doublons) sites that may also exhibit charge instabilities. There is evidence that antiferromagnetic correlations enhance attractive interactions between holons and doublons, which can then form bound pairs known as Hubbard excitons, and that these might self-organize into an insulating Hubbard exciton fluid. However, this out-of-equilibrium phenomenon has not been experimentally detected. Here we report the transient formation of a Hubbard exciton fluid in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 using ultrafast terahertz conductivity. Following photo-excitation, we observe rapid spectral-weight transfer from a Drude metallic response to an insulating response. The latter is characterized by a finite-energy peak originating from intraexcitonic transitions, whose assignment is corroborated by our numerical simulations of an extended Hubbard model. The lifetime of the peak is short (approximately one picosecond) and scales exponentially with the Mott gap size, implying extremely strong coupling to magnon modes. Hole and particle-like quasiparticles of a Mott insulator can pair into excitonic bound states. Now, time-resolved measurements of Sr2IrO4 show signs of an excitonic fluid forming from a photo-excited population of quasiparticles.},

A large phonon magnetic moment enables the direct mutual control of magnetic orders and lattice motions, and could be applied to develop spin–phononic devices. In some non- and paramagnetic systems, a large phonon magnetic moment is found due to coupling with electronic excitations. However, for magnetically ordered systems, a correspondingly large moment has not yet been discovered, and the roles of many-body correlations and fluctuations in phonon magnetism remain unclear. Here we report a phonon magnetic moment that is enhanced by critical fluctuations in a polar antiferromagnet, namely, Fe2Mo3O8. Combining magneto-Raman spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering measurements, we show that a pair of low-lying chiral phonons carry large magnetic moments. Once the system is driven to a ferrimagnetic phase, we observe a splitting between the chiral phonons of nearly a quarter of the phonon frequency. We also observe a sixfold enhancement in the phonon magnetic moment in the vicinity of the Néel temperature. A microscopic model based on the coupling between phonons and both magnons and paramagnons accounts for the experimental observations. Phonons that carry a large magnetic moment may be helpful for creating spintronic devices. Now this phenomenon is observed in an antiferromagnet and is enhanced by the critical fluctuations associated with a phase transition.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of moiré materials with flat bands provides a platform to systematically investigate and precisely control the correlated electronic phases. Here we report on a rich phase diagram of interpenetrating Hofstadter states—also called Chern insulators—and electron solids in a twisted WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayer using local electronic compressibility measurements. We show that this reflects the presence of both flat and dispersive moiré bands whose relative energies, and therefore occupations, are tuned by the density and magnetic field. At low density, the competition between moiré bands leads to a transition from the commensurate arrangements of singlets at doubly occupied sites to triplet configurations at high fields. Hofstadter states are generally favoured at high density as dispersive bands are populated, but are suppressed by an intervening region of re-entrant charge-ordered states in which holes originating from multiple bands cooperatively crystallize. Our results reveal the key microscopic ingredients that favour distinct correlated ground states in semiconductor moiré systems, and they demonstrate an emergent lattice model system in which both interactions and band dispersion can be experimentally controlled. The interplay between flat and dispersive bands in moiré materials has not yet been examined in detail. Now, the phase diagram of a transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer shows correlated states arising from both types of band.},

  abstract     = {The spin–orbit interaction plays an important role in magnetism and in many quantum materials. It is the cornerstone of the physics of many electronic phases that emerge at interfaces because of broken inversion symmetry. In that context, the spin Rashba effect locks electronic spins with momentum to produce large spin galvanic effects. It has recently been argued that these spin-based effects could in fact be spin–orbit coupling consequences of a potentially larger orbital effect. Here we observe spin-to-charge conversion at a LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface and demonstrate that its orbital contribution dominates. Our analysis of the in-plane anisotropy and gate voltage dependence of the angular momentum conversion into charge highlights some of the salient features of the orbital Rashba splitting. These results open the door to broader use of pure orbital angular momentum effects and confirm the potential of the orbital degree of freedom for information storage and processing. Observations of the conversion of orbital angular momentum into charge indicate that the orbital degree of freedom can provide a channel for information storage and processing.},

They are rare in naturally occurring compounds, but the tailored manipulation of quantum matter offers opportunities for their realization. Specifically, lattices of Yu–Shiba–Rusinov bound states—Shiba lattices—that arise when magnetic adatoms are placed on the surface of a conventional superconductor can be used to create topological bands within the superconducting gap of the substrate. Here we reveal two signatures consistent with the realization of two types of mirror-symmetry-protected topological superconductor using scanning tunnelling microscopy to create and probe adatom lattices with single-atom precision. The first has edge modes as well as higher-order corner states, and the second has symmetry-protected bulk nodal points. In principle, their topological character and boundary modes should be protected by the spatial symmetries of the adatom lattice. Our results highlight the potential of Shiba lattices as a platform to design the topology and sample geometry of two-dimensional superconductors. One-dimensional chains of magnetic adatoms on the surface of a superconductor have been claimed to host topological states. Now, this idea is extended to two-dimensional systems.},

  abstract     = {In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) depends on the number of CuO2 planes in the structural unit and the maximum Tc is realized in the trilayer system. Trilayer superconductors also exhibit an unusual phase diagram where Tc is roughly constant in the overdoped region, which is in contrast to the decrease usually found in other cuprate superconductors. The mechanism for these two effects remains unclear. Here we report features in the electronic structure of Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+δ superconductor that helps to explain this issue. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements show the splitting of bands from the three layers, and this allows us to parameterize a three-layer interaction model that effectively describes the data. This, in turn, demonstrates the electronic origin of the maximum Tc and its persistence in the overdoped region. These results are qualitatively consistent with a composite picture where a high Tc is realized in an array of coupled planes with different doping levels such that a high pairing strength is derived from the underdoped planes, whereas a large phase stiffness comes from the optimally or overdoped ones. Measurements of the electronic structure of a trilayer cuprate superconductor suggest that its high critical temperature is explained by the different doping levels of the layers. The combination of underdoped inner layer and overdoped outer layers supports superconductivity.},

  abstract     = {Electron-doped cuprates consistently exhibit strong antiferromagnetic correlations, leading to the prevalent belief that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations mediate Cooper pairing in these unconventional superconductors. However, early investigations showed that although antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations create the largest pseudogap at hot spots in momentum space, the superconducting gap is also maximized at these locations. This presented a paradox for spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing: Cooper pairing is strongest at momenta where the normal-state low-energy spectral weight is most suppressed. Here we investigate this paradox and find evidence that a gossamer—meaning very faint—Fermi surface can provide an explanation for these observations. We study Nd2–xCexCuO4 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and directly observe the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. First, we resolve the previously observed reconstructed main band and the states gapped by the antiferromagnetic pseudogap around the hot spots. Within the antiferromagnetic pseudogap, we also observe gossamer states with distinct dispersion, from which coherence peaks of Bogoliubov quasiparticles emerge below the superconducting critical temperature. Moreover, the direct observation of a Bogoliubov quasiparticle permits an accurate determination of the superconducting gap, yielding a maximum value an order of magnitude smaller than the pseudogap, establishing the distinct nature of these two gaps. We propose that orientation fluctuations in the antiferromagnetic order parameter are responsible for the gossamer states. Observation of a faint Fermi surface inside the pseudogap of an electron-doped cuprate suggests that Cooper pairing is mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {Electronic nematicity that spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry is a generic phenomenon in correlated quantum systems including high-temperature superconductors and the AV3Sb5 (A can be K, Rb or Cs) family of kagome superconductors. However, the underlying mechanism of nematicity in these systems is hard to identify because of its entanglement with other ordered phases. Recently, a family of titanium-based kagome superconductors ATi3Bi5 have been synthesized, where electronic nematicity occurs in the absence of charge order. It provides a platform to study nematicity in its pure form, as well as its interplay with orbital degrees of freedom. Here we reveal the band topology and orbital characters of the multiorbital RbTi3Bi5. We use polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with density functional theory to identify the coexistence of flat bands, type-II Dirac nodal lines and non-trivial topology in this compound. Our study demonstrates the change in orbital character along the Fermi surface contributed by the kagome bands, implying a strong intrinsic interorbital coupling in the Ti-based kagome metals. Furthermore, doping-dependent measurements uncover the orbital-selective features in the kagome bands, which can be explained by d–p hybridization. Hence, interorbital coupling together with d–p hybridization is probably the origin of electronic nematicity in ATi3Bi5. The origin of nematicity in kagome superconductors has been hard to explain due to other entangled phases. Now, the role of orbital hybridization and coupling is revealed to induce electronic nematicity in the kagome superconductor RbTi3Bi5.},

Here we demonstrate a two-orders-of-magnitude increase in photo-susceptibility near 10 THz excitation frequency. At these drive frequencies, a metastable superconducting-like phase is observed up to room temperature. The discovery of a dominant frequency scale sheds light on the microscopic mechanism underlying photo-induced superconductivity. It also indicates a path towards steady-state operation, limited at present by the availability of a suitable high-repetition-rate optical source at these frequencies.

It has been applied to a variety of systems in the gas phase and solid state. Here we extend its use to liquid samples. By studying high-harmonic generation over a broad range of wavelengths and intensities, we show that the cut-off energy is independent of the wavelength beyond a threshold intensity and that it is a characteristic property of the studied liquid. We explain these observations with a semi-classical model based on electron trajectories that are limited by the electron scattering. This is further confirmed by measurements performed with elliptically polarized light and with ab-initio time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Our results propose high-harmonic spectroscopy as an all-optical approach for determining the effective mean free paths of slow electrons in liquids. This regime is extremely difficult to access with other methodologies, but is critical for understanding radiation damage to living tissues. Our work also indicates the possibility of resolving subfemtosecond electron dynamics in liquids offering an all-optical approach to attosecond spectroscopy of chemical processes in their native liquid environment. The application of high-harmonic spectroscopy to liquid samples shows that the cut-off energy is a material characteristic.

Such temperature and pressure regimes, which result in a change in the refractive index and sound velocity, can be accessed by optoacoustic interactions such as Brillouin–Mandelstam scattering. Here we demonstrate the Brillouin–Mandelstam measurements of nanolitre volumes of liquids in extreme thermodynamic regimes. This is enabled by a fully sealed liquid-core optical fibre containing carbon disulfide. Within this waveguide, which exhibits tight optoacoustic confinement and a high Brillouin gain, we are able to conduct spatially resolved measurements of the local Brillouin response, giving us access to a resolved image of the temperature and pressure values along the liquid channel. We measure the material properties of the liquid core at very large positive pressures (above 1,000 bar) and substantial negative pressures (below –300 bar), as well as explore the isobaric and isochoric regimes. The extensive thermodynamic control allows the tunability of the Brillouin frequency shift of more than 40\% using only minute volumes of liquid. Material characterization of liquids in extreme thermodynamic conditions is a challenging technical problem. Brillouin scattering metrology in an optical fibre design with a sealed liquid core now enables spatially resolved temperature and pressure measurements, using carbon disulfide as an example.},

  abstract     = {Quantum systems subject to driving and dissipation display distinctive non-equilibrium phenomena relevant to condensed matter, quantum optics, metrology and quantum error correction. An example is the emergence of phase transitions with uniquely quantum properties, which opposes the intuition that dissipation generally leads to classical behaviour. The quantum and non-equilibrium nature of such systems makes them hard to study with existing tools, such as those from equilibrium statistical mechanics, and represents a challenge for numerical simulations. Quantum computers, however, are well suited to simulating such systems, especially as hardware developments enable the controlled application of dissipative operations in a pristine quantum environment. Here we demonstrate a large-scale accurate quantum simulation of a non-equilibrium phase transition using a trapped-ion quantum computer. We simulate a quantum extension of the classical contact process that has been proposed as a description for driven gases of Rydberg atoms and has stimulated numerous attempts to determine the impact of quantum effects on the classical directed-percolation universality class. We use techniques such as qubit reuse and error avoidance based on real-time conditional logic to implement large instances of the model with 73 sites and up to 72 circuit layers and quantitatively determine the model’s critical properties. Our work demonstrates that today’s quantum computers are able to perform useful simulations of open quantum system dynamics and non-equilibrium phase transitions. Quantum computers may help to solve classically intractable problems, such as simulating non-equilibrium dissipative quantum systems. The critical dynamics of a dissipative quantum model has now been probed on a trapped-ion quantum computer.},

We observe strong interqubit noise correlations with a correlation strength as large as 0.7 at around 1 Hz, even in the regime where the spin–spin exchange interaction contributes negligibly. We find that fluctuations of single-spin precession rates are strongly correlated with exchange noise, showing that they have an electrical origin. Noise cross-correlations have thus enabled us to pinpoint the most influential noise in our device. Our work presents a powerful tool set to assess and identify the noise acting on multiple qubits and highlights the importance of long-range electric noise in densely packed silicon spin qubits. Errors in a quantum computer that are correlated between different qubits pose a considerable challenge for correction schemes. Measurements of noise in silicon spin qubits show that electric field fluctuations can create strongly correlated errors.},

  abstract     = {An important measure of the development of quantum computing platforms has been the simulation of increasingly complex physical systems. Before fault-tolerant quantum computing, robust error-mitigation strategies were necessary to continue this growth. Here, we validate recently introduced error-mitigation strategies that exploit the expectation that the ideal output of a quantum algorithm would be a pure state. We consider the task of simulating electron systems in the seniority-zero subspace where all electrons are paired with their opposite spin. This affords a computational stepping stone to a fully correlated model. We compare the performance of error mitigations on the basis of doubling quantum resources in time or in space on up to 20 qubits of a superconducting qubit quantum processor. We observe a reduction of error by one to two orders of magnitude below less sophisticated techniques such as postselection. We study how the gain from error mitigation scales with the system size and observe a polynomial suppression of error with increased resources. Extrapolation of our results indicates that substantial hardware improvements will be required for classically intractable variational chemistry simulations. It is hoped that simulations of molecules and materials will provide a near-term application of quantum computers. A study of the performance of error mitigation highlights the obstacles to scaling up these calculations to practically useful sizes.},

  abstract     = {The leakage of quantum information out of the two computational states of a qubit into other energy states represents a major challenge for quantum error correction. During the operation of an error-corrected algorithm, leakage builds over time and spreads through multi-qubit interactions. This leads to correlated errors that degrade the exponential suppression of the logical error with scale, thus challenging the feasibility of quantum error correction as a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we demonstrate a distance-3 surface code and distance-21 bit-flip code on a quantum processor for which leakage is removed from all qubits in each cycle. This shortens the lifetime of leakage and curtails its ability to spread and induce correlated errors. We report a tenfold reduction in the steady-state leakage population of the data qubits encoding the logical state and an average leakage population of less than 1 × 10−3 throughout the entire device. Our leakage removal process efficiently returns the system back to the computational basis. Adding it to a code circuit would prevent leakage from inducing correlated error across cycles. With this demonstration that leakage can be contained, we have resolved a key challenge for practical quantum error correction at scale. Physical realizations of qubits are often vulnerable to leakage errors, where the system ends up outside the basis used to store quantum information. A leakage removal protocol can suppress the impact of leakage on quantum error-correcting codes.},

  abstract     = {Biological processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing and cancer progression rely on the ability of epithelial cells to coordinate their mechanical activity over length scales that are orders of magnitude larger than the typical cellular size1. Although this process is regulated by various signalling pathways2, it has recently become evident that this coordination can be understood using physics tools, of which liquid crystal order is a prominent example3,4. However, prior studies have given inconsistent results in this respect. Whereas nematic order is often invoked in the interpretation of experimental data3–5, computational models have instead suggested that hexatic order could serve as a linchpin for collective migration in confluent cell layers6–8. In this Letter, we resolve this dilemma. Using a combination of in vitro experiments, numerical simulations and analytical work, we demonstrate that both nematic and hexatic order are present in epithelial layers, with the former being dominant at large length scales and the latter at small length scales. In cells on uncoated glass, these different types of liquid crystal order cross over at a length scale of the order of ten cell sizes. Our work provides a framework for deciphering epithelial structure and may lead to a predictive mesoscopic theory of tissues9. Cells in a tissue layer arrange themselves in orientationally ordered structures. Now two types of liquid crystalline order have been shown to coexist, with nematic order dominating large length scales and hexatic order dominating small length scales.},

  abstract     = {The ability to perform measurements in the middle of a quantum circuit is a powerful resource. It underlies a wide range of applications, from remote state preparation to quantum error correction. Here we apply mid-circuit measurements for a particular task: demonstrating quantum computational advantage. The goal of such a demonstration is for a quantum device to perform a computational task that is infeasible for a classical device with comparable resources. In contrast to existing demonstrations, the distinguishing feature of our approach is that the classical verification process is efficient, both in asymptotic complexity and in practice. Furthermore, the classical hardness of performing the task is based upon well-established cryptographic assumptions. Protocols with these features are known as cryptographic proofs of quantumness. Using a trapped-ion quantum computer, we perform mid-circuit measurements by spatially isolating portions of the ion chain via shuttling. This enables us to implement two interactive cryptographic proofs of quantumness, which when suitably scaled to larger systems, promise the efficient verification of quantum computational advantage. Our methods can be applied to a range of interactive quantum protocols. Being able to perform qubit measurements within a quantum circuit and adapt to their outcome broadens the power of quantum computers. These mid-circuit measurements have now been used to implement a cryptographic proof of non-classical behaviour.},

  abstract     = {As Moore’s law reaches its limits, quantum computers are emerging that hold promise to dramatically outperform classical computers. It is now possible to build quantum processors with over 100 qubits, which are expected to be beyond the reach of classical simulation. These developments have been accompanied by the anticipation that, at some stage, a quantum computer should be able to perform a task that is practically impossible for any classical computer. The lead candidate for reaching this threshold is random circuit sampling, which involves sampling the output of a quantum computer after implementing a sequence of random quantum operations. However, it is difficult to provide theoretical guarantees on the hardness of simulating random quantum circuits by classical computers. Here we prove that estimating the output probabilities of random quantum circuits is #P-hard for any classical computer. We also extend our results to a restricted model of quantum computation known as instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuits. We achieve this by a worst-case to average-case reduction for quantum-circuit simulation. The robustness of our result to the estimation error serves as a new hardness criterion for the performance of classical algorithms. Our results suggest that there is an exponential hardness barrier for the approximate classical simulation of most quantum circuits. Quantum computers are believed to exponentially outperform classical computers at some tasks, but it is hard to make guarantees about the limits of classical computers. It has now been proven that classical computers cannot efficiently simulate most quantum circuits.},

  abstract     = {A complex scattering medium offers spatial mixing of the incoming waves via numerous randomly wired channels, making it act as a unique linear optical operator. However, its use as a nonlinear operator has been unexplored due to the difficulty in formulating the nonlinear wave–medium interaction. Here we present a theoretical framework and experimental proof that a third-order scattering tensor completely describes the input–output response of a nonlinear scattering medium made of second-harmonic-generation nanoparticles. The rank of the nonlinear scattering tensor is higher than that of a second-order scattering tensor describing a linear scattering medium, scaling with the number of the spatially orthogonal illumination channels. We implement the inverse of the nonlinear scattering tensor by tensor reshaping and minimization operation, which enables us to retrieve the original incident wave from the speckled nonlinear wave. Using the increased rank of the scattering tensor along with its inverse operation, we demonstrate that the disordered nonlinear medium can be used as a highly scalable nonlinear optical operator for optical encryptions, all-optical multichannel logic AND gates, and optical kernel methods in machine learning. Disordered media with their numerous scattering channels can be used as optical operators. Measurements of the scattering tensor of a second-harmonic medium extend this computing application to the nonlinear regime.},

This process inherently requires the combination of energy exchanges among the waves and spatial interfaces to tailor their scattering. Here we explore the temporal analogue of this phenomenon, based on time interfaces that support instantaneous non-conservative scattering events for photons. Based on this mechanism, we demonstrate ultrabroadband temporal coherent wave control and the photonic analogue of mechanical collisions with phase-tunable elastic features. We apply them to erase, enhance and reshape arbitrary pulses by suitably tailoring the amplitude and phase of counterpropagating signals. Our findings provide a pathway to effectively sculpt broadband light with light without requiring spatial boundaries, within an ultrafast and low-energy platform. Coherent control is an interference technique widely used to control dynamic wave processes. Its analogue in the time domain allows the tailored suppression, enhancement and reshaping of optical pulses, and the mimicking of collisions between them.},

  abstract     = {An enduring challenge in constructing mechanical-oscillator-based hybrid quantum systems is to ensure engineered coupling to an auxiliary degree of freedom and maintain good mechanical isolation from the environment, that is, low quantum decoherence, consisting of thermal decoherence and dephasing. Here we overcome this challenge by introducing a superconducting-circuit-based optomechanical platform that exhibits low quantum decoherence and has a large optomechanical coupling, which allows us to prepare the quantum ground and squeezed states of motion with high fidelity. We directly measure a thermal decoherence rate of 20.5 Hz (corresponding to T1 = 7.7 ms) as well as a pure dephasing rate of 0.09 Hz, yielding a 100-fold improvement in the quantum state lifetime compared with prior optomechanical systems. This enables us to reach a motional ground-state occupation of 0.07 quanta (93\% fidelity) and realize mechanical squeezing of –2.7 dB below the zero-point fluctuation. Furthermore, we observe the free evolution of the mechanical squeezed state, preserving its non-classical nature over millisecond timescales. Such ultralow quantum decoherence not only increases the fidelity of quantum control and measurement of macroscopic mechanical systems but may also benefit interfacing with qubits, and places the system in a parameter regime suitable for tests of quantum gravity. Achieving low decoherence is challenging in hybrid quantum systems. A superconducting-circuit-based optomechanical platform realizes millisecond-scale quantum state lifetime, which allows tracking of the free evolution of a squeezed mechanical state.},

  abstract     = {High-harmonic generation (HHG) is an extreme nonlinear process in which intense pulses of light drive matter to emit high harmonics of the driving frequency, reaching the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray spectral ranges. So far, HHG has always been generated by intense laser pulses that are well described as a classical electromagnetic field. However, the role of the quantum state of light in non-perturbative interactions of intense light with matter has remained unexplored. Here we show that the defining spectral characteristics of HHG, such as the plateau and cutoff, are sensitive to the quantum state of light. While coherent and Fock light states induce the established HHG cutoff law, thermal and squeezed states substantially surpass it, extending the cutoff compared with a coherent light state of the same intensity. Shaping the quantum state of light thus enables the production of far higher harmonics. We develop the theory of extreme nonlinear optics driven by squeezed light, and more generally by arbitrary quantum states of light, introducing the quantum state of the driving field as a degree of freedom. High-harmonic generation is a source of high-frequency radiation and is typically driven by strong, but classical, laser fields. A theoretical study now shows that using quantum light states as the driver extends the spectrum of outgoing radiation in a controllable manner.},

  abstract     = {When in equilibrium, thermal forces agitate molecules, which then diffuse, collide and bind to form materials. However, the space of accessible structures in which micron-scale particles can be organized by thermal forces is limited, owing to the slow dynamics and metastable states. Active agents in a passive fluid generate forces and flows, forming a bath with active fluctuations. Two unanswered questions are whether those active agents can drive the assembly of passive components into unconventional states and which material properties they will exhibit. Here we show that passive, sticky beads immersed in a bath of swimming Escherichia coli bacteria aggregate into unconventional clusters and gels that are controlled by the activity of the bath. We observe a slow but persistent rotation of the aggregates that originates in the chirality of the E. coli flagella and directs aggregation into structures that are not accessible thermally. We elucidate the aggregation mechanism with a numerical model of spinning, sticky beads and reproduce quantitatively the experimental results. We show that internal activity controls the phase diagram and the structure of the aggregates. Overall, our results highlight the promising role of active baths in designing the structural and mechanical properties of materials with unconventional phases. Colloidal aggregates are conventionally formed by particle aggregation under thermal fluctuation. Now the structure and mechanical properties of aggregates can be controlled by an active bath of swimming Escherichia coli.},

They are easily fluidized by applying mechanical stress, undergoing a yielding transition that still lacks a unified description. Here we investigate yielding in three classes of repulsive soft solids and find that at the microscopic level, yielding consists of a transition between two distinct dynamical states. We rationalize this by proposing a lattice model with dynamical coupling between neighbouring sites, leading to a unified state diagram for yielding. Employing the analogy with van der Waals phase diagram for real gases, we show that distance from a critical point plays a major role in the emergence of first-order-like versus second-order-like features in yielding, thereby reconciling previously contrasting observations on the nature of the transition. The yielding transition in concentrated colloidal suspensions and emulsions lacks a universal description. A unified state diagram is now shown to underlie yielding for these materials, analogous to the van der Waals phase diagram for non-ideal gases.},

Yet, little is known about the behaviour of fibre-attached drops when exposed to a background air flow. Additionally, control of drop motion and coalescence with neighbouring drops remains a challenge. Here we show that in the presence of a uniform air flow, drops wetting parallel fibres can interact aerodynamically, both with their downstream and upstream neighbours. These interactions can lead to a variety of behaviours, including alignment, repulsion and coalescence. Using particle-image velocimetry, we visualize the wake patterns and explain the alignment and coalescence behaviours based on the interactions between the wakes and drops. We obtain a diagram of the different interaction regimes, depending on the distance between the fibres. Finally, we apply this knowledge to realize controlled drop coalescence. The wetting behaviour of drops attached to fibres is exploited in many applications including fog harvesting. The presence of a background air flow on fibre-attached drops on parallel fibres is now shown to lead to alignment, repulsion and coalescence processes.},

  abstract     = {The recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid-crystal phase exhibits a spontaneous polarization field that is both orientationally fluid like a liquid crystal and large in magnitude like a solid ferroelectric. This combination imparts this phase with a unique electrostatic phenomenology and response to applied fields. Here we probe this phase by applying a small electric field to ferroelectric nematics confined in microchannels that connect electrodes through straight and curved paths and find that the NF phase smoothly orders with its polarization following the channels despite their winding paths. This implies a corresponding behaviour of the electric field. On inversion of the electric field, the polar order undergoes a multistage switching process dominated by electrostatic interactions. We also find multistage polarization switching dynamics in the numerical simulations of a quasi-two-dimensional continuum model of channel-confined NF liquid crystals, enabling the exploration of their internal structural and electrical self-organization. This indicates that polarization alignment and electric-field guiding are direct consequences of fluid superscreening—the prompt elimination of electric-field components normal to the channel walls by polarization reorientation. This response mimics the behaviour expected for ultrahigh-permittivity dielectrics, but with patterns of charge accumulation and local ordering unique to fluid ferroelectrics. The ferroelectric uniaxial nematic liquid-crystal phase features a freely reorientable polarization field. When confined in microchannels and subjected to electric fields, this polarization is now found to align with the channels due to a superscreening effect.},

  abstract     = {Aliovalent doping is a way to optimize the electrical properties of semiconductors, but its impact on the phonon structure and propagation is seldom considered properly. Here we show that aliovalent doping can be much more effective in reducing the lattice thermal conductivity of thermoelectric semiconductors than the commonly employed isoelectronic alloying strategy. We demonstrate this in the heavy-band NbFeSb system, finding that a reduction of 65\% in the lattice thermal conductivity is achieved through only 10\% aliovalent Hf doping, compared with the four times higher isoelectronic Ta alloying. We show that aliovalent doping introduces free charge carriers and enhances screening, leading to the softening and deceleration of optical phonons. Moreover, the heavy dopant can induce the avoided crossing of acoustic and optical phonon branches, decelerating the acoustic phonons. These results highlight the significant role of aliovalent dopants in regulating the phonon structure and suppressing the phonon propagation of semiconductors. Aliovalent doping affects the electrical properties of semiconductors, but its effect on phonons is unclear. Now, strong softening and deceleration of phonons, causing a significant reduction in lattice thermal conductivity, is reported for Hf-doped NbFeSb.},

  abstract     = {The anomalously low thermal expansion of Fe–Ni Invar has long been associated with magnetism, but to date, the microscopic underpinnings of the Invar behaviour have eluded both theory and experiment. Here we present nuclear resonant X-ray scattering measurements of the phonon and magnetic entropies under pressure. By applying a thermodynamic Maxwell relation to these data, we obtain the separate phonon and magnetic contributions to thermal expansion. We find that the Invar behaviour stems from a competition between phonons and spins. In particular, the phonon contribution to thermal expansion cancels the magnetic contribution over the 0–3 GPa pressure range of Invar behaviour. At pressures above 3 GPa, the cancellation is lost, but our analysis reproduces the positive thermal expansion measured separately by synchrotron X-ray diffractometry. Ab initio calculations informed by experimental data show that spin–phonon interactions improve the accuracy of this cancellation over the range of Invar behaviour. Spin–phonon interactions also explain how different phonon modes have different energy shifts with pressure. The iron–nickel alloy Invar has an extremely small coefficient of thermal expansion that has been difficult to explain theoretically. A study of Invar under pressure now suggests that there is a cancellation of phonon and spin contributions to expansion.},

We show that the observed effect can be controlled non-locally based on the phase difference of the adjacent junction. These results indicate that the time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries of a Josephson junction are broken by the coherent coupling to an adjacent junction, and this enables the engineering of superconducting phenomena mediated by interaction among Josephson junctions. The behaviour of a superconductor can be altered by changing its symmetry properties.

Contrary to expectations, we observe that the array resistance drops dramatically as the temperature is decreased—reminiscent of superconducting behaviour—and then saturates at low temperature. Applying a magnetic field, we eventually observe a transition to a highly resistive regime. These observations can be understood within a theoretical picture that accounts for the effect of thermal fluctuations on the insulating phase. On the basis of the agreement between experiment and theory, we suggest that apparent superconductivity in our Josephson arrays arises from melting the zero-temperature insulator.

Although most Kitaev model candidate materials eventually order magnetically due to additional non-Kitaev interactions, their bond-dependent anisotropy manifests in unusual spin dynamics. Recent research suggests that bond-dependent anisotropy can stabilize exotic magnetic phases on the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice. Unfortunately, few materials have been identified with simultaneous geometric frustration and bond-dependent anisotropy. Here, we report a frustrated triangular lattice with bond-dependent anisotropy in the cobalt-based van der Waals antiferromagnet CoI2. Momentum and energy-resolved inelastic neutron scattering measurements show substantial magnon decay and level repulsion. A thorough examination of excitations in both the paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states demonstrates that the bond-dependent anisotropy is the origin of the spiral order and the magnon decay found in CoI2. Our results provide the basis for future studies of the interplay between Kitaev magnetism and geometric frustration. Geometric frustration and bond-dependent interactions each introduce quantum fluctuations that can create spin liquid phases. Now it is shown that CoI2 is a triangular lattice material that combines both.},

Here we present three-dimensional visualizations of a bulk Co8Zn8Mn4 skyrmion lattice through a tomographic algorithm applied to multiprojection small-angle neutron scattering measurements. Reconstructions of the sample show a disordered skyrmion lattice exhibiting three-dimensional topological transitions through emergent (anti)monopole branching and segmentation defect pathways. Our technique provides insights into skyrmion stabilization and topological transition pathways in a bulk skyrmion lattice, guiding the future development and manipulation of skyrmion materials for spintronic applications.

Here, we challenge this common belief and show using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy that exotic carriers exist even at room temperature in TbInO3, a candidate material for realizing a low-temperature quantum spin-liquid phase. In particular, over the entire temperature range of 1.5–300 K, we observe a quadratic frequency dependence in the real part of the in-plane optical conductivity as well as Fano asymmetry of an optical phonon mode strongly interacting with the excitation continuum. These features are robust even under external magnetic fields of up to 7 T. Our data confirm the presence of emergent charge carriers within the Mott charge gap of TbInO3, suggesting that it is possible to probe and manipulate highly entangled quantum many-body states at room temperature. Previous work has suggested that at very low temperatures TbInO3 hosts an unconventional quantum ground state. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy measurements of its excitations show that related exotic effects can persist to room temperature.},

  abstract     = {When a system close to a continuous phase transition is subjected to perturbations, it takes an exceptionally long time to return to equilibrium. This critical slowing down is observed universally in the dynamics of bosonic excitations, such as order-parameter collective modes, but it is not generally expected to occur for fermionic excitations. Here using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we find evidence for fermionic critical slowing down in YbRh2Si2 close to a quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic phase and a heavy Fermi liquid. In the latter phase, the relevant quasiparticles are a quantum superposition of itinerant and localized electronic states with a strongly enhanced effective mass. As the temperature is lowered on the heavy-Fermi-liquid side of the transition, the heavy-fermion spectral weight builds up until the Kondo temperature TK ≈ 25 K, then decays towards the quantum phase transition and is, thereafter, followed by a logarithmic rise of the quasiparticle excitation rate below 10 K. A two-band heavy-Fermi-liquid theory shows that this is indicative of the fermionic critical slowing down associated with heavy-fermion breakdown near the quantum phase transition. The critical exponent of this breakdown could be used to classify this system among a wider family of fermionic quantum phase transitions that is yet to be fully explored. YbRh2Si2 has a quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic phase and a so-called heavy-Fermi-liquid state. Measurements of critical slowing down suggest that the heavy-fermion quasiparticles break down at the transition.},

  abstract     = {A phase characterized by a spatially modulated order parameter is counter-intuitive because of the entropy penalty that the modulations incur. Its possible existence in superconductors was first proposed under the condition that the formation of Cooper pairs is limited to some segments of the Fermi surface and that the Cooper pairs carry momentum above the Pauli limit. This prediction motivated experimental efforts to identify such non-uniform superconducting states in organic superconductors, heavy fermion compounds and cuprates. Here we report evidence of another type of finite-momentum pairing that manifests below the Pauli limit. It is driven by the orbital effect and does not rely on Fermi surface segmentation. We have evidence of this spatially modulated superconducting state in a hexagonal MoS2 bilayer through remote intercalation that offers both balanced doping and firm out-of-plane coherence across both layers. Cooper pairs that form with finite centre-of-mass momentum are rare. Now there is evidence that this can happen below the Pauli limit in a bilayer material.},

  abstract     = {Layered crystalline materials that consist of transition metal atoms on a kagome network have emerged as a versatile platform for the study of unusual electronic phenomena. For example, in the vanadium-based kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (where A can stand for K, Cs or Rb), there is a parent charge density wave phase that appears to simultaneously break both the translational and rotational symmetries of the lattice. Here we show a contrasting situation, where electronic nematic order—the breaking of rotational symmetry without the breaking of translational symmetry—can occur without a corresponding charge density wave. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunnelling microscopy to study the kagome metal CsTi3Bi5 that is isostructural to AV3Sb5 but with a titanium atom kagome network. CsTi3Bi5 does not exhibit any detectable charge density wave state, but a comparison to density functional theory calculations reveals substantial electronic correlation effects at low energies. In comparing the amplitudes of scattering wave vectors along different directions, we discover an electronic anisotropy that breaks the sixfold symmetry of the lattice, arising from both in-plane and out-of-plane titanium-derived d orbitals. Our work uncovers the role of electronic orbitals in CsTi3Bi5, suggestive of a hexagonal analogue of the nematic bond order in Fe-based superconductors. Electronic nematic order as a distinct phase in kagome materials without any entanglement with charge density wave or charge stripe order has not been detected. Now, it is observed in a titanium-based kagome metal.},

  abstract     = {Quantum entanglement can provide enhanced measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit, the highest precision achievable with classical means. However, observations with a large enhancement remain challenging due to experimental limitations in the preparation, control and detection of entanglement. Here we report a nonlinear interferometry protocol with echoed spin-nematic squeezing in a spinor atomic Bose–Einstein condensate. We generate spin-nematic squeezed states through spin-mixing dynamics, an atomic analogue of optical four-wave mixing. The squeezed states are refocused back to the vicinity of the classical initial state by a state-flip operation that resembles spin-echo techniques, which leads to encoded phases preferentially amplified over noise. Using a large ensemble of 26,400 atoms, we observe a sensitivity of 15.6 ± 0.5 dB beyond the standard quantum limit for detecting small-angle Rabi rotation, as well as 16.6 ± 1.1 dB for phase sensing in a Ramsey-like interferometry application. Our results highlight the many-body coherence of spin-nematic squeezed states and point to their possible quantum metrological application in atomic magnetometers, atomic clocks and fundamental tests of Lorentz symmetry violations. Entangled states are a key resource for quantum-enhanced sensing. A protocol based on spin-nematic squeezed states of atomic Bose–Einstein condensates has now been used to achieve record metrological gains in nonlinear interferometry experiments.},

  abstract     = {Stable ultracold ensembles of dipolar molecules hold great promise for studies of many-body quantum physics, but high inelastic loss rates have been a long-standing challenge. Recently, gases of fermionic molecules in their ground state have been effectively stabilized by applying external fields. However, for gases of bosonic molecules, which might provide access to fundamentally different many-body quantum systems, it is unknown whether a similar suppression of losses can be achieved. This is due to the high inelastic loss rates for bosonic molecules, which are intrinsically one to two orders of magnitude larger than those for their fermionic counterparts. Here we stabilize a bosonic gas of strongly dipolar NaCs molecules via microwave shielding, decreasing losses by more than a factor of 200 and reaching lifetimes on the order of 1 second. In addition, we measure high elastic scattering rates and characterize their anisotropy, which arises from strong dipolar interactions. Finally, we demonstrate evaporative cooling of a bosonic molecular gas. We increase the phase-space density by a factor of 20, reach a temperature of 36(5) nK and bring the system to the brink of quantum degeneracy. Our results constitute a step towards the creation of a Bose–Einstein condensate of dipolar molecules and open the door to the creation of strongly correlated phases of dipolar quantum matter. The high inelastic loss rate in gases of bosonic molecules has so far hindered the stabilization needed to reach quantum degeneracy. Now, an experiment using microwave shielding demonstrates a large reduction of losses for bosonic dipolar molecules.},

In many ultracold experiments, however, the particles collide in the presence of an external trapping potential that can couple their centre-of-mass and relative motions, assisting the formation of bound states. Here we report the observation of weakly bound molecular states formed between one ultracold atom and a single trapped ion in the presence of a linear Paul trap. We show that bound states can efficiently form in binary collisions, and enhance the rate of inelastic processes. By measuring the electronic spin-exchange rate, we study the dependence of these bound states on the collision energy and magnetic field, and extract the average molecular binding energy and mean lifetime of the molecule, having good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations predict a power-law distribution of molecular lifetimes with a mean that is dominated by extreme, long-lived events. The dependence of the molecular properties on the trapping parameters enables further studies on the characterization and control of ultracold collisions. The formation of molecules in binary particle collisions is forbidden in free space, but the presence of an external trapping potential now enables the realization of bound states in ultracold atom–ion collisions.},

Here we report the magnetic trapping of molecules in the triplet ground state at high density and ultralow temperature. We measure the inelastic loss rates in a single-spin sample and spin mixtures of fermionic molecules and spin-stretched atom–molecule mixtures. We demonstrate the sympathetic cooling of molecules in the magnetic trap by the radio-frequency evaporation of co-trapped atoms and observe an increase in the molecules’ phase-space density by a factor of 16. Magnetic trapping at these densities allows the study of both atom–molecule and molecule–molecule collisions in the ultracold regime in the absence of trapping light, which often leads to undesired photochemistry effects. Many applications of ultracold molecules require high densities that have been difficult to reach.

  abstract     = {The understanding of the dynamics of a glass above its devitrification temperature remains incomplete. Here, we build a spatio-temporal map of the relaxation dynamics of a highly stable glass into its supercooled liquid using real-time atomic force microscopy imaging. This methodology enables direct visualization of the progression of the liquid phase and clarifies and quantifies the presence of localized fast mobility regions separated by giant length scales. Our data establish a clear correlation between dynamic length and time scales in glasses. This approach may also be applicable to unveil the microscopic structure and dynamics of other glass-forming systems with much shorter length and time scales, including liquid-cooled glasses. Visualizing dynamical changes in glassy systems is challenging because of the time and length scales involved. Now, atomic force microscopy is shown to be a viable method for obtaining a spatio-temporal description of the relaxation of a glass.},

  abstract     = {In an all-van der Waals heterostructure, the active layer, gate dielectrics and gate electrodes are assembled from two-dimensional crystals that have a low density of atomic defects. This design allows two-dimensional electron systems with very low disorder to be created, particularly in heterostructures where the active layer also has intrinsically low disorder, such as crystalline graphene layers or metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers. A key missing ingredient has been nanoscale electrostatic control, with existing methods for fabricated local gates typically introducing unwanted contamination. Here we describe a resist-free local anodic oxidation process for patterning sub-100 nm features in graphite gates, and their subsequent integration into an all-van der Waals heterostructure. We define a quantum point contact in the fractional quantum Hall regime as a benchmark device and observe signatures of chiral Luttinger liquid behaviour, indicating an absence of extrinsic scattering centres in the vicinity of the point contact. In the integer quantum Hall regime, we demonstrate in situ control of the edge confinement potential, a key requirement for the precision control of chiral edge states. This technique may enable the fabrication of devices capable of single anyon control and coherent edge-state interferometry in the fractional quantum Hall regime. Precise control of electrons in two-dimensional materials has been limited by fabrication techniques for local gates that introduce disorder. Now, a technique allows patterning of sub-100 nm features and fabrication of very clean interfaces.},

  abstract     = {The formation of topological defects after a symmetry-breaking phase transition is an overarching phenomenon that encodes the underlying dynamics. The Kibble–Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes these non-equilibrium dynamics of second-order phase transitions and predicts a power-law relationship between the cooling rates and the density of topological defects. It has been verified as a successful model in a wide variety of physical systems, including structure formation in the early Universe and condensed-matter materials. However, it is uncertain if the KZM mechanism is also valid for topologically trivial Ising domains, one of the most common and fundamental types of domain in condensed-matter systems. Here we show that the cooling rate dependence of Ising domain density follows the KZM power law in two different three-dimensional structural Ising domains: ferro-rotation domains in NiTiO3 and polar domains in BiTeI. However, although the KZM slope of NiTiO3 agrees with the prediction of the 3D Ising model, the KZM slope of BiTeI exceeds the theoretical limit, providing an example of steepening KZM slope with long-range dipolar interactions. Our results demonstrate the validity of KZM for Ising domains and reveal an enhancement of the power-law exponent for transitions of non-topological quantities with long-range interactions. The Kibble–Zurek mechanism is shown to apply to structural Ising domains in three-dimensional materials. Long-range interactions modify the critical exponents away from theoretical predictions.},

  abstract     = {In the prevalent picture of ultrafast structural phase transitions, atomic motion occurs in a slowly varying potential energy surface adiabatically determined by fast electrons. However, this ignores non-conservative forces caused by electron–lattice collisions, which can substantially influence atomic motion. Most ultrafast techniques only probe the average structure and are less sensitive to random displacements and therefore do not detect the role played by non-conservative forces in phase transitions. Here we show that the lattice dynamics of the prototypical insulator–metal transition of vanadium dioxide cannot be described by potential energy alone. We use the sample temperature to control the preexisting lattice disorder before ultrafast photoexcitation across the phase transition and our ultrafast diffuse scattering experiments show that the fluctuations characteristic of rutile metal develop equally fast (120 fs) at initial temperatures of 100 and 300 K. This indicates that additional non-conservative forces are responsible for the increased lattice disorder. These results highlight the need for more sophisticated descriptions of ultrafast phenomena beyond the Born–Oppenheimer approximation as well as ultrafast probes of spatial fluctuations beyond the average unit cell measured by diffraction. The Born–Oppenheimer approximation is the prevailing assumption for interpreting ultrafast electron dynamics in solids. Evidence now suggests that collisions between electrons and lattice not captured by this approximation play an important role.},

  abstract     = {Interacting electrons in flat bands give rise to a variety of quantum phases. One fundamental aspect of such states is the ordering of the various flavours—such as spin or valley—that the electrons can possess and the excitation spectrum of the broken-symmetry states that they form. These properties cannot be probed directly with electrical transport measurements. The zeroth Landau level of monolayer graphene with fourfold spin–valley degeneracy is a model system for such investigations, but the nature of its broken-symmetry states—particularly at partial fillings—is still not understood. Here we demonstrate a non-invasive spectroscopic technique with a scanning tunnelling microscope and use it to perform measurements of the valley polarization of the electronic wavefunctions and their excitation spectrum in the partially filled zeroth Landau level of graphene. We can extract information such as the strength of the Haldane pseudopotentials that characterize the repulsive interactions underlying the fractional quantum states. Our experiments also demonstrate that fractional quantum Hall phases are built upon broken-symmetry states that persist at partial filling. Our experimental approach quantifies the valley phase diagram of the partially filled Landau level as a model flat-band platform, which is applicable to other graphene-based electronic systems. A scanning tunnelling microscopy technique that minimally perturbs the sample quantifies the interacting phase diagram of the zeroth Landau level in monolayer graphene.},

Among them, a vortex-like spin swirling texture known as a magnetic skyrmion has attracted particular attention. Lattices of skyrmions form in the helimagnet MnSi with a periodicity of 18 nm, which makes them amenable to investigation by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in real space and by small-angle neutron scattering in momentum space. However, the dynamics of the skyrmion lattice are difficult to measure at the microelectronvolts energy scale at small wavevectors. Here we examine the low-energy excitations of the skyrmion state in MnSi by using the neutron spin-echo technique under small-angle neutron scattering conditions. We observe an asymmetric dispersion of the phason excitations of the lattice because of the string-like structure of the skyrmion cores. Skyrmions are localized magnetic textures that form lattices in some magnetic materials. Neutron spin-echo measurements have now been able to observe topological effects on the low-energy collective excitations of a skrymion lattice.},

For example, topological invariants describe the plateaux observed in the quantized Hall effect and the pumped charge in its dynamic analogue—the Thouless pump2–4. However, the presence of interparticle interactions can affect the topology of a material, invalidating the idealized formulation in terms of Bloch waves. Despite pioneering experiments in different platforms5–9, the study of topological matter under variations in interparticle interactions has proven challenging10. Here we experimentally realize a topological Thouless pump with fully tuneable Hubbard interactions in an optical lattice and observe regimes with robust pumping, as well as an interaction-induced breakdown. We confirm the pump’s robustness against interactions that are smaller than the protecting gap for both repulsive and attractive interactions. Furthermore, we identify that bound pairs of fermions are responsible for quantized transport at strongly attractive interactions. However, for strong repulsive interactions, topological pumping breaks down, but we show how to reinstate it by modifying the pump trajectory. Our results will prove useful for further investigations of interacting topological matter10, including edge effects11 and interaction-induced topological phases12–15. Thouless pumping is the quantization of charge transport through the adiabatic variation of a system’s parameters. The robustness and breakdown of pumping under variations in interparticle interactions have now been shown with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice.},

In many-body reactions involving bosonic reactants and products, such as coupled atomic and molecular Bose–Einstein condensates, quantum coherence and bosonic enhancement are key features of the reaction dynamics. However, the observation of these many-body phenomena, also known as ‘superchemistry’, has been elusive so far. Here we report the observation of coherent and collective reactive coupling between Bose-condensed atoms and molecules near a Feshbach resonance. Starting from an atomic condensate, the reaction begins with the rapid formation of molecules, followed by oscillations of their populations during the equilibration process. We observe faster oscillations in samples with higher densities, indicating bosonic enhancement. We present a quantum field model that captures the dynamics well and allows us to identify three-body recombination as the dominant reaction process. Our findings deepen our understanding of quantum many-body chemistry and offer insights into the control of chemical reactions at quantum degeneracy. The study and control of chemical reactions between atoms and molecules at quantum degeneracy is an outstanding problem in quantum chemistry. An experiment now reports the coherent and collective reactions of atomic and molecular Bose–Einstein condensates.},

  abstract     = {Quantum simulation provides platforms to study fundamental aspects of many-body physics in a controlled way, and to explore their implications for quantum technology. However, the dimension of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of interacting particles, which means that investigations of strongly correlated problems such as quantum criticality and many-body localization in terms of few-body probes in real space are often insufficient. Here we demonstrate how to tackle such questions on a superconducting quantum processor from a Fock-space perspective. We map a many-body system onto an unconventional Anderson model on a network of many-body states, which allows the direct observation of wave-packet propagation in Fock space. We find a quantum-critical regime of anomalously enhanced wave-packet width and deduce a critical point from the maximum wave-packet fluctuations, which lends support to the two-dimensional many-body localization transition in finite-sized systems. Our results introduce an alternative picture for characterizing many-body dynamics and for exploring the controversial problems such as criticality and dimensionality. Moreover, the protocol is universal and scalable, and is therefore a promising strategy to solve a broader range of many-body problems on future quantum devices. Some many-body problems are challenging to solve in real space, but have a convenient Fock-space representation. A superconducting qubit experiment now demonstrates the benefits of this approach for the study of quantum dynamics and criticality.},

The ability to tune these dispersive shifts provides additional options for performing either quantum measurements or logical manipulations. Here we couple two transmon qubits to a lumped-element cavity through a shared superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Our design balances the mutual capacitive and inductive circuit components so that both qubits are statically decoupled from the cavity with low flux sensitivity, offering protection from decoherence processes. Parametric driving of the SQUID flux enables independent, dynamical tuning of each qubit’s interaction with the cavity. As a practical demonstration, we perform pulsed parametric dispersive readout of both qubits. The dispersive frequency shifts of the cavity mode follow the theoretically expected magnitude and sign. This parametric approach creates an extensible, tunable cavity QED framework with various future applications, such as entanglement and error correction via multi-qubit parity readout, state and entanglement stabilization, and parametric logical gates. Efficient control and measurement of qubits requires them to be strongly coupled to other degrees of freedom, but this can introduce additional decoherence. Now, parametric driving makes it possible to controllably introduce and remove interactions.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a considerable push towards ultrahigh dose rates in proton therapy to effectively utilize motion mitigation strategies and potentially increase the sparing of healthy tissue through the so-called FLASH effect. However, in cyclotron-based proton therapy facilities, it is difficult to reach ultrahigh dose rates for low-energy beams. The main reason for this lies in the large momentum spread that such beams have after reducing their energy to levels required for proton therapy, incurring large losses in conventionally used momentum or energy selection slits. Here we propose momentum cooling by using a wedge in the energy selection system (instead of a slit) to reduce the momentum spread of the beam without introducing substantial beam losses. We demonstrate this concept in our eye treatment beamline and obtain a factor of two higher transmission, which could eventually halve the treatment delivery time. Furthermore, we show that with a gantry design incorporating this feature, we can achieve almost a factor of 100 higher transmission for a 70 MeV beam compared with conventional cyclotron-based facilities. This concept could enhance the potential of proton therapy by opening up possibilities of treating new indications and reducing the cost. In cyclotron-based proton therapy facilities, beam loss due to large momentum spread can limit ultrahigh dose rates. Now, beam transmission is enhanced and higher dose rate is achieved by introducing momentum cooling through a wedge.},

Despite vastly different platforms and underlying working principles, the realizations of nonreciprocal transport in linear, time-independent systems rely on Aharonov–Bohm interference among several pathways and require breaking time-reversal symmetry. Here we extend the notion of nonreciprocity to unidirectional bosonic transport in systems with a time-reversal symmetric Hamiltonian by exploiting interference between beamsplitter (excitation-preserving) and two-mode-squeezing (excitation non-preserving) interactions. In contrast to standard nonreciprocity, this unidirectional transport manifests when the mode quadratures are resolved with respect to an external reference phase. Accordingly, we dub this phenomenon ‘quadrature nonreciprocity’. We experimentally demonstrate it in the minimal system of two coupled nanomechanical modes orchestrated by optomechanical interactions. Next, we develop a theoretical framework to characterize the class of networks exhibiting quadrature nonreciprocity based on features of their particle–hole graphs. In addition to unidirectionality, these networks can exhibit an even–odd pairing between collective quadratures, which we confirm experimentally in a four-mode system, and an exponential end-to-end gain in the case of arrays of cavities. Across platforms, nonreciprocity requires time-reversal symmetry to be broken. Interference of an excitation-preserving and a non-preserving interaction realizes unidirectional transport in a time-reversal-symmetric system.},

  abstract     = {Photons with optical frequencies of a few hundred terahertz are perhaps the only way to distribute quantum information over long distances. Superconducting qubits, which are one of the most promising approaches for realizing large-scale quantum machines, operate on microwave photons at frequencies that are ~40,000 times lower. To network these quantum machines across appreciable distances, we must bridge this frequency gap. Here we implement and demonstrate a transducer that can generate correlated optical and microwave photons. We use it to show that by detecting an optical photon we generate an added microwave photon with an efficiency of ~35\%. Our device uses a gigahertz nanomechanical resonance as an intermediary, which efficiently couples to optical and microwave channels through strong optomechanical and piezoelectric interactions. We show continuous operation of the transducer with 5\% frequency conversion efficiency, input-referred added noise of ~100, and pulsed microwave photon generation at a heralding rate of 15 Hz. Optical absorption in the device generates thermal noise of less than two microwave photons. Improvements of the system efficiencies and device performance are necessary to realize a high rate of entanglement generation between distant microwave-frequency quantum nodes, but these enhancements are within reach. Many quantum devices operate in the microwave regime, but long-distance communication relies on optical photons. A nanomechanical resonator can be used to create entangled optical and microwave photons linking the two frequency regimes.},

  abstract     = {A central goal of any quantum technology consists in demonstrating an advantage in their performance compared to the best possible classical implementation. A quantum radar improves the detection of a target placed in a noisy environment by exploiting quantum correlations between two modes, probe and idler. The predicted quantum enhancement is not only less sensitive to loss than most quantum metrological applications, but it is also supposed to improve with additional noise. Here we demonstrate a superconducting circuit implementing a microwave quantum radar that can provide more than 20\% better performance than any possible classical radar. The scheme involves joint measurement of entangled probe and idler microwave photon states after the probe has been reflected from the target and mixed with thermal noise. By storing the idler state in a resonator, we mitigate the detrimental impact of idler loss on the quantum advantage. Measuring the quantum advantage over a wide range of parameters, we find that the purity of the initial probe-idler entangled state is the main limiting factor and needs to be considered in any practical application. Proposals for quantum radars have suggested that in noisy environments there may be a benefit in sensing using quantum microwaves. A superconducting circuit experiment has now confirmed an advantage exists under appropriate conditions.},

  abstract     = {While correlated electrons are at the heart of many phenomena in condensed matter, as well as atomic and molecular physics, Coulomb interactions in free-electron beams are generally considered detrimental. Here, we demonstrate the generation of Coulomb-correlated pair, triple and quadruple states of free electrons by femtosecond photoemission from a nanoscale field emitter inside a transmission electron microscope. Event-based electron spectroscopy allows the spatial and spectral characterization of the electron ensemble emitted by each laser pulse. We identify distinctive energy and momentum correlations arising from acceleration-enhanced interparticle energy exchange, revealing strong few-body Coulomb interactions at an energy scale of 2 eV. State-sorted beam caustics show a discrete increase in virtual source size and longitudinal source shift for few-electron states, associated with transverse momentum correlations. We observe field-controllable electron antibunching, attributed primarily to transverse Coulomb deflection. The pronounced spatial and spectral characteristics of these electron number states allow filtering schemes that control the statistical distribution of the pulse charge. In this way, the fraction of specific few-electron states can be actively suppressed or enhanced, facilitating the preparation of highly non-Poissonian electron beams for microscopy and lithography, including future heralding schemes and correlated multi-electron probing. Coulomb interactions in free-electron beams are usually seen as an adverse effect. The creation of distinctive number states with one, two, three and four electrons now reveals unexpected opportunities for electron microscopy and lithography from Coulomb correlations.},

  abstract     = {Free electrons are essential in such diverse applications as electron microscopes, accelerators and photoemission spectroscopy. However, the space charge effects of many electrons are often a problem and, when confined to extremely small space–time dimensions, even two electrons can interact strongly. Here we demonstrate that the resulting Coulomb repulsion can be highly advantageous, as it leads to strong electron–electron correlations. We show that femtosecond laser-emitted electrons from nanometric needle tips are highly anticorrelated in terms of energy because of dynamic Coulomb repulsion, with a visibility of 56\%. We extract a mean energy splitting of 3.3 eV and a correlation decay time of 82 fs. The energy-filtered electrons display a sub-Poissonian number distribution with a second-order correlation function as small as g(2) = 0.34, implying that shot-noise-reduced pulsed electron beams can be realized by simple energy filtering. We also reach the strong-field regime of laser-driven electron emission and gain insights into how the electron correlations of the different electron classes (direct or rescattered) are influenced by the strong laser fields. Even a few electrons confined to a tight space and time interval interact strongly, often causing issues for applications. The resulting repulsion has now been shown to allow strong electron–electron correlations, enabling shot-noise reduction.},

  abstract     = {Highly regenerative animals can regrow lost appendages and the rate of regrowth is proportional to the amount of appendage loss. This century-old phenomenon prompted us to investigate whether the mechanism of wound healing, as the first stage of regeneration, is responsible for discerning the amputation position. In vitro studies have revealed great insights into the mechanics of the wound-healing process, including the identification of mechanical waves in collective epithelial cell expansion. It has been suggested that these mechanical waves may also be involved in positional sensing. Here we perform live-cell imaging on adult zebrafish tailfins to monitor the collective migration of basal epithelial cells on tailfin amputation. We observed a cell density wave propagating away from the amputation edge, with the maximum travelling distance proportional to the amputation level and cell proliferation at later stages. We developed a mechanical model to explain this wave behaviour, including the tension-dependent wave speed and amputation-dependent travelling distance. Together, our findings point to an in vivo positional sensing mechanism in regenerative tissues based on a coupling of mechanical signals manifested as a travelling density wave. It is known that mechanical waves play a role in collective motion in vitro. Now these waves can help an amputated zebrafish know where its fin was cut off to aid regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Active fluids, such as cytoskeletal filaments, bacterial colonies and epithelial cell layers, exhibit distinctive orientational coherence, often characterized by nematic order and its breakdown, defined by the presence of topological defects. In contrast, little is known about positional coherence, that is, whether there is an organization in the underlying fluid motion—despite this being both a prominent and an experimentally accessible feature. Here we characterize the organization of fluid motion in active nematics using the notion of Lagrangian coherent structures by analyzing experimental data of two-dimensional mixtures of microtubules and kinesin, as well as numerical data obtained from the simulation of the active nematodynamic equations. Coherent structures consist of moving attractors and repellers, which orchestrate complex motion. To understand the interaction of positional and orientational coherence, we analyse experiments and simulations and find that +1/2 defects move and deform the attractors, functioning as control centres for collective motion. Additionally, we find that regions around isolated +1/2 defects undergo high bending and low stretching/shearing deformations, consistent with the local stress distribution. The stress is the minimum at the defect, whereas high differential stress along the defect orientation induces folding. Our work offers a new perspective to describe and control self-organization in active fluids, with potential applications to multicellular systems. Active matter exhibits positional coherence in addition to the well-known orientational order. It is now shown that coherent structures in active nematics—made of dynamical attractors and repellers—form, move and deform, steered by topological defects.},

Here, we report the use of nonlinear-optical two-photon transitions for the quantum-coherent control of a free-electron matter wave in free space. We superimpose an electron beam with two crossed laser beams of different photon energies for non-linear Compton scattering. At suitable angle combinations, the electron energy spectrum becomes modulated into discrete energy sidebands with thousands of interference maxima. We explain our observations by the cascaded addition and subtraction of two-photon pairs under three-body conservation of energy and momentum. Calculations reveal that the electron matter wave converts into pulses of few-attosecond duration. These results show the general importance of matter wave coherences in scattering phenomena and provide a way for investigating and creating quantum correlations and entanglement between massive and massless elementary particles without the need for a classical coupling construct. Although massive electrons and massless photons are known to interact, their study has so far been confined to the linear regime. Experiments showing two-photon coherent control of a free-electron matter wave now introduce non-linearities.},

  abstract     = {A class of systems exists in which dissipation, external drive and interactions compete and give rise to non-equilibrium phases that would not exist without the drive. There, phase transitions could occur without the breaking of any symmetry, yet with a local order parameter—in contrast to the Landau theory of phase transitions at equilibrium. One of the simplest driven–dissipative quantum systems consists of two-level atoms enclosed in a volume smaller than the wavelength of the atomic transition cubed, driven by a light field. The competition between collective coupling of the atoms to the driving field and their cooperative decay should lead to a transition between a phase where all the atomic dipoles are phase-locked and a phase governed by superradiant spontaneous emission. Here, we realize this model using a pencil-shaped cloud of laser-cooled atoms in free space, optically excited along its main axis, and observe the predicted phases. Our demonstration is promising in view of obtaining free-space superradiant lasers or observing new types of time crystal. Some driven systems sustain non-equilibrium phases in which phase transitions occur without symmetry breaking. The use of a laser-cooled atomic cloud confined in a pencil beam now allows the demonstration of such a system.},

Here we discover a mechanism to boost the Duffing nonlinearity by coupling the vibrations of a nanotube resonator to single-electron tunnelling and by operating the system in the ultrastrong-coupling regime. We find that thermal vibrations become highly nonlinear when lowering the temperature. The average vibration amplitude at the lowest temperature is 13 times the zero-point motion, with approximately 42\% of the thermal energy stored in the anharmonic part of the potential. Our work may enable the realization of mechanical Schrödinger cat states, mechanical qubits and quantum simulators emulating the electron–phonon coupling. Although mechanical resonators are routinely cooled to their quantum ground state, it has remained unclear if sizable nonlinearities could persist there.

However, so far, such photonic simulators have been limited in scale, yielding results that suffer from finite-size effects. Here we present an analogue simulator capable of simulating large two-dimensional (2D) and 3D lattices, as well as lattices with non-planar connectivity. Our simulator takes advantage of the broad bandwidth achievable in photonics, allowing our experiment to realize programmable lattices with over 100,000 lattice sites. We showcase the scale of our simulator by demonstrating the extension of bandstructure spectroscopy from 1D to 2D and 3D lattices. We then report the direct observation of time-reversal symmetry-breaking in a triangular lattice in both momentum and real space, as well as site-resolved occupation measurements in a tree-like geometry that serves as a toy model in quantum gravity. Moreover, we demonstrate a method to excite arbitrary multisite states, which we use to study the response of a 2D lattice to both conventional and exotic input states. Our work highlights the scalability and flexibility of optical synthetic frequency dimensions. Future experiments building on our approach will be able to explore non-equilibrium phenomena in high-dimensional lattices and to simulate models with nonlocal higher-order interactions. Analogue photonic simulators have so far suffered from severe finite size effects and limited programmability. Now, a frequency-mode photonic simulator enables the simulation of large-scale models in two and three dimensions.},

  abstract     = {In single crystals, the suppression of intrinsic loss channels at low temperatures leads to exceptionally long mechanical lifetimes. Quantum electrical control of such long-lived mechanical oscillators would enable the development of phononic memory elements, sensors and transducers. The integration of piezoelectric materials is one approach to introducing electrical control, but the challenges of combining heterogeneous materials lead to severely limited phonon lifetimes. Here we present a non-piezoelectric silicon electromechanical system capable of operating in the gigahertz frequency band. Relying on a driving scheme based on electrostatic fields and the kinetic inductance effect in disordered superconductors, we demonstrate a parametrically enhanced electromechanical coupling of g/2π = 1.1 MHz, sufficient to enter the strong-coupling regime with a cooperativity of $${{{\mathcal{C}}}}={1,200}$$ . In our best devices, we measure mechanical quality factors approaching Q ≈ 107, measured at low-phonon numbers and millikelvin temperatures. Despite using strong electrostatic fields, we find the cavity mechanics system in the quantum ground state, verified by thermometry measurements. Simultaneously achieving ground-state operation, long mechanical lifetimes and strong coupling sets the stage for employing silicon electromechanical devices in hybrid quantum systems and as a tool for studying the origins of acoustic loss in the quantum regime. Electrical control of quantum mechanical oscillators is normally performed using piezoelectrics, but incorporating these additional materials can severely reduce performance. Electrostatic control has now been demonstrated in a silicon device.},

By implementing a quantum Szilard engine with an active feedback control loop, we show that a superconducting fluxonium qubit is coupled to a two-level system (TLS) environment of unknown origin, with a relatively long intrinsic energy relaxation time exceeding 50 ms. The TLSs can be cooled down, resulting in a four times lower qubit population, or they can be heated to manifest themselves as a negative-temperature environment corresponding to a qubit population of ~80\%. We show that the TLSs and qubit are the dominant loss mechanism for each other and that qubit relaxation is independent of the TLS populations. Understanding and mitigating TLS environments is, therefore, not only crucial to improve the qubit lifetimes but also to avoid non-Markovian qubit dynamics. The performance of superconducting qubits is often limited by spurious two-level systems. Now, a qubit operating as a heat engine manipulates its bath of nearby two-level systems, providing insights into their dynamics and interactions.},

  abstract     = {Quantum many-body systems subjected to unitary evolution with the addition of interspersed measurements exhibit a variety of dynamical phases that do not occur under pure unitary evolution. However, these systems remain challenging to investigate on near-term quantum hardware owing to the need for numerous ancilla qubits or repeated high-fidelity mid-circuit measurements, a capability that has only recently become available. Here we report the realization of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition with a hybrid random circuit on up to 14 superconducting qubits with mid-circuit readout capability. We directly observe extensive and sub-extensive scaling of entanglement entropy in the volume- and area-law phases, respectively, by varying the rate of the measurements. We also demonstrate phenomenological critical behaviour by performing a data collapse of the measured entanglement entropy. Our work establishes the use of mid-circuit measurement as a powerful resource for quantum simulation on near-term quantum computers. The interplay of quantum measurements and unitary evolution is expected to produce dynamical phases with different entanglement properties. An entanglement phase transition has now been detected with hybrid quantum circuits in a superconducting processor.},

  abstract     = {Anderson localization is a halt of diffusive wave propagation in disordered systems. Despite extensive studies over the past 40 years, Anderson localization of light in three dimensions has remained elusive, leading to the question of its very existence. Recent advances have enabled finite-difference time-domain calculations to be sped up by orders of magnitude, allowing us to conduct brute-force numerical simulations of light transport in fully disordered three-dimensional systems with unprecedented dimension and refractive index difference. We show numerically three-dimensional localization of vector electromagnetic waves in random aggregates of overlapping metallic spheres, in sharp contrast to the absence of localization for dielectric spheres with a refractive index up to 10 in air. Our work opens a wide range of avenues in both fundamental research related to Anderson localization and potential applications using three-dimensional localized light. Whether Anderson localization of light can be achieved in three dimensions has remained an open question. Numerical calculations now show that it is possible with a random arrangement of metallic spheres, but not with dielectric ones.},

  abstract     = {In conventional metallic superconductors such as aluminium, the large number of weakly bounded Cooper pairs become phase-coherent as soon as they start to form. The cuprate high-temperature superconductors belong to a different category because, being doped Mott insulators, they are known to have low superfluid density and are therefore susceptible to phase fluctuations. It has been proposed that pairing and phase coherence may occur separately in cuprates, and that the measured critical temperature corresponds to the phase-coherence temperature controlled by the superfluid density. Here we examine the evolution of pairing and phase-ordering in underdoped cuprates, and find that a chequerboard plaquette pattern of charge order plays a crucial role, such that the global phase coherence is established once its spatial occupation exceeds a threshold. We make these observations via scanning tunnelling microscopy on underdoped Bi2LaxSr2 − xCuO6 + δ. We observe a smooth crossover from the Mott insulator to superconductor on small islands that have chequerboard order. Each chequerboard plaquette contains approximately two holes and exhibits a stripy internal structure that has a strong influence on the superconducting spectroscopic features. The local spectra remain qualitatively the same across the insulator-to-superconductor transition, and the quasiparticle interference becomes long-ranged. How the superconducting state emerges from a Mott insulator in cuprate superconductors is still not fully understood. Now, the spatial extent of a chequerboard charge order with internal stripes is shown to be crucial.},

  abstract     = {Recent discoveries of superconductivity in various hydrides at high pressures have shown that a critical temperature of superconductivity can reach near-room-temperature values. However, experimental studies are limited by high-pressure conditions, and electrical transport measurements have been the primary technique for detecting superconductivity in hydrides. Here we implement a non-conventional protocol for the magnetic measurements of superconductors in a SQUID magnetometer and probe the trapped magnetic flux in two near-room-temperature superconductors H3S and LaH10 at high pressures. Contrary to traditional magnetic susceptibility measurements, the magnetic response from the trapped flux is almost unaffected by the background signal of the diamond anvil cell due to the absence of external magnetic fields. The behaviour of the trapped flux generated under zero-field-cooled and field-cooled conditions proves the existence of superconductivity in these materials. We reveal that the absence of a pronounced Meissner effect is associated with the very strong pinning of vortices inside the samples. This approach can also be a tool for studying multiphase samples or samples that have a low superconducting fraction at ambient pressure. Measurements of the trapped magnetic flux in hydrides at high pressure provide further evidence that these materials are superconducting at high temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional semiconductor moiré superlattices have emerged as a powerful platform for engineering correlated electronic phenomena. On the other hand, optical excitation creates charge neutral interlayer excitons with an out-of-plane electric dipole. Strong onsite dipole–dipole interaction promises the formation of correlated bosonic states, akin to the Mott states of electrons, but has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report a large interaction between excitons occupying the same moiré lattice site—characterized by the Hubbard U parameter—and consequent dipole ladders with spin- and electron-filling dependence in WSe2/WS2 moiré superlattices. Photoluminescence measurements show successive peaks emerging with an energy separation of around 34 meV above the ground state as the exciton density is increased. This corresponds to the sequential injection of excitons into a single site with an energy cost to overcome the large exciton Hubbard U, forming a dipole ladder. Based on findings of local magnetic moments at two holes per moiré cell, we show that excitons can also fill a second moiré orbital, establishing the two-orbital nature of the moiré potential landscape. Our results show that the Bose–Hubbard model with possible exciton crystal phases can be investigated in interacting opto-moiré quantum matter. Strong dipole–dipole interactions between excitons in a moiré superlattice create a manifestation of the Bose–Hubbard model with a ground state similar to a Mott insulator.},

  abstract     = {Under high pressures and temperatures, molecular systems with substantial polarization charges, such as ammonia and water, are predicted to form superionic phases and dense fluid states with dissociating molecules and high electrical conductivity. This behaviour potentially plays a role in explaining the origin of the multipolar magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune, whose mantles are thought to result from a mixture of H2O, NH3 and CH4 ices. Determining the stability domain, melting curve and electrical conductivity of these superionic phases is therefore crucial for modelling planetary interiors and dynamos. Here we report the melting curve of superionic ammonia up to 300 GPa from laser-driven shock compression of pre-compressed samples and atomistic calculations. We show that ammonia melts at lower temperatures than water above 100 GPa and that fluid ammonia’s electrical conductivity exceeds that of water at conditions predicted by hot, super-adiabatic models for Uranus and Neptune, and enhances the conductivity in their fluid water-rich dynamo layers. Laser-driven shock compression experiments yield the melting curve of the superionic phase of ammonia at conditions relevant to the interiors of Uranus and Neptune.},

However, the intense optical excitations required to achieve high densities cause substantial heating that prevents the realization of simultaneously dense and cold electron–hole systems in conventional semiconductors. Here we show that the separation of electron and hole layers enables the realization of a simultaneously dense and cold electron–hole system. We find a strong enhancement of photoluminescence intensity at the Fermi energy of the neutral dense ultracold electron–hole system that demonstrates the emergence of an excitonic Fermi edge singularity due to the formation of Cooper-pair-like excitons at the Fermi energy. Our measurements also show a crossover from the hydrogen-like excitons to the Cooper-pair-like excitons with increasing density, consistent with the theoretical prediction of a smooth transition. The realization of cold and dense electron–hole systems by optical excitation is hindered by the heating caused by particle recombination.

However, the commonly used anion cooling technique via collisions with a buffer gas is limited by the temperature of the used cryogenic cooling medium. Here we demonstrate the forced evaporative cooling of anions via a laser beam with photon energies far above the photodetachment threshold of the anion. We cool an anionic ensemble from an initial temperature of 370(12) K down to 2.2(8) K. This results in a three orders of magnitude increase in the phase-space density of the ions, approaching the near-strong Coulomb coupling regime. We present an analysis of the cooling dynamics through a thermodynamic model that includes the role of intrinsic collisional heating, without any fitting parameters. This technique can be used to cool any anionic species below liquid helium temperature, providing a tool to push the frontiers of anion cooling below state-of-the-art temperature regimes. A common technique to cool down molecular ions is through collisions with a buffer gas, but that is limited by the achievable temperature of the medium. Now, an experiment demonstrates the evaporative cooling of molecular ions below previously reached temperatures.},

In particular, the long-range baryon–baryon interaction and the degrees of freedom of baryon rotational and vibrational motion are key features of molecular hydrogen ions. Here we present the measurement of a one-photon transition of HD+, a fourth overtone vibrational transition. Through a comparison of experimental and ab initio frequencies of this and previously measured transitions, we implement a test of the low-energy quantum physics of baryon interaction and motion. The results may also be interpreted as a test of Weinberg’s quantum mechanics extension. Furthermore, we compare the value of the fundamental constant combination μ/me = mpmd/(mp + md)me determined from our measurement with the value obtained from mass spectrometry experiments. This may also be regarded as a test of the quantum behaviour of baryons, revealing a moderate tension of 1.7 times the combined uncertainty. Combining our measurement result with some previous ones on HD+, we obtain a least-squares-adjusted value for μ/me as well as a bound for the force between the proton and deuteron in a scenario that is beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. No evidence of a deviation from conventional quantum physics is found. Vibrational spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen ions is used to search for deviations from conventional quantum physics, but none are found.},

Multilayer networks provide the framework to capture the complexity typical of systems of systems, enabling the analysis of biophysical, social and human-made networks from an integrated perspective. Here I review the most important theoretical developments in the past decade, showing how the layered structure of multilayer networks is responsible for phenomena that cannot be observed from the analysis of subsystems in isolation or from their aggregation, including enhanced diffusion, emergent mesoscale organization and phase transitions. I discuss applications spanning multiple spatial scales, from the cell to the human brain and to ecological and social systems, and offer perspectives and challenges on future research directions. Describing interdependencies and coupling between complex systems requires tools beyond what the framework of single networks offers.

  abstract     = {Achieving autonomous motion is a central objective in designing artificial cells that mimic biological cells in form and function. Cellular motion often involves complex multiprotein machineries, which are challenging to reconstitute in vitro. Here we achieve persistent motion of cell-sized liposomes. These small artificial vesicles are driven by a direct mechanochemical feedback loop between the MinD and MinE protein systems of Escherichia coli and the liposome membrane. Membrane-binding Min proteins self-organize asymmetrically around the liposomes, which results in shape deformation and generates a mechanical force gradient leading to motion. The protein distribution responds to the deformed liposome shape through the inherent geometry sensitivity of the reaction–diffusion dynamics of the Min proteins. We show that such a mechanochemical feedback loop between liposome and Min proteins is sufficient to drive continuous motion. Our combined experimental and theoretical study provides a starting point for the future design of motility features in artificial cells. Through a mechanochemical feedback loop involving Min proteins of Escherichia coli, liposomes start to move, which may help to design motile artificial cells.},

  abstract     = {Morphogenesis, the process through which genes generate form, establishes tissue-scale order as a template for constructing the complex shapes of the body plan. The extensive growth required to build these ordered substrates is fuelled by cell proliferation, which, naively, should destroy order. Understanding how active morphogenetic mechanisms couple cellular and mechanical processes to generate order—rather than annihilate it—remains an outstanding question in animal development. We show that cell divisions are the primary drivers of tissue flow, leading to a fourfold orientationally ordered phase. Waves of anisotropic cell proliferation propagate across the embryo with precise patterning. Defects introduced into the nascent lattice by cell divisions are moved out of the tissue bulk towards the boundary by subsequent divisions. Specific cell proliferation rates and orientations enable cell divisions to organize rather than fluidize the tissue. We observe this using live imaging and tissue cartography to analyse the dynamics of fourfold tissue ordering in the trunk segmental ectoderm of the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis beginning 72 h after egg lay. The result is a robust, active mechanism for generating global orientational order in a non-equilibrium system that sets the stage for the subsequent development of shape and form. In the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis, the analysis of the dynamics of fourfold tissue ordering reveals cell divisions as the underlying mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Turbulence is hard to control. Many experimental methods have been developed to generate this elusive state of matter, leading to fundamental insights into its statistical and structural features as well as its onset. In all cases, however, the material boundaries of the experimental apparatus pose a challenge for understanding what the turbulence has been fed and how it would freely evolve. Here we build and control a confined state of turbulence using elemental building blocks—vortex rings. We create a stationary and isolated blob of turbulence in a quiescent environment, initiated and sustained solely by vortex rings. We assemble a full picture of its three-dimensional structure, onset, energy budget and tunability. The incoming vortex rings can be endowed with conserved quantities, such as helicity, which can then be controllably transferred to the turbulent state. Our one-eddy-at-a-time approach opens the possibility for sculpting turbulent flows much as a state of matter, placing the turbulent blob at the targeted position, localizing it and ultimately harnessing it. Turbulence is generated in a quiescent environment using vortex rings as building blocks.},

  abstract     = {ATPases are a group of enzymes that can cyclically convert the free energy of ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work. GTPases are another class of enzymes that are predominantly associated with signal transduction processes, but their role in mechanotransduction is less established. It was previously shown that the binding of the GTPase Rab5 to the tethering protein EEA1 induces a large conformational change in EEA1 from a rigid, extended to a flexible, collapsed state. This entropic collapse of EEA1 gives rise to an effective force that can pull tethered membranes closer. It currently remains unclear if EEA1 can return from the collapsed to the extended conformation without the aid of chaperone proteins. Here we show that EEA1 in a bulk solution can undergo multiple flexibility transition cycles driven by the energetics of Rab5 binding and unbinding as well as GTP hydrolysis. Each cycle can perform up to 20kBT of mechanical work. Hence, Rab5 and EEA1 constitute a two-component molecular motor driven by the chemical energy derived from the Rab5 GTPase cycle. We conclude that tethering proteins and their small GTPase partners can have active mechanical roles in membrane trafficking. ATPases can cyclically convert free energy into mechanical work. Now, it is shown that the GTPase Rab5 can also perform mechanical work as part of a two-component molecular motor with the tethering protein EEA1.},

  abstract     = {Soft particulate gels are composed of a small amount of particulate matter dispersed in a continuous fluid phase. The solid components assemble to form a porous matrix, providing rigidity and control of the mechanical response, despite being the minority constituent. The rheological response and gel elasticity are direct functions of the particle volume fraction. However, the diverse range of different functional dependencies reported experimentally has challenged efforts to identify general scaling laws. Here we reveal a hidden hierarchical organization of fractal elements that controls the viscoelastic spectrum, and which is associated with the spatial heterogeneity of the solid matrix topology. The fractal elements form the foundations of a viscoelastic master curve, constructed using large-scale three-dimensional (3D) microscopic simulations of model gels, which can be described by a recursive rheological ladder model over a range of particle volume fractions and gelation rates. The hierarchy of the fractal elements provides the missing general framework required to predict the gel elasticity and the linear viscoelastic response of these complex materials. Colloidal gels consist of particles embedded in a fluid. It is now found that a gel’s viscoelastic spectrum, relating mechanical properties and deformation frequencies, can be understood by modelling these gels as networks of fractal viscoelastic units, connected hierarchically.},

  abstract     = {Amorphous gels are formed in various soft matter and biomatter when phase separation is dynamically arrested without crystallization. The dynamic arrest in gelation has been attributed to glass transition, but a microscopic foundation is lacking. To address this issue, we experimentally study the gelation of a sticky colloid model using the single-particle-level dynamic analysis of in situ confocal microscopy observations. We show that, during gelation, individual colloids first aggregate into tetrahedra, which then grow to form poly-tetrahedral clusters. Subsequently, pentagonal bipyramids are formed as sets of five tetrahedra, and finally, these pentagonal bipyramids self-catalyse secondary growth to form medium-range amorphous order and arrest dynamics. This hierarchical ordering is primarily driven by local potential energy, not free energy. Thus, the amorphous ordering and arrest mechanism fundamentally differ between gels formed by phase separation and glasses formed homogeneously. These findings will deepen our understanding of two types of amorphous solid, namely, gel and glass. Dynamic arrest in amorphous gels has so far been ascribed to glass transition. Now, experiments reveal a hierarchical structural ordering in dilute colloidal gels driven by the local potential energy, making this type of gel distinct from amorphous glasses.},

The theoretical background for these phenomena is rich and interdisciplinary, with interdependent networks providing a versatile framework to study their multiscale evolution. However, laboratory experiments aimed at validating this ever-growing volume of predictions have not been accomplished, mostly because of the lack of a physical mechanism that realizes interdependent couplings. Here we demonstrate an experimental realization of an interdependent system as a multilayer network of two disordered superconductors separated by an electric insulating film. We show that Joule heating effects due to large driving currents act as dependency links between the superconducting layers, igniting overheating cascades via adaptive and heterogeneous back-and-forth electrothermal feedback. We characterize the phase diagram of mutual superconductive transitions and spontaneous microscopic critical processes that physically realize interdependent percolation and generalize it beyond structural dismantling. This work establishes a laboratory manifestation of the theory of interdependent systems, enabling experimental studies to control and to further develop the multiscale phenomena of complex interdependent materials. Interdependent networks display many interesting properties, but have not been studied in laboratory experiments because of the lack of a platform that manifests appropriate couplings. Now, a network of disordered superconductors accomplishes this.},

  abstract     = {Collective excitations contain key information regarding the electronic order of the ground state of strongly correlated systems. Various collective modes in the spin and valley isospin channels of magic-angle graphene moiré bands have been alluded to by a series of recent experiments. However, a direct observation of collective excitations has been impossible due to the lack of a spin probe. Here we observe low-energy collective excitations in twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle, using a resistively detected electron spin resonance technique. Two independent observations show that the generation and detection of microwave resonance relies on the strong correlations within the flat moiré energy band. First, the onset of the resonance response coincides with the spontaneous flavour polarization at moiré half-filling, but is absent in the isospin unpolarized density range. Second, we perform the same measurement on various systems that do not have flat bands and observe no indication of a resonance response in these samples. Our explanation is that the resonance response near the magic angle originates from Dirac revivals and the resulting isospin order. Phase transitions during which electrons recover their Dirac nature are shown to produce a spin resonance response that allows the characterization of spin and valley couplings in twisted bilayer graphene.},

  abstract     = {Moiré magnetism is emerging as a platform to design and control exotic magnetic phases in twisted magnetic two-dimensional crystals. Non-collinear spin texture emerging from twisted two-dimensional magnets with collinear spins is one of the most profound consequences of moiré magnetism and forms the basis for realizing non-trivial magnetic orders and excitations. However, no direct experimental observations of non-collinear spins in moiré magnets have been made, despite recent theoretical and experimental efforts. Here, we report evidence of non-collinear spin texture in two-dimensional twisted double bilayer CrI3. We distinguish the non-collinear spins with a gradual spin flop process from the collinear spins with sudden spin flip transitions and identify a net magnetization emerging from the collinear spins. We also demonstrate that both non-collinear spins and net magnetization are present at twist angles from 0.5° to 5° but are most prominent for 1.1°. We resolve a critical temperature of 25 K for the onset of the net magnetization and the softening of the non-collinear spins in the 1.1° samples. This is substantially lower than the Néel temperature of 45 K for natural few layers. Our results provide a platform to explore non-trivial magnetism with non-collinear spins. A moiré potential may play a role in determining the magnetic properties of a two-dimensional homo or heterostructure. Now, non-collinear spin structures are observed in twisted double bilayer CrI3, providing a platform to engineer unusual magnetic textures.},

  abstract     = {Electronic nematicity has been commonly observed in juxtaposition with unconventional superconductivity. Understanding the nature of the nematic state and its consequences for the electronic band structure and superconductivity has therefore become a key issue in condensed matter physics. Here we visualize the organization of the interacting quasiparticles in the nematic state of the kagome superconductor CsV3−xTixSb5 using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Two-fold symmetric quasiparticle scattering interference of the vanadium kagome bands emerges below the bulk nematic transition temperature deep inside the charge density wave phase. We find that electron–phonon coupling alters the self-energy of the electrons and renormalizes the Fermi velocity of the in-plane vanadium bands only along the symmetry-breaking direction, making the low-energy dispersion and electron dynamics highly non-equivalent along the three lattice directions. The anti-correlation between the nematic transition temperature and the superconducting transition temperature with Ti substitution suggests a possible competition between superconductivity and electronic nematicity, with principal superconducting gaps opening on the same vanadium bands once the nematic state is totally suppressed. This provides a platform for modelling electronic nematicity in systems where electron correlations and lattice degree of freedom act together. The observation of unidirectional electron–phonon coupling in a kagome lattice material suggests a strong link between superconductivity and the nematic state in that class of materials.},

  abstract     = {Kagome materials have emerged as a setting for emergent electronic phenomena that encompass different aspects of symmetry and topology. It is debated whether the XV6Sn6 kagome family (where X is a rare-earth element), a recently discovered family of bilayer kagome metals, hosts a topologically non-trivial ground state resulting from the opening of spin–orbit coupling gaps. These states would carry a finite spin Berry curvature, and topological surface states. Here we investigate the spin and electronic structure of the XV6Sn6 kagome family. We obtain evidence for a finite spin Berry curvature contribution at the centre of the Brillouin zone, where the nearly flat band detaches from the dispersing Dirac band because of spin–orbit coupling. In addition, the spin Berry curvature is further investigated in the charge density wave regime of ScV6Sn6 and it is found to be robust against the onset of the temperature-driven ordered phase. Utilizing the sensitivity of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to the spin and orbital angular momentum, our work unveils the spin Berry curvature of topological kagome metals and helps to define its spectroscopic fingerprint. The direct observation of spin Berry curvature, an important aspect of non-trivial band topology, has not been achieved in quantum materials. Now it is observed in a bilayer Kagome metal.},

  abstract     = {All-to-all interacting, disordered quantum many-body models have a wide range of applications across disciplines, from spin glasses in condensed-matter physics over holographic duality in high-energy physics to annealing algorithms in quantum computing. Typically, these models are abstractions that do not find unambiguous physical realizations in nature. Here we realize an all-to-all interacting, disordered spin system by subjecting an atomic cloud in a cavity to a controllable light shift. Adjusting the detuning between atom resonance and cavity mode, we can tune between disordered versions of a central-mode model and a Lipkin–Meshkov–Glick model. By spectroscopically probing the low-energy excitations of the system, we explore the competition of interactions with disorder across a broad parameter range. We show how disorder in the central-mode model breaks the strong collective coupling, making the dark-state manifold cross over to a random distribution of weakly mixed light–matter, ‘grey’, states. In the Lipkin–Meshkov–Glick model, the ferromagnetic finite-sized ground state evolves towards a paramagnet as disorder is increased. In that regime, semi-localized eigenstates emerge, as we observe by extracting bounds on the participation ratio. These results present substantial steps towards freely programmable cavity-mediated interactions for the design of arbitrary spin Hamiltonians. Random spin models play a key role in our understanding of disorder and complex many-body systems. Two all-to-all interacting, disordered models have now been realized using a cavity quantum electrodynamics platform.},

  abstract     = {The precision of quantum metrology is widely believed to be restricted by the Heisenberg limit, corresponding to a root mean square error that is inversely proportional to the number of independent processes probed in an experiment, N. In the past, some proposals have challenged this belief, for example, using nonlinear interactions among the probes. However, these proposals turned out to still obey the Heisenberg limit with respect to other relevant resources, such as the total energy of the probes. Here we present a photonic implementation of a quantum metrology protocol surpassing the Heisenberg limit by probing two groups of independent processes in a superposition of two alternative causal orders. Each process creates a phase-space displacement, and our setup is able to estimate a geometric phase associated with two sets of N displacements with an error that falls quadratically with N. Our results only require a single-photon probe with an initial energy that is independent of N. Using a superposition of causal orders outperforms every setup where the displacements are probed in a definite order. Our experiment features the demonstration of indefinite causal order in a continuous-variable system, and opens up the experimental investigation of quantum metrology setups boosted by indefinite causal order. Normally, quantum operations are thought of as being applied in a particular order, but it is possible to create superpositions of different orders. An experiment now demonstrates this indefinite causal order may give an advantage for quantum sensing.},

Our work presents a practical protocol for learning and inverting a sparse noise model that is able to capture correlated noise and scales to large quantum devices. These advances allow us to demonstrate probabilistic error cancellation on a superconducting quantum processor, thereby providing a way to measure noise-free observables at larger circuit volumes. Probabilistic error cancellation could improve the performance of quantum computers without the prohibitive overhead of fault-tolerant error correction.

  abstract     = {Spin qubits in semiconductors are a promising platform for producing highly scalable quantum computing devices. However, it is difficult to realize multiqubit interactions over extended distances. Superconducting spin qubits provide an alternative by encoding a qubit in the spin degree of freedom of an Andreev level. These Andreev spin qubits have an intrinsic spin–supercurrent coupling that enables the use of recent advances in circuit quantum electrodynamics. The first realization of an Andreev spin qubit encoded the qubit in the excited states of a semiconducting weak link, leading to frequent decay out of the computational subspace. Additionally, rapid qubit manipulation was hindered by the need for indirect Raman transitions. Here we use an electrostatically defined quantum dot Josephson junction with large charging energy, which leads to a spin-split doublet ground state. We tune the qubit frequency over a frequency range of 10 GHz using a magnetic field, which also enables us to investigate the qubit performance using direct spin manipulation. An all-electric microwave drive produces Rabi frequencies exceeding 200 MHz. We embed the Andreev spin qubit in a superconducting transmon qubit, demonstrating strong coherent qubit–qubit coupling. These results are a crucial step towards a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial aspects of both superconducting and semiconductor qubits. Semiconductor qubits can benefit from existing industrial methods, but there are challenges in coupling qubits together. A hybrid superconductor–semiconductor qubit that couples to superconducting qubit devices may overcome these issues.},

Here we observe the transition from a disordered regime to a polaritonic one with only two resonances, using the high degree of control in a strongly coupled cold-atom system where the ratio between coupling strength and frequency inhomogeneities can be tuned. The polaritons are much narrower than the frequency distribution, as predicted in the context of cavity protection. We find that the concentration of photonic weight of the coupled light–matter states is a key parameter for this transition and demonstrate that a simple parameter based on the statistics of transmission count spectra provides an experimental proxy for this theoretical quantity. Moreover, we realize a dynamically modulated Tavis–Cummings model to produce a comb of narrow polariton resonances protected from disorder, with potential applications to quantum networks. Engineering the frequency spectrum of systems of multiple quantum emitters is the key for many quantum technologies. A cavity quantum electrodynamics experiment now demonstrates the real-time frequency modulation of cavity-protected polaritons.},

  abstract     = {Exceptional points are a unique feature of non-Hermitian systems at which the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates of a Hamiltonian coalesce. Many intriguing physical phenomena arise from the topology of exceptional points, such as bulk Fermi arcs and the braiding of eigenvalues. Here we report that a structurally richer degeneracy morphology, known as the swallowtail catastrophe in singularity theory, can naturally exist in non-Hermitian systems with both parity–time and pseudo-Hermitian symmetries. For the swallowtail, three different types of singularity exist at the same time and interact with each other—an isolated nodal line, a pair of exceptional lines of order three and a non-defective intersection line. Although these singularities seem independent, they are stably connected at a single point—the vertex of the swallowtail—through which transitions can occur. We implement such a system in a non-reciprocal circuit and experimentally observe the degeneracy features of the swallowtail. Based on the frame rotation and deformation of eigenstates, we further demonstrate that the various transitions are topologically protected. A characteristic feature of non-Hermitian systems is an exceptional point at which eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce. They also support richer degeneracies—a swallowtail catastrophe—that reveals transitions among three different types of singularity.},

  abstract     = {X-ray bursts are among the brightest stellar objects frequently observed in the sky by space-based telescopes. A type-I X-ray burst is understood as a violent thermonuclear explosion on the surface of a neutron star, accreting matter from a companion star in a binary system. The bursts are powered by a nuclear reaction sequence known as the rapid proton capture process (rp process), which involves hundreds of exotic neutron-deficient nuclides. At so-called waiting-point nuclides, the process stalls until a slower β+ decay enables a bypass. One of the handful of rp process waiting-point nuclides is 64Ge, which plays a decisive role in matter flow and therefore the produced X-ray flux. Here we report precision measurements of the masses of 63Ge, 64,65As and 66,67Se—the relevant nuclear masses around the waiting-point 64Ge—and use them as inputs for X-ray burst model calculations. We obtain the X-ray burst light curve to constrain the neutron-star compactness, and suggest that the distance to the X-ray burster GS 1826–24 needs to be increased by about 6.5\% to match astronomical observations. The nucleosynthesis results affect the thermal structure of accreting neutron stars, which will subsequently modify the calculations of associated observables. Rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis stalls at waiting-point nuclides, including 64Ge. Precision mass measurements in the vicinity of this nuclide influence state-of-the-art calculations of X-ray bursts from accreting neutron stars.},

  abstract     = {Non-Newtonian fluids have a viscosity that varies with applied stress. Elastoviscoplastic fluids, the elastic, viscous and plastic properties of which are interconnected in a non-trivial way, belong to this category. We have performed numerical simulations to investigate turbulence in elastoviscoplastic fluids at very high Reynolds-number values, as found in landslides and lava flows, focusing on the effect of plasticity. We find that the range of active scales in the energy spectrum reduces when increasing the fluid plasticity; when plastic effects dominate, a new scaling range emerges between the inertial range and the dissipative scales. An extended self-similarity analysis of the structure functions reveals that intermittency is present and grows with the fluid plasticity. The enhanced intermittency is caused by the non-Newtonian dissipation rate, which also exhibits an intermittent behaviour. These findings have relevance to catastrophic events in natural flows, such as landslides and lava flows, where the enhanced intermittency results in stronger extreme events, which are thus more destructive and difficult to predict. Elastoviscoplastic fluids combine solid- and liquid-like behaviour depending on applied stress. Simulations of elastoviscoplastic fluids at high Reynolds number now show that plasticity plays a key role in the turbulent flows seen in these systems, leading for example to intermittency.},

  abstract     = {As developing tissues grow in size and undergo morphogenetic changes, their material properties may be altered. Such changes result from tension dynamics at cell contacts or cellular jamming. Yet, in many cases, the cellular mechanisms controlling the physical state of growing tissues are unclear. We found that at early developmental stages, the epithelium in the developing mouse spinal cord maintains both high junctional tension and high fluidity. This is achieved via a mechanism in which interkinetic nuclear movements generate cell area dynamics that drive extensive cell rearrangements. Over time, the cell proliferation rate declines, effectively solidifying the tissue. Thus, unlike well-studied jamming transitions, the solidification uncovered here resembles a glass transition that depends on the dynamical stresses generated by proliferation and differentiation. Our finding that the fluidity of developing epithelia is linked to interkinetic nuclear movements and the dynamics of growth is likely to be relevant to multiple developing tissues. Developing tissues undergo rheology transitions that are often linked to cell–cell adhesion. Now, tissue fluidity is linked to interkinetic nuclear movements and tissue growth.},

  abstract     = {The renormalization group is a key set of ideas and quantitative tools of statistical physics that allow for the calculation of universal quantities that encompass the behaviour of different kinds of collective systems. Extension of the predictive power of the renormalization group to collective biological systems would greatly strengthen the effort to put physical biology on a firm basis. Here we present a step in that direction by calculating the dynamical critical exponent z of natural swarms of insects using the renormalization group to order ϵ = 4 − d. We report the emergence of a novel fixed point, where both activity and inertia are relevant. In three dimensions, the critical exponent at the new fixed point is z = 1.35, in agreement with both experiments (1.37 ± 0.11) and numerical simulations (1.35 ± 0.04). Our results probe the power of the renormalization group for the quantitative description of collective behaviour, and suggest that universality may also play a decisive role in strongly correlated biological systems. Tests of the predictions of the renormalization group in biological experiments have not yet been decisive. Now, a study on the collective dynamics of insect swarms provides a long-sought match between experiment and theory.},

  abstract     = {The stable functionality of networked systems is a hallmark of their natural ability to coordinate between their multiple interacting components. Yet, real-world networks often appear random and highly irregular, raising the question of what are the naturally emerging organizing principles of complex system stability. The answer is encoded within the system’s stability matrix—the Jacobian—but is hard to retrieve, due to the scale and diversity of the relevant systems, their broad parameter space and their nonlinear interaction dynamics. Here we introduce the dynamic Jacobian ensemble, which allows us to systematically investigate the fixed-point dynamics of a range of relevant network-based models. Within this ensemble, we find that complex systems exhibit discrete stability classes. These range from asymptotically unstable (where stability is unattainable) to sensitive (where stability abides within a bounded range of system parameters). Alongside these two classes, we uncover a third asymptotically stable class in which a sufficiently large and heterogeneous network acquires a guaranteed stability, independent of its microscopic parameters and robust against external perturbation. Hence, in this ensemble, two of the most ubiquitous characteristics of real-world networks—scale and heterogeneity—emerge as natural organizing principles to ensure fixed-point stability in the face of changing environmental conditions. Despite looking highly irregular, most real-world networks exhibit natural stability to external perturbations. A study of the properties of the stability matrix of networks now sheds light on the principles underlying this emerging stability.},

  abstract     = {An outstanding challenge in large-scale quantum platforms is to simultaneously achieve strong interactions, giving rise to the most interesting behaviours, and local addressing, which can probe them. In the context of correlated phases, local addressing allows one to directly probe the nature of the system’s order. At the same time, such addressing allows the study of quantum information spreading and operator growth in out-of-equilibrium scenarios. Here we introduce a technique that enables the measurement of local correlation functions, down to single-site resolution, despite access to only global controls. Our approach leverages the intrinsic disorder present in a solid-state spin ensemble to dephase the non-local components of the correlation function. Utilizing this toolset, we measure both the spin and energy transport in nuclear spin chains. By tuning the interaction Hamiltonian via Floquet engineering, we investigate the cross-over between ballistic and diffusive hydrodynamics. Interestingly, in certain parameter regimes, we observe the coexistence of diffusive spin transport with ballistic energy transport, a hallmark of interacting integrable systems. Probing strongly interacting quantum systems with high spatial resolution can be challenging. An experiment now uses disorder in nuclear spin chains as a local probe to investigate spin and energy hydrodynamics.},

Here we measure the von Neumann entropy of spatially extended subsystems in an ultracold atom simulator of one-dimensional quantum field theories. We experimentally verify one of the fundamental properties of equilibrium states of gapped quantum many-body systems—the area law of quantum mutual information. We also study the dependence of mutual information on temperature and on the separation between the subsystems. Our work represents a step towards employing ultracold atom simulators to probe entanglement in quantum field theories. The scaling of entanglement entropy and mutual information is key for the understanding of correlated states of matter.

Here we investigate the complex interplay between Bloch band transport, non-linearity and dissipation, exploring how a synthetic dimension realized in the frequency space of a coherently driven optical resonator influences the dynamics of the system. We observe and study non-linear dissipative Bloch oscillations along the synthetic frequency dimension, sustained by localized dissipative structures (solitons) that persist in the resonator. The unique properties of the coherently driven dissipative soliton states can extend the effective size of the synthetic dimension far beyond that achieved in the linear regime, as well as enable long-lived Bloch oscillations and high-resolution probing of the underlying band structure. Synthetic dimensions can introduce band properties without a periodic structure in real space, but they have largely been studied in linear systems. A study using an optical resonator has now shown non-linear soliton states in synthetic frequency space.},

With the recent achievement of ground-state cooling of a single motional mode, levitated nanoparticles have entered the quantum domain. To overcome detrimental cross-coupling and decoherence effects, quantum control needs to be expanded to more system dimensions, but the effect of a decoupled dark mode has so far hindered cavity-based ground-state cooling of multiple mechanical modes. Here, we demonstrate two-dimensional ground-state cooling of an optically levitated nanoparticle. Utilizing coherent scattering into an optical cavity mode, we reduce the occupation numbers of two separate centre-of-mass modes to 0.83 and 0.81, respectively. By controlling the frequency separation and the cavity coupling strengths of the nanoparticle’s mechanical modes, we show the transition from 1D to 2D ground-state cooling. This 2D control lays the foundations for quantum-limited orbital angular momentum states for rotation sensing and, combined with ground-state cooling along the third motional axis shown previously, may allow full 3D ground-state cooling of a massive object. A levitated nanoparticle in an optical cavity has been cooled to its motional ground state in two degrees of freedom at the same time. Control of the cavity properties also enabled the observation of the transition from 1D to 2D ground-state cooling.},

Here we report the control and cooling of all the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of a nanoparticle trapped in an optical tweezer, accomplished by cavity cooling via coherent elliptic scattering. We reached temperatures in the range of hundreds of microkelvins for the translational modes and temperatures as low as 5 mK for the librational degrees of freedom.

Yet, the temporal counterpart of Young’s double-slit experiment—a wave interacting with a double temporal modulation of an interface—remains elusive. Here we report such a time-domain version of the classic Young’s double-slit experiment: a beam of light twice gated in time produces an interference in the frequency spectrum. The ‘time slits’, narrow enough to produce diffraction at optical frequencies, are generated from the optical excitation of a thin film of indium tin oxide near its epsilon-near-zero point. The separation between time slits determines the period of oscillations in the frequency spectrum, whereas the decay of fringe visibility in frequency reveals the shape of the time slits. Surprisingly, many more oscillations are visible than expected from existing theory, implying a rise time that approaches an optical cycle. This result enables the further exploration of time-varying physics, towards the spectral synthesis of waves and applications such as signal processing and neuromorphic computation. A temporal version of Young’s double-slit experiment shows characteristic interference in the frequency domain when light interacts with time slits produced by ultrafast changes in the refractive index of an epsilon-near-zero material.},

It is commonly believed that any perturbation that destroys such a topological phase simultaneously destroys the boundary states. However, by introducing and exploring a weaker sub-symmetry requirement on perturbations, we find that the nature of boundary state protection is in fact more complex. Here we demonstrate that the boundary states are protected by only the sub-symmetry, using Su–Schrieffer–Heeger and breathing kagome lattice models, even though the overall topological invariant and the associated topological phase can be destroyed by sub-symmetry-preserving perturbations. By precisely controlling symmetry breaking in photonic lattices, we experimentally demonstrate such sub-symmetry protection of topological states. Furthermore, we introduce a long-range hopping symmetry in breathing kagome lattices, which resolves a debate on the higher-order topological nature of their corner states. Our results apply beyond photonics and could be used to explore the properties of symmetry-protected topological phases in the absence of full symmetry in different physical contexts. Some topological boundary states are symmetry protected. Experiments with photonic lattices now show that the protection via sub-symmetry is enough to ensure topological modes, even if the full symmetry and topological invariant are destroyed.},

Here we report that a classical metamaterial nanostructure, a two-dimensional array of plasmonic metamolecules supported on flexible nanowires, can be driven to a state possessing all of the key features of a continuous time crystal: continuous coherent illumination by light resonant with the metamolecules’ plasmonic mode triggers a spontaneous phase transition to a superradiant-like state of transmissivity oscillations, resulting from many-body interactions among the metamolecules, characterized by long-range order in space and time. The phenomenon is of interest to the study of dynamic classical many-body states in the strongly correlated regime and applications in all-optical modulation, frequency conversion and timing. So far, a continuous time crystal has only been implemented on a quantum system.

  abstract     = {Memory and rejuvenation effects in the magnetic response of off-equilibrium spin glasses have been widely regarded as the doorway into the experimental exploration of ultrametricity and temperature chaos. Unfortunately, despite more than twenty years of theoretical efforts following the experimental discovery of memory and rejuvenation, these effects have, thus far, been impossible to reliably simulate. Yet, three recent developments convinced us to accept this challenge: first, the custom-built Janus II supercomputer makes it possible to carry out simulations in which the very same quantities that can be measured in single crystals of CuMn are computed from the simulation, allowing for a parallel analysis of the simulation and experimental data. Second, Janus II simulations have taught us how numerical and experimental length scales should be compared. Third, we have recently understood how temperature chaos materializes in aging dynamics. All these three aspects have proved crucial for reliably reproducing rejuvenation and memory effects on the computer. Our analysis shows that at least three different length scales play a key role in aging dynamics, whereas essentially all the theoretical analyses of the aging dynamics emphasize the presence and crucial role of a single glassy correlation length. Reliably probing rejuvenation and memory effects in spin glasses by means of simulations is difficult. Now, a state-of-the-art numerical study shows that at least three different length scales play a crucial role in aging dynamics of spin glasses.},

  abstract     = {Unlike a crystal, a glassy solid state displays slow internal relaxation processes besides vibrational modes even when structural (α) relaxation is frozen. The precise nature of such residual local relaxation modes remains poorly understood due to the lack of real-space information. Here we directly visualize the internal relaxations in a glass via a long-time observation of the dynamics of a mechanically driven two-dimensional granular system that shows a pinning-induced transition. This allows directly visualizing the internal relaxations in a glass. On approaching the glass transition, vanishing cage-breaking motion is observed, accompanied by the emergence of a restricted dynamic mode characterizing slow β relaxation. The emergence of bond rigidity freezes the structure relaxation and leads to slow β motion. Our findings indicate that unlike crystallization, where all the bonds are constrained, vitrification in a disordered system freezes α relaxation and accompanies elastic percolation, but the remaining non-constrained bonds provide room for slow β relaxation. Glasses relax internally even when their structure is frozen. Observations of a two-dimensional glass former now show that although structure relaxation freezes with the glass transition, non-constrained bonds survive; this accounts for persisting internal relaxation.},

  abstract     = {In ferromagnets, an electric current generally induces a transverse Hall voltage in proportion to the internal magnetization. This effect is frequently used for the electrical readout of the spin-↑ and spin-↓ states. Although these properties are usually not expected in antiferromagnets, recent theoretical studies predicted that a non-coplanar antiferromagnetic order with finite scalar spin chirality—meaning a solid angle spanned by neighbouring spins—can induce a large spontaneous Hall effect even without a net magnetization or external magnetic field. This phenomenon—the spontaneous topological Hall effect—can potentially be used for the efficient electrical readout of antiferromagnetic states, but it has not been experimentally verified due to a lack of appropriate materials hosting such magnetism. Here we report the discovery of an all-in–all-out-type non-coplanar antiferromagnetic order in triangular lattice compounds CoTa3S6 and CoNb3S6. These compounds are reported to host unconventionally large spontaneous Hall effects despite their vanishingly small net magnetization, and our analysis reveals that it can be explained in terms of the topological Hall effect that originates from the fictitious magnetic field associated with scalar spin chirality. These results indicate that the scalar spin chirality mechanism offers a promising route to the realization of a giant spontaneous Hall response even in compensated antiferromagnets, and highlight intercalated van der Waals magnets as a promising quasi-two-dimensional material platform to enable various non-trivial ways of electrical reading and the possible writing of non-coplanar antiferromagnetic domains. The spontaneous topological Hall effect, combining non-coplanar antiferromagnetic order with finite scalar spin chirality in the absence of a magnetic field, is now experimentally demonstrated for the triangular lattice compounds CoTa3S6 and CoNb3S6.},

  abstract     = {The relaxation of energetic quasiparticles in superconducting nanostructures involves many cascaded interactions between electrons, phonons and Cooper pairs. These dynamics are central to the performance of devices such as qubits or photon detectors. However, they are still not well understood, as they require experiments in which quasiparticles are injected in a controlled fashion. Until now, such experiments have typically employed solid-state tunnel junctions with a fixed tunnel barrier. Here we use instead the scanning critical current microscopy technique that we developed by taking advantage of a cryogenic scanning tunnelling microscope to tune independently the energy and the rate of quasiparticle injection through, respectively, the bias voltage and the tunnelling current. For high-energy quasiparticles, we observe a reduction in the critical current of a nanowire and show it is mainly controlled by the injected power and, marginally, by the injection rate. Our results prove a thermal mechanism for the reduction of the critical current and give insight into the rapid dynamics of the generated hot spot. The performance of superconducting devices is affected by the generation and relaxation of excitations called quasiparticles. A scanning tunnelling microscope can controllably inject quasiparticles so their dynamics can be better understood.},

  abstract     = {Layer-by-layer material engineering has produced interesting quantum phenomena such as interfacial superconductivity and the quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, probing electronic states layer by layer remains challenging. This is exemplified by the difficulty in understanding the layer origins of topological electronic states in magnetic topological insulators. Here we report a layer-encoded frequency-domain photoemission experiment on the magnetic topological insulator (MnBi2Te4)(Bi2Te3) that characterizes the origins of its electronic states. Infrared laser excitations launch coherent lattice vibrations with the layer index encoded by the vibration frequency. Photoemission spectroscopy then tracks the electron dynamics, where the layer information is carried in the frequency domain. This layer–frequency correspondence shows wavefunction relocation of the topological surface state from the top magnetic layer into the buried second layer, reconciling the controversy over the vanishing broken-symmetry energy gap in (MnBi2Te4)(Bi2Te3) and its related compounds. The layer–frequency correspondence can be harnessed to disentangle electronic states layer by layer in a broad class of van der Waals superlattices. Layering quantum materials can produce interesting phenomena by combining the different behaviour of electronic states in each layer. A layer-sensitive measurement technique provides insights into the physics of a magnetic topological insulator.},

  abstract     = {It has long been hoped that spin liquid states might be observed in materials that realize the triangular-lattice Hubbard model. However, weak spin–orbit coupling and other small perturbations often induce conventional spin freezing or magnetic ordering. Sufficiently strong spin–orbit coupling, however, can renormalize the electronic wavefunction and induce anisotropic exchange interactions that promote magnetic frustration. Here we show that the cooperative interplay of spin–orbit coupling and correlation effects in the triangular-lattice magnet NaRuO2 produces an inherently fluctuating magnetic ground state. Despite the presence of a charge gap, we find that low-temperature spin excitations generate a metal-like term in the specific heat and a continuum of excitations in neutron scattering, reminiscent of spin liquid states previously found in triangular-lattice organic magnets. Further cooling produces a crossover into a different, highly disordered spin state whose dynamic spin autocorrelation function reflects persistent fluctuations. These findings establish NaRuO2 as a cousin to organic, Heisenberg spin liquid compounds with a low-temperature crossover in quantum disorder. Spin liquids are predicted to emerge in materials that combine strong electronic correlations with geometric frustration. Evidence has now been found for a spin liquid state in the triangular-lattice material NaRuO2.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic reconnection converts magnetic energy into thermal and kinetic energy in plasma. Among the numerous candidate mechanisms, ion acoustic instabilities driven by the relative drift between ions and electrons (or equivalently, electric current) have been suggested to play a critical role in dissipating magnetic energy in collisionless plasmas. However, their existence and effectiveness during reconnection have not been well understood due to ion Landau damping and difficulties in resolving the Debye length scale in the laboratory. Here we report a sudden onset of ion acoustic bursts measured by collective Thomson scattering in the exhaust of anti-parallel magnetically driven reconnection using high-power lasers. The ion acoustic bursts are followed by electron acoustic bursts with electron heating and bulk acceleration. We reproduce these observations with one- and two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations in which an electron outflow jet drives ion acoustic instabilities, forming double layers. These layers induce electron two-stream instabilities that generate electron acoustic bursts and energize electrons. Our results demonstrate the importance of ion and electron acoustic dynamics during reconnection when ion Landau damping is ineffective, a condition applicable to a range of astrophysical plasmas including near-Earth space, stellar flares and black hole accretion engines. Ion acoustic bursts followed by electron acoustic bursts are observed during magnetic reconnection in a laboratory experiment. These bursts have been suggested to mediate energy dissipation.},

  abstract     = {The cosmogenic isotope 41Ca with a half-life of 99,000 years can, in principle, serve as a tracer for environmental processes at an age scale beyond the reach of 14C. With accelerator mass spectrometry, the ratio of 41Ca/Ca has been measured down to the 10−15 level in natural samples. A wide range of potential applications, such as the burial dating of bones and exposure dating of rocks, require measuring even smaller 41Ca/Ca ratios in the range of 10−16 to 10−15. Here we achieved this by employing the atom-trap trace analysis method in which individual 41Ca atoms are selectively captured in a magneto-optical trap and counted by detecting their fluorescence. We realized a precision of 12\% on the 41Ca/Ca ratio at the level of 10−16 and achieved a detection limit at the level of 10−17, which is below the distribution of natural abundances. We verified the accuracy of the 41Ca/Ca results through a series of measurements of reference samples, and performed demonstration analyses on bone, rock and seawater samples. Our table-top method has the potential to explore the suitability of 41Ca as a tracer. The calcium isotope 41Ca is a promising candidate to complement dating methods relying on radiocarbon. Small levels of 41Ca can be measured with atom-trap trace analysis, which brings the use of 41Ca a step closer to applications.},

  abstract     = {Turbulence under strong influence of rotation is described as an ensemble of interacting inertial waves across a wide range of length scales. In macroscopic quantum condensates, the quasiclassical turbulent dynamics at large scales is altered at small scales, where the quantization of vorticity is essential. The nature of this transition remains an unanswered question. Here we expand the concept of wave-driven turbulence to rotating quantum fluids where the spectrum of waves extends to microscopic scales as Kelvin waves on quantized vortices. We excite inertial waves at the largest scale by periodic modulation of the angular velocity and observe dissipation-independent transfer of energy to smaller scales and the eventual onset of the elusive Kelvin wave cascade at the lowest temperatures. We further find that energy is pumped to the system through a boundary layer distinct from the classical Ekman layer and support our observations with numerical simulations. Our experiments demonstrate a regime of turbulent motion in quantum fluids where the role of vortex reconnections can be neglected, thus stripping the transition between the classical and the quantum regimes of turbulence down to its constituent components. Quantum turbulence typically entails reconnecting quantized vortices as seen in quantum fluids. Experiments with superfluid helium now show turbulent dynamics with negligible vortex reconnection, a regime dominated by interacting vortex waves at all length scales.},

  abstract     = {The phenomenon of active turbulence, a complex organization of matter driven at the scale of its constituent agents, is puzzling. Specifically, the lack of scale-separation in low-Reynolds-number active flows breaks away from the familiar notions of the energy cascade and approximate scale-invariance of inertial turbulence. Here, using a generalized hydrodynamic model developed for bacterial turbulence, we provide compelling analytical and numerical evidence that, beyond a critical drive, active turbulence indeed attains universality akin to inertial turbulence. In this asymptotic state, the energy spectrum scales as k−3/2, reminiscent of some classes of inertial turbulence. The flow also exhibits spatio-temporal intermittency beyond the transition, as seen from non-Gaussian fluctuations in velocity differences. With these tell-tale fingerprints, active turbulence is placed closer in phenomenology to inertial turbulence than previously held. We show, however, that as a consequence of a finite range of scales, the degree of chaoticity and hence mixing efficiency saturates to a maximum in the asymptotic regime, unlike unbounded chaos in inertial turbulence. We conclude that active turbulence, depending on the level of drive, can switch between fundamentally distinct non-universal and universal states. Active fluids exhibit regimes with a complex spatio-temporal structure reminiscent of inertial turbulence. Now, inertial and active turbulence are theoretically shown to be closely related indeed.},

  abstract     = {Bubble-bursting aerosols have a key role in mass and momentum transfer across interfaces. Previous studies report that the bursting of a millimetre-sized bare bubble at an aqueous surface produces jet drops with a typical size on the order of 100 μm. Here we show that jet drops can be as small as a few micrometres when the bursting bubble is coated by a thin oil layer. The faster and smaller jet drops result from the singular dynamics of the oil-coated cavity collapse. The air–oil–water compound interface offers a distinct damping mechanism to smooth out the precursor capillary waves during cavity collapse, leading to a more efficient focusing of the dominant wave and thus allowing singular jets over a much wider parameter space than that of a bare bubble. We develop a theoretical explanation for the parameter limits of the singular jet regime by considering the interplay between inertia, surface tension and viscous effects. Contaminated bubbles are widely observed, therefore previously unrecognized fast and small contaminant-laden jet drops may contribute to the aerosolization and airborne transmission of bulk substances. A bursting bubble produces a jet drop previously estimated to be too large to contribute to aerosolization. Oil-coated bubbles produce fast and thin jets, which break up into much smaller drops with potential implications for airborne transmission.},

While such networks have mostly been implemented in optical systems using photons, alternative realizations addressing major limitations in photonic systems such as photon loss have been explored recently. Quantized excitations of vibrational modes (phonons) of trapped ions are a promising candidate to realize such bosonic networks. Here, we demonstrate a minimal-loss programmable phononic network in which any phononic state can be deterministically prepared and detected. We realize networks with up to four collective vibrational modes, which can be extended to reveal quantum advantage. We benchmark the performance of the network for an exemplary tomography algorithm using arbitrary multi-mode states with fixed total phonon number. We obtain high reconstruction fidelities for both single- and two-phonon states. Our experiment demonstrates a clear pathway to scale up a phononic network for quantum information processing beyond the limitations of classical and photonic systems. The scalability of quantum information processing applications is generally hindered by loss and inefficient preparation and detection. A minimal loss network based on phonons has now been realized with trapped ions.},

  abstract     = {Ultrafast photon–electron spectroscopy in electron microscopes commonly requires ultrafast laser setups. Photoemission from an engineered electron source is used to generate pulsed electrons, interacting with a sample excited by the laser pulse at a known time delay. Thus, developing an ultrafast electron microscope demands the exploitation of extrinsic laser excitations and complex synchronization schemes. Here we present an inverse approach to introduce internal radiation sources in an electron microscope based on cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Our compact method is based on a sequential interaction of the electron beam with an electron-driven photon source and the investigated sample. Such a source in an electron microscope generates phase-locked photons that are mutually coherent with the near-field distribution of the swift electron. We confirm the mutual frequency and momentum-dependent correlation of the electron-driven photon source and sample radiation and determine a degree of mutual coherence of up to 27\%. With this level of mutual coherence, we were able to perform spectral interferometry with an electron microscope. Our method has the advantage of being simple, compact and operating with continuous electron beams. It will open the door to local photon–electron correlation spectroscopy of quantum materials, single-photon systems and coherent exciton–polaritonic samples with nanometre resolution. Ultrafast photon–electron spectroscopy commonly requires a driving laser. Now, an inverse approach based on cathodoluminescence spectroscopy has allowed a compact solution to spectral interferometry inside an electron microscope, without a laser.},

  abstract     = {Time reflection is a uniform inversion of the temporal evolution of a signal, which arises when an abrupt change in the properties of the host material occurs uniformly in space. At such a time interface, a portion of the input signal is time reversed, and its frequency spectrum is homogeneously translated as its momentum is conserved, forming the temporal counterpart of a spatial interface. Combinations of time interfaces, forming time metamaterials and Floquet matter, exploit the interference of multiple time reflections for extreme wave manipulation, leveraging time as an additional degree of freedom. Here we report the observation of photonic time reflection and associated broadband frequency translation in a switched transmission-line metamaterial whose effective capacitance is homogeneously and abruptly changed via a synchronized array of switches. A pair of temporal interfaces are combined to demonstrate time-reflection-induced wave interference, realizing the temporal counterpart of a Fabry–Pérot cavity. Our results establish the foundational building blocks to realize time metamaterials and Floquet photonic crystals, with opportunities for extreme photon manipulation in space and time. Reflection cannot only occur at interfaces in space but also in time. Transmission-line metamaterials support time interfaces at which interference has been observed, forming a temporal version of a Fabry–Pérot cavity.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between photons and a single two-level atom constitutes a fundamental paradigm in quantum physics. The nonlinearity provided by the atom leads to a strong dependence of the light–matter interface on the number of photons interacting with the two-level system within its emission lifetime. This nonlinearity unveils strongly correlated quasiparticles known as photon bound states, giving rise to key physical processes such as stimulated emission and soliton propagation. Although signatures consistent with the existence of photon bound states have been measured in strongly interacting Rydberg gases, their hallmark excitation-number-dependent dispersion and propagation velocity have not yet been observed. Here we report the direct observation of a photon-number-dependent time delay in the scattering off a single artificial atom—a semiconductor quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity. By scattering a weak coherent pulse off the cavity–quantum electrodynamics system and measuring the time-dependent output power and correlation functions, we show that single photons and two- and three-photon bound states incur different time delays, becoming shorter for higher photon numbers. This reduced time delay is a fingerprint of stimulated emission, where the arrival of two photons within the lifetime of an emitter causes one photon to stimulate the emission of another. Measurements on a single artificial atom—a quantum dot—coupled to an optical cavity show scattering dynamics that depend on the number of photons involved in the light–matter interaction, which is a signature of stimulated emission.},

  abstract     = {The modern primary voltage standard is based on the a.c. Josephson effect and the ensuing Shapiro steps, where a microwave tone applied to a Josephson junction yields a constant voltage hf/2e determined by only the microwave frequency f, Planck’s constant h and the electron charge e. Duality arguments for current and voltage have long suggested the possibility of dual Shapiro steps—that a Josephson junction device could produce current steps with heights determined only by the applied frequency. Here we embed an ultrasmall Josephson junction in a high impedance array of larger junctions to reveal dual Shapiro steps. For multiple frequencies, we detect that the a.c. response of the circuit is synchronized with the microwave tone at frequency f, and the corresponding emergence of flat steps in the d.c. response with current 2ef, equal to the transport of a Cooper pair per tone period. This work extends phase–charge duality to Josephson circuits, which opens a broad range of possibilities in the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics and is an important step towards the long-sought closure of the quantum metrology electrical triangle. It has been predicted that Josephson junction devices could produce quantized currents in analogy to the Shapiro steps of voltage used to define the voltage standard. These dual Shapiro steps have now been observed in a Josephson junction array.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe. However, understanding the properties of dense hydrogen is still an open challenge because—under megabar pressures—the quantum nature of both electrons and protons emerges, producing deviations from the common behaviour of condensed-matter systems. Experiments are challenging and can access only limited observables, and the interplay between electron correlation and nuclear quantum motion makes standard simulations unreliable. Here we present the computed phase diagram of hydrogen and deuterium at low temperatures and high pressures using state-of-the-art methods to describe both many-body electronic correlation and quantum anharmonic motion of protons. Our results show that the long-sought atomic metallic hydrogen phase—predicted to host room-temperature superconductivity—forms at 577(4) GPa. The anharmonic vibrations of nuclei pushes the stability of this phase towards pressures much larger than previous estimates or attained experimental values. Before atomization, molecular hydrogen transforms from a metallic phase (phase III) to another metallic structure that is still molecular (phase VI) at 410(20) GPa. Isotope effects increase the pressures of both transitions by 63 and 32 GPa, respectively. We predict signatures in optical spectroscopy and d.c. conductivity that can be experimentally used to distinguish between the two structural transitions. It is very challenging to model hydrogen at high pressures and low temperatures because quantum effects become significant. A state-of-the-art numerical study shows that these effects cause important changes to the predicted phase diagram.},

  abstract     = {The most direct approach for characterizing the quantum dynamics of a strongly interacting system is to measure the time evolution of its full many-body state. Despite the conceptual simplicity of this approach, it quickly becomes intractable as the system size grows. An alternate approach is to think of the many-body dynamics as generating noise, which can be measured by the decoherence of a probe qubit. Here we investigate what the decoherence dynamics of such a probe tells us about the many-body system. In particular, we utilize optically addressable probe spins to experimentally characterize both static and dynamical properties of strongly interacting magnetic dipoles. Our experimental platform consists of two types of spin defects in nitrogen delta-doped diamond: nitrogen-vacancy colour centres, which we use as probe spins, and a many-body ensemble of substitutional nitrogen impurities. We demonstrate that the many-body system’s dimensionality, dynamics and disorder are naturally encoded in the probe spins’ decoherence profile. Furthermore, we obtain direct control over the spectral properties of the many-body system, with potential applications in quantum sensing and simulation. Solid-state systems are established candidates to study models of many-body physics but have limited control and readout capabilities. Ensembles of defects in diamond may provide a solution for studying dipolar systems.},

  abstract     = {Strong electric field annihilation by particle–antiparticle pair creation, also known as the Schwinger effect, is a non-perturbative prediction of quantum electrodynamics. Its experimental demonstration remains elusive, as threshold electric fields are extremely strong and beyond current reach. Here, we propose a mesoscopic variant of the Schwinger effect in graphene, which hosts Dirac fermions with an approximate electron–hole symmetry. Using transport measurements, we report on universal one-dimensional Schwinger conductance at the pinchoff of ballistic graphene transistors. Strong pinchoff electric fields are concentrated within approximately 1 μm of the transistor’s drain and induce Schwinger electron–hole pair creation at saturation. This effect precedes a collective instability towards an ohmic Zener regime, which is rejected at twice the pinchoff voltage in long devices. These observations advance our understanding of current saturation limits in ballistic graphene and provide a direction for further quantum electrodynamic experiments in the laboratory. Observations of the Schwinger effect—the creation of matter by electric fields—have been hindered by the high required field strength. A mesoscopic variant of the Schwinger effect has now been realized in graphene transistors.},

While magnetic order can arise in both insulating and metallic compounds, ferroelectricity is in principle only allowed in insulators, although ferroelectric metals have been proposed and several two-dimensional systems have been reported to behave in this way. However, their combination with and coupling to magnetic order have not been realized thus far. Here we show the coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism in an oxide-based two-dimensional electron gas. We report a modulation of the Ti–O polar displacements depending on the ferroelectric polarization direction, and a voltage-induced hysteresis of the sheet resistance that is reminiscent of the ferroelectric polarization loop. The transport properties of the electron gas display an anomalous Hall effect and magnetoresistance that can both be modulated and cycled by switching the remanent polarization, demonstrating a magnetoelectric coupling. Our findings provide new opportunities in quantum matter that stem from the interplay between ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, metallicity and Rashba spin–orbit coupling. Materials that simultaneously display ferroelectricity and magnetism, and are metallic, are very rare. Now, the two-dimensional electron gas in an oxide heterostructure brings all of this behaviour together.},

  abstract     = {Electron correlations often lead to emergent orders in quantum materials, and one example is the kagome lattice materials where topological states exist in the presence of strong correlations between electrons. This arises from the features of the electronic band structure that are associated with the kagome lattice geometry: flat bands induced by destructive interference of the electronic wavefunctions, topological Dirac crossings and a pair of van Hove singularities. Various correlated electronic phases have been discovered in kagome lattice materials, including magnetism, charge density waves, nematicity and superconductivity. Recently, a charge density wave was discovered in the magnetic kagome FeGe, providing a platform for understanding the interplay between charge order and magnetism in kagome materials. Here we observe all three electronic signatures of the kagome lattice in FeGe using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The presence of van Hove singularities near the Fermi level is driven by the underlying magnetic exchange splitting. Furthermore, we show spectral evidence for the charge density wave as gaps near the Fermi level. Our observations point to the magnetic interaction-driven band modification resulting in the formation of the charge density wave and indicate an intertwined connection between the emergent magnetism and charge order in this moderately correlated kagome metal. The observation of band structure features typical of the kagome lattice in FeGe suggests that an interplay of magnetism and electronic correlations determines the physics of this material.},

  abstract     = {In spin torque magnetic memories, electrically actuated spin currents are used to switch a magnetic bit. Typically, these require a multilayer geometry including both a free ferromagnetic layer and a second layer providing spin injection. For example, spin may be injected by a non-magnetic layer exhibiting a large spin Hall effect, a phenomenon known as spin–orbit torque. Here we demonstrate a spin–orbit torque magnetic bit in a single two-dimensional system with intrinsic magnetism and strong Berry curvature. We study AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2, which hosts a magnetic Chern insulator at a carrier density of one hole per moiré superlattice site. We observe hysteretic switching of the resistivity as a function of applied current. Magnetic imaging reveals that current switches correspond to reversals of individual magnetic domains. The real space pattern of domain reversals aligns with spin accumulation measured near the Hubbard band edges with high Berry curvature. This suggests that intrinsic spin or valley Hall torques drive the observed current-driven magnetic switching in both MoTe2/WSe2 and other moiré materials. The switching current density is substantially less than those reported in other platforms, suggesting that moiré heterostructures are a suitable platform for efficient control of magnetic order. Switching of magnetic behaviour is one of the main ideas that drives spintronics. Now, magnetic switching via spin-orbit torque is shown in a moiré bilayer, introducing a platform for spintronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the underlying nature of dynamical correlations believed to drive the bulk glass transition is a long-standing problem. Here we show that the form of spatial gradients of the glass transition temperature and structural relaxation time near an interface indeed provide signatures of the nature of relaxation in bulk glass-forming liquids. We report the results of long-time, large-system molecular dynamics simulations of thick glass-forming polymer films with one vapour interface, supported on a dynamically neutral substrate. We find that gradients in the glass transition temperature and logarithm of the structural relaxation time nucleated at a vapour interface exhibit two distinct regimes: a medium-ranged, large-amplitude exponential gradient, followed by a long-range slowly decaying tail that can be described by an inverse power law. This behaviour disagrees with multiple proposed theories of glassy dynamics but is predicted by the ‘elastically collective nonlinear Langevin equation’ theory as a consequence of two coupled mechanisms: a medium-ranged interface-nucleated gradient of surface-modified local caging constraints, and an interfacial truncation of a long-ranged collective elastic field. These findings support a coupled spatially local–nonlocal mechanism of activated glassy relaxation and kinetic vitrification in both the isotropic bulk and in broken-symmetry films. Large-system molecular dynamics simulations of films of glass-forming polymers reveal spatially long-range tails of interface-driven gradients of the glass transition temperature, suggestive of a combined local caging and long-range collective elasticity origin of relaxation and vitrification in glass-forming liquids.},

Here we demonstrate the preparation of ultracold Feshbach molecules of fermionic atoms in the second Bloch band of an optical square lattice. We cover a wide range of interaction strengths, including the regime of unitarity in the middle of the crossover. Binding energies and band relaxation dynamics are measured by means of a method resembling mass spectrometry. We find that the longest lifetimes arise for strongly interacting Feshbach molecules at the onset of unitarity. In the case of strong confinement in a deep lattice potential, we observe bound dimers also for negative values of the scattering length, extending previous findings for molecules in the lowest band. The realization of ultracold molecules in higher bands of an optical lattice sets the stage for the study of the interplay between orbital physics and the Bose–Einstein condensation and Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer superfluidity crossover.},

  abstract     = {According to quantum chromodynamics, vacuum is not an empty space, because it is filled with quark–antiquark pairs. The pair has the same quantum numbers as the vacuum and forms a condensate because the strong interaction of the quantum chromodynamics is too strong to leave the vacuum empty. This quark–antiquark condensation, the chiral condensate, breaks the chiral symmetry of the vacuum. The expectation value of the chiral condensate is an order parameter of the chiral symmetry, which is expected to decrease at high temperatures or high matter densities where the chiral symmetry is partially restored. Head-on collisions of nuclei at ultra-relativistic energies have explored the high-temperature regime, but experiments at high densities are rare. Here we measure the spectrum of pionic 121Sn atoms and study the interaction between the pion and the nucleus. We find that the expectation value of the chiral condensate is reduced at finite density compared to the value in vacuum. The reduction is linearly extrapolated to the nuclear saturation density and indicates that the chiral symmetry is partially restored due to the extremely high density of the nucleus. In quantum chromodynamics, the condensation of quark–antiquark pairs breaks the chiral symmetry of vacuum. Experiments with pionic tin atoms demonstrate that the symmetry is partially restored at high densities.},

  abstract     = {Noise in existing quantum processors only enables an approximation to ideal quantum computation. However, for the computation of expectation values, these approximations can be improved by error mitigation. This has been experimentally demonstrated in small systems but the scaling of these methods to larger circuit volumes remains unknown. Here we demonstrate the utility of zero-noise extrapolation for practically relevant quantum circuits using up to 26 qubits, circuit depths of 120 and 1,080 CNOT gates. We study the scaling of the method for canonical examples of product states and entangling Clifford circuits of increasing size, and extend it to simulating the quench dynamics of two-dimensional Ising spin lattices with varying couplings. These experiments reveal that the accuracy of physically relevant observables after error mitigation substantially exceeds previously expected values. Furthermore, we show that the efficacy of error mitigation is greatly enhanced by additional error suppression techniques and native gate decomposition that reduce the circuit time. By combining these methods, the accuracy of our quantum simulation surpasses the classical approximations obtained from an established tensor network method. These results establish the potential of a useful quantum advantage using noisy, digital quantum processors. A technique called error mitigation can significantly improve the performance of large-scale quantum computations on near-term devices without the significant resource overheard of fault-tolerant quantum error correction.},

Here we investigate a pivot joint that enables rotational motion of a nanorobotic arm and show the storage and release of mechanical energy by winding up and relaxing the joint that functions as a molecular torsion spring. Using electrical manipulation of the nanorobotic arm and simultaneous observation via single molecule fluorescence microscopy, we study the mechanical properties of various joint designs. Brownian dynamics simulations suggest that breaking of stacking interactions is a major contributor to enthalpic energy storage. The molecular joint of a nanorobotic arm can be wound up to store mechanical energy and then relaxed to drive the rotation of a DNA nanodevice.},

  abstract     = {Elongated active units cannot spontaneously break rotation symmetry in bulk fluids to form nematic or polar phases. This has led to the image of active suspensions as spontaneously evolving, spatiotemporally chaotic fluids. Here, in contrast, I show that bulk active fluids have stable active nematic and polar states at fluid–fluid or fluid–air interfaces. The active flow-mediated long-range interactions that destroy the ordered phase in bulk lead to long-range order at the interface. Thus, active fluids have a surface ordering transition and form states with quiescent, ordered surfaces and chaotic bulk. I further consider active units that are constrained to live at an interface to examine the minimal conditions for the existence of two-dimensional order in bulk three-dimensional fluids. In this case, immotile units do not order, but motile particles still form a long-range-ordered polar phase. This prediction of stable, uniaxial, active phases in bulk fluids may have functional consequences for active transport. Bulk active fluids are unstable because activity destroys long-range ordering. Now, a model of 3D active liquids shows that stable states can form at fluid–fluid surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there has been increasing interest in the temporal degree of freedom in photonics due to its analogy with spatial axes, causality and open-system characteristics. In particular, the temporal analogues of photonic crystals have allowed the design of momentum gaps and their extension to topological and non-Hermitian photonics. Although recent studies have also revealed the effect of broken discrete time-translational symmetry in view of the temporal analogy of spatial Anderson localization, the broad intermediate regime between time order and time uncorrelated disorder has not been examined. Here we theoretically investigate the inverse design of photonic time disorder to achieve optical functionalities in spatially homogeneous platforms. By developing the structure factor and order metric using causal Green’s functions for disorder in the time domain, we propose an engineered time scatterer, which provides unidirectional scattering with controlled scattering amplitudes. We also show that the order-to-disorder transition in the time domain allows the manipulation of scattering bandwidths, which makes resonance-free temporal colour filtering possible. Our work could advance optical functionalities without spatial patterning. Photonic systems can exploit time as a degree of freedom analogous to space, eliminating the need for spatial patterning to achieve functionality. A Green’s function approach allows the design of disordered time scatterers with desired properties.},

However, investigating this phase diagram remains challenging when bosons condense due to the resulting fast interspecies loss. Here we report observations consistent with a phase transition from a polaronic to a molecular phase in a density-matched degenerate Bose–Fermi mixture. The condensate fraction, representing the order parameter of the transition, is depleted by interactions, and the build-up of strong correlations results in the emergence of a molecular Fermi gas. The features of the underlying quantum phase transition represent a new phenomenon complementary to the paradigmatic Bose–Einstein condensate/Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer crossover observed in Fermi systems. By driving the system through the transition, we produce a sample of sodium–potassium molecules exhibiting a large molecule-frame dipole moment in the quantum-degenerate regime. Tuning interspecies interactions in atomic Bose–Fermi mixtures is shown to drive the system through a quantum phase transition. This enables the generation of heteronuclear molecules in the quantum-degenerate regime.},

  abstract     = {Enhancing light–matter coupling at the level of single quanta is essential for numerous applications in quantum science. The cooperative optical response of subwavelength atomic arrays has been found to open new pathways for such strong light–matter couplings, while simultaneously offering access to multiple spatial modes of the light field. Efficient single-mode free-space coupling to such arrays has been reported, but spatial control over the modes of outgoing light fields has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such spatial control over the optical response of an atomically thin mirror formed by a subwavelength array of atoms in free space using a single controlled ancilla atom excited to a Rydberg state. The switching behaviour is controlled by the admixture of a small Rydberg fraction to the atomic mirror, and consequently strong dipolar Rydberg interactions with the ancilla. Driving Rabi oscillations on the ancilla atom, we demonstrate coherent control of the transmission and reflection of the array. These results represent a step towards the realization of quantum coherent metasurfaces, the demonstration of controlled atom–photon entanglement and deterministic engineering of quantum states of light. The realization of efficient light–matter interfaces is important for many quantum technologies. An experiment now shows how to coherently switch the collective optical properties of an array of quantum emitters by driving a single ancilla atom to a Rydberg state.},

In superconducting circuits, the resonator-based Josephson-junction parametric amplifiers conventionally used to generate squeezed microwaves are constrained by a narrow bandwidth and low dynamic range. Here we develop a dual-pump, broadband Josephson travelling-wave parametric amplifier that combines a phase-sensitive extinction ratio of 56 dB with single-mode squeezing on par with the best resonator-based squeezers. We also demonstrate two-mode squeezing at microwave frequencies with bandwidth in the gigahertz range that is almost two orders of magnitude wider than that of contemporary resonator-based squeezers. Our amplifier is capable of simultaneously creating entangled microwave photon pairs with large frequency separation, with potential applications including high-fidelity qubit readout, quantum illumination and teleportation. Parametric amplifiers are a key component in the operation and readout of superconducting quantum circuits.

This means that it develops a thin polymorphic crystalline layer before reaching the solid–solid transition temperature if two crystals can form a low-energy coherent interface. We confirm this in simulations and colloid experiments at single-particle resolution. The power-law increase of surface layer thickness is analogous to premelting. Different kinetics and reversibilities of surface-crystal growth are observed in various systems. Surface crystals exist not only under thermal equilibrium but also during melting, crystallization and grain coarsening. Furthermore, the premelting and pre-solid–solid transition can coexist, resulting in double surface wetting layers. We hypothesize that such surface phenomena also exist in some atomic and molecular crystals, and this could provide a mechanism to tune the properties of the materials. Premelting refers to the formation of a thin liquid film on a crystal’s surface before it properly melts. Now, a similar mechanism is shown to occur before solid–solid transitions in colloidal crystals: the formation of a polymorphic crystalline layer.},

  abstract     = {Melting is well understood in terms of the Lindemann criterion, which essentially states that crystalline materials melt when the thermal vibrations of their atoms become so vigorous that they shake themselves free of the binding forces. This picture does not necessarily have to hold for glasses, where the nature of the solid–liquid cross-over is highly debated. The Lindemann criterion implies that the thermal expansion coefficients of crystals are inversely proportional to their melting temperatures. Here we find that, in contrast, the thermal expansion coefficient of glasses decreases more strongly with increasing glass temperature, which marks the liquid–solid cross-over in this material class. However, this proportionality returns when the thermal expansion coefficient is scaled by the fragility, a measure of particle cooperativity. Therefore, for a glass to become liquid, it is not sufficient to simply overcome the interparticle binding energies. Instead, more energy must be invested to break up the typical cooperative particle network that is common to glassy materials. The thermal expansion coefficient of the liquid phase reveals similar anomalous behaviour and is universally enhanced by a constant factor of approximately 3. These universalities allow the estimation of glass temperatures from thermal expansion and vice versa. The Lindemann criterion states that crystals melt when thermal vibrations overcome binding forces. It is now found that this picture does not hold for glasses, and that there is a universal relationship between glass temperature and thermal expansion.},

Some of the most interesting of these ground states, such as fractional quantum Hall states and fractional Chern insulators, have fractionally charged quasiparticles. Correlations in these phases are captured by the binding of electrons and vortices into emergent particles called composite fermions. Composite fermion quasiparticles are randomly localized at high levels of disorder and may exhibit charge order when there is not too much disorder in the system. However, more complex correlations are predicted when composite fermion quasiparticles cluster into a bubble, and then these bubbles order on a lattice. Such a highly correlated ground state is termed the bubble phase of composite fermions. Here we report the observation of such a bubble phase of composite fermions, evidenced by the re-entrance of the fractional quantum Hall effect. We associate this re-entrance with a bubble phase with two composite fermion quasiparticles per bubble. Our results demonstrate the existence of a new class of strongly correlated topological phases driven by clustering and charge ordering of emergent quasiparticles. Composite fermions emerge in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Now, it has been shown that these objects can group into bubbles and that these can order into a lattice.},

  abstract     = {The classification scheme of electronic phases uses two prominent paradigms: correlations and topology. Electron correlations give rise to superconductivity and charge density waves, while the quantum geometric Berry phase gives rise to electronic topology. The intersection of these two paradigms has initiated an effort to discover electronic instabilities at or near the Fermi level of topological materials. Here we identify the electronic topology of chiral fermions as the driving mechanism for creating van Hove singularities that host electronic instabilities in the surface band structure. We observe that the chiral fermion conductors RhSi and CoSi possess two types of helicoid arc van Hove singularities that we call type I and type II. In RhSi, the type I variety drives a switching of the connectivity of the helicoid arcs at different energies. In CoSi, we measure a type II intra-helicoid arc van Hove singularity near the Fermi level. Chemical engineering methods are able to tune the energy of these singularities. Finally, electronic susceptibility calculations allow us to visualize the dominant Fermi surface nesting vectors of the helicoid arc singularities, consistent with recent observations of surface charge density wave ordering in CoSi. This suggests a connection between helicoid arc singularities and surface charge density waves. Strong correlations between electrons in topological surface states drive the formation of surface van Hove singularities. These may be linked to charge density waves in the surface states.},

  abstract     = {When a magnetic moment is embedded in a metal, it captures nearby itinerant electrons to form a so-called Kondo cloud. When magnetic impurities are sufficiently dense that their individual clouds overlap with each other they are expected to form a correlated electronic ground state. This is known as Kondo condensation and can be considered a magnetic version of Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer pair formation. Here, we examine this phenomenon by performing electrical transport and high-precision tunnelling density-of-states spectroscopy measurements in a highly P-doped crystalline silicon metal in which disorder-induced localized magnetic moments exist. We detect the Kondo effect in the resistivity of the Si metal at temperatures below 2 K and an unusual pseudogap in the density of states with gap edge peaks below 100 mK. The pseudogap and peaks are tuned by applying an external magnetic field and transformed into a metallic Altshuler–Aronov gap associated with a paramagnetic disordered Fermi liquid phase. We interpret these observations as evidence of Kondo condensation followed by a transition to a disordered Fermi liquid. Heavily doping silicon with phosphorus produces a dense population of metallic conduction electrons and localized magnetic moments. Low-temperature measurements show evidence of strongly correlated state.},

Self-testing is a method to infer the underlying physics of a quantum experiment only from the measured statistics1,2. Although all bipartite pure entangled states can be self-tested3, little is known about how to self-test quantum states of an arbitrary number of systems. Here we introduce a framework of network-assisted self-testing and use it to self-test any pure entangled quantum state of an arbitrary number of systems. The scheme requires the preparation of a number of singlets that scales linearly with the number of systems, and the implementation of standard projective and Bell measurements, all feasible with current technology4. When all the network constraints are exploited, the obtained self-testing certification is stronger than what is achievable in any Bell-type scenario. Our work shows how properly designed networks offer new opportunities for the certification of quantum phenomena. Quantum systems produce correlations that cannot be mimicked by classical resources, which can be used to certify quantum states without trusting the underlying devices. A network can perform this procedure for pure states with any number of systems.},

It has been proposed that animal groups constitute examples of self-organized systems at criticality2,3; however, direct empirical evidence of this hypothesis—in particular in the wild—is mostly absent. Here we show that highly conspicuous, repetitive and rhythmic collective dive cascades produced by many thousands of freshwater fish under high predation risk resemble a stochastic excitable system driven by environmental perturbations. Together with the results of an agent-based model of the system, this suggests that these fish shoals might operate at a critical point between a state of high individual diving activity and low overall diving activity. We show that the best fitting model, which is located at a critical point, allows information about external perturbations—such as predator attacks—to propagate most effectively through the shoal. Our results suggest that criticality might be a plausible principle of distributed information processing in large animal collectives. Certain fish shoals ward off bird attacks by touching the water surface in a manner resembling waves observed in stadiums. This behaviour exhibits characteristics that suggest the fish might operate close to criticality.},

  abstract     = {Plasmon polaritons (plasmons, for simplicity) have become paramount for tailored nanoscale light–matter interaction, and extensive research has been conducted to monitor1,2 and manipulate their spatial3 and spatio-temporal dynamics4. These dynamics result from the superposition of various plasmon modes, which are classical wave packets. Beyond this classical picture, plasmon modes are treated as quasiparticles5,6 and they are considered essential for the realization of future nanoscale quantum functionality7–10. Implementing and demonstrating such functionality requires access to the quasiparticle’s quantum state to monitor and manipulate its corresponding quantum wave packet dynamics in Hilbert space. Here we report the local detection of nanoscale plasmon quantum wave packets using plasmon-assisted electron emission as a signal in coherent two-dimensional nanoscopy11. The observation of a quantum coherence oscillating at the third harmonic of the plasmon frequency is traced back to the superposition of energetically non-adjacent plasmon occupation number states and is therefore a direct fingerprint of the quantum wave packet. Beyond demonstrating the existence of a plasmon quantum wave packet via the coherence between certain occupation number states and providing an improved model for plasmon-assisted electron emission processes, the results may enable time-dependent probing and manipulation of coupled quantum states and dynamics on the nanoscale. Plasmonics allows precise engineering of light–matter interactions and is the driver behind many optical devices. The local observation of a plasmonic quantum wave packet is a step towards bringing these functionalities to the quantum regime.},

  abstract     = {Supercooled droplet freezing on surfaces occurs frequently in nature and industry, often adversely affecting the efficiency and reliability of technological processes. The ability of superhydrophobic surfaces to rapidly shed water and reduce ice adhesion make them promising candidates for resistance to icing. However, the effect of supercooled droplet freezing—with its inherent rapid local heating and explosive vaporization—on the evolution of droplet–substrate interactions, and the resulting implications for the design of icephobic surfaces, are little explored. Here we investigate the freezing of supercooled droplets resting on engineered textured surfaces. On the basis of investigations in which freezing is induced by evacuation of the atmosphere, we determine the surface properties required to promote ice self-expulsion and, simultaneously, identify two mechanisms through which repellency falters. We elucidate these outcomes by balancing (anti-)wetting surface forces with those triggered by recalescent freezing phenomena and demonstrate rationally designed textures to promote ice expulsion. Finally, we consider the complementary case of freezing at atmospheric pressure and subzero temperature, where we observe bottom-up ice suffusion within the surface texture. We then assemble a rational framework for the phenomenology of ice adhesion of supercooled droplets throughout freezing, informing ice-repellent surface design across the phase diagram. Icephobic surfaces are helpful for increasing safety and sustainability in engineering applications. A study of the behaviour of supercooled droplets freezing on superhydrophobic surfaces now provides insights into ice-repellency mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {The ability to sensitively image electric fields is important for understanding many nanoelectronic phenomena, including charge accumulation at surfaces1 and interfaces2 and field distributions in active electronic devices3. A particularly exciting application is the visualization of domain patterns in ferroelectric and nanoferroic materials4,5, owing to their potential in computing and data storage6–8. Here, we use a scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) microscope, well known for its use in magnetometry9, to image domain patterns in piezoelectric (Pb[Zr0.2Ti0.8]O3) and improper ferroelectric (YMnO3) materials through their electric fields. Electric field detection is enabled by measuring the Stark shift of the NV spin10,11 using a gradiometric detection scheme12. Analysis of the electric field maps allows us to discriminate between different types of surface charge distributions, as well as to reconstruct maps of the three-dimensional electric field vector and charge density. The ability to measure both stray electric and magnetic fields9,13 under ambient conditions opens opportunities for the study of multiferroic and multifunctional materials and devices8,14. A scanning nitrogen-vacancy microscope is used to image ferroelectric domains in piezoelectric and improper ferroelectric samples with high sensitivity. The technique relies on the nitrogen-vacancy’s Stark shift produced by the samples’ electric field.},

  abstract     = {Kagome metals AV3Sb51 (where the A can stand for K, Cs or Rb) display a rich phase diagram of correlated electron states, including superconductivity2–4 and density waves5–7. Within this landscape, recent experiments have revealed signs of a transition below approximately 35 K attributed to an electronic nematic phase that spontaneously breaks the rotational symmetry of the lattice8. Here we show that the rotational symmetry breaking initiates universally at a high temperature in these materials, towards the 2 × 2 charge density wave transition temperature. We do this via spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunnelling microscopy and study the atomic-scale signatures of the electronic symmetry breaking across several materials in the AV3Sb5 family: CsV3Sb5, KV3Sb5 and Sn-doped CsV3Sb5. Below a substantially lower temperature of about 30 K, we measure the quantum interference of quasiparticles, a key signature for the formation of a coherent electronic state. These quasiparticles display a pronounced unidirectional feature in reciprocal space that strengthens as the superconducting state is approached. Our experiments reveal that high-temperature rotation symmetry breaking and the charge ordering states are separated from the superconducting ground state by an intermediate-temperature regime with coherent unidirectional quasiparticles. This picture is phenomenologically different compared to that in high-temperature superconductors, shedding light on the complex nature of rotation symmetry breaking in AV3Sb5 kagome superconductors. The charge density wave state in kagome superconductors is not fully understood. Now, evidence suggests that the rotational symmetry of the lattice is broken before coherence of unidirectional quasiparticles is established at a lower temperature.},

In crystalline solids, polarons form when electrons and holes become dressed by lattice vibrations. While experimental signatures of polarons in bulk three-dimensional materials abound4–14, only rarely have polarons been observed in two-dimensional atomic crystals. Here, we shed light on this asymmetry by developing a quantitative ab initio theory of polarons in atomically thin crystals. Using this conceptual framework, we determine the real-space structure of the recently observed hole polaron in hexagonal boron nitride, discover a critical condition for the existence of polarons in two-dimensional crystals and establish the key materials descriptors and the universal laws that underpin polaron physics in two dimensions. When electrons in a crystal interact with the surrounding lattice, they can form quasiparticles known as polarons. A computational approach to studying polarons in two-dimensional materials explains why they are rarely observed in these systems.},

  abstract     = {Conventional electron linear accelerators are essential research tools but limited in providing high beam currents. Energy recovery technology enables high beam currents with reasonable and sustainable power supply requirements by recycling the electrons’ kinetic energy. Independently, higher beam energies can be achieved if electrons are accelerated multiple times in a linear accelerator. The combination of both techniques results in a multi-turn energy recovery linear accelerator, which is capable of providing high beam power. Here we report the demonstration of efficient energy recycling in multi-turn operation where we saved up to 87\% of the consumed beam power in the main linear accelerator of the superconducting Darmstadt electron linear accelerator (S-DALINAC). In this setting, the cumulative phase slippage effect, caused by the different speeds of the electrons per main linear accelerator pass and the resulting different interactions with the alternating electric field, cannot be neglected and was compensated. Our proof-of-principle demonstration shows how multi-turn energy recovery linear accelerators can outperform conventional machines due to the potential for considerable power saving while providing higher beam power. By combining energy recovery technology and a multi-turn accelerating scheme in a linear accelerator, high-power beams can be achieved with considerably reduced energy consumption.},

Precise and rapid spatiotemporal control of reactions by condensates requires tuning of their sizes. However, the physical processes that govern the distribution of condensate sizes remain unclear. Here we show that both native and synthetic condensates display an exponential size distribution, which is captured by Monte Carlo simulations of fast nucleation followed by coalescence. In contrast, pathological aggregates exhibit a power-law size distribution. These distinct behaviours reflect the relative importance of nucleation and coalescence kinetics. We demonstrate this by utilizing a combination of synthetic and native condensates to probe the underlying physical mechanisms determining condensate size. The appearance of exponential distributions for abrupt nucleation versus power-law distributions under continuous nucleation may reflect a general principle that determines condensate size distributions. Biomolecular condensates play a role in cellular processes and their size affects reaction pathways. The size distribution is connected to varying contributions of nucleation and coalescence.},

  abstract     = {The organisation of actin filaments into bundles is required for cellular processes such as motility, morphogenesis and cell division. A network of actin-binding proteins, some of which can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation, controls filament bundling. However, it remains unclear how these liquid-like condensates contribute to filament bundling. Here we show that the processive actin polymerase and bundling protein VASP forms liquid-like droplets under physiological conditions. As actin polymerizes within VASP droplets, elongating filaments partition to the edges of the droplet to minimize filament curvature, forming an actin-rich ring within the droplet. The rigidity of this ring is balanced by the droplet’s surface tension. However, as the ring grows thicker, its rigidity increases and eventually overcomes the surface tension, deforming into a linear bundle. The fluid nature of the droplets is critical for bundling, as more solid droplets resist deformation and therefore prevent filaments from rearranging into bundles. This droplet-based bundling mechanism may be relevant to the assembly of cellular architectures rich in bundled actin filaments such as filopodia, stress fibres and focal adhesions. The protein VASP can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation. The interplay between the surface tension of the VASP droplet and actin polymerization controls the bundling of actin filaments, a necessary step for many cellular processes.},

Quantum characterization of motion is key, for example, in controlling or harnessing motion in trapped ion and atom systems or observing the quantum nature of the vibrational excitations of solid-state objects. Here we show that the direct measurement of position and momentum can be used for quantum tomography of motional states of a single trapped particle. We obtain the momentum of an atom in an optical tweezer via time-of-flight measurements, which, combined with trap harmonic evolution, grants us access to all quadrature distributions. Starting with non-classical motional states of a trapped neutral atom, we demonstrate the Wigner function negativity and coherence of non-stationary states. Our work will enable the characterization of the complex neutral atom motion that is of interest for quantum information and metrology, and for investigations of the quantum behaviour of massive levitated particles. A tomography protocol that exploits the control offered by optical tweezers allows the reconstruction of motional states of a single trapped atom. This has implications for the study of non-classical states of massive trapped and levitated particles.},

However, scattering from a dynamic medium typically scrambles and averages out such correlations. Here we show that multiply scattered entangled photons reflected from a dynamic complex medium remain partially correlated. In experiments and full-wave simulations we observe enhanced correlations, within an angular range determined by the transport mean free path, which prevail over disorder averaging. Theoretical analysis reveals that this enhancement arises from the interference between scattering trajectories, in which the photons leave the sample and are then virtually reinjected back into it. These paths are the quantum counterpart of the paths that lead to the coherent backscattering of classical light. This work points to opportunities for entanglement transport despite dynamic multiple scattering in complex systems. Dynamic and disordered media destroy the correlations that underlie many quantum measurement protocols and applications. However, coherently backscattered photons can remain partially correlated due to interference between scattering trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Strongly driven systems of emitters offer an attractive source of light over broad spectral ranges up to the X-ray region. A key limitation of these systems is that the light they emit is mostly classical. We overcome this constraint by building a quantum-optical theory of strongly driven many-body systems, showing that the presence of correlations among the emitters creates emission of non-classical many-photon states of light. We consider the example of high-harmonic generation, by which a strongly driven system emits photons at integer multiples of the drive frequency. In the conventional case of uncorrelated emitters, the harmonics are in an almost perfectly multi-mode coherent state lacking any correlation between harmonics. By contrast, a correlation of the emitters before the strong drive is converted into non-classical features of the output light, including doubly peaked photon statistics, ring-shaped Wigner functions and correlations between harmonics. We propose schemes for implementing these concepts, creating the correlations between emitters via an interaction between them or their joint interaction with the background electromagnetic field. Our work paves the way towards the engineering of novel states of light over a broadband spectrum and suggests high-harmonic generation as a tool for characterizing correlations in many-body systems with attosecond temporal resolution. Strongly driven light sources have become useful in many ways but are limited to classical emission. A quantum-optical theory now shows how non-classical states of light can be achieved from strongly-driven many-body systems, for example, non-coherent and correlated high-harmonic generation.},

  abstract     = {Direct visualization of ultrafast coupling between charge carriers and lattice degrees of freedom in photoexcited semiconductors has remained a long-standing challenge and is critical for understanding the light-induced physical behaviour of materials under extreme non-equilibrium conditions. Here we obtain a direct visualization of the structural dynamics in monocrystalline 2D perovskites. We achieve this by monitoring the evolution of wavevector-resolved ultrafast electron diffraction intensity following above-bandgap high-density photoexcitation. Our analysis reveals a light-induced ultrafast reduction in antiferro-distortion resulting from a strong interaction between the electron–hole plasma and perovskite lattice, which induces an in-plane octahedra rotation towards a more symmetric phase. Correlated ultrafast spectroscopy performed at the same carrier density as ultrafast electron diffraction reveals that the creation of a dense electron–hole plasma triggers the relaxation of lattice distortion at shorter timescales by modulating the crystal cohesive energy. Finally, we show that the interaction between carrier gas and lattice can be altered by tailoring the rigidity of the 2D perovskite by choosing an appropriate organic spacer layer. The ultrafast structural dynamics in 2D perovskites are an important part of their non-equilibrium properties. Now, their visualization reveals a light-induced reduction in the antiferro-distortion initiated by the electron–hole plasma.},

  abstract     = {The concept of quasiparticles—long-lived low-energy particle-like excitations—has become a cornerstone of condensed quantum matter, where it explains a variety of emergent many-body phenomena such as superfluidity and superconductivity. Here we use quasiparticles to explain the collective behaviour of a classical system of hydrodynamically interacting particles in two dimensions. In the disordered phase of this matter, measurements reveal a subpopulation of long-lived particle pairs. Modelling and simulation of the ordered crystalline phase identify the pairs as quasiparticles, emerging at the Dirac cones of the spectrum. The quasiparticles stimulate supersonic pairing avalanches, bringing about the melting of the crystal. In hexagonal crystals, where the intrinsic three-fold symmetry of the hydrodynamic interaction matches that of the crystal, the spectrum forms a flat band dense with ultra-slow, low-frequency phonons whose collective interactions induce a much sharper melting transition. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the usefulness of concepts from quantum matter theory in understanding many-body physics in classical dissipative settings. The concept of quasiparticles helps to describe various quantum phenomena in solids. It is now shown that certain properties of a classical system of hydrodynamically interacting particles can also be described by means of quasiparticles.},

  abstract     = {Spin-based technologies can operate at terahertz frequencies but require manipulation techniques that work at ultrafast timescales to become practical. For instance, devices based on spin waves, also known as magnons, require efficient generation of high-energy exchange spin waves at nanometre wavelengths. To achieve this, a substantial coupling is needed between the magnon modes and an electro-magnetic stimulus such as a coherent terahertz field pulse. However, it has been difficult to excite non-uniform spin waves efficiently using terahertz light because of the large momentum mismatch between the submillimetre-wave radiation and the nanometre-sized spin waves. Here we improve the light–matter interaction by engineering thin films to exploit relativistic spin–orbit torques that are confined to the interfaces of heavy metal/ferromagnet heterostructures. We are able to excite spin-wave modes with frequencies of up to 0.6 THz and wavelengths as short as 6 nm using broadband terahertz radiation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the coupling of terahertz light to exchange-dominated magnons originates solely from interfacial spin–orbit torques. Our results are of general applicability to other magnetic multilayered structures, and offer the prospect of nanoscale control of high-frequency signals. Engineering of the spin–orbit interactions in a magnetic multilayered structure makes it possible to coherently generate coherent spin waves using terahertz radiation, which could benefit the development of spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Long viewed as passive elements, antiferromagnetic materials have emerged as promising candidates for spintronic devices due to their insensitivity to external fields and potential for high-speed switching. Recent work exploiting spin and orbital effects has identified ways to electrically control and probe the spins in metallic antiferromagnets, especially in non-collinear or non-centrosymmetric spin structures. The rare-earth nickelate NdNiO3 is known to be a non-collinear antiferromagnet in which the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering is concomitant with a transition to an insulating state. Here we find that for low electron doping, the magnetic order on the nickel site is preserved, whereas electronically, a new metallic phase is induced. We show that this metallic phase has a Fermi surface that is mostly gapped by an electronic reconstruction driven by bond disproportionation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to write to and read from the spin structure via a large zero-field planar Hall effect. Our results expand the already rich phase diagram of rare-earth nickelates and may enable spintronics applications in this family of correlated oxides. Films of the correlated oxide NdNiO3 form a metallic antiferromagnetic phase that can be identified using electrical currents, raising the prospect of applications in spintronics.},

  abstract     = {Fractional quantum Hall states have long been predicted to be a testing ground of fractional—anyonic—exchange statistics. These topological states, which can have either an Abelian or non-Abelian character, harbour quasiparticles with fractional charges. The charge of the quasiparticles can be measured by shot noise measurements, whereas their quantum statistics can be revealed by appropriate interference experiments. The multipath Fabry–Pérot electronic interferometer is easier to fabricate, but it is often plagued by Coulomb interactions, area breathing with the magnetic field and fluctuating charges. Yet, recent experiments with an adequately screened Fabry–Pérot interferometer allowed the observation of anyonic interference at a bulk filling factor of ν = 1/3. Here we demonstrate the interference and braiding of anyons in an interaction-free two-path Mach–Zehnder interferometer tuned to bulk filling of ν = 2/5 with an outermost ν = 1/3 edge mode. Interference with this mode reveals a phase dependence that corresponds to the predicted anyonic braiding. This proves that a Mach–Zehnder interferometer is a powerful tool that probes the quantum statistics of complex anyonic states. In two-dimensional systems, swapping the position of two indistinguishable particles twice—braiding them—reveals their exchange statistics. Now, a Mach–Zehnder interferometer accomplishes this for anyonic fractional quantum Hall states.},

  abstract     = {Materials that rectify light into current in their bulk are desired for optoelectronic applications. In Weyl semimetals that break inversion symmetry, bulk photocurrents may arise due to nonlinear optical processes that are enhanced near the Weyl nodes. However, the photoresponse of these materials is commonly studied by scanning photocurrent microscopy, which convolves the effects of photocurrent generation and collection. Here we directly image the photocurrent flow inside the type-II Weyl semimetals WTe2 and TaIrTe4 using high-sensitivity quantum magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy centre spins. We elucidate a mechanism for bulk photocurrent generation, which we call the anisotropic photothermoelectric effect, where unequal thermopowers along different crystal axes drive intricate circulations of photocurrent around the photoexcitation. Using overlapping scanning photocurrent microscopy and magnetic imaging at the interior and edges of the sample, we visualize how the anisotropic photothermoelectric effect stimulates the long-range photocurrent collected in our WTe2 and TaIrTe4 devices through the Shockley–Ramo mechanism. Our results highlight a widely relevant source of current flow and will inspire photodetectors that utilize bulk materials with thermoelectric anisotropy. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of photocurrent generation is important for photodetector design. Now, the anisotropy of the thermal properties of Weyl semimetals is shown to generate circulating photocurrents.},

  abstract     = {Tin adatoms on a Si(111) substrate with a one-third monolayer coverage form a two-dimensional triangular lattice with one unpaired electron per site. These electrons order into an antiferromagnetic Mott-insulating state, but doping the Sn layer with holes creates a two-dimensional conductor that becomes superconducting at low temperatures. Although the pairing symmetry of the superconducting state is currently unknown, the combination of repulsive interactions and frustration inherent in the triangular adatom lattice opens up the possibility of a chiral order parameter. Here we study the superconducting state of Sn/Si(111) using scanning tunnelling microscopy, scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and quasiparticle interference imaging. We find evidence for a doping-dependent superconducting critical temperature with a fully gapped order parameter, the presence of time-reversal symmetry breaking and a strong enhancement in zero-bias conductance near the edges of the superconducting domains. Although each individual piece of evidence could have a more mundane interpretation, our combined results suggest the possibility that Sn/Si(111) is an unconventional chiral d-wave superconductor. Adatoms on the surface of silicon can create two-dimensional superconductivity, the order parameter symmetry of which is currently not known. Now, evidence suggests it might be a topological chiral d-wave state.},

  abstract     = {Tuning a material to the cusp between two distinct ground states can produce physical properties that are unlike those in either of the neighbouring phases. Advances in the fabrication and control of quantum systems have raised the tantalizing prospect of artificial quantum simulators that can capture such behaviour. A tunable array of coupled qubits should have an appropriately rich phase diagram, but realizing such a system with either tunnel-coupled semiconductor quantum dots or metal nanostructures has proven difficult. The challenge for scaling up to clusters or lattices is to ensure that each element behaves essentially identically and that the coupling between elements is uniform, while also maintaining tunability of the interactions. Here we study a nanoelectronic circuit comprising two coupled hybrid metal–semiconductor islands, combining the strengths of both materials to form a potentially scalable platform. The semiconductor component allows for controllable inter-site couplings at quantum point contacts, while the metal component’s effective continuum of states means that different sites can be made equivalent by tuning local potentials. The couplings afforded by this architecture can realize an unusual quantum critical point resulting from frustrated Kondo interactions. The observed critical behaviour matches theoretical predictions, verifying the success of our experimental quantum simulation. The quantum critical behaviour of a two-impurity Kondo model variant is observed in a system of hybrid-semiconductor islands that could provide a scalable platform for solid-state quantum simulation},

  abstract     = {Tides are universal and affect spatially distributed systems, ranging from planetary to galactic scales. In the Earth–Moon system, effects caused by lunar tides were reported in the Earth’s crust, oceans, neutral gas-dominated atmosphere (including the ionosphere) and near-ground geomagnetic field. However, whether a lunar tide effect exists in the plasma-dominated regions has not been explored yet. Here we show evidence of a lunar tide-induced signal in the plasmasphere, the inner region of the magnetosphere, which is filled with cold plasma. We obtain these results by analysing variations in the plasmasphere’s boundary location over the past four decades from multisatellite observations. The signal possesses distinct diurnal (and monthly) periodicities, which are different from the semidiurnal (and semimonthly) variations dominant in the previously observed lunar tide effects in other regions. These results demonstrate the importance of lunar tidal effects in plasma-dominated regions, influencing understanding of the coupling between the Moon, atmosphere and magnetosphere system through gravity and electromagnetic forces. Furthermore, these findings may have implications for tidal interactions in other two-body celestial systems. Lunar tides affect Earth’s oceans and its geomagnetic field. Multisatellite observations demonstrate that they also impact the plasmasphere.},

An example is many-body localization, which prevents generic interacting systems from reaching thermal equilibrium even at long times1,2. The stability of the many-body localized phase has been predicted to be hindered by the presence of small thermal inclusions that act as a bath, leading to the delocalization of the entire system through an avalanche propagation mechanism3–8. Here we study the dynamics of a thermal inclusion of variable size when it is coupled to a many-body localized system. We find evidence for accelerated transport of thermal inclusion into the localized region. We monitor how the avalanche spreads through the localized system and thermalizes it site by site by measuring the site-resolved entropy over time. Furthermore, we isolate the strongly correlated bath-induced dynamics with multipoint correlations between the bath and the system. Our results have implications on the robustness of many-body localized systems and their critical behaviour. The presence of small thermal regions in a many-body localized system could lead to its delocalization. An experiment with cold atoms now monitors the delocalization induced by the coupling of a many-body localized region with a thermal bath.},

  abstract     = {Topological solitons commonly appear as energy-minimizing field configurations, but examples of stable, spatially localized objects with coexisting solitonic structures and singular defects are rare. Here we use a nonpolar chiral liquid crystal system to show how twist domain walls can co-self-assemble with vortices to form spatially localized topological objects with spontaneous folding. These soliton–vortex assemblies, which we call ‘möbiusons’, have a topology of the molecular alignment field resembling that of the Möbius strip’s surface and package localized field excitations into folded structures within a confinement-frustrated uniform far-field background. Upon supplying energy in the form of electric pulses, möbiusons with different overall symmetries of structure exhibit folding-dependent rotational and translational motions, as well as topological cargo-carrying abilities that can be controlled by tuning the amplitude and frequency of the applied fields. We demonstrate on-demand transformations between various möbiusons and show examples of encoding information by manipulating folds in such structures. A model based on the energetics of solitons and vortices provides insights into the origins of the folding instability, whereas minimization of the Landau–de Gennes free energy closely reproduces details of their internal structure. Our findings may provide a route towards topology-enabled light-steering designs. Topological defect structures that swim have been realized in liquid crystals. Now, a range of structures with topology reminiscent of a Möbius strip swim and transform into one another.},

  abstract     = {The renormalization group is the cornerstone of the modern theory of universality and phase transitions and it is a powerful tool to scrutinize symmetries and organizational scales in dynamical systems. However, its application to complex networks has proven particularly challenging, owing to correlations between intertwined scales. To date, existing approaches have been based on hidden geometries hypotheses, which rely on the embedding of complex networks into underlying hidden metric spaces. Here we propose a Laplacian renormalization group diffusion-based picture for complex networks, which is able to identify proper spatiotemporal scales in heterogeneous networks. In analogy with real-space renormalization group procedures, we first introduce the concept of Kadanoff supernodes as block nodes across multiple scales, which helps to overcome detrimental small-world effects that are responsible for cross-scale correlations. We then rigorously define the momentum space procedure to progressively integrate out fast diffusion modes and generate coarse-grained graphs. We validate the method through application to several real-world networks, demonstrating its ability to perform network reduction keeping crucial properties of the systems intact. The renormalization group method is routinely employed in studies of criticality in many areas of physics. A framework based on a field theoretical description of information diffusion now extends this tool to the study of complex networks.},

Mackinnon proposed a localized non-dispersive wave packet constructed out of dispersive de Broglie phase waves that possess an intrinsic length scale via an inversion of the roles of particle and observer. So far, the de Broglie–Mackinnon wave packet has remained a theoretical proposal. Here we report the observation of optical de Broglie–Mackinnon wave packets using paraxial space–time-coupled pulsed laser fields in the presence of anomalous group-velocity dispersion. Crucially, the bandwidth of de Broglie–Mackinnon wave packets has an upper limit that is compatible with the wave-packet group velocity and equivalent mass. In contrast to previously observed linear-propagation-invariant wave packets whose spatio-temporal profiles at any axial plane are X-shaped, those for de Broglie–Mackinnon wave packets are uniquely O-shaped (circularly symmetric with respect to space and time). By sculpting their spatio-temporal spectral structure, we produce dispersion-free de Broglie–Mackinnon wave packets in the dispersive medium, observe their circularly symmetric spatio-temporal intensity profiles and closed-trajectory spectra, and tune the field parameters that uniquely determine the wave-packet length scale. de Broglie–Mackinnon wave packets are an extension of matter waves, but have so far remained a theoretical construct.

Here we show that coupled nonlinear optical resonators can undergo self-organization in their spectrum leading to a first-order phase transition. We experimentally demonstrate such a spectral phase transition in time-multiplexed coupled optical parametric oscillators. We switch the nature of mutual coupling from dispersive to dissipative and access distinct spectral regimes of the parametric oscillator dimer. We observe abrupt spectral discontinuity at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, we show how non-equilibrium phase transitions can lead to enhanced sensing, where the applied perturbation is not resolvable by the underlying linear system. Our approach could be exploited for sensing applications that use nonlinear driven-dissipative systems, leading to performance enhancements without sacrificing sensitivity. Dispersive coupling between two optical parametric oscillators induces a first-order phase transition in the system at a critical detuning. This manifests as a discontinuity in the dimer’s spectrum, which may be useful for enhanced sensing.},

  abstract     = {In many contexts, interaction between particles gives rise to emergent phenomena. An example is the fractional quantum Hall effect, where the interaction between electrons leads to fractionally quantized Hall conductance. In photonic systems, the nonlinear response of an ambient medium mediates the interaction between photons, and, in the mean-field limit, these dynamics are described by the nonlinear Schrödinger (also called Gross–Pitaevskii) equation. It was recently shown that at weak nonlinearity, soliton motion in nonlinear Thouless pumps—a dimensionally reduced implementation of a Chern insulator—could be quantized to the Chern number, because solitons track the single-band Wannier function throughout the pumping cycle. Here using arrays of coupled optical waveguides, we show that a sufficiently strong nonlinearity fractionally quantizes the motion of solitons. Specifically, we find that the soliton follows maximally localized multi-band Wannier functions and therefore returns to itself only after multiple cycles of the Thouless pump—but displaced by an integer number of unit cells—leading to a rich fractional plateau structure describing soliton motion. Our results represent an example of emergent behaviour in topologically non-trivial systems in the presence of interactions. Interactions between photons arise due to the presence of optical nonlinearities. In topological Thouless pumps, a sufficiently strong nonlinearity leads to soliton transport with a fractionally quantized plateau structure—reminiscent of transport in the fractional quantum Hall effect.},

  abstract     = {Phonon lasers, which exploit coherent amplifications of phonons, are a means to explore nonlinear phononics, image nanomaterial structures and operate phononic devices. Recently, a phonon laser governed by dispersive optomechanical coupling has been demonstrated by levitating a nanosphere in an optical tweezer. Such levitated optomechanical devices, with minimal noise in high vacuum, can allow flexible control of large-mass objects without any internal discrete energy levels. However, it is challenging to achieve phonon lasing with levitated microscale objects because optical scattering losses are much larger than at the nanoscale. Here we report a nonlinear multi-frequency phonon laser with a micro-size sphere, which is governed by dissipative coupling. The active gain provided by a Yb3+-doped system plays a key role. It achieves three orders of magnitude for the amplitude of the fundamental-mode phonon lasing, compared with the passive device. In addition, nonlinear mechanical harmonics can emerge spontaneously above the lasing threshold. Furthermore, we observe coherent correlations of phonons for both the fundamental mode and its harmonics. Our work drives the field of levitated optomechanics into a regime where it becomes feasible to engineer collective motional properties of typical micro-size objects. Sufficient optical gain provided by Yb3+ doping allows phonon lasing from a levitated optomechanical system at the microscale, which exhibits strong mechanical amplitudes and nonlinear mechanical harmonics above the lasing threshold.},

  abstract     = {Discrete time crystals are non-equilibrium many-body phases of matter characterized by spontaneously broken discrete time-translation symmetry under periodic driving. At sufficiently high driving frequencies, the system enters the Floquet prethermalization regime, in which the periodically driven many-body state has a lifetime vastly exceeding the intrinsic decay time of the system. Here, we report the observation of long-lived prethermal discrete time-crystalline order in a three-dimensional (3D) lattice of 13C nuclei in diamond at room temperature. We demonstrate a two-frequency driving protocol, involving an interleaved application of slow and fast drives that simultaneously prethermalize the spins with an emergent quasi-conserved magnetization along the $${\hat{{{{\bf{x}}}}}}$$ axis. This enables continuous and highly resolved observation of their dynamic evolution. We obtain videos of the time-crystalline response with a clarity and throughput orders of magnitude greater than previous experiments. Parametric control over the drive frequencies allows us to reach time-crystal lifetimes of up to 396 Floquet cycles, which we measure in a single-shot experiment. Such rapid measurement enables detailed characterization of the entire phase diagram, highlighting the role of prethermalization in stabilizing the time-crystal response. The two-frequency drive approach expands the toolkit for investigating non-equilibrium phases of matter stabilized by emergent quasi-conservation laws. Time-crystalline order appears in periodically driven systems with broken time-translation symmetry. Now, a protocol based on pulse drives of different frequencies is used to create and continuously observe time crystals with long lifetimes.},

  abstract     = {Differential geometry has long found applications in physics in general relativity and related areas. More recently, it was proposed by Nielsen that the tools of differential geometry, when applied to the unitary group, might be used to bound the complexity of quantum operations. The Bishop–Gromov bound—a cousin of the focusing lemmas used to prove the Penrose–Hawking black hole singularity theorems—is a differential geometry result that gives an upper bound on the rate of growth of the volume of geodesic balls in terms of the Ricci curvature. Here I apply the Bishop–Gromov bound to Nielsen’s complexity geometry to prove lower bounds on the quantum complexity of a typical unitary. For a broad class of models, the typical complexity is shown to be exponentially large in the number of qubits. This technique gives results that are tighter than all known lower bounds in the literature, as well as establishing lower bounds for a much broader class of complexity geometry metrics than has hitherto been bounded. This method thus realizes the original vision of Nielsen, which was to apply the tools of differential geometry to study quantum complexity. Quantum operations can be considered as points in a high-dimensional space in which distance reflects the similarity of two operations. Applying differential-geometric methods in this picture gives insights into the complexity of quantum systems.},

  abstract     = {Routing quantum information between non-local computational nodes is a foundation for extensible networks of quantum processors. Quantum information transfer between arbitrary nodes is generally mediated either by photons that propagate between them or by resonantly coupling nearby nodes. The utility is determined by the type of emitter, propagation channel and receiver. Conventional approaches involving propagating microwave photons have limited fidelity due to photon loss and are often unidirectional, whereas architectures that use direct resonant coupling are bidirectional in principle but can generally accommodate only a few local nodes. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity, on-demand, directional, microwave photon emission. We do this using an artificial molecule comprising two superconducting qubits strongly coupled to a bidirectional waveguide, effectively creating a chiral microwave waveguide. Quantum interference between the photon emission pathways from the molecule generates single photons that selectively propagate in a chosen direction. This circuit will also be capable of photon absorption, making it suitable for building interconnects within extensible quantum networks. Light could be used to carry quantum information in networks, but this requires methods to prepare and control individual photons. A superconducting circuit can controllably emit photons in either direction along a microwave waveguide.},

  abstract     = {Electron spins in silicon quantum dots are excellent qubits because they have long coherence times and high gate fidelities and are compatible with advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques. For qubits based on single spins, electron spin resonance with real or effective time-varying magnetic fields is the standard method for universal quantum control. Here we show that spin–valley coupling in Si, which drives transitions between states with different spin and valley quantum numbers, enables coherent control of single- and multi-electron spin states without oscillating electromagnetic fields. We demonstrate Rabi oscillations between effective single-spin states in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot that are driven by spin–valley coupling. Together with the exchange coupling between neighbouring electrons, spin–valley coupling also enables universal control of effective two-spin states, driving singlet–triplet and triplet–triplet oscillations that feature coherence times on the order of microseconds. Our results establish spin–valley coupling as a promising mechanism for coherent control of qubits based on electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots. Established methods of controlling silicon spin qubits require high-frequency signals that can be difficult to implement for various reasons. Exploiting the coupling between spin and valley degrees of freedom provides an alternative approach.},

  abstract     = {A strange-metal state appears in many strongly correlated materials, so understanding its nature is a crucial problem in condensed matter physics. This knowledge could provide important insight into high-temperature superconductivity and quantum criticality, but standard Fermi-liquid theory fails in strange metals. Establishing an alternative theory has been a long-standing challenge and fundamental aspects of strange metals—including the nature of their charge carriers—remain elusive. Here we report the observation of a large Nernst response in the strange-metal state in a two-dimensional superconductor 2M-WS2. Specifically, when the system enters the strange-metal state from the Fermi-liquid state, the Nernst coefficient increases to be comparable to the vortex Nernst signal in superconducting cuprates, and it is highly sensitive to carrier mobility. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the Nernst peak rule out the relevance of both Landau quasiparticles and superconductivity. Instead, the Nernst peak at the crossover indicates a change in carrier entropy when entering the strange-metal state. The presence of such an anomalous Nernst response is further confirmed in other iconic strange metals, suggesting its universality and places experimental constraints on the mechanism of strange metals. The transport behaviour of strange metals is distinct from weakly interacting Fermi liquids. Now, a large thermoelectric response has been shown at the transition between those two states.},

  abstract     = {Coulomb drag refers to the phenomenon in which a charge current in one electronic circuit induces a responsive current in a neighbouring circuit solely through Coulomb interactions. For conventional interactions between electrons, the induced drag current in the passive layer is orders of magnitude weaker than the active current due to the strong dielectric screening effect between them. Here we show a Coulomb drag effect between an active normal conductor and a passive superconductor of Josephson junction arrays, where the passive current is of the same order as the active one. The drag force originates from the interactions between the substantially enhanced dynamical quantum fluctuations of the superconducting phases in the passive layer and normal electrons in the active layer. We demonstrate this effect in devices composed of monolayer graphene and LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface. The estimated passive-to-active ratio can reach about 0.3 at the optimal gate voltage and the temperature dependence follows that of the typical Josephson energy between superconducting puddles. From an engineering perspective, our device may work as a current or voltage transformer, and the drag mechanism lays the foundation for synchronizing Josephson-junction-array-based terahertz radiators. Transport measurements between a normal conductor and superconductor show that in this case, the Coulomb drag response can be much larger than that between two normal conductors.},

  abstract     = {In contrast to conventional Fermi liquids where resistivity scales quadratically with temperature, unconventional superconductors usually exhibit a normal-state resistivity that varies as a linear function of temperature (T-linear) in the low-temperature limit. This phenomenon, termed as the strange metal, has been extensively studied in cuprates and is thought to be intimately linked to superconductivity. A quantitative description of its relationship with superconductivity is, therefore, of great importance for developing further theoretical understanding; however, so far, comprehensive studies are scarce due to the difficulties in realizing a systematic control of the superconducting state. Here we report the observation of a typical strange-metal behaviour in FeSe, namely, T-linear resistivity, linear-in-field magnetoresistance and universal scaling of magnetoresistance. More importantly, when we tune the superconductivity by ionic-liquid gating, the superconducting transition temperature increases from approximately 10 to 45 K, and the T-linear resistivity coefficient exhibits a quadratic dependence on the critical temperature. This is a ubiquitous feature that describes the relation between these parameters in various systems including overdoped cuprates and Bechgaard salts. This suggests that there may be a universal mechanism underlying the T-linear resistivity and unconventional superconductivity. Superconductivity can emerge from a strange-metal state, but the exact relationship between them is unknown. Now, quantitative measurements reveal the dependence of resistivity in the strange metal on the superconducting transition temperature.},

Injecting superconducting pairs therefore entails splitting Cooper pairs into two families of helical Andreev states of opposite helicity, one at each hinge. Here we provide evidence for such separation via the measurement and analysis of the switching supercurrent statistics of a crystalline nanoring of bismuth. Using a phenomenological model of two helical Andreev hinge modes, we find that pairs relax at a rate comparable to individual quasiparticles, in contrast to the much faster pair relaxation of non-topological systems. This constitutes a unique telltale sign of the spatial separation of topological helical hinges. Second-order topological insulators feature helical one-dimensional states located at crystal hinges. Running a supercurrent through such systems is now shown to lead to long-lived excited Andreev pairs due to their separation along hinges with opposite helicity.},

Much of the focus of quantum metrology so far has been on generating highly entangled quantum states that offer better sensitivity, per resource, than what can be achieved classically. However, to reach the ultimate limits in multi-parameter quantum metrology and quantum information processing tasks, collective measurements, which generate entanglement between multiple copies of the quantum state, are necessary. Here, we experimentally demonstrate theoretically optimal single- and two-copy collective measurements for simultaneously estimating two non-commuting qubit rotations. This allows us to implement quantum-enhanced sensing, for which the metrological gain persists for high levels of decoherence, and to draw fundamental insights about the interpretation of the uncertainty principle. We implement our optimal measurements on superconducting, trapped-ion and photonic systems, providing an indication of how future quantum-enhanced sensing networks may look. Multi-parameter metrology requires collective measurements on more than one copy of the same quantum state. Now, an optimal scheme for the estimation of qubit rotations has been demonstrated on superconducting and trapped-ion platforms.},

In a proton-proton collision, typically only one parton of each proton undergoes a hard scattering – referred to as single-parton scattering – leaving the remainder of each proton only slightly disturbed. Here, we report the study of double- and triple-parton scatterings through the simultaneous production of three J/ψ mesons, which consist of a charm quark-antiquark pair, in proton-proton collisions recorded with the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. We observed this process – reconstructed through the decays of J/ψ mesons into pairs of oppositely charged muons – with a statistical significance above five standard deviations. We measured the inclusive fiducial cross-section to be $$27{2}_{-104}^{+141}\,{{{\rm{(stat)}}}}\,\pm 17\,{{{\rm{(syst)}}}}\,{{{\rm{fb}}}}\,$$ , and compared it to theoretical expectations for triple-J/ψ meson production in single-, double- and triple-parton scattering scenarios. Assuming factorization of multiple hard-scattering probabilities in terms of single-parton scattering cross-sections, double- and triple-parton scattering are the dominant contributions for the measured process. The CMS Collaboration reports the study of three simultaneous hard interactions between quarks and gluons in proton–proton collisions.

In analogy, three-dimensional topological insulators have been predicted to support charge pumping through their magnetically gapped surface states5–10. But despite its importance as a direct probe of surface Hall conductivity, charge pumping has not been demonstrated in topological-insulator-based systems. Here we report the observation of charge pumping in a thin-film magnetic heterostructure of topological insulators in a geometry that prohibits edge transport. We find that charge pumping occurs between the inner and outer electrodes in response to alternating magnetic fields when the sample is in the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase. The amount of pumped charge is accounted for by the surface Hall conductivity of half the quantum conductance for each surface, from a comparison with the axion insulator phase that shows no charge pumping. Because charge pumping is closely related to the theoretically predicted topological magnetoelectric effect5–10, our observation may provide clues to its direct observation. Quantized charge pumping is a hallmark of topological phases. Now, this effect is observed in the quantum anomalous Hall regime.},

For two-dimensional topological insulators, the determination of thermal Hall (transverse) conductance and thermal longitudinal conductance is crucial for the understanding of topological order in the underlying state. Such measurements have not been accomplished, even in the extensively studied quantum Hall effect regime. Here we report a local power measurement technique that we use to reveal the topological thermal Hall conductance, going beyond the ubiquitous two-terminal conductance. For example, we show that the thermal Hall conductance is approximately zero in the v = 2/3 particle–hole conjugated state. This is in contrast to the two-terminal thermal conductance that gives a non-universal value that depends on the extent of thermal equilibration between the counter-propagating edge modes. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of this technique in studying the power carried by the current fluctuations of a partitioned edge mode with an out-of-equilibrium distribution. Careful thermal transport measurements identify the topological nature of transverse thermal conductance in the fractional quantum Hall regime.},

  abstract     = {The interface between two tissues can have very different bioelectrical properties compared to either tissue on its own. Here we show that an interface between non-excitable tissues can be electrically excitable because of an interaction between the currents passing through the gap junctions—electrically resistive intercellular connections—and the non-linear current–voltage dependence in the ion channels on either side of the interface. Our theory shows that this topologically robust excitability occurs over a far larger range of ion channel expression levels than can support excitability in the bulk. The corresponding interfacial action potentials can cause local elevations in calcium concentration, possibly providing a bioelectrical mechanism for interface sensing. The observed topological action potentials point to the possibility of other types of topological effect in electrophysiology and at other diffusively coupled interfaces. Interfaces between non-excitable tissues can be electrically excitable, suggesting a possible bioelectrical mechanism for interface sensing.},

  abstract     = {The directed migration of cellular clusters enables morphogenesis, wound healing and collective cancer invasion. Gradients of substrate stiffness direct the migration of cellular clusters in a process called collective durotaxis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we unveil a connection between collective durotaxis and the wetting properties of cellular clusters. We show that clusters of cancer cells dewet soft substrates and wet stiff ones. At intermediate stiffness—at the crossover from low to high wettability—clusters on uniform-stiffness substrates become maximally motile, and clusters on stiffness gradients exhibit optimal durotaxis. Durotactic velocity increases with cluster size, stiffness gradient and actomyosin activity. We demonstrate this behaviour on substrates coated with the cell–cell adhesion protein E-cadherin and then establish its generality on substrates coated with extracellular matrix. We develop an active wetting model that explains collective durotaxis in terms of a balance between in-plane active traction and tissue contractility and out-of-plane surface tension. Finally, we show that the distribution of cluster displacements has a heavy tail, with infrequent but large cellular hops that contribute to durotactic migration. Our study demonstrates a physical mechanism of collective durotaxis, through both cell–cell and cell–substrate adhesion ligands, based on the wetting properties of active droplets. Substrate stiffness influences cellular cluster migration through collective durotaxis. Now, the underlying mechanism of this process is explained by considering the wetting dynamics of the clusters.},

  abstract     = {In developing micro- and nanodevices, stiction between their parts, that is, static friction preventing surfaces in contact from moving, is a well-known problem. It is caused by the finite-temperature analogue of the quantum electrodynamical Casimir–Lifshitz forces, which are normally attractive. Repulsive Casimir–Lifshitz forces have been realized experimentally, but their reliance on specialized materials severely limits their applicability and prevents their dynamic control. Here we demonstrate that repulsive critical Casimir forces, which emerge in a critical binary liquid mixture upon approaching the critical temperature, can be used to counteract stiction due to Casimir–Lifshitz forces and actively control microscopic and nanoscopic objects with nanometre precision. Our experiment is conducted on a microscopic gold flake suspended above a flat gold-coated substrate immersed in a critical binary liquid mixture. This may stimulate the development of micro- and nanodevices by preventing stiction as well as by providing active control and precise tunability of the forces acting between their constituent parts. Casimir forces are normally attractive and cause stiction, that is, static friction preventing surfaces in contact from starting to move. Now, a system exhibiting tunable repulsive critical Casimir forces, relevant for the development of micro- and nanodevices, is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Turbulent magnetic reconnection is believed to occur in astrophysical plasmas, and it has been suggested to be a trigger of solar flares. It often occurs in long stretched and fragmented current sheets. Recent observations by the Parker Solar Probe, the Solar Dynamics Observatory and in situ satellite missions agree with signatures expected from turbulent reconnection. However, the underlying mechanisms, including how magnetic energy stored in the Sun’s magnetic field is dissipated, remain unclear. Here we demonstrate turbulent magnetic reconnection in laser-generated plasmas created when irradiating solid targets. Turbulence is generated by strongly driven magnetic reconnection, which fragments the current sheet, and we also observe the formation of multiple magnetic islands and flux-tubes. Our findings reproduce key features of solar flare observations. Supported by kinetic simulations, we reveal the mechanism underlying the electron acceleration in turbulent magnetic reconnection, which is dominated by the parallel electric field, whereas the betatron mechanism plays a cooling role and Fermi acceleration is negligible. As the conditions in our laboratory experiments are scalable to those of astrophysical plasmas, our results are applicable to the study of solar flares. Laboratory experiments reveal the underlying mechanism of turbulent reconnection, including electron acceleration. These findings are directly relevant for studies of flares in the solar corona.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic reconnection rapidly converts magnetic energy into some combination of plasma flow energy, thermal energy and non-thermal energetic particles. Various reconnection acceleration mechanisms have been theoretically proposed and numerically studied in different collisionless and low-β environments, where β refers to the plasma-to-magnetic pressure ratio. These mechanisms include Fermi acceleration, betatron acceleration, parallel electric field acceleration along magnetic fields and direct acceleration by the reconnection electric field. However, none of them have been experimentally confirmed, as the direct observation of non-thermal particle acceleration in laboratory experiments has been difficult due to short Debye lengths for in situ measurements and short mean free paths for ex situ measurements. Here we report the direct measurement of accelerated non-thermal electrons from magnetically driven reconnection at low β in experiments using a laser-powered capacitor coil platform. We use kilojoule lasers to drive parallel currents to reconnect megagauss-level magnetic fields in a quasi-axisymmetric geometry. The angular dependence of the measured electron energy spectrum and the resulting accelerated energies, supported by particle-in-cell simulations, indicate that the mechanism of direct electric field acceleration by the out-of-plane reconnection electric field is at work. Scaled energies using this mechanism show direct relevance to astrophysical observations. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that electrons are accelerated to high energies by the reconnection electric field in magnetically driven reconnection. This mechanism is expected to be relevant for many astrophysical environments.},

Among all processes related to vector-boson scattering, the electroweak production of two jets and a Z-boson pair is a rare and important one. Here we report the observation of this process from proton–proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb−1 recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. We consider two different final states originating from the decays of the Z-boson pair: one containing four charged leptons and another containing two charged leptons and two neutrinos. The hypothesis of no electroweak production is rejected with a statistical significance of 5.7σ, and the measured cross-section for electroweak production is consistent with the Standard Model prediction. In addition, we report cross-sections for inclusive production of a Z-boson pair and two jets for the two final states. The ATLAS Collaboration reports the observation of the electroweak production of two jets and a Z-boson pair. This process is related to vector-boson scattering and allows the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking to be probed.},

  abstract     = {Circular dichroism (CD) describes the different responses of a chiral object to circularly polarized light of opposite handedness and serves as the basis of most chirality-sensitive spectroscopy techniques. All previously observed CD effects originate from the chiral sensitivity of the amplitudes of transition-matrix elements. However, CD effects in the phase of such matrix elements have barely been studied, even theoretically. Here we present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of amplitude- and phase-resolved CDs of continuum–continuum transitions for electron vortices. We employ a circularly polarized attosecond pulse train to prepare electron vortices in the continuum, and a circularly polarized near-infrared laser pulse to probe the chirality of the electron vortices. Our complete experimental reconstruction of the partial-wave amplitudes and phases demonstrates that the photoionization time delays of the continuum–continuum transitions depend not only on the angular-momentum quantum number l of the populated continuum state, but also on its magnetic quantum number m. Our work defines a general technique called attosecond circular-dichroism chronoscopy (ACDC), which can provide new insights into electron-vortex beams, chiral molecules and magnetic materials on the most fundamental timescales. Attosecond circular-dichroism chronoscopy—a spectroscopy technique that employs two circularly polarized pulses in co-rotating and counter-rotating geometries—can measure the amplitudes and phases of continuum–continuum transitions in electron vortices.},

Several methods have been proposed for the analysis of multivariate time series, yet most of them neglect the effect of non-pairwise interactions on the emerging dynamics. Here, we propose a framework to characterize the temporal evolution of higher-order dependencies within multivariate time series. Using network analysis and topology, we show that our framework robustly differentiates various spatiotemporal regimes of coupled chaotic maps. This includes chaotic dynamical phases and various types of synchronization. Hence, using the higher-order co-fluctuation patterns in simulated dynamical processes as a guide, we highlight and quantify signatures of higher-order patterns in data from brain functional activity, financial markets and epidemics. Overall, our approach sheds light on the higher-order organization of multivariate time series, allowing a better characterization of dynamical group dependencies inherent to real-world data. Most temporal analyses of multivariate time series rely on pairwise statistics. A study combining network theory and topological data analysis now shows how to characterize the dynamics of signals at all orders of interactions in real-world data.},

  abstract     = {Using light to control transient phases in quantum materials is an emerging route to engineer new properties and functionality, with both thermal and non-thermal phases observed out of equilibrium. Transient phases are expected to be heterogeneous, either through photo-generated domain growth or by generating topological defects, and this impacts the dynamics of the system. However, this nanoscale heterogeneity has not been directly observed. Here we use time- and spectrally resolved coherent X-ray imaging to track the prototypical light-induced insulator-to-metal phase transition in vanadium dioxide on the nanoscale with femtosecond time resolution. We show that the early-time dynamics are independent of the initial spatial heterogeneity and observe a 200 fs switch to the metallic phase. A heterogeneous response emerges only after hundreds of picoseconds. Through spectroscopic imaging, we reveal that the transient metallic phase is a highly orthorhombically strained rutile metallic phase, an interpretation that is in contrast to those based on spatially averaged probes. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of spatially and spectrally resolved measurements for understanding and interpreting the transient phases of quantum materials. The intermediate states in photo-excited phase transitions are expected to be inhomogeneous. However, ultrafast X-ray imaging shows the early part of the metal–insulator transition in VO2 is homogeneous but then becomes heterogeneous.},

Bosonic stimulation of light scattering was predicted more than 30 years ago but has proven elusive to direct observation. Here we investigate this effect in an ultracold gas of bosons. We show that the bosonic enhancement factor for a harmonically trapped gas is bounded by a universal constant above the phase transition to a Bose–Einstein condensate and depends linearly on the condensate fraction just below the phase transition. We observe bosonic enhanced light scattering both above and below the phase transition, and we show how interactions can alter the bosonic stimulation and optical properties of the gas. Lastly, we demonstrate that, for a multi-level system prepared in a single internal state, the bosonic enhancement is reduced because it occurs only for Rayleigh scattering but not for Raman scattering. In bosonic systems, the presence of particles in a given quantum level can enhance the transition rates into that state, an effect known as bosonic stimulation. Bosonic enhancement of light scattering has now been observed in an ultracold Bose gas.},

Although progress has been made towards terahertz-driven superconductivity and supercurrents, the interactions able to drive non-equilibrium pairing are still poorly understood, partially due to the lack of measurements of high-order correlation functions. In particular, the sensing of exotic collective modes that would uniquely characterize light-driven superconducting coherence, in a way analogous to the Meissner effect, is very challenging but much needed. Here we report the discovery of parametrically driven superconductivity by light-induced order-parameter collective oscillations in iron-based superconductors. The time-periodic relative phase dynamics between the coupled electron and hole bands drives the transition to a distinct parametric superconducting state out-of-equalibrium. This light-induced emergent coherence is characterized by a unique phase–amplitude collective mode with Floquet-like sidebands at twice the Higgs frequency. We measure non-perturbative, high-order correlations of this parametrically driven superconductivity by separating the terahertz-frequency multidimensional coherent spectra into pump–probe, Higgs mode and bi-Higgs frequency sideband peaks. We find that the higher-order bi-Higgs sidebands dominate above the critical field, which indicates the breakdown of susceptibility perturbative expansion in this parametric quantum matter. Multidimensional coherent spectroscopy measurements in iron-based superconductors demonstrate how the coupling between a superconductor and strong light pulses can drive the transition into a non-equilibrium superconducting state with distinct collective modes.},

Here we detect the instantaneous heat release caused by a phase slip in a Josephson junction, signalled by an abrupt increase in the local electronic temperature in the weak link and subsequent relaxation back to equilibrium. Beyond the advance in experimental quantum thermodynamics of observing heat in an elementary quantum process, our approach could allow experimentally investigating the ubiquity of dissipation in quantum devices, particularly in superconducting quantum sensors and qubits. Superconducting currents around a loop containing a weak link can be quantized and only change during discrete events called phase slips.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to certify that an experiment harvests the advantages made possible by generalized measurements, especially beyond the simplest two-level qubit system. Here we show that multiport beamsplitters allow for the robust realization of high-quality generalized measurements in higher-dimensional systems with more than two levels. Using multicore optical fibre technology, we implement a seven-outcome generalized measurement in a four-dimensional Hilbert space with a fidelity of 99.7\%. We present a practical quantum communication task and demonstrate a success rate that cannot be simulated in any conceivable quantum protocol based on standard projective measurements on quantum messages of the same dimension. Our approach, which is compatible with modern photonic platforms, showcases an avenue for faithful and high-quality implementation of genuinely non-projective quantum measurements beyond qubit systems. Generalized measurements that do not correspond to conventional basis projections of the quantum wavefunction are a part of several important protocols in quantum information. These measurements can be certifiably performed on higher-dimensional systems using optical fibre technology.},

A long-standing open problem has been to establish a true second law of entanglement, and in particular a unique function that governs all transformations between entangled systems, mirroring the role of entropy in thermodynamics. Contrary to previous promising evidence, here we show that this is impossible and that no direct counterpart to the second law of thermodynamics can be established. This is accomplished by demonstrating the irreversibility of entanglement theory from first principles. Assuming only the most general microscopic physical constraints of entanglement manipulation, we show that entanglement theory is irreversible under all non-entangling transformations. We furthermore rule out reversibility without significant entanglement expenditure, showing that reversible entanglement transformations require the generation of macroscopically large amounts of entanglement according to certain measures. Our results not only reveal fundamental differences between quantum entanglement transformations and thermodynamic processes, but also showcase a unique property of entanglement that distinguishes it from other known quantum resources. A formal analysis of the physical limits of entanglement manipulation shows that it cannot be done reversibly, highlighting an important difference from thermodynamics.},

  abstract     = {Animal organs exhibit complex topologies involving cavities and tubular networks, which underlie their form and function1–3. However, how topology emerges during the development of organ shape, or morphogenesis, remains elusive. Here we combine tissue reconstitution and quantitative microscopy to show that tissue topology and shape is governed by two distinct modes of topological transitions4,5. One mode involves the fusion of two separate epithelia and the other involves the fusion of two ends of the same epithelium. The morphological space is captured by a single control parameter that can be traced back to the relative rates of the two epithelial fusion modes. Finally, we identify a pharmacologically accessible pathway that regulates the frequency of two modes of epithelial fusion, and demonstrate the control of organoid topology and shape. The physical principles uncovered here provide fundamental insights into the self-organization of complex tissues6. During development, tissues with complex topology emerge from collections of cells with simple geometry. This process in neuroepithelial organoids is governed by two topologically distinct modes of epithelial fusion.},

  abstract     = {Interactions of quantum materials with strong laser fields can induce exotic non-equilibrium electronic states1–6. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, a new class of direct-gap semiconductors with prominent quantum confinement7, offer exceptional opportunities for the Floquet engineering of excitons, which are quasiparticle electron–hole correlated states8. Strong-field driving has the potential to achieve enhanced control of the electronic band structure and thus the possibility of opening a new realm of exciton light–matter interactions. However, a full characterization of strong-field driven exciton dynamics4,9 has been difficult. Here we use mid-infrared laser pulses below the optical bandgap to excite monolayer tungsten disulfide and demonstrate strong-field light dressing of excitons in excess of a hundred millielectronvolts. Our high-sensitivity transient absorption spectroscopy further reveals the formation of a virtual absorption feature below the 1s-exciton resonance, which we assign to a light-dressed sideband from the dark 2p-exciton state. Quantum-mechanical simulations substantiate the experimental results and enable us to retrieve real-space movies of the exciton dynamics. This study advances our understanding of the exciton dynamics in the strong-field regime, showing the possibility of harnessing ultrafast, strong-field phenomena in device applications of two-dimensional materials. The interaction of strong laser fields with tungsten disulfide leads to light-dressed Floquet replica of excitonic states, which manifest as new features in the transient absorption spectrum.},

  abstract     = {Epithelia act as barriers against environmental stresses. They are continuously exposed to various mechanical stress and abrasion, which impact epithelial integrity. The impact of the environment on epithelial integrity remains elusive. By culturing epithelial cells on two-dimensional hydrogels, we observe a loss of epithelial monolayer integrity on soft substrates through spontaneous hole formation. These monolayer ruptures are associated with local cellular stretching and cell-division events. Substrate stiffness triggers an unanticipated mechanical switch of epithelial monolayers from compressive stress on stiff substrates to highly tensile on soft, favouring hole formation. In agreement with an active nematic model, hole-opening events occur preferentially near spontaneous half-integer topological defects, which underpin large isotropic stress fluctuations triggering stochastic mechanical failure. Our results thus show that substrate stiffness provides feedback on the mechanical state of epithelial monolayers with potential application towards a mechanistic understanding of compromised epithelial integrity during normal and pathological human ontogenesis. On soft substrates, epithelial tissues are under high tension and form holes that spontaneously heal. Thus, mechanical stress directly impacts the integrity of epithelia.},

Here we implement a resource-efficient construction for a quantum version of AND logic that can reduce the compilation overhead, enabling the execution of key quantum circuits. On a high-scalability superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate low-depth synthesis of high-fidelity generalized Toffoli gates with up to 8 qubits and Grover’s search algorithm in a search space of up to 64 entries. Our experimental demonstration illustrates a scalable and widely applicable approach to implementing quantum algorithms, bringing more meaningful quantum applications on noisy devices within reach. To run algorithms on a computer they are broken down into logical operations that are implemented in hardware. A quantum logical AND gate has now been demonstrated, which could substantially improve the efficiency of near-term quantum computers.},

  abstract     = {Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is a recently discovered form of weak ergodicity breaking in strongly interacting quantum systems, which presents opportunities for mitigating thermalization-induced decoherence in quantum information processing applications. However, the existing experimental realizations of QMBS are based on systems with specific kinetic constrains. Here we experimentally realize a distinct kind of QMBS by approximately decoupling a part of the many-body Hilbert space in the computational basis. Utilizing a programmable superconducting processor with 30 qubits and tunable couplings, we realize Hilbert space scarring in a non-constrained model in different geometries, including a linear chain and quasi-one-dimensional comb geometry. By reconstructing the full quantum state through quantum state tomography on four-qubit subsystems, we provide strong evidence for QMBS states by measuring qubit population dynamics, quantum fidelity and entanglement entropy after a quench from initial unentangled states. Our experimental findings broaden the realm of scarring mechanisms and identify correlations in QMBS states for quantum technology applications. Many-body quantum systems that escape thermalization are promising candidates for quantum information applications. A weak-ergodicity-breaking mechanism—quantum scarring—has now been observed with superconducting qubits in unconstrained models.},

  abstract     = {The conventional understanding of the glass transition is that the transition from glass to liquid appears as a dynamic process in which atoms or molecules relax cooperatively into the equilibrium phase. Here we show that—in contrast to this picture—isolated regions of liquid form within the glassy matrix and the nature of the glass transition at a given temperature depends on the ratio between the relaxation time of the glass, τglass, and the alpha relaxation time of the equilibrated liquid, τα. At temperatures at which τglass/τα is large, we observe that high-mobility regions transit directly into the equilibrated liquid and subsequently grow by dynamic facilitation before—or while—cooperative glass relaxation sets into play. On the contrary, at temperatures associated with smaller τglass/τα, the glass transition proceeds by cooperative relaxation dynamics throughout the material. This behaviour is independent of the experimental procedure or protocol used to produce the glass. The transition from a glassy to a liquid phase is normally assumed to take place cooperatively across the whole material. But now, experiments show that, under certain conditions, isolated regions of liquid can form in the glassy matrix first.},

  abstract     = {The investigation of two-dimensional atomically thin superconductors—especially those hosting topological states—attracts growing interest in condensed-matter physics. Here we report the observation of spin–orbit–parity coupled superconducting state in centrosymmetric atomically thin 2M-WS2, a material that has been predicted to exhibit topological band inversions. Our magnetotransport measurements show that the in-plane upper critical field not only exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit but also exhibits a strongly anisotropic two-fold symmetry in response to the in-plane magnetic field direction. Furthermore, tunnelling spectroscopy measurements conducted under high in-plane magnetic fields reveal that the superconducting gap possesses an anisotropic magnetic response along different in-plane magnetic field directions, and it persists much above the Pauli limit. Self-consistent mean-field calculations show that this unusual behaviour originates from the strong spin–orbit–parity coupling arising from the topological band inversion in 2M-WS2, which effectively pins the spin of states near the topological band crossing and gives rise to an anisotropic renormalization of the effect of external Zeeman fields. Our results identify the unconventional superconductivity in atomically thin 2M-WS2, which serves as a promising platform for exploring the interplay between superconductivity, topology and strong spin–orbit–parity coupling. A form of superconductivity where strong spin–orbit coupling combines with topological band inversions to produce strong robustness against magnetic fields is shown in a few-layer transition metal dichalcogenide.},

  abstract     = {Theories of the origin of superconductivity in cuprates depend on an understanding of their normal state, which exhibits various competing orders. Transport and thermodynamic measurements on La2 − xSrxCuO4 show signatures of a quantum critical point and the associated fluctuations, including a peak in the electronic specific heat versus doping, near the doping p* where the pseudogap collapses. The fundamental nature of these quantum fluctuations is unclear. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering to show that, close to the superconducting critical temperature and near p*, there are very-low-energy collective spin excitations with characteristic energies of ~5 meV. Cooling and applying a magnetic field creates a mixed state with a stronger magnetic response below 10 meV. We conclude that the low-energy spin fluctuations are due to the collapse of the pseudogap combined with an underlying tendency to magnetic order. We show that the large specific heat near p* can be understood in terms of collective spin fluctuations. The spin fluctuations we measure exist across the superconducting phase diagram and may be related to the strange metal behaviour observed in overdoped cuprates. Various features of the behaviour in the cuprates near where the pseudogap collapses are caused by quantum fluctuations. Now, neutron scattering experiments suggest that very-low-energy collective spin excitations are the cause.},

  abstract     = {Crystal structures with degenerate electronic orbitals are unstable towards lattice distortions that lift the degeneracy. Although these Jahn–Teller distortions have profound effects on magnetism, they are typically unaffected by the onset of magnetic ordering because of a separation in energy scales. Here we show the contrary case in Pr2Zr2O7, where orbital degeneracy remains down to the millikelvin range due to an interplay between spins and orbitals. Pr2Zr2O7 is a multipolar spin ice with strongly localized 4f electrons in an even-number configuration, giving rise to a non-Kramers doublet that carries transverse quadrupolar and longitudinal dipolar moments. Our study of ultrapure single crystals of Pr2Zr2O7 finds comprehensive evidence for enhanced spin–orbital quantum dynamics of the non-Kramers doublet. This dynamical Jahn–Teller effect is encapsulated by the liquid–gas metamagnetic transition that is characteristic of spin ice being accompanied by strong lattice softening. This behaviour suggests that a spin–orbital liquid state forms on the pyrochlore lattice at low temperatures and low magnetic fields. At low temperatures, the orbital degrees of freedom in insulating magnets normally do not fluctuate, leaving only magnetic behaviour. Measurements now suggest that in Pr2Zr2O7, it is possible to reach a quantum regime of coupled spin–orbital dynamics.},

Here we demonstrate a versatile quantum microscope using point defects embedded within a thin layer of the van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride. To showcase the multi-modal capabilities of this platform, we assemble two different heterostructures of a van der Waals material in combination with a quantum-active boron nitride flake. We demonstrate time-resolved, simultaneous temperature and magnetic imaging near the Curie temperature of a van der Waals ferromagnet, as well as map out charge currents and Joule heating in an operating graphene device. The straightforward integration of the hexagonal boron nitride quantum sensor with other van der Waals materials will yield substantial practical benefits for the design and measurement of 2D devices. Hexagonal boron nitride is a common component of 2D heterostructures. Defects implanted in boron nitride crystals can be used to perform spatially resolved sensing of properties, including temperature, magnetism and current.},

Under suitable interplanetary magnetic field conditions, a foreshock with intense wave activity forms upstream of the bow shock. So-called 30 s waves, named after their typical period at Earth, are the dominant wave mode in the foreshock and play an important role in modulating the shape of the shock front and affect particle reflection at the shock. These waves are also observed inside the magnetosphere and down to the Earth’s surface, but how they are transmitted through the bow shock remains unknown. By combining state-of-the-art global numerical simulations and spacecraft observations, we demonstrate that the interaction of foreshock waves with the shock generates earthward-propagating, fast-mode waves, which reach the magnetosphere. These findings give crucial insight into the interaction of waves with collisionless shocks in general and their impact on the downstream medium. The Earth’s bow shock results from the interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial magnetic field. With global numerical simulations and spacecraft observations, the transmission of fast magnetosonic waves through the bow shock is revealed.},

  abstract     = {At the National Ignition Facility, inertial confinement fusion experiments aim to burn and ignite a hydrogen plasma to generate a net source of energy through the fusion of deuterium and tritium ions. The energy deposited by α-particles released from the deuterium–tritium fusion reaction plays the central role in heating the fuel to achieve a sustained thermonuclear burn. In the hydrodynamic picture, α-heating increases the temperature of the plasma, leading to increased reactivity because the mean ion kinetic energy increases. Therefore, the ion temperature is related to the mean ion kinetic energy. Here we use the moments of the neutron spectrum to study the relationship between the ion temperature (measured by the variance in the neutron kinetic energy spectrum) and the ion mean kinetic energy (measured by the shift in the mean neutron energy). We observe a departure from the relationship expected for plasmas where the ion relative kinetic energy distribution is Maxwell–Boltzmann, when the plasma begins to burn. Understanding the cause of this departure from hydrodynamic behaviour could be important for achieving robust and reproducible ignition. Inertial confinement fusion experiments reveal a departure from the expected hydrodynamic behaviour of a plasma when the fusion reactions become the primary source of plasma heating.},

On Earth, the only way to produce and study antinuclei with high precision is to create them at high-energy particle accelerators. Although the properties of elementary antiparticles have been studied in detail, the knowledge of the interaction of light antinuclei with matter is limited. We determine the disappearance probability of $${}^{3}\overline{{{{\rm{He}}}}}$$ when it encounters matter particles and annihilates or disintegrates within the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. We extract the inelastic interaction cross section, which is then used as an input to the calculations of the transparency of our Galaxy to the propagation of $${}^{3}\overline{{{{\rm{He}}}}}$$ stemming from dark-matter annihilation and cosmic-ray interactions within the interstellar medium. For a specific dark-matter profile, we estimate a transparency of about 50\%, whereas it varies with increasing $${}^{3}\overline{{{{\rm{He}}}}}$$ momentum from 25\% to 90\% for cosmic-ray sources. The results indicate that $${}^{3}\overline{{{{\rm{He}}}}}$$ nuclei can travel long distances in the Galaxy, and can be used to study cosmic-ray interactions and dark-matter annihilation. Measurements of the inelastic cross section of anti-3He allow the estimation of the transparency of the Milky Way to the propagation of these light antinuclei produced in either cosmic-ray collisions or annihilation of dark-matter particles.},

  abstract     = {Statistical mechanics can describe the major conformational ensembles determining the equilibrium free-energy landscape of a folding protein. The challenge is to capture the full repertoire of low-occurrence conformations separated by high kinetic barriers that define complex landscapes. Computationally, enhanced sampling methods accelerate the exploration of molecular rare events. However, accessing the entire protein’s conformational space in equilibrium experiments requires technological developments to enable extended observation times. We used single-molecule magnetic tweezers to capture over a million individual transitions as a single talin protein unfolds and refolds under force in equilibrium. When observed at classically probed timescales, talin folds in an apparently uncomplicated two-state manner. As the sampling time extends from minutes to days, the underlying energy landscape exhibits gradually larger signatures of complexity, involving a finite number of well-defined rare conformations. Fluctuation analysis allows us to propose plausible structures of each low-probability conformational state. The physiological relevance of each distinct conformation can be connected to the binding of the cytoskeletal protein vinculin, suggesting an extra layer of complexity in talin-mediated mechanotransduction. More generally, our experiments directly test the fundamental notion that equilibrium dynamics depend on the observation timescale. Single-molecule magnetic tweezers enable probing the folding dynamics of a single talin protein for long periods of time. This allows the observation of previously inaccessible rare and kinetically trapped conformations.},

This shape-preserving property and the intrinsic non-equilibrium nature make active solids an attractive potential component for self-driven devices, but their mechanical properties and emergent behaviour remain poorly understood. Here, using a biofilm-based living active solid, we observe self-sustained elastic waves with wave properties not seen in passive solids, such as power-law scaling of wave speed with activity. Under isotropic confinement, the active solid develops two topologically distinct global motion modes that can be selectively excited, with a step-like frequency jump at the transition between the two modes. Our findings reveal spatiotemporal order in elastic active matter and may guide the development of solid-state adaptive or living materials. A continuum active solid system is realized in a bacterial biofilm. Self-sustained elastic waves are observed, and two modes of collective motion with a sharp transition between them are identified.},

  abstract     = {Although the concept of the Luttinger liquid (LL) describing a one-dimensional (1D) interacting fermion system1,2 collapses at higher dimensions, it has been proposed to be relevant to enigmatic problems in condensed matter physics including the normal state of cuprate superconductors3–5, unconventional metals6,7 and quantum criticality8,9. Here we investigate the electronic structure of quasi-2D η-Mo4O11, a charge-density wave material, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. We show a prototypical LL behaviour originating from the crossed quasi-1D chain arrays hidden in the quasi-2D crystal structure. Our results suggest that η-Mo4O11 materializes the crossed LL phase10–12 in its normal state, where the orthogonal orbital components substantially reduce the coupling between intersecting quasi-1D chains and therefore maintain the essential properties of the LL. Our finding not only presents a realization of a 2D LL, but also provides a new angle to understand non-Fermi liquid behaviour in other 2D and 3D quantum materials. The Luttinger liquid is a theoretical concept used to describe interacting fermions in a 1D system. Now it is shown that the model also describes electron physics in η-Mo4O11, a quasi-2D material in which 1D chains cross each other.},

  abstract     = {Chirality is a manifestation of the asymmetry inherent in nature. It has been defined as the symmetry breaking of the parity of static objects, and the definition was extended to dynamic motion such that true and false chiralities were distinguished. Recently, rotating, yet not propagating, atomic motions were predicted and observed in two-dimensional materials, and they were referred to as ‘chiral phonons’. A natural development would be the discovery of truly chiral phonons that propagate while rotating in three-dimensional materials. Here we used circularly polarized Raman scattering and first-principles calculations to identify truly chiral phonons in chiral bulk crystals. This approach enabled us to determine the chirality of a crystal in a non-contact and non-destructive manner. In addition, we demonstrated that the law of the conservation of pseudo-angular momentum holds between circularly polarized photons and chiral phonons. These findings are expected to help develop ways for transferring the pseudo-angular momentum from photons to electron spins via propagating chiral phonons in opto-phononic-spintronic devices. The notion of chirality in dynamical systems with broken spatial symmetry but preserved time inversion symmetry has led to the concept of truly chiral phonons. These have now been observed in bulk HgS using circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {When a quantum system undergoes slow changes, the evolution of its state depends only on the corresponding trajectory in Hilbert space. This phenomenon, known as quantum holonomy, brings to light the geometric aspects of quantum theory. Depending on the number of degrees of freedom involved, these purely geometric entities can be scalar or belong to a matrix-valued symmetry group. In their various forms, holonomies are vital elements in the description of the fundamental forces in particle physics as well as theories beyond the standard model such as loop quantum gravity or topological quantum field theory. Yet, implementing matrix-valued holonomies thus far has proven challenging, being further complicated by the difficulties involved in identifying suitable dark states for their construction in bosonic systems. Here we develop a representation of holonomic theory founded on the Heisenberg picture and leverage these insights for the experimental realization of a three-dimensional quantum holonomy. Its non-Abelian geometric phase is implemented via the judicious manipulation of bosonic modes constructed from indistinguishable photons and obeys the U(3) symmetry relevant to the strong interaction. Our findings could enable the experimental study of higher-dimensional non-Abelian gauge symmetries and the exploration of exotic physics on a photonic chip. Photonic waveguides with appropriately engineered interactions allow the experimental realization of non-Abelian quantum holonomies of the symmetry group U(3), which is known from the strong nuclear force.},

  abstract     = {Comparisons of high-accuracy optical atomic clocks1 are essential for precision tests of fundamental physics2, relativistic geodesy3–5 and the anticipated redefinition of the second by the International System of Units6. The scientific reach of these applications is restricted by the statistical precision of comparison measurements between clocks realized with different atomic species. The instability of individual clocks is limited by the finite coherence time of the optical local oscillator, which bounds the maximum atomic interrogation time. Here we experimentally demonstrate differential spectroscopy7, a comparison protocol that enables interrogating times beyond the optical local oscillator coherence time. By phase coherently linking a zero-dead-time8 Yb optical lattice clock with an Al+ single-ion clock via an optical frequency comb and performing synchronized Ramsey spectroscopy, we show an improvement in comparison instability relative to previous results9 of nearly an order of magnitude. This result represents one of the most stable interspecies clock comparisons to date. Interspecies comparisons between atomic optical clocks are important for several technological applications. A recently proposed spectroscopy technique extends the interrogation times of clocks, leading to highly stable comparison between species.},
