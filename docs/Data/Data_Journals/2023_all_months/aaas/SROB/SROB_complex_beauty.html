  abstract     = {Limbless locomotors, from microscopic worms to macroscopic snakes, traverse complex, heterogeneous natural environments typically using undulatory body wave propagation. Theoretical and robophysical models typically emphasize body kinematics and active neural/electronic control. However, we contend that because such approaches often neglect the role of passive, mechanically controlled processes (those involving “mechanical intelligence”), they fail to reproduce the performance of even the simplest organisms. To uncover principles of how mechanical intelligence aids limbless locomotion in heterogeneous terradynamic regimes, here we conduct a comparative study of locomotion in a model of heterogeneous terrain (lattices of rigid posts). We used a model biological system, the highly studied nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans , and a robophysical device whose bilateral actuator morphology models that of limbless organisms across scales. The robot’s kinematics quantitatively reproduced the performance of the nematodes with purely open-loop control; mechanical intelligence simplified control of obstacle navigation and exploitation by reducing the need for active sensing and feedback. An active behavior observed in C. elegans , undulatory wave reversal upon head collisions, robustified locomotion via exploitation of the systems’ mechanical intelligence. Our study provides insights into how neurally simple limbless organisms like nematodes can leverage mechanical intelligence via appropriately tuned bilateral actuation to locomote in complex environments. These principles likely apply to neurally more sophisticated organisms and also provide a design and control paradigm for limbless robots for applications like search and rescue and planetary exploration.},

  abstract     = {Extra robotic arms (XRAs) are gaining interest in neuroscience and robotics, offering potential tools for daily activities. However, this compelling opportunity poses new challenges for sensorimotor control strategies and human-machine interfaces (HMIs). A key unsolved challenge is allowing users to proficiently control XRAs without hindering their existing functions. To address this, we propose a pipeline to identify suitable HMIs given a defined task to accomplish with the XRA. Following such a scheme, we assessed a multimodal motor HMI based on gaze detection and diaphragmatic respiration in a purposely designed modular neurorobotic platform integrating virtual reality and a bilateral upper limb exoskeleton. Our results show that the proposed HMI does not interfere with speaking or visual exploration and that it can be used to control an extra virtual arm independently from the biological ones or in coordination with them. Participants showed significant improvements in performance with daily training and retention of learning, with no further improvements when artificial haptic feedback was provided. As a final proof of concept, naïve and experienced participants used a simplified version of the HMI to control a wearable XRA. Our analysis indicates how the presented HMI can be effectively used to control XRAs. The observation that experienced users achieved a success rate 22.2\% higher than that of naïve users, combined with the result that naïve users showed average success rates of 74\% when they first engaged with the system, endorses the viability of both the virtual reality–based testing and training and the proposed pipeline.},

  abstract     = {The morphology of a robot is typically assumed to be known, and data from external measuring devices are used mainly for its kinematic calibration. In contrast, we take an agent-centric perspective and ponder the vaguely explored question of whether a robot could learn elements of its morphology by itself, relying on minimal prior knowledge and depending only on unorganized proprioceptive signals. To answer this question, we propose a mutual information–based representation of the relationships between the proprioceptive signals of a robot, which we call proprioceptive information graphs (π-graphs). Leveraging the fact that the information structure of the sensorimotor apparatus is dependent on the embodiment of the robot, we use the π-graph to look for pairwise signal relationships that reflect the underlying kinematic first-order principles applicable to the robot’s structure. In our discussion, we show that analysis of the π-graph leads to the inference of two fundamental elements of the robot morphology: its mechanical topology and corresponding kinematic description, that is, the location and orientation of the robot’s joints. Results from a robot manipulator, a hexapod, and a humanoid robot show that the correct topology and kinematic description can be effectively inferred from their π-graph either offline or online, regardless of the number of links and body configuration.},

  abstract     = {A flexible spine is critical to the motion capability of most animals and plays a pivotal role in their agility. Although state-of-the-art legged robots have already achieved very dynamic and agile movement solely relying on their legs, they still exhibit the type of stiff movement that compromises movement efficiency. The integration of a flexible spine thus appears to be a promising approach to improve their agility, especially for small and underactuated quadruped robots that are underpowered because of size limitations. Here, we show that the lateral flexion of a compliant spine can promote both walking speed and maneuver agility for a neurorobotic mouse (NeRmo). We present NeRmo as a biomimetic robotic mouse that mimics the morphology of biological mice and their muscle-tendon actuation system. First, by leveraging the lateral flexion of the compliant spine, NeRmo can greatly increase its static stability in an initially unstable configuration by adjusting its posture. Second, the lateral flexion of the spine can also effectively extend the stride length of a gait and therefore improve the walking speeds of NeRmo. Finally, NeRmo shows agile maneuvers that require both a small turning radius and fast walking speed with the help of the spine. These results advance our understanding of spine-based quadruped locomotion skills and highlight promising design concepts to develop more agile legged robots.},

By making use of externally controlled temperature and ultraviolet (UV) light, our programmable robot, ~100 nanometers in size, grabs different parts, positions and aligns them so that they can be welded, releases the construct, and returns to its original configuration ready for its next operation. Our robot can also self-replicate its 3D structure and functions, surpassing single-step templating (restricted to two dimensions) by using folding to access the third dimension and more degrees of freedom. Our introduction of multiple-axis precise folding and positioning as a tool/technology for nanomanufacturing will open the door to more complex and useful nano- and microdevices.},

  abstract     = {In early 2016, we had the opportunity to test a pair of sprawling posture robots, one designed to mimic a crocodile and another designed to mimic a monitor lizard, along the banks of the Nile River in Uganda, Africa. These robots were developed uniquely for a documentary by the BBC called Spy in the Wild and fell at the intersection of our interests in developing robots to study animals and robots for disaster response and other missions in challenging environments. The documentary required that these robots not only walk and swim in the same harsh, natural environments as the animals that they were modeled on and film up close but also move and even look exactly like the real animals from an aesthetic perspective. This pushed us to take a fundamentally different approach to the design and building of biorobots compared with our typical laboratory-residing robots, in addition to collaborating with sculpting artists to enhance our robots’ aesthetics. The robots needed to be designed on the basis of a systematic study of data on the model specimens, be fabricated rapidly, and be reliable and robust enough to handle what the wild would throw at them. Here, we share the research efforts of this collaboration, the design specifications of the robots’ hardware and software, the lessons learned from testing these robots in the field first hand, and how the eye-opening experience shaped our subsequent work on disaster response robotics and biorobotics for challenging amphibious scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Octopuses can whip their soft arms with a characteristic “bend propagation” motion to capture prey with sensitive suckers. This relatively simple strategy provides models for robotic grasping, controllable with a small number of inputs, and a highly deformable arm with sensing capabilities. Here, we implemented an electronics-integrated soft octopus arm (E-SOAM) capable of reaching, sensing, grasping, and interacting in a large domain. On the basis of the biological bend propagation of octopuses, E-SOAM uses a bending-elongation propagation model to move, reach, and grasp in a simple but efficient way. E-SOAM’s distal part plays the role of a gripper and can process bending, suction, and temperature sensory information under highly deformed working states by integrating a stretchable, liquid-metal–based electronic circuit that can withstand uniaxial stretching of 710\% and biaxial stretching of 270\% to autonomously perform tasks in a confined environment. By combining this sensorized distal part with a soft arm, the E-SOAM can perform a reaching-grasping-withdrawing motion across a range up to 1.5 times its original arm length, similar to the biological counterpart. Through a wearable finger glove that produces suction sensations, a human can use just one finger to remotely and interactively control the robot’s in-plane and out-of-plane reaching and grasping both in air and underwater. E-SOAM’s results not only contribute to our understanding of the function of the motion of an octopus arm but also provide design insights into creating stretchable electronics-integrated bioinspired autonomous systems that can interact with humans and their environments.},

  abstract     = {From quadrotors delivering packages in urban areas to robot arms moving in confined warehouses, motion planning around obstacles is a core challenge in modern robotics. Planners based on optimization can design trajectories in high-dimensional spaces while satisfying the robot dynamics. However, in the presence of obstacles, these optimization problems become nonconvex and very hard to solve, even just locally. Thus, when facing cluttered environments, roboticists typically fall back to sampling-based planners that do not scale equally well to high dimensions and struggle with continuous differential constraints. Here, we present a framework that enables convex optimization to efficiently and reliably plan trajectories around obstacles. Specifically, we focus on collision-free motion planning with costs and constraints on the shape, the duration, and the velocity of the trajectory. Using recent techniques for finding shortest paths in Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS), we design a practical convex relaxation of the planning problem. We show that this relaxation is typically very tight, to the point that a cheap postprocessing of its solution is almost always sufficient to identify a collision-free trajectory that is globally optimal (within the parameterized class of curves). Through numerical and hardware experiments, we demonstrate that our planner, which we name GCS, can find better trajectories in less time than widely used sampling-based algorithms and can reliably design trajectories in high-dimensional complex environments.},

  abstract     = {An overreliance on the less-affected limb for functional tasks at the expense of the paretic limb and in spite of recovered capacity is an often-observed phenomenon in survivors of hemispheric stroke. The difference between capacity for use and actual spontaneous use is referred to as arm nonuse. Obtaining an ecologically valid evaluation of arm nonuse is challenging because it requires the observation of spontaneous arm choice for different tasks, which can easily be influenced by instructions, presumed expectations, and awareness that one is being tested. To better quantify arm nonuse, we developed the bimanual arm reaching test with a robot (BARTR) for quantitatively assessing arm nonuse in chronic stroke survivors. The BARTR is an instrument that uses a robot arm as a means of remote and unbiased data collection of nuanced spatial data for clinical evaluations of arm nonuse. This approach shows promise for determining the efficacy of interventions designed to reduce paretic arm nonuse and enhance functional recovery after stroke. We show that the BARTR satisfies the criteria of an appropriate metric for neurorehabilitative contexts: It is valid, reliable, and simple to use.},

  abstract     = {In-hand object reorientation is necessary for performing many dexterous manipulation tasks, such as tool use in less structured environments, which remain beyond the reach of current robots. Prior works built reorientation systems assuming one or many of the following conditions: reorienting only specific objects with simple shapes, limited range of reorientation, slow or quasi-static manipulation, simulation-only results, the need for specialized and costly sensor suites, and other constraints that make the system infeasible for real-world deployment. We present a general object reorientation controller that does not make these assumptions. It uses readings from a single commodity depth camera to dynamically reorient complex and new object shapes by any rotation in real time, with the median reorientation time being close to 7 seconds. The controller was trained using reinforcement learning in simulation and evaluated in the real world on new object shapes not used for training, including the most challenging scenario of reorienting objects held in the air by a downward-facing hand that must counteract gravity during reorientation. Our hardware platform only used open-source components that cost less than 5000 dollars. Although we demonstrate the ability to overcome assumptions in prior work, there is ample scope for improving absolute performance. For instance, the challenging duck-shaped object not used for training was dropped in 56\% of the trials. When it was not dropped, our controller reoriented the object within 0.4 radians (23°) 75\% of the time.},

Toward these ends, we present a robotic construction pipeline that is capable of planning and building freeform stone walls and landscapes from highly heterogeneous local materials using a robotic excavator equipped with a shovel and gripper. Our system learns from real and simulated data to facilitate the online detection and segmentation of stone instances in spatial maps, enabling robotic grasping and textured 3D scanning of individual stones and rubble elements. Given a limited inventory of these digitized stones, our geometric planning algorithm uses a combination of constrained registration and signed-distance-field classification to determine how these should be positioned toward the formation of stable and explicitly shaped structures. We present a holistic approach for the robotic manipulation of complex objects toward dry stone construction and use the same hardware and mapping to facilitate autonomous terrain-shaping on a single construction site. Our process is demonstrated with the construction of a freestanding stone wall (10 meters by 1.7 meters by 4 meters) and a permanent retaining wall (65.5 meters by 1.8 meters by 6 meters) that is integrated with robotically contoured terraces (665 square meters).

  abstract     = {One challenge to achieving widespread success of augmentative exoskeletons is accurately adjusting the controller to provide cooperative assistance with their wearer. Often, the controller parameters are “tuned” to optimize a physiological or biomechanical objective. However, these approaches are resource intensive, while typically only enabling optimization of a single objective. In reality, the exoskeleton user experience is likely derived from many factors, including comfort, fatigue, and stability, among others. This work introduces an approach to conveniently tune the four parameters of an exoskeleton controller to maximize user preference. Our overarching strategy is to leverage the wearer to internally balance the experiential factors of wearing the system. We used an evolutionary algorithm to recommend potential parameters, which were ranked by a neural network that was pretrained with previously collected user preference data. The controller parameters that had the highest preference ranking were provided to the exoskeleton, and the wearer responded with real-time feedback as a forced-choice comparison. Our approach was able to converge on controller parameters preferred by the wearer with an accuracy of 88\% on average when compared with randomly generated parameters. User-preferred settings stabilized in 43 ± 7 queries. This work demonstrates that user preference can be leveraged to tune a partial-assist ankle exoskeleton in real time using a simple, intuitive interface, highlighting the potential for translating lower-limb wearable technologies into our daily lives.},

  abstract     = {Lower limb loss is a major insult to the body’s nervous and musculoskeletal systems. Despite technological advances in prosthesis design, artificial limbs are not yet integrated into the body’s physiological systems. Therefore, lower limb amputees (LLAs) experience lower balance confidence, higher fear of falls, and impaired gait compared with their able-bodied peers (ABs). Previous studies have demonstrated that restored sensations perceived as originating directly from the missing limb via neural interfaces improve balance and performance in certain ambulatory tasks; however, the effects of such evoked sensations on neural circuitries involved in the locomotor activity are not well understood. In this work, we investigated the effects of plantar sensation elicited by peripheral nerve stimulation delivered by multicontact nerve cuff electrodes on gait symmetry and stability, speed perception, and motor adaptation. We found that restored plantar sensation increased stance time and propulsive force on the prosthetic side, improved gait symmetry, and yielded an enhanced perception of prosthetic limb movement. Our results show that the locomotor adaptation among LLAs with plantar sensation became similar to that of ABs. These findings suggest that our peripheral nerve–based approach to elicit plantar sensation directly affects central nervous pathways involved in locomotion and motor adaptation during walking. Our neuroprosthesis provided a unique model to investigate the role of somatosensation in the lower limb during walking and its effects on perceptual recalibration after a locomotor adaptation task. Furthermore, we demonstrated how plantar sensation in LLAs could effectively increase mobility, improve walking dynamics, and possibly reduce fall risks.},

In one person with unilateral below-elbow amputation, titanium implants were placed intramedullary in the radius and ulna bones, and electromuscular constructs were created surgically by transferring the severed nerves to free muscle grafts. The native muscles, free muscle grafts, and ulnar nerve were implanted with electrodes. Percutaneous extensions from the titanium implants provided direct skeletal attachment and bidirectional communication between the implanted electrodes and a prosthetic hand. Operation of the bionic hand in daily life resulted in improved prosthetic function, reduced postamputation, and increased quality of life. Sensations elicited via direct neural stimulation were consistently perceived on the phantom hand throughout the study. To date, the patient continues using the prosthesis in daily life. The functionality of conventional artificial limbs is hindered by discomfort and limited and unreliable control.

In this study, we aimed to address this missing function by enabling neural control of robotic lower-limb prostheses. Specifically, electromyographic (EMG) signals (amplified neural control signals) recorded from antagonistic residual ankle muscles were used to drive a robotic prosthetic ankle directly and continuously. Participants with transtibial amputation were recruited and trained in using the EMG-driven robotic ankle. We studied how using the EMG-controlled ankle affected the participants’ anticipatory and compensatory postural control strategies and stability under expected perturbations compared with using their daily passive devices. We investigated the similarity of neuromuscular coordination (by analyzing motor modules) of the participants, using either device in a postural sway task, to that of able-bodied controls. Results showed that, compared with their passive prosthesis, the EMG-controlled prosthesis enabled participants to use near-normative postural control strategies, as evidenced by improved between-limb symmetry in intact-prosthetic center-of-pressure and joint angle excursions. Participants substantially improved postural stability, as evidenced by a reduction in steps or falls using the EMG-controlled prosthetic ankle. Furthermore, after relearning to use residual ankle muscles to drive the robotic ankle in postural control, nearly all participants’ motor module structure shifted toward that observed in individuals without limb amputations. Here, we have demonstrated the potential benefit of direct EMG control of robotic lower limb prostheses to restore normative postural control strategies (both neural and biomechanical) toward enhancing standing postural stability in amputee users.},

  abstract     = {Using wind to disperse microfliers that fall like seeds and leaves can help automate large-scale sensor deployments. Here, we present battery-free microfliers that can change shape in mid-air to vary their dispersal distance. We designed origami microfliers using bistable leaf-out structures and uncovered an important property: A simple change in the shape of these origami structures causes two dramatically different falling behaviors. When unfolded and flat, the microfliers exhibit a tumbling behavior that increases lateral displacement in the wind. When folded inward, their orientation is stabilized, resulting in a downward descent that is less influenced by wind. To electronically transition between these two shapes, we designed a low-power electromagnetic actuator that produces peak forces of up to 200 millinewtons within 25 milliseconds while powered by solar cells. We fabricated a circuit directly on the folded origami structure that includes a programmable microcontroller, a Bluetooth radio, a solar power–harvesting circuit, a pressure sensor to estimate altitude, and a temperature sensor. Outdoor evaluations show that our 414-milligram origami microfliers were able to electronically change their shape mid-air, travel up to 98 meters in a light breeze, and wirelessly transmit data via Bluetooth up to 60 meters away, using only power collected from the sun.},

  abstract     = {A central question in robotics is how to design a control system for an agile mobile robot. This paper studies this question systematically, focusing on a challenging setting: autonomous drone racing. We show that a neural network controller trained with reinforcement learning (RL) outperformed optimal control (OC) methods in this setting. We then investigated which fundamental factors have contributed to the success of RL or have limited OC. Our study indicates that the fundamental advantage of RL over OC is not that it optimizes its objective better but that it optimizes a better objective. OC decomposes the problem into planning and control with an explicit intermediate representation, such as a trajectory, that serves as an interface. This decomposition limits the range of behaviors that can be expressed by the controller, leading to inferior control performance when facing unmodeled effects. In contrast, RL can directly optimize a task-level objective and can leverage domain randomization to cope with model uncertainty, allowing the discovery of more robust control responses. Our findings allowed us to push an agile drone to its maximum performance, achieving a peak acceleration greater than 12 times the gravitational acceleration and a peak velocity of 108 kilometers per hour. Our policy achieved superhuman control within minutes of training on a standard workstation. This work presents a milestone in agile robotics and sheds light on the role of RL and OC in robot control.},

  abstract     = {Loco-manipulation planning skills are pivotal for expanding the utility of robots in everyday environments. These skills can be assessed on the basis of a system’s ability to coordinate complex holistic movements and multiple contact interactions when solving different tasks. However, existing approaches have been merely able to shape such behaviors with hand-crafted state machines, densely engineered rewards, or prerecorded expert demonstrations. Here, we propose a minimally guided framework that automatically discovers whole-body trajectories jointly with contact schedules for solving general loco-manipulation tasks in premodeled environments. The key insight is that multimodal problems of this nature can be formulated and treated within the context of integrated task and motion planning (TAMP). An effective bilevel search strategy was achieved by incorporating domain-specific rules and adequately combining the strengths of different planning techniques: trajectory optimization and informed graph search coupled with sampling-based planning. We showcase emergent behaviors for a quadrupedal mobile manipulator exploiting both prehensile and nonprehensile interactions to perform real-world tasks such as opening/closing heavy dishwashers and traversing spring-loaded doors. These behaviors were also deployed on the real system using a two-layer whole-body tracking controller.},

This paper presents a model-based design approach to effectively increase the payload capacity of soft robot arms. The proposed approach uses localized body stiffening to decrease the compliance at the end effector without sacrificing the robot’s range of motion. This approach is validated on both a simulated and a real soft robot arm, where experiments show that increasing the stiffness of localized regions of their bodies reduces the compliance at the end effector and increases the height to which the arm can lift a payload. By increasing the payload capacity of soft robot arms, this approach has the potential to improve their efficacy in a variety of tasks including object manipulation and exploration of cluttered environments.},

  abstract     = {Soft robots promise improved safety and capability over rigid robots when deployed near humans or in complex, delicate, and dynamic environments. However, infinite degrees of freedom and the potential for highly nonlinear dynamics severely complicate their modeling and control. Analytical and machine learning methodologies have been applied to model soft robots but with constraints: quasi-static motions, quasi-linear deflections, or both. Here, we advance the modeling and control of soft robots into the inertial, nonlinear regime. We controlled motions of a soft, continuum arm with velocities 10 times larger and accelerations 40 times larger than those of previous work and did so for high-deflection shapes with more than 110° of curvature. We leveraged a data-driven learning approach for modeling, based on Koopman operator theory, and we introduce the concept of the static Koopman operator as a pregain term in optimal control. Our approach is rapid, requiring less than 5 min of training; is computationally low cost, requiring as little as 0.5 s to build the model; and is design agnostic, learning and accurately controlling two morphologically different soft robots. This work advances rapid modeling and control for soft robots from the realm of quasi-static to inertial, laying the groundwork for the next generation of compliant and highly dynamic robots.},

  abstract     = {Robots are active agents that operate in dynamic scenarios with noisy sensors. Predictions based on these noisy sensor measurements often lead to errors and can be unreliable. To this end, roboticists have used fusion methods using multiple observations. Lately, neural networks have dominated the accuracy charts for perception-driven predictions for robotic decision-making and often lack uncertainty metrics associated with the predictions. Here, we present a mathematical formulation to obtain the heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty of any arbitrary distribution without prior knowledge about the data. The approach has no prior assumptions about the prediction labels and is agnostic to network architecture. Furthermore, our class of networks, Ajna, adds minimal computation and requires only a small change to the loss function while training neural networks to obtain uncertainty of predictions, enabling real-time operation even on resource-constrained robots. In addition, we study the informational cues present in the uncertainties of predicted values and their utility in the unification of common robotics problems. In particular, we present an approach to dodge dynamic obstacles, navigate through a cluttered scene, fly through unknown gaps, and segment an object pile, without computing depth but rather using the uncertainties of optical flow obtained from a monocular camera with onboard sensing and computation. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate the proposed Ajna network on four aforementioned common robotics and computer vision tasks and show comparable results to methods directly using depth. Our work demonstrates a generalized deep uncertainty method and demonstrates its utilization in robotics applications.},

  abstract     = {The foreign body response impedes the function and longevity of implantable drug delivery devices. As a dense fibrotic capsule forms, integration of the device with the host tissue becomes compromised, ultimately resulting in device seclusion and treatment failure. We present FibroSensing Dynamic Soft Reservoir (FSDSR), an implantable drug delivery device capable of monitoring fibrotic capsule formation and overcoming its effects via soft robotic actuations. Occlusion of the FSDSR porous membrane was monitored over 7 days in a rodent model using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrical resistance of the fibrotic capsule correlated to its increase in thickness and volume. Our FibroSensing membrane showed great sensitivity in detecting changes at the abiotic/biotic interface, such as collagen deposition and myofibroblast proliferation. The potential of the FSDSR to overcome fibrotic capsule formation and maintain constant drug dosing over time was demonstrated in silico and in vitro. Controlled closed loop release of methylene blue into agarose gels (with a comparable fold change in permeability relating to 7 and 28 days in vivo) was achieved by adjusting the magnitude and frequency of pneumatic actuations after impedance measurements by the FibroSensing membrane. By sensing fibrotic capsule formation in vivo, the FSDSR will be capable of probing and adapting to the foreign body response through dynamic actuation changes. Informed by real-time sensor signals, this device offers the potential for long-term efficacy and sustained drug dosing, even in the setting of fibrotic capsule formation.},

Its self-driving autonomous navigation system (AutoNav) has been used to evaluate 88\% of the 17.7-kilometer distance traveled during its first Mars year of operation. Previously, the maximum total autonomous distance evaluated was 2.4 kilometers by the Opportunity rover during its 14-year lifetime. AutoNav has set multiple planetary rover records, including the greatest distance driven without human review (699.9 meters) and the greatest single-day drive distance (347.7 meters). The Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science (AEGIS) system analyzes wide-angle imagery onboard to autonomously select targets for observations by the SuperCam instrument, a multimode sensor suite capable of millimeter-scale geochemical and mineralogical analysis. AEGIS enables observations of scientifically interesting targets during or immediately after long drives without the need for ground communication. OnBoard Planner (OBP) is a scheduling capability planned for operational use in September 2023 that has the potential to reduce energy usage by up to 20\% and complete drive and arm-contact science campaigns in 25\% fewer days on Mars.

  abstract     = {We propose a dual-resolution scheme to achieve time-efficient autonomous exploration with one or many robots. The scheme maintains a high-resolution local map of the robot’s immediate vicinity and a low-resolution global map of the remaining areas of the environment. We believe that the strength of our approach lies in this low- and high-resolution representation of the environment: The high-resolution local map ensures that the robots observe the entire region in detail, and because the local map is bounded, so is the computation burden to process it. The low-resolution global map directs the robot to explore the broad space and only requires lightweight computation and low bandwidth to communicate among the robots. This paper shows the strength of this approach for both single-robot and multirobot exploration. For multirobot exploration, we also introduce a “pursuit” strategy for sharing information among robots with limited communication. This strategy directs the robots to opportunistically approach each other. We found that the scheme could produce exploration paths with a bounded difference in length compared with the theoretical shortest paths. Empirically, for single-robot exploration, our method produced 80\% higher time efficiency with 50\% lower computational runtimes than state-of-the-art methods in more than 300 simulation and real-world experiments. For multirobot exploration, our pursuit strategy demonstrated higher exploration time efficiency than conventional strategies in more than 3400 simulation runs with up to 20 robots. Last, we discuss how our method was deployed in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge and demonstrated the fastest and most complete exploration among all teams.},

  abstract     = {The interest in exploring planetary bodies for scientific investigation and in situ resource utilization is ever-rising. Yet, many sites of interest are inaccessible to state-of-the-art planetary exploration robots because of the robots’ inability to traverse steep slopes, unstructured terrain, and loose soil. In addition, current single-robot approaches only allow a limited exploration speed and a single set of skills. Here, we present a team of legged robots with complementary skills for exploration missions in challenging planetary analog environments. We equipped the robots with an efficient locomotion controller, a mapping pipeline for online and postmission visualization, instance segmentation to highlight scientific targets, and scientific instruments for remote and in situ investigation. Furthermore, we integrated a robotic arm on one of the robots to enable high-precision measurements. Legged robots can swiftly navigate representative terrains, such as granular slopes beyond 25°, loose soil, and unstructured terrain, highlighting their advantages compared with wheeled rover systems. We successfully verified the approach in analog deployments at the Beyond Gravity ExoMars rover test bed, in a quarry in Switzerland, and at the Space Resources Challenge in Luxembourg. Our results show that a team of legged robots with advanced locomotion, perception, and measurement skills, as well as task-level autonomy, can conduct successful, effective missions in a short time. Our approach enables the scientific exploration of planetary target sites that are currently out of human and robotic reach.},

  abstract     = {To realize the potential of autonomous underwater robots that scale up our observational capacity in the ocean, new techniques are needed. Fleets of autonomous robots could be used to study complex marine systems and animals with either new imaging configurations or by tracking tagged animals to study their behavior. These activities can then inform and create new policies for community conservation. The role of animal connectivity via active movement of animals represents a major knowledge gap related to the distribution of deep ocean populations. Tracking underwater targets represents a major challenge for observing biological processes in situ, and methods to robustly respond to a changing environment during monitoring missions are needed. Analytical techniques for optimal sensor placement and path planning to locate underwater targets are not straightforward in such cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of reinforcement learning as a tool for range-only underwater target-tracking optimization, whose promising capabilities have been demonstrated in terrestrial scenarios. To evaluate its usefulness, a reinforcement learning method was implemented as a path planning system for an autonomous surface vehicle while tracking an underwater mobile target. A complete description of an open-source model, performance metrics in simulated environments, and evaluated algorithms based on more than 15 hours of at-sea field experiments are presented. These efforts demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning is a powerful approach that enhances the abilities of autonomous robots in the ocean and encourages the deployment of algorithms like these for monitoring marine biological systems in the future.},

  abstract     = {Most soft robots are pneumatically actuated and fabricated by molding and assembling processes that typically require many manual operations and limit complexity. Furthermore, complex control components (for example, electronic pumps and microcontrollers) must be added to achieve even simple functions. Desktop fused filament fabrication (FFF) three-dimensional printing provides an accessible alternative with less manual work and the capability of generating more complex structures. However, because of material and process limitations, FFF-printed soft robots often have a high effective stiffness and contain a large number of leaks, limiting their applications. We present an approach for the design and fabrication of soft, airtight pneumatic robotic devices using FFF to simultaneously print actuators with embedded fluidic control components. We demonstrated this approach by printing actuators an order of magnitude softer than those previously fabricated using FFF and capable of bending to form a complete circle. Similarly, we printed pneumatic valves that control a high-pressure airflow with low control pressure. Combining the actuators and valves, we demonstrated a monolithically printed electronics-free autonomous gripper. When connected to a constant supply of air pressure, the gripper autonomously detected and gripped an object and released the object when it detected a force due to the weight of the object acting perpendicular to the gripper. The entire fabrication process of the gripper required no posttreatment, postassembly, or repair of manufacturing defects, making this approach highly repeatable and accessible. Our proposed approach represents a step toward complex, customized robotic systems and components created at distributed fabricating facilities.},

  abstract     = {Semantic navigation is necessary to deploy mobile robots in uncontrolled environments such as homes or hospitals. Many learning-based approaches have been proposed in response to the lack of semantic understanding of the classical pipeline for spatial navigation, which builds a geometric map using depth sensors and plans to reach point goals. Broadly, end-to-end learning approaches reactively map sensor inputs to actions with deep neural networks, whereas modular learning approaches enrich the classical pipeline with learning-based semantic sensing and exploration. However, learned visual navigation policies have predominantly been evaluated in sim, with little known about what works on a robot. We present a large-scale empirical study of semantic visual navigation methods comparing representative methods with classical, modular, and end-to-end learning approaches across six homes with no prior experience, maps, or instrumentation. We found that modular learning works well in the real world, attaining a 90\% success rate. In contrast, end-to-end learning does not, dropping from 77\% sim to a 23\% real-world success rate because of a large image domain gap between sim and reality. For practitioners, we show that modular learning is a reliable approach to navigate to objects: Modularity and abstraction in policy design enable sim-to-real transfer. For researchers, we identify two key issues that prevent today’s simulators from being reliable evaluation benchmarks—a large sim-to-real gap in images and a disconnect between sim and real-world error modes—and propose concrete steps forward.},

  abstract     = {Fluid-driven robotic systems typically use bulky and rigid power supplies, considerably limiting their mobility and flexibility. Although various forms of low-profile soft pumps have been demonstrated, they either are limited to specific working fluids or generate limited flow rates or pressures, making them ill-suited for widespread robotics applications. In this work, we introduce a class of centimeter-scale soft peristaltic pumps for power and control of fluidic robots. An array of high power density robust dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) (each weighing 1.7 grams) were adopted as soft motors, operated in a programmed pattern to produce pressure waves in a fluidic channel. We investigated and optimized the dynamic performance of the pump by analyzing the interaction between the DEAs and the fluidic channel with a fluid-structure interaction finite element model. Our soft pump achieved a maximum blocked pressure of 12.5 kilopascals and a run-out flow rate of 39 milliliters per minute with a response time of less than 0.1 second. The pump can generate bidirectional flow and adjustable pressure through control of drive parameters such as voltage and phase shift. Furthermore, the use of peristalsis makes the pump compatible with various liquids. To illustrate the versatility of the pump, we demonstrate mixing a cocktail, powering custom actuators for haptic devices, and performing closed-loop control of a soft fluidic actuator. This compact soft peristaltic pump opens up possibilities for future on-board power sources for fluid-driven robots in a variety of applications, including food handling, manufacturing, and biomedical therapeutics.},

  abstract     = {Through cooperation, robot swarms can perform tasks or solve problems that a single robot from the swarm could not perform/solve by itself. However, it has been shown that a single Byzantine robot (such as a malfunctioning or malicious robot) can disrupt the coordination strategy of the entire swarm. Therefore, a versatile swarm robotics framework that addresses security issues in inter-robot communication and coordination is urgently needed. Here, we show that security issues can be addressed by setting up a token economy between the robots. To create and maintain the token economy, we used blockchain technology, originally developed for the digital currency Bitcoin. The robots were given crypto tokens that allowed them to participate in the swarm’s security-critical activities. The token economy was regulated via a smart contract that decided how to distribute crypto tokens among the robots depending on their contributions. We designed the smart contract so that Byzantine robots soon ran out of crypto tokens and could therefore no longer influence the rest of the swarm. In experiments with up to 24 physical robots, we demonstrated that our smart contract approach worked: The robots could maintain blockchain networks, and a blockchain-based token economy could be used to neutralize the destructive actions of Byzantine robots in a collective-sensing scenario. In experiments with more than 100 simulated robots, we studied the scalability and long-term behavior of our approach. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility and viability of blockchain-based swarm robotics.},

In this work, we report on a scalable technique for the fabrication of large-area soft robotic electrode arrays and their deployment on the cortex through a square-centimeter burr hole using a pressure-driven actuation mechanism called eversion. The deployable system consists of up to six prefolded soft legs, and it is placed subdurally on the cortex using an aqueous pressurized solution and secured to the pedestal on the rim of the small craniotomy. Each leg contains soft, microfabricated electrodes and strain sensors for real-time deployment monitoring. In a proof-of-concept acute surgery, a soft robotic electrode array was successfully deployed on the cortex of a minipig to record sensory cortical activity. This soft robotic neurotechnology opens promising avenues for minimally invasive cortical surgery and applications related to neurological disorders such as motor and sensory deficits.},

  abstract     = {Place recognition is an essential spatial intelligence capability for robots to understand and navigate the world. However, recognizing places in natural environments remains a challenging task for robots because of resource limitations and changing environments. In contrast, humans and animals can robustly and efficiently recognize hundreds of thousands of places in different conditions. Here, we report a brain-inspired general place recognition system, dubbed NeuroGPR, that enables robots to recognize places by mimicking the neural mechanism of multimodal sensing, encoding, and computing through a continuum of space and time. Our system consists of a multimodal hybrid neural network (MHNN) that encodes and integrates multimodal cues from both conventional and neuromorphic sensors. Specifically, to encode different sensory cues, we built various neural networks of spatial view cells, place cells, head direction cells, and time cells. To integrate these cues, we designed a multiscale liquid state machine that can process and fuse multimodal information effectively and asynchronously using diverse neuronal dynamics and bioinspired inhibitory circuits. We deployed the MHNN on Tianjic, a hybrid neuromorphic chip, and integrated it into a quadruped robot. Our results show that NeuroGPR achieves better performance compared with conventional and existing biologically inspired approaches, exhibiting robustness to diverse environmental uncertainty, including perceptual aliasing, motion blur, light, or weather changes. Running NeuroGPR as an overall multi–neural network workload on Tianjic showcases its advantages with 10.5 times lower latency and 43.6\% lower power consumption than the commonly used mobile robot processor Jetson Xavier NX.},

  abstract     = {As the field of soft robotics advances, full autonomy becomes highly sought after, especially if robot motion can be powered by environmental energy. This would present a self-sustained approach in terms of both energy supply and motion control. Now, autonomous movement can be realized by leveraging out-of-equilibrium oscillatory motion of stimuli-responsive polymers under a constant light source. It would be more advantageous if environmental energy could be scavenged to power robots. However, generating oscillation becomes challenging under the limited power density of available environmental energy sources. Here, we developed fully autonomous soft robots with self-sustainability based on self-excited oscillation. Aided by modeling, we have successfully reduced the required input power density to around one-Sun level through a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE)–based bilayer structure. The autonomous motion of the low-intensity LCE/elastomer bilayer oscillator “LiLBot” under low energy supply was achieved by high photothermal conversion, low modulus, and high material responsiveness simultaneously. The LiLBot features tunable peak-to-peak amplitudes from 4 to 72 degrees and frequencies from 0.3 to 11 hertz. The oscillation approach offers a strategy for designing autonomous, untethered, and sustainable small-scale soft robots, such as a sailboat, walker, roller, and synchronized flapping wings.},

  abstract     = {The power of natural evolution lies in the adaptability of biological organisms but is constrained by the time scale of genetics and reproduction. Engineering artificial molecular machines should not only include adaptability as a core feature but also apply it within a larger design space and at a faster time scale. A lesson from engineering electromechanical robots is that modular robots can perform diverse functions through self-reconfiguration, a large-scale form of adaptation. Molecular machines made of modular, reconfigurable components may form the basis for dynamic self-reprogramming in future synthetic cells. To achieve modular reconfiguration in DNA origami assemblies, we previously developed a tile displacement mechanism in which an invader tile replaces another tile in an array with controlled kinetics. Here, we establish design principles for simultaneous reconfigurations in tile assemblies using complex invaders with distinct shapes. We present toehold and branch migration domain configurations that expand the design space of tile displacement reactions by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the construction of multitile invaders with fixed and variable sizes and controlled size distributions. We investigate the growth of three-dimensional (3D) barrel structures with variable cross sections and introduce a mechanism for reconfiguring them into 2D structures. Last, we show an example of a sword-shaped assembly transforming into a snake-shaped assembly, illustrating two independent tile displacement reactions occurring concurrently with minimum cross-talk. This work serves as a proof of concept that tile displacement could be a fundamental mechanism for modular reconfiguration robust to temperature and tile concentration.},

  abstract     = {The gut-brain axis, which is mediated via enteric and central neurohormonal signaling, is known to regulate a broad set of physiological functions from feeding to emotional behavior. Various pharmaceuticals and surgical interventions, such as motility agents and bariatric surgery, are used to modulate this axis. Such approaches, however, are associated with off-target effects or post-procedure recovery time and expose patients to substantial risks. Electrical stimulation has also been used to attempt to modulate the gut-brain axis with greater spatial and temporal resolution. Electrical stimulation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, however, has generally required invasive intervention for electrode placement on serosal tissue. Stimulating mucosal tissue remains challenging because of the presence of gastric and intestinal fluid, which can influence the effectiveness of local luminal stimulation. Here, we report the development of a bioinspired ingestible fluid-wicking capsule for active stimulation and hormone modulation (FLASH) capable of rapidly wicking fluid and locally stimulating mucosal tissue, resulting in systemic modulation of an orexigenic GI hormone. Drawing inspiration from Moloch horridus, the “thorny devil” lizard with water-wicking skin, we developed a capsule surface capable of displacing fluid. We characterized the stimulation parameters for modulation of various GI hormones in a porcine model and applied these parameters to an ingestible capsule system. FLASH can be orally administered to modulate GI hormones and is safely excreted with no adverse effects in porcine models. We anticipate that this device could be used to treat metabolic, GI, and neuropsychiatric disorders noninvasively with minimal off-target effects.},

Here, we present a method to create robust flight navigation agents that successfully perform vision-based fly-to-target tasks beyond their training environment under drastic distribution shifts. To this end, we designed an imitation learning framework using liquid neural networks, a brain-inspired class of continuous-time neural models that are causal and adapt to changing conditions. We observed that liquid agents learn to distill the task they are given from visual inputs and drop irrelevant features. Thus, their learned navigation skills transferred to new environments. When compared with several other state-of-the-art deep agents, experiments showed that this level of robustness in decision-making is exclusive to liquid networks, both in their differential equation and closed-form representations.},

  abstract     = {Insects maintain remarkable agility after incurring severe injuries or wounds. Although robots driven by rigid actuators have demonstrated agile locomotion and manipulation, most of them lack animal-like robustness against unexpected damage. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a class of muscle-like soft transducers that have enabled nimble aerial, terrestrial, and aquatic robotic locomotion comparable to that of rigid actuators. However, unlike muscles, DEAs suffer local dielectric breakdowns that often cause global device failure. These local defects severely limit DEA performance, lifetime, and size scalability. We developed DEAs that can endure more than 100 punctures while maintaining high bandwidth (&gt;400 hertz) and power density (&gt;700 watt per kilogram)—sufficient for supporting energetically expensive locomotion such as flight. We fabricated electroluminescent DEAs for visualizing electrode connectivity under actuator damage. When the DEA suffered severe dielectric breakdowns that caused device failure, we demonstrated a laser-assisted repair method for isolating the critical defects and recovering performance. These results culminate in an aerial robot that can endure critical actuator and wing damage while maintaining similar accuracy in hovering flight. Our work highlights that soft robotic systems can embody animal-like agility and resilience—a critical biomimetic capability for future robots to interact with challenging environments.},

  abstract     = {Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely heavily on visual sensors to perceive obstacles and explore environments. Current UAVs are limited in both perception capability and task efficiency because of a small sensor field of view (FoV). One solution could be to leverage self-rotation in UAVs to extend the sensor FoV without consuming extra power. This natural mechanism, induced by the counter-torque of the UAV motor, has rarely been exploited by existing autonomous UAVs because of the difficulties in design and control due to highly coupled and nonlinear dynamics and the challenges in navigation brought by the high-rate self-rotation. Here, we present powered-flying ultra-underactuated LiDAR (light detection and ranging) sensing aerial robot (PULSAR), an agile and self-rotating UAV whose three-dimensional position is fully controlled by actuating only one motor to obtain the required thrust and moment. The use of a single actuator effectively reduces the energy loss in powered flights. Consequently, PULSAR consumes 26.7\% less power than the benchmarked quadrotor with the same total propeller disk area and avionic payloads while retaining a good level of agility. Augmented by an onboard LiDAR sensor, PULSAR can perform autonomous navigation in unknown environments and detect both static and dynamic obstacles in panoramic views without any external instruments. We report the experiments of PULSAR in environment exploration and multidirectional dynamic obstacle avoidance with the extended FoV via self-rotation, which could lead to increased perception capability, task efficiency, and flight safety.},

To address this knowledge gap, this work used a noninvasive, load-controlled robotic device to impose highly defined tissue stresses to evaluate the age dependence of ML on muscle repair after injury. The response of injured muscle to robot-actuated cyclic compressive loading was found to be age sensitive, revealing not only a lack of reparative benefit of ML on injured aged muscles but also exacerbation of tissue inflammation. ML alone also disrupted the normal regenerative processes of aged muscle stem cells. However, these negative effects could be reversed by introducing anti-inflammatory therapy alongside ML application, leading to enhanced skeletal muscle regeneration even in aged mice.},

Biocompatible robots, incorporating sensing and actuation capable of generating and responding to relevant stimuli, can be a tool to study collective behaviors previously unattainable with traditional techniques. To investigate collective behaviors of the western honeybee ( Apis mellifera ), we designed a robotic system capable of observing and modulating the bee cluster using an array of thermal sensors and actuators. We initially integrated the system into a beehive populated with about 4000 bees for several months. The robotic system was able to observe the colony by continuously collecting spatiotemporal thermal profiles of the winter cluster. Furthermore, we found that our robotic device reliably modulated the superorganism’s response to dynamic thermal stimulation, influencing its spatiotemporal reorganization. In addition, after identifying the thermal collapse of a colony, we used the robotic system in a “life-support” mode via its thermal actuators. Ultimately, we demonstrated a robotic device capable of autonomous closed-loop interaction with a cluster comprising thousands of individual bees. Such biohybrid societies open the door to investigation of collective behaviors that necessitate observing and interacting with the animals within a complete social context, as well as for potential applications in augmenting the survivability of these pollinators crucial to our ecosystems and our food supply.},

  abstract     = {Maintaining balance throughout daily activities is challenging because of the unstable nature of the human body. For instance, a person’s delayed reaction times limit their ability to restore balance after disturbances. Wearable exoskeletons have the potential to enhance user balance after a disturbance by reacting faster than physiologically possible. However, “artificially fast” balance-correcting exoskeleton torque may interfere with the user’s ensuing physiological responses, consequently hindering the overall reactive balance response. Here, we show that exoskeletons need to react faster than physiological responses to improve standing balance after postural perturbations. Delivering ankle exoskeleton torque before the onset of physiological reactive joint moments improved standing balance by 9\%, whereas delaying torque onset to coincide with that of physiological reactive ankle moments did not. In addition, artificially fast exoskeleton torque disrupted the ankle mechanics that generate initial local sensory feedback, but the initial reactive soleus muscle activity was only reduced by 18\% versus baseline. More variance of the initial reactive soleus muscle activity was accounted for using delayed and scaled whole-body mechanics [specifically center of mass (CoM) velocity] versus local ankle—or soleus fascicle—mechanics, supporting the notion that reactive muscle activity is commanded to achieve task-level goals, such as maintaining balance. Together, to elicit symbiotic human-exoskeleton balance control, device torque may need to be informed by mechanical estimates of global sensory feedback, such as CoM kinematics, that precede physiological responses.},

In such situations, balancing uneven illumination, improving image contrast for facile object detection, and achieving high visual acuity in the main visual fields are key requirements. Meanwhile, in nature, cuttlefish (genus Sepia ) have evolved an eye optimized for vertically uneven illumination conditions, which consists of a W-shaped pupil, a single spherical lens, and a curved retina with a high-density photoreceptor arrangement and polarized light sensitivity. Here, inspired by the cuttlefish eye, we report an artificial vision system consisting of a W-shaped pupil, a single ball lens, a surface-integrated flexible polarizer, and a cylindrical silicon photodiode array with a locally densified pixel arrangement. The W-shaped pupil integrated on the ball lens balances vertically uneven illumination, and the cylindrical silicon photodiode array integrated with the flexible polarizer enables high-contrast and high-acuity imaging.},

  abstract     = {Aortic stenosis (AS) affects about 1.5 million people in the United States and is associated with a 5-year survival rate of 20\% if untreated. In these patients, aortic valve replacement is performed to restore adequate hemodynamics and alleviate symptoms. The development of next-generation prosthetic aortic valves seeks to provide enhanced hemodynamic performance, durability, and long-term safety, emphasizing the need for high-fidelity testing platforms for these devices. We propose a soft robotic model that recapitulates patient-specific hemodynamics of AS and secondary ventricular remodeling which we validated against clinical data. The model leverages 3D-printed replicas of each patient’s cardiac anatomy and patient-specific soft robotic sleeves to recreate the patients’ hemodynamics. An aortic sleeve allows mimicry of AS lesions due to degenerative or congenital disease, whereas a left ventricular sleeve recapitulates loss of ventricular compliance and diastolic dysfunction (DD) associated with AS. Through a combination of echocardiographic and catheterization techniques, this system is shown to recreate clinical metrics of AS with greater controllability compared with methods based on image-guided aortic root reconstruction and parameters of cardiac function that rigid systems fail to mimic physiologically. Last, we leverage this model to evaluate the hemodynamic benefit of transcatheter aortic valves in a subset of patients with diverse anatomies, etiologies, and disease states. Through the development of a high-fidelity model of AS and DD, this work demonstrates the use of soft robotics to recreate cardiovascular disease, with potential applications in device development, procedural planning, and outcome prediction in industrial and clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {Whereas naturally occurring swarms thrive when crowded, physical interactions in robotic swarms are either avoided or carefully controlled, thus limiting their operational density. Here, we present a mechanical design rule that allows robots to act in a collision-dominated environment. We introduce Morphobots, a robotic swarm platform developed to implement embodied computation through a morpho-functional design. By engineering a three-dimensional printed exoskeleton, we encode a reorientation response to an external body force (such as gravity) or a surface force (such as a collision). We show that the force orientation response is generic and can augment existing swarm robotic platforms (e.g., Kilobots) as well as custom robots even 10 times larger. At the individual level, the exoskeleton improves motility and stability and also allows encoding of two contrasting dynamical behaviors in response to an external force or a collision (including collision with a wall or a movable obstacle and on a dynamically tilting plane). This force orientation response adds a mechanical layer to the robot’s sense-act cycle at the swarm level, leveraging steric interactions for collective phototaxis when crowded. Enabling collisions also promotes information flow, facilitating online distributed learning. Each robot runs an embedded algorithm that ultimately optimizes collective performance. We identify an effective parameter that controls the force orientation response and explore its implications in swarms that transition from dilute to crowded. Experimenting with physical swarms (of up to 64 robots) and simulated swarms (of up to 8192 agents) shows that the effect of morphological computation increases with growing swarm size.},

  abstract     = {Simulation-based reinforcement learning approaches are leading the next innovations in legged robot control. However, the resulting control policies are still not applicable on soft and deformable terrains, especially at high speed. The primary reason is that reinforcement learning approaches, in general, are not effective beyond the data distribution: The agent cannot perform well in environments that it has not experienced. To this end, we introduce a versatile and computationally efficient granular media model for reinforcement learning. Our model can be parameterized to represent diverse types of terrain from very soft beach sand to hard asphalt. In addition, we introduce an adaptive control architecture that can implicitly identify the terrain properties as the robot feels the terrain. The identified parameters are then used to boost the locomotion performance of the legged robot. We applied our techniques to the Raibo robot, a dynamic quadrupedal robot developed in-house. The trained networks demonstrated high-speed locomotion capabilities on deformable terrains: The robot was able to run on soft beach sand at 3.03 meters per second although the feet were completely buried in the sand during the stance phase. We also demonstrate its ability to generalize to different terrains by presenting running experiments on vinyl tile flooring, athletic track, grass, and a soft air mattress.},

  abstract     = {The protection and restoration of the biosphere is crucial for human resilience and well-being, but the scarcity of data on the status and distribution of biodiversity puts these efforts at risk. DNA released into the environment by organisms, i.e., environmental DNA (eDNA), can be used to monitor biodiversity in a scalable manner if equipped with the appropriate tool. However, the collection of eDNA in terrestrial environments remains a challenge because of the many potential surfaces and sources that need to be surveyed and their limited accessibility. Here, we propose to survey biodiversity by sampling eDNA on the outer branches of tree canopies with an aerial robot. The drone combines a force-sensing cage with a haptic-based control strategy to establish and maintain contact with the upper surface of the branches. Surface eDNA is then collected using an adhesive surface integrated in the cage of the drone. We show that the drone can autonomously land on a variety of branches with stiffnesses between 1 and 10 3 newton/meter without prior knowledge of their structural stiffness and with robustness to linear and angular misalignments. Validation in the natural environment demonstrates that our method is successful in detecting animal species, including arthropods and vertebrates. Combining robotics with eDNA sampling from a variety of unreachable aboveground substrates can offer a solution for broad-scale monitoring of biodiversity.},

  abstract     = {Stiffness and forces are two fundamental quantities essential to living cells and tissues. However, it has been a challenge to quantify both 3D traction forces and stiffness (or modulus) using the same probe in vivo. Here, we describe an approach that overcomes this challenge by creating a magnetic microrobot probe with controllable functionality. Biocompatible ferromagnetic cobalt-platinum microcrosses were fabricated, and each microcross (about 30 micrometers) was trapped inside an arginine–glycine–aspartic acid–conjugated stiff poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) round microgel (about 50 micrometers) using a microfluidic device. The stiff magnetic microrobot was seeded inside a cell colony and acted as a stiffness probe by rigidly rotating in response to an oscillatory magnetic field. Then, brief episodes of ultraviolet light exposure were applied to dynamically photodegrade and soften the fluorescent nanoparticle–embedded PEG microgel, whose deformation and 3D traction forces were quantified. Using the microrobot probe, we show that malignant tumor–repopulating cell colonies altered their modulus but not traction forces in response to different 3D substrate elasticities. Stiffness and 3D traction forces were measured, and both normal and shear traction force oscillations were observed in zebrafish embryos from blastula to gastrula. Mouse embryos generated larger tensile and compressive traction force oscillations than shear traction force oscillations during blastocyst. The microrobot probe with controllable functionality via magnetic fields could potentially be useful for studying the mechanoregulation of cells, tissues, and embryos.},
