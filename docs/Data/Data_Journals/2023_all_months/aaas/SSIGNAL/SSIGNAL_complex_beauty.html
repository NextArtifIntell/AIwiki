Double-stranded DNA breaks induced by radiation triggered IRAK4-dependent activation and nuclear translocation of IRAK1, which bound to and inhibited a proapoptotic complex, thereby supporting cell survival. This mechanism required the DNA damage response kinase ATR and Pellino family ubiquitin ligases. Disrupting the pathway sensitized p53-mutant zebrafish to radiation, providing potential targets for overcoming radiation resistance in some cancers. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)–associated kinases (IRAKs) are core effectors of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and IL-1R in innate immunity. Here, we found that IRAK4 and IRAK1 together inhibited DNA damage–induced cell death independently of TLR or IL-1R signaling. In human cancer cells, IRAK4 was activated downstream of ATR kinase in response to double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation (IR). Activated IRAK4 then formed a complex with and activated IRAK1. The formation of this complex required the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino1, acting structurally but not catalytically, and the activation of IRAK1 occurred independently of extracellular signaling, intracellular TLRs, and the TLR/IL-1R signaling adaptor MyD88. Activated IRAK1 translocated to the nucleus in a Pellino2-dependent manner. In the nucleus, IRAK1 bound to the PIDD1 subunit of the proapoptotic PIDDosome and interfered with platform assembly, thus supporting cell survival. This noncanonical IRAK signaling pathway was also activated in response to other DSB-inducing agents. The loss of IRAK4, of IRAK4 kinase activity, of either Pellino protein, or of the nuclear localization sequence in IRAK1 sensitized p53-mutant zebrafish to radiation. Thus, the findings may lead to strategies for overcoming tumor resistance to conventional cancer treatments.},

Schaefer et al . found that the two most common RHOA mutations drive the development and progression of this cancer in distinct ways (see also the Focus by Benton and Chernoff). Both the Y42C and L57V mutations conferred a similar gain-of-function phenotype that promoted the interaction of RHOA with the actin cytoskeleton and activation of the transcriptional coactivator YAP1 to promote malignant transformation, growth, and cell motility in Cdh1 -deficient mouse-derived gastric organoids. However, distinct from Y42C, L57V engaged the kinases PAK1 and IGF1R, and inhibition of either kinase suppressed the growth of organoids. These results reveal potential drug targets in the treatment of gastric cancer. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Cancer-associated mutations in the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RHOA are found at different locations from the mutational hotspots in the structurally and biochemically related RAS. Tyr 42 -to-Cys (Y42C) and Leu 57 -to-Val (L57V) substitutions are the two most prevalent RHOA mutations in diffuse gastric cancer (DGC). RHOA Y42C exhibits a gain-of-function phenotype and is an oncogenic driver in DGC. Here, we determined how RHOA L57V promotes DGC growth. In mouse gastric organoids with deletion of Cdh1 , which encodes the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin, the expression of RHOA L57V , but not of wild-type RHOA, induced an abnormal morphology similar to that of patient-derived DGC organoids. RHOA L57V also exhibited a gain-of-function phenotype and promoted F-actin stress fiber formation and cell migration. RHOA L57V retained interaction with effectors but exhibited impaired RHOA-intrinsic and GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis, which favored formation of the active GTP-bound state. Introduction of missense mutations at KRAS residues analogous to Tyr 42 and Leu 57 in RHOA did not activate KRAS oncogenic potential, indicating distinct functional effects in otherwise highly related GTPases. Both RHOA mutants stimulated the transcriptional co-activator YAP1 through actin dynamics to promote DGC progression; however, RHOA L57V additionally did so by activating the kinases IGF1R and PAK1, distinct from the FAK-mediated mechanism induced by RHOA Y42C .

  abstract     = {In response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, macrophages produce type I interferons (IFNs), which promote antiviral immunity, but they also secrete tissue-damaging, proinflammatory cytokines. Mazzarella et al. showed that pharmacological inhibition or loss of the lysine demethylase LSD1 reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion but minimally affected IFN production by macrophages infected with a murine coronavirus in vitro. Furthermore, LSD1 inhibition reduced inflammation and increased antiviral responses in a mouse model of human SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings highlight a potential mechanism by which LSD1 inhibitors could treat COVID-19. —John F. Foley Innate immune responses to coronavirus infections are highly cell specific. Tissue-resident macrophages, which are infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients but are inconsistently infected in vitro, exert critical but conflicting effects by secreting both antiviral type I interferons (IFNs) and tissue-damaging inflammatory cytokines. Steroids, the only class of host-targeting drugs approved for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), indiscriminately suppress both responses, possibly impairing viral clearance. Here, we established in vitro cell culture systems that enabled us to separately investigate the cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic proinflammatory and antiviral activities of mouse macrophages infected with the prototypical murine coronavirus MHV-A59. We showed that the nuclear factor κB–dependent inflammatory response to viral infection was selectively inhibited by loss of the lysine demethylase LSD1, which was previously implicated in innate immune responses to cancer, with negligible effects on the antiviral IFN response. LSD1 ablation also enhanced an IFN-independent antiviral response, blocking viral egress through the lysosomal pathway. The macrophage-intrinsic antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of Lsd1 inhibition was confirmed in vitro and in a humanized mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that LSD1 controls innate immune responses against coronaviruses at multiple levels and provide a mechanistic rationale for potentially repurposing LSD1 inhibitors for COVID-19 treatment.},

We found that ZNF746 (also known as PARIS), a zinc finger transcription factor implicated in Parkinson’s disease, physically associated with NRF2 and MAFG, resulting in suppression of NRF2-driven transcription.

  abstract     = {At the start of a viral infection, a few cells secrete type I interferons (IFNs), which stimulate transient signaling by STAT transcription factors in the infected cells and prolonged STAT signaling in bystander, uninfected cells, enabling their accumulation of antiviral proteins. Korwek et al . measured the effects of type I IFN on the signaling dynamics of transcription factors and antiviral proteins in cells subsequently treated with poly(I:C), an immune stimulant that mimics viral infections. These data were used to generate a mathematical model that explained how IFN prestimulation led to a switch in poly(I:C)-treated cells from IFN-responding cells to IFN-secreting cells, a critical conversion needed to mount an effective antiviral response. —John F. Foley Type I interferons (IFNs) are key coordinators of the innate immune response to viral infection, which, through activation of the transcriptional regulators STAT1 and STAT2 (STAT1/2) in bystander cells, induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we showed that in cells transfected with poly(I:C), an analog of viral RNA, the transcriptional activity of STAT1/2 was terminated because of depletion of the interferon-β (IFN-β) receptor, IFNAR. Activation of RNase L and PKR, products of two ISGs, not only hindered the replenishment of IFNAR but also suppressed negative regulators of IRF3 and NF-κB, consequently promoting IFNB transcription. We incorporated these findings into a mathematical model of innate immunity. By coupling signaling through the IRF3–NF-κB and STAT1/2 pathways with the activities of RNase L and PKR, the model explains how poly(I:C) switches the transcriptional program from being STAT1/2 induced to being IRF3 and NF-κB induced, which converts IFN-β–responding cells to IFN-β–secreting cells.},

Mice lacking Sept8-204 or the enzyme that mediates its palmitoylation had learning and memory deficits and showed anxiety-like behaviors. The findings deepen our understanding of this lipid modification in spine formation and cognition. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Septin proteins are involved in diverse physiological functions, including the formation of specialized cytoskeletal structures. Septin 8 (Sept8) is implicated in spine morphogenesis and dendritic branching through palmitoylation. We explored the role and regulation of a Sept8 variant in human neural-like cells and in the mouse brain. We identified Sept8-204 as a brain-specific variant of Sept8 that was abundant in neurons and modified by palmitoylation, specifically at Cys 469 , Cys 470 , and Cys 472 . Sept8-204 palmitoylation was mediated by the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC7 and was removed by the depalmitoylase PPT1. Palmitoylation of Sept8-204 bound to F-actin and induced cytoskeletal dynamics to promote the outgrowth of filopodia in N2a cells and the arborization of neurites in hippocampal neurons. In contrast, a Sept8-204 variant that could not be palmitoylated because of mutation of all three Cys residues (Sept8-204-3CA) lost its ability to bind F-actin, and expression of this mutant did not promote morphological changes. Genetic deletion of Sept8 , Sept8 -204, or Zdhhc7 caused deficits in learning and memory and promoted anxiety-like behaviors in mice.

  abstract     = {Signaling by the transcription factor STAT3 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). S-palmitoylation of STAT3, a reversible posttranslational modification mediated by DHHC palmitoyltransferases, increases its transcriptional activity. Jiang et al. investigated the effect of S-palmitoylation on liver tumor growth in mice. Bioinformatics analysis revealed an association between DHHC7 and HCC malignancy. DHHC7 stimulated STAT3 activity and HCC cell proliferation. The kinase CDK5 and the transcription factor HIF1α are associated with decreased survival in HCC, and ZDHHC7 expression was driven by HIF1α, a target of STAT3 that is stabilized by CDK5. Targeting this signaling loop reduced tumor growth in mice, supporting the therapeutic potential of disrupting this pathway. —Amy E. Baek Constitutive activation of the transcription factor STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) contributes to the malignancy of many cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is associated with poor prognosis. STAT3 activity is increased by the reversible palmitoylation of Cys 108 by the palmitoyltransferase DHHC7 (encoded by ZDHHC7 ). Here, we investigated the consequences of S-palmitoylation of STAT3 in HCC. Increased ZDHHC7 abundance in HCC cases was associated with poor prognosis, as revealed by bioinformatics analysis of patient data. In HepG2 cells in vitro, DHHC7-mediated palmitoylation enhanced the expression of STAT3 target genes, including HIF1A , which encodes the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1α. Inhibiting DHHC7 decreased the S-palmitoylation of STAT3 and decreased HIF1α abundance. Furthermore, stabilization of HIF1α by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) enabled it to promote the expression of ZDHHC7 , which generated a positive feedback loop between DHHC7, STAT3, and HIF1α. Perturbing this loop reduced the growth of HCC cells in vivo. Moreover, DHHC7, STAT3, and HIF1α were all abundant in human HCC tissues. Our study identifies a pathway connecting these proteins that is initiated by S-palmitoylation, which may be broadly applicable to understanding the role of this modification in cancer.},

  abstract     = {When engaged by its ligands, the receptor PD-1 inhibits the activation of T cells stimulated through the T cell receptor. Alleviating this effect is the basis of checkpoint inhibitors that promote antitumor immunity (see the Focus by Acharya and Kumari). Paillon et al . used imaging techniques to show that PD-1 signaling inhibited the formation of an immunological synapse between T cells and their target cells by preventing remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in a manner independent of its intracellular, tyrosine-based signaling motifs. These findings suggest an alternative mechanism by which PD-1 regulates immune responses. —John F. Foley Engagement of the receptor programmed cell death molecule 1 (PD-1) by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 inhibits T cell–mediated immune responses. Blocking such signaling provides the clinical effects of PD-1–targeted immunotherapy. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying PD-1–mediated inhibition. Because dynamic actin remodeling is crucial for T cell functions, we characterized the effects of PD-1 engagement on actin remodeling at the immunological synapse, the interface between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC) or target cell. We used microscopy to analyze the formation of immunological synapses between PD-1 + Jurkat cells or primary human CD8 + cytotoxic T cells and APCs that presented T cell–activating antibodies and were either positive or negative for PD-L1. PD-1 binding to PD-L1 inhibited T cell spreading induced by antibody-mediated activation, which was characterized by the absence of the F-actin–dense distal lamellipodial network at the immunological synapse and the Arp2/3 complex, which mediates branched actin formation. PD-1–induced inhibition of actin remodeling also prevented the characteristic deformation of T cells that contact APCs and the release of cytotoxic granules. We showed that the effects of PD-1 on actin remodeling did not require its tyrosine-based signaling motifs, which are thought to mediate the co-inhibitory effects of PD-1. Our study highlights a previously unappreciated mechanism of PD-1–mediated suppression of T cell activity, which depends on the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in a signaling motif–independent manner.},

  abstract     = {Preventing angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, is critical in certain pathological conditions. Kobialka et al. found that the phosphoinositide kinase PI3K-C2β acted as a limit on endothelial cell size. During developmental angiogenesis, mice expressing a kinase-deficient form of PI3K-C2β had expanded blood vessels due to larger endothelial cells, rather than because of increases in endothelial cell proliferation or migration. The multiprotein complex mTORC1 couples nutrient availability to cell growth, and inactivation of PI3K-C2β enhanced the activity of mTORC1 by promoting its localization to lysosomes. Thus, PI3K-C2β restrains mTORC1 activity to limit angiogenesis. —Wei Wong Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate intracellular inositol lipids to regulate signaling and intracellular vesicular trafficking. Mammals have eight PI3K isoforms, of which class I PI3Kα and class II PI3K-C2α are essential for vascular development. The class II PI3K-C2β is also abundant in endothelial cells. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we found that PI3K-C2β was a critical regulator of blood vessel growth by restricting endothelial mTORC1 signaling. Mice expressing a kinase-inactive form of PI3K-C2β displayed enlarged blood vessels without corresponding changes in endothelial cell proliferation or migration. Instead, inactivation of PI3K-C2β resulted in an increase in the size of endothelial cells, particularly in the sprouting zone of angiogenesis. Mechanistically, we showed that the aberrantly large size of PI3K-C2β mutant endothelial cells was caused by mTORC1 activation, which sustained growth in these cells. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin normalized vascular morphogenesis in PI3K-C2β mutant mice. Together, these results identify PI3K-C2β as a crucial determinant of endothelial signaling and illustrate the importance of mTORC1 regulation during angiogenic growth.},

In vitro, yeast, and plant assays demonstrated that MDL1 and MDL2 oligomerized with each other and with MIF and enhanced MIF-mediated activation of the receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4. MDL1 augmented MIF-induced chemotaxis and inflammatory gene expression in human neutrophils and lung epithelial cells, respectively, indicating that these plant proteins have the potential to modulate cellular responses to MIF. —Annalisa M. VanHook Mammalian macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its paralog, D-dopachrome tautomerase, are multifunctional inflammatory cytokines. Plants have orthologous MIF and D-dopachrome tautomerase–like (MDL) proteins that mimic some of the effects of MIF on immune cells in vitro. We explored the structural and functional similarities between the three Arabidopsis thaliana MDLs and MIF. X-ray crystallography of the MDLs revealed high structural similarity between MDL and MIF homotrimers and suggested a potential explanation for the lack of tautomerase activity in the MDLs. MDL1 and MDL2 interacted with each other and with MIF in vitro, in yeast, and in plant leaves and formed hetero-oligomeric complexes with MIF in vitro. The MDLs stimulated signaling through the MIF receptors CXCR2 or CXCR4 and enhanced the responses to MIF in a yeast reporter system, in human neutrophils, and in human lung epithelial cells. Pharmacological inhibitors that disrupted MIF activity or prevented the formation of MIF-MDL hetero-oligomers blocked the observed synergism. These findings demonstrate that MDLs can enhance cellular responses to MIF, which may have functional implications in tissues exposed to MDLs from the diet or environment.},

  abstract     = {The pain associated with gut inflammation can be debilitating, chronic, and difficult to manage. Morales-Soto et al . found that local glial cells may be major contributors to this inflammatory pain. Inducing inflammation in the gut in mice provoked enteric glia to secrete prostaglandin E 2 , which activated receptors on gut-innervating sensory neurons that sensitized the neurons to stimuli that were otherwise not noxious. Activating the glia in the absence of inflammation did not stimulate neurons or produce visceral pain. The findings reveal a cellular and molecular source of pain in the intestines that is specifically inflammation associated and that may be therapeutically targetable. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Inflammation in the intestines causes abdominal pain that is challenging to manage. The terminals of sensory neurons innervating the gut are surrounded by glia. Here, using a mouse model of acute colitis, we found that enteric glia contribute to visceral pain by secreting factors that sensitized sensory nerves innervating the gut in response to inflammation. Acute colitis induced a transient increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the intestines of male and female mice. Of these, IL-1β was produced in part by glia and augmented the opening of the intercellular communication hemichannel connexin-43 in glia, which made normally innocuous stimuli painful in female mice. Chemogenetic glial activation paired with calcium imaging in nerve terminals demonstrated that glia sensitized gut-innervating nociceptors only under inflammatory conditions. This inflammatory, glial-driven visceral hypersensitivity involved an increased abundance of the enzyme COX-2 in glia, resulting in greater production and release of prostaglandin E 2 that activated EP 4 receptors on sensory nerve terminals. Blocking EP 4 receptors reduced nociceptor sensitivity in response to glial stimulation in tissue samples from colitis-model mice, and impairing glial connexin-43 reduced visceral hypersensitivity induced by IL-1β in female mice. The findings suggest that therapies targeting enteric glial–neuron signaling might alleviate visceral pain caused by inflammatory disorders.},

Yamasaki et al . linked impaired Ca 2+ signaling in smooth muscle cells with disease phenotype in a mouse model of Gould syndrome. As these mice aged, they became more susceptible to intracerebral hemorrhaging and showed defects in ion channel–mediated Ca 2+ signaling in smooth muscle cells and in the ability of cerebral arteries to autoregulate blood flow, a Ca 2+ -dependent process called the myogenic response. Alleviating the stress caused by the accumulation of misfolded collagen with a small molecule chaperone attenuated intracerebral hemorrhages and restored Ca 2+ signaling and the myogenic response, suggesting that perturbations in Ca 2+ signaling induced by misfolded proteins may underlie Gould syndrome and similar cerebral blood vessel diseases. —Wei Wong Humans and mice with mutations in COL4A1 and COL4A2 manifest hallmarks of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). Mice with a missense mutation in Col4a1 at amino acid 1344 ( Col4a1 +/G1344D ) exhibit age-dependent intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) and brain lesions. Here, we report that this pathology was associated with the loss of myogenic vasoconstriction, an intrinsic vascular response essential for the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. Electrophysiological analyses showed that the loss of myogenic constriction resulted from blunted pressure-induced smooth muscle cell (SMC) membrane depolarization. Furthermore, we found that dysregulation of membrane potential was associated with impaired Ca 2+ -dependent activation of large-conductance Ca 2+ -activated K + (BK) and transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) cation channels linked to disruptions in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2+ signaling. Col4a1 mutations impair protein folding, which can cause SR stress. Treating Col4a1 +/G1344D mice with 4-phenylbutyrate, a compound that promotes the trafficking of misfolded proteins and alleviates SR stress, restored SR Ca 2+ signaling, maintained BK and TRPM4 channel activity, prevented loss of myogenic tone, and reduced ICHs. We conclude that alterations in SR Ca 2+ handling that impair ion channel activity result in dysregulation of SMC membrane potential and loss of myogenic tone and contribute to age-related cSVD in Col4a1 +/G1344D mice.},

Mata-Daboin et al . found that the Ca 2+ -activated Cl - channel TMEM16A in endothelial cells induced arteries to relax. Multiple vasodilators stimulated the activity of the Ca 2+ channel TRPV4 in endothelial cells, and the resulting Ca 2+ influx activated TMEM16A. These effects were lost in mice with an endothelial cell–specific deficiency in TMEM16A, which also had higher systemic blood pressure than that of control mice. Thus, TMEM16A in endothelial cells induces vasodilation, in contrast to its vasoconstrictive effect in smooth muscle cells (see the Focus by Tammaro). —Wei Wong Systemic blood pressure is acutely controlled by total peripheral resistance as determined by the diameter of small arteries and arterioles, the contractility of which is regulated by endothelial cells lining the lumen of blood vessels. We investigated the physiological functions of the chloride (Cl − ) channel TMEM16A in endothelial cells. TMEM16A channels generated calcium (Ca 2+ )–activated Cl − currents in endothelial cells from control ( TMEM16A fl/fl ) mice that were absent in those from mice with tamoxifen-inducible, endothelial cell–specific knockout of TMEM16A ( TMEM16A ecKO). TMEM16A currents in endothelial cells were activated by the muscarinic receptor agonist acetylcholine and an agonist of the Ca 2+ channel TRPV4, which localized in nanoscale proximity with TMEM16A as assessed by single-molecule localization imaging of endothelial cells. Acetylcholine stimulated TMEM16A currents by activating Ca 2+ influx through surface TRPV4 channels without altering the nanoscale properties of TMEM16A and TRPV4 surface clusters or their colocalization. In pressurized arteries, activation of TMEM16A channels in endothelial cells induced by acetylcholine; TRPV4 channel stimulation; or intraluminal ATP, another vasodilator, produced hyperpolarization and dilation. Furthermore, deficiency of TMEM16A channels in endothelial cells resulted in increased systemic blood pressure in conscious mice. These data indicate that vasodilators stimulate TRPV4 channels, leading to Ca 2+ -dependent activation of nearby TMEM16A channels in endothelial cells to produce arterial hyperpolarization, vasodilation, and reduced blood pressure. Thus, TMEM16A is an anion channel in endothelial cells that regulates arterial contractility and blood pressure.},

Analysis of species-, tissue-, and disease-specific gene expression patterns revealed that the genes encoding the ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 for the chemokine receptor CXCR3 were all expressed in the same context. Specificity was provided by the differential interactions of these chemokines with glycosaminoglycans, which regulated their localization and availability for signaling, suggesting alternative ways to target chemokines therapeutically. —John F. Foley Chemokine-driven leukocyte recruitment is a key component of the immune response and of various diseases. Therapeutically targeting the chemokine system in inflammatory disease has been unsuccessful, which has been attributed to redundancy. We investigated why chemokines instead have specific, specialized functions, as demonstrated by multiple studies. We analyzed the expression of genes encoding chemokines and their receptors across species, tissues, and diseases. This analysis revealed complex expression patterns such that genes encoding multiple chemokines that mediated recruitment of the same leukocyte type were expressed in the same context, such as the genes encoding the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Through biophysical approaches, we showed that these chemokines differentially interacted with extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans (ECM GAGs), which was enhanced by sulfation of specific GAGs. Last, in vivo approaches demonstrated that GAG binding was critical for the CXCL9-dependent recruitment of specific T cell subsets but not of others, irrespective of CXCR3 expression. Our data demonstrate that interactions with ECM GAGs regulated whether chemokines were presented on cell surfaces or remained more soluble, thereby affecting chemokine availability and ensuring specificity of chemokine action. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of chemokine-mediated immune cell recruitment and identify strategies to target specific chemokines during inflammatory disease.},

  abstract     = {Notch signaling plays a prominent but context-dependent role in the progression of prostate cancer because of its effects on cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Wang et al . used a Drosophila tumor model to identify modulators of Notch signaling in tumors. The activation of the kinase JNK blocked the expression of a protease required for Notch activity, resulting in the accumulation of inactive Notch, whereas inhibition of JNK rescued Notch signaling. High JNK activity correlated with low Notch activity in samples from patients with advanced human prostate cancer, supporting a tumor-suppressive role for Notch. Thus, suppressing JNK signaling could restore Notch activity in some advanced prostate cancer tumors. —Amy E. Baek Dysregulated Notch signaling is a common feature of cancer; however, its effects on tumor initiation and progression are highly variable, with Notch having either oncogenic or tumor-suppressive functions in various cancers. To better understand the mechanisms that regulate Notch function in cancer, we studied Notch signaling in a Drosophila tumor model, prostate cancer–derived cell lines, and tissue samples from patients with advanced prostate cancer. We demonstrated that increased activity of the Src-JNK pathway in tumors inactivated Notch signaling because of JNK pathway–mediated inhibition of the expression of the gene encoding the Notch S2 cleavage protease, Kuzbanian, which is critical for Notch activity. Consequently, inactive Notch accumulated in cells, where it was unable to transcribe genes encoding its target proteins, many of which have tumor-suppressive activities. These findings suggest that Src-JNK activity in tumors predicts Notch activity status and that suppressing Src-JNK signaling could restore Notch function in tumors, offering opportunities for diagnosis and targeted therapies for a subset of patients with advanced prostate cancer.},

Hypomorphic (partial loss-of-function) mutations in CARD11 are associated with the development of severe atopic dermatitis, in which T cell receptor signaling is reduced and helper T cell differentiation is skewed to an allergy-associated type 2 phenotype. Here, we found that the docking protein DOK3 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis by suppressing CARD11 activity. DOK3 interacted with CARD11 and decreased its phosphorylation in T cells by recruiting the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 4, thereby dampening downstream signaling. Knocking out Dok3 enhanced the production of the cytokine IFN-γ by T cells, which conferred protection against experimental atopic dermatitis–like skin inflammation in mice. The expression of DOK3 was increased in T cells isolated from patients with atopic dermatitis and inversely correlated with IFNG expression. A subset of hypomorphic CARD11 variants found in patients with atopic dermatitis bound more strongly than wild-type CARD11 to DOK3. Our findings suggest that the strength of the interaction of DOK3 with CARD11 may predispose individuals to developing atopic dermatitis.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical cues sensed by integrins induce cells to produce proteases to remodel the extracellular matrix. Excessive protease production occurs in many degenerative diseases, including osteoarthritis, in which articular cartilage degradation is associated with the genesis of matrix protein fragments that can activate integrins. We investigated the mechanisms by which integrin signals may promote protease production in response to matrix changes in osteoarthritis. Using a fragment of the matrix protein fibronectin (FN) to activate the α5β1 integrin in primary human chondrocytes, we found that endocytosis of the integrin and FN fragment complex drove the production of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-13. Activation of α5β1 by the FN fragment, but not by intact FN, was accompanied by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production initially at the cell surface, then in early endosomes. These ROS-producing endosomes (called redoxosomes) contained the integrin-FN fragment complex, the ROS-producing enzyme NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), and SRC, a redox-regulated kinase that promotes MMP-13 production. In contrast, intact FN was endocytosed and trafficked to recycling endosomes without inducing ROS production. Articular cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis showed increased amounts of SRC and the NOX2 complex component p67 phox . Furthermore, we observed enhanced localization of SRC and p67 phox at early endosomes, suggesting that redoxosomes could transmit and sustain integrin signaling in response to matrix damage. This signaling mechanism not only amplifies the production of matrix-degrading proteases but also establishes a self-perpetuating cycle that contributes to the ongoing degradation of cartilage matrix in osteoarthritis.},

  abstract     = {Lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), characterized by inflammation, vascular permeability, and lung edema, is the major cause of primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation. Here, we investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying lung IR–induced activation of endothelial TRPV4 channels, which play a central role in lung edema and dysfunction after IR. In a left lung hilar-ligation model of IRI in mice, we found that lung IRI increased the efflux of ATP through pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels at the endothelial cell (EC) membrane. Elevated extracellular ATP activated Ca 2+ influx through endothelial TRPV4 channels downstream of purinergic P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R) signaling. P2Y2R-dependent activation of TRPV4 channels was also observed in human and mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelium in ex vivo and in vitro models of IR. Endothelium-specific deletion of P2Y2R, TRPV4, or Panx1 in mice substantially prevented lung IRI–induced activation of endothelial TRPV4 channels and lung edema, inflammation, and dysfunction. These results identify endothelial P2Y2R as a mediator of the pathological sequelae of IRI in the lung and show that disruption of the endothelial Panx1-P2Y2R-TRPV4 signaling pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing lung IRI after transplantation.},

  abstract     = {The cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) is secreted by T helper 17 (T H 17) cells and is beneficial for microbial control; however, it also causes inflammation and pathological tissue remodeling in autoimmunity. Hence, T H 17 cell differentiation and IL-17 production must be tightly regulated, but, to date, this has been defined only in terms of transcriptional control. Phosphatidylinositols are second messengers produced during T cell activation that transduce signals from the T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory receptors at the plasma membrane. Here, we found that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) was enriched in the nuclei of human T H 17 cells, which depended on the kinase PIP5K1α, and that inhibition of PIP5K1α impaired IL-17A production. In contrast, nuclear PIP 2 enrichment was not observed in T H 1 or T H 2 cells, and these cells did not require PIP5K1α for cytokine production. In T cells from people with multiple sclerosis, IL-17 production elicited by myelin basic protein was blocked by PIP5K1α inhibition. IL-17 protein was affected without altering either the abundance or stability of IL17A mRNA in T H 17 cells. Instead, analysis of PIP5K1α-associating proteins revealed that PIP5K1α interacted with ARS2, a nuclear cap-binding complex scaffold protein, to facilitate its binding to IL17A mRNA and subsequent IL-17A protein production. These findings highlight a transcription-independent, translation-dependent mechanism for regulating IL-17A protein production that might be relevant to other cytokines.},

  abstract     = {The cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) has the potential to treat autoimmune disease but is limited by its modest specificity toward immunosuppressive regulatory T (T reg ) cells. IL-2 receptors consist of combinations of α, β, and γ chains of variable affinity and cell specificity. Engineering IL-2 to treat autoimmunity has primarily focused on retaining binding to the relatively T reg -selective, high-affinity receptor while reducing binding to the less selective, low-affinity receptor. However, we found that refining the designs to focus on targeting the high-affinity receptor through avidity effects is key to optimizing T reg selectivity. We profiled the dynamics and dose dependency of signaling responses in primary human immune cells induced by engineered fusions composed of either wild-type IL-2 or mutant forms with altered affinity, valency, and fusion to the antibody Fc region for stability. T reg selectivity and signaling response variations were explained by a model of multivalent binding and dimer-enhanced avidity—a combined measure of the strength, number, and conformation of interaction sites—from which we designed tetravalent IL-2–Fc fusions that had greater T reg selectivity in culture than do current designs. Biasing avidity toward IL2Rα with an asymmetrical multivalent design consisting of one α/β chain–binding and one α chain–binding mutant further enhanced T reg selectivity. Comparative analysis revealed that IL2Rα was the optimal cell surface target for T reg selectivity, indicating that avidity for IL2Rα may be the optimal route to producing IL-2 variants that selectively target T regs .},

Hh binding to the receptor Patched (Ptc) elicits intracellular signaling by relieving Ptc-mediated inhibition of the transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo). We uncovered a role for the lipid phosphatidic acid (PA) in the regulation of the Hh pathway in Drosophila melanogaster . Deleting the Ptc C-terminal tail or mutating the predicted PA-binding sites within it prevented Ptc from inhibiting Smo in wing discs and in cultured cells. The C-terminal tail of Ptc directly interacted with PA in vitro, an association that was reduced by Hh, and increased the amount of PA at the plasma membrane in cultured cells. Smo also interacted with PA in vitro through a binding pocket located in the transmembrane region, and mutating residues in this pocket reduced Smo activity in vivo and in cells. By genetically manipulating PA amounts in vivo or treating cultured cells with PA, we demonstrated that PA promoted Smo activation. Our findings suggest that Ptc may sequester PA in the absence of Hh and release it in the presence of Hh, thereby increasing the amount of PA that is locally available to promote Smo activation.},

Despite using the same Janus-activated kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling cascade, type I and III IFN receptors differ in the magnitude and dynamics of their signaling in terms of STAT phosphorylation, gene transcription, and antiviral responses. These differences are not due to ligand-binding affinity and receptor abundance. Here, we investigated the ability of the intracellular domains (ICDs) of IFN receptors to differentiate between type I and III IFN signaling. We engineered synthetic, heterodimeric type I and III IFN receptors that were stably expressed at similar amounts in human cells and responded to a common ligand. We found that our synthetic type I IFN receptors stimulated STAT phosphorylation and gene expression to greater extents than did the corresponding type III IFN receptors. Furthermore, we identified short “box motifs” within ICDs that bind to JAK1 that were sufficient to encode differences between the type I and III IFN receptors. Together, our results indicate that specific regions within the ICDs of IFN receptor subunits encode different downstream signaling strengths that enable type I and III IFN receptors to produce distinct signaling outcomes.},

  abstract     = {The ubiquitination-dependent processing of NF-κB2 (also known as p100) is a critical step in the activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. We investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating this process and showed that TRIM55 was the E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediated the ubiquitination of p100 and coordinated its processing. TRIM55 deficiency impaired noncanonical NF-κB activation and B cell function. Mice with a B cell–specific Trim55 deficiency exhibited reduced germinal center formation and antibody production. These mice showed less severe symptoms than those of control mice upon the induction of a systemic lupus–like disease, suggesting B cell–intrinsic functions of TRIM55 in humoral immune responses and autoimmunity. Mechanistically, the ubiquitination of p100 mediated by TRIM55 was crucial for p100 processing by VCP, an ATPase that mediates ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation by the proteasome. Furthermore, we found that TRIM55 facilitated the interaction between TRIM21 and VCP as well as TRIM21-mediated K63-ubiquitination of VCP, both of which were indispensable for the formation of the VCP-UFD1-NPL4 complex and p100 processing. Together, our results reveal a mechanism by which TRIM55 fine-tunes p100 processing and regulates B cell–dependent immune responses in vivo, highlighting TRIM55 as a potential therapeutic target for lupus-like disease.},

  abstract     = {Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) is an inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor that restrains autoimmune and antitumor responses, but its evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic tail lacks classical inhibitory motifs. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) is an established LAG3 ligand, and fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1), lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin), and Galectin-3 have been proposed as alternative binding partners that play important roles in LAG3 function. Here, we used a fluorescent human T cell reporter system to study the function of LAG3. We found that LAG3 reduced the response to T cell receptor stimulation in the presence of MHC class II molecules to a lesser extent compared with the receptor programmed cell death protein 1. Analysis of deletion mutants demonstrated that the RRFSALE motif in the cytoplasmic tail of LAG3 was necessary and sufficient for LAG3-mediated inhibition. In this system, FGL1, but not LSECtin or Galectin-3, acted as a LAG3 ligand that weakly induced inhibition. LAG3-blocking antibodies attenuated LAG3-mediated inhibition in our reporter cells and enhanced reporter cell activation even in the absence of LAG3 ligands, indicating that they could potentially enhance T cell responses independently of their blocking effect.},

  abstract     = {Human neutrophils respond to multiple chemoattractants to guide their migration from the vasculature to sites of infection and injury, where they clear pathogens and amplify inflammation. To properly focus their responses during this complex navigation, neutrophils prioritize pathogen- and injury-derived signals over long-range inflammatory signals, such as the leukotriene LTB4, secreted by host cells. Different chemoattractants can also drive qualitatively different modes of migration even though their receptors couple to the same Gα i family of G proteins. Here, we used live-cell imaging to demonstrate that the responses differed in their signaling dynamics. Low-priority chemoattractants caused transient responses, whereas responses to high-priority chemoattractants were sustained. We observed this difference in both primary neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells, for downstream signaling mediated by Ca 2+ , a major regulator of secretion, and Cdc42, a primary regulator of polarity and cell steering. The rapid attenuation of Cdc42 activation in response to LTB4 depended on the phosphorylation sites Thr 308 and Ser 310 in the carboxyl-terminal tail of its receptor LTB4R in a manner independent of endocytosis. Mutation of these residues to alanine impaired chemoattractant prioritization, although it did not affect chemoattractant-dependent differences in migration persistence. Our results indicate that distinct temporal regulation of shared signaling pathways distinguishes between receptors and contributes to chemoattractant prioritization.},

We found that human B cell responses to membrane-presented antigens required the function of Piezo1, a plasma membrane mechanosensitive cation channel. Simply making contact with a glass probe induced calcium (Ca 2+ ) fluxes in B cells that were blocked by the Piezo1 inhibitor GsMTx4. When placed on glass surfaces, the plasma membrane tension of B cells increased, which stimulated Ca 2+ influx and spreading of B cells over the glass surface, which was blocked by the Piezo1 inhibitor OB-1. B cell responses to membrane-presented antigens but not to soluble antigens were inhibited both by Piezo1 inhibitors and by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Piezo1. Thus, the activation of Piezo1 defines an essential event in B cell activation to membrane-presented antigens that may be exploited to improve the efficacy of vaccines.},

Here, we performed an integrated analysis of the dynamics of virus replication and the host cell transcriptional response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using human Caco-2 colon cancer cells as a model. Time-resolved RNA sequencing revealed that, upon infection, cells immediately transcriptionally activated genes associated with inflammatory pathways that mediate the antiviral response, which was followed by an increase in the expression of genes involved in ribosome and mitochondria function, thus suggesting rapid alterations in protein production and cellular energy supply. At later stages, between 24 and 48 hours after infection, the expression of genes involved in metabolic processes—in particular, those related to xenobiotic metabolism—was decreased. Mathematical modeling incorporating SARS-CoV-2 replication suggested that SARS-CoV-2 proteins inhibited the host antiviral response and that virus transcripts exceeded the translation capacity of the host cells. Targeting kinase-dependent pathways that exhibited increases in transcription in host cells was as effective as a virus-targeted inhibitor at repressing viral replication. Our findings in this model system delineate a sequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactions that may facilitate the identification of druggable host pathways to suppress infection.},

Here, we discovered that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MIR99AHG regulated alternative splicing to alter the activity of a chromatin remodeler and promote metastatic behaviors in colorectal cancer (CRC). MIR99AHG was abundant in invasive CRC cells and metastatic tumors from patients and promoted motility and invasion in cultured CRC cells. MIR99AHG bound to and stabilized the RNA splicing factor PTBP1, and this complex increased cassette exon inclusion in the mRNA encoding the chromatin remodeling gene SMARCA1 . Specifically, MIR99AHG altered the nature of PTBP1 binding to the splice sites on intron 12 of SMARCA1 pre-mRNA, thereby triggering a splicing switch from skipping to including exon 13 to produce the long isoform, SMARCA1-L. SMARCA1, but not SMARCA1-L, suppressed invadopodia formation, cell migration, and invasion. Analysis of CRC samples revealed that the abundance of MIR99AHG transcript positively correlated with that of SMARCA1-L mRNA and PTBP1 protein and with poor prognosis in patients with CRC. Furthermore, TGF-β1 secretion from cancer-associated fibroblasts increased MIR99AHG expression in CRC cells. Our findings identify an lncRNA that is induced by cues from the tumor microenvironment and that interacts with PTBP1 to regulate alternative splicing, potentially providing a therapeutic target and predictive biomarker for metastatic CRC.},

Here, we characterized the role of a shorter isoform, RUBCN 100 , as an autophagy-promoting factor in B cells. RUBCN 100 was translated from alternative translation initiation sites and lacked the RUN domain of the longer, previously characterized RUBCN 130 isoform. Specific deficiency of RUBCN 130 in B cells enhanced autophagy, which promoted memory B cell generation. In contrast to RUBCN 130 , which is localized in late endosomes and lysosomes and suppresses the enzymatic activity of VPS34, an effect thought to mediated by its RUN domain, RUBCN 100 was preferentially located in early endosomes and enhanced VPS34 activity, presumably because of the absence of the RUN domain. Furthermore, RUBCN 100 , but not RUBCN 130 , enhanced autophagy and suppressed mTORC1 activation.

Here, we investigated whether TSLP contributes to allergic inflammation by directly stimulating human CD4 + T cells and whether this process is operational in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a disease linked to variants in TSLP . We showed that about 10\% of esophageal-derived memory CD4 + T cells from individuals with EoE and less than 3\% of cells from control individuals expressed the receptor for TSLP and directly responded to TSLP, as determined by measuring the phosphorylation of STAT5, a transcription factor activated downstream of TSLP stimulation. Accordingly, increased numbers of TSLP-responsive memory CD4 + T cells were present in the circulation of individuals with EoE. TSLP increased the proliferation of CD4 + T cells, enhanced type 2 cytokine production, induced the increased abundance of its own receptor, and modified the expression of 212 genes. The epigenetic response to TSLP was associated with an enrichment in BATF and IRF4 chromatin-binding sites, and these transcription factors were induced by TSLP, providing a feed-forward loop. The numbers of circulating and esophageal CD4 + T cells responsive to TSLP correlated with the numbers of esophageal eosinophils, supporting a potential functional role for TSLP in driving the pathogenesis of EoE and providing the basis for a blood-based diagnostic test based on the extent of TSLP-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in circulating CD4 + T cells. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic value of TSLP inhibitors for the treatment of EoE.},

We showed that fluoxetine treatment of murine or human mast cells reduced IgE-mediated degranulation, cytokine production, and inflammatory lipid secretion, as well as signaling mediated by the mast cell activator ATP. In a mouse model of systemic anaphylaxis, fluoxetine reduced hypothermia and cytokine production. Fluoxetine was also effective in a model of allergic airway inflammation, where it reduced bronchial responsiveness and inflammation.

  abstract     = {In eukaryotes, lactate produced during glycolysis is involved in regulating multiple metabolic processes through lysine lactylation (Kla). To explore the potential link between metabolism and Kla in prokaryotes, we investigated the distribution of Kla in the cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans during planktonic growth in low-sugar conditions and in biofilm-promoting, high-sugar conditions. We identified 1869 Kla sites in 469 proteins under these two conditions, with the biofilm growth state showing a greater number of lactylated sites and proteins. Although high sugar increased Kla globally, it reduced lactylation of RNA polymerase subunit α (RpoA) at Lys 173 . Lactylation at this residue inhibited the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, a major constituent of the cariogenic biofilm. The Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily enzyme GNAT13 exhibited lysine lactyltransferase activity in cells and lactylated Lys 173 in RpoA in vitro. Either GNAT13 overexpression or lactylation of Lys 173 in RpoA inhibited biofilm formation. These results provide an overview of the distribution and potential functions of Kla and improve our understanding of the role of lactate in the metabolic regulation of prokaryotes.},

ORAI1 was highly expressed in tumor samples from patients with oral cancer, and ORAI1 activation caused sustained Ca 2+ influx in human oral cancer cells. RNA-seq analysis showed that ORAI1 regulated many genes encoding oral cancer markers such as metalloproteases (MMPs) and pain modulators. Compared with control cells, oral cancer cells lacking ORAI1 formed smaller tumors that elicited decreased allodynia when inoculated into mouse paws. Exposure of trigeminal ganglia neurons to MMP1 evoked an increase in action potentials. These data demonstrate an important role of ORAI1 in oral cancer progression and pain, potentially by controlling MMP1 abundance.},

  abstract     = {Cell stemness is characterized by quiescence, pluripotency, and long-term self-renewal capacity. Therapy-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are the primary cause of relapse in patients with chronic and acute myeloid leukemia (CML and AML). However, the same signaling pathways frequently support stemness in both LSCs and normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), making LSCs difficult to therapeutically target. In cell lines and patient samples, we found that interleukin-33 (IL-33) signaling promoted stemness only in leukemia cells in a subtype-specific manner. The IL-33 receptor ST2 was abundant on the surfaces of CD34 + BCR/ABL1 CML and CD34 + AML cells harboring AML1/ETO and DEK/NUP214 translocations or deletion of chromosome 9q [del(9q)]. The cell surface abundance of ST2, which was lower or absent on other leukemia subtypes and HSCs, correlated with stemness, activated Wnt signaling, and repressed Notch signaling. IL-33–ST2 signaling promoted the maintenance and expansion of AML1/ETO–, DEK/NUP214–, and BCR/ABL1–positive LSCs in culture and in mice by activating Wnt, MAPK, and NF-κB signaling. Wnt signaling and its inhibition of the Notch pathway up-regulated the expression of the gene encoding ST2, thus forming a cell-autonomous loop. IL-33–ST2 signaling promoted the resistance of CML cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) nilotinib and of AML cells to standard chemotherapy. Thus, inhibiting IL-33–ST2 signaling may target LSCs to overcome resistance to chemotherapy or TKIs in these subtypes of leukemia.},

  abstract     = {Signaling by the kinase cascade composed of Raf, MEK, and ERK is critical for animal development and is often inappropriately activated in human malignancies. We sought to identify factors that control signaling mediated by the Caenorhabditis elegans Raf ortholog LIN-45. A genetic screen showed that the degradation of LIN-45 required the E3/E4 ubiquitin ligase UFD-2. Both UFD-2 and its partner, the ATP-dependent segregase CDC-48, were required for the developmental regulation of LIN-45 protein abundance. We showed that UFD-2 acted in the same pathway as the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF SEL-10 to decrease LIN-45 abundance in cells in which Raf-MEK-ERK signaling was most highly active. UFD-2 also reduced the protein abundance of activated LIN-45 carrying a mutation equivalent to the cancer-associated BRAF(V600E) variant. Our structure-function studies showed that the disruption of LIN-45 domains that mediate protein-protein interactions, including the conserved cysteine-rich domain and 14-3-3 binding motifs, were required for UFD-2–independent degradation of LIN-45. We propose a model in which UFD-2 and CDC-48 act downstream of SCF SEL-10 to remove LIN-45 from its protein interaction partners and facilitate proteasomal targeting and degradation. These findings imply that UFD-2 and CDC-48 may be important for Raf degradation during normal and oncogenic Ras and MAPK signaling in mammalian cells.},

TPC2 toggles between PI(3, 5)P 2 -induced, sodium ion (Na + )–selective and NAADP-induced, Ca 2+ –permeable states in response to these cues. To address the molecular basis of polymodal gating and ion-selectivity switching, we investigated the mechanism by which NAADP and its synthetic functional agonist, TPC2-A1-N, induced Ca 2+ release through TPC2 in human cells. Whereas NAADP required the NAADP-binding proteins JPT2 and LSM12 to evoke endogenous calcium ion signals, TPC2-A1-N did not. Residues in TPC2 that bind to PI(3, 5)P 2 were required for channel activation by NAADP but not for activation by TPC2-A1-N. The cryptic voltage-sensing region of TPC2 was required for the actions of TPC2-A1-N and PI(3, 5)P 2 but not for those of NAADP. These data mechanistically distinguish natural and synthetic agonist action at TPC2 despite convergent effects on Ca 2+ permeability and delineate a route for pharmacologically correcting impaired NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ signals.},

We investigated whether and how the NAADP-binding proteins Jupiter microtubule–associated homolog 2 (JPT2) and like-Sm protein 12 (LSM12) contributed to NAADP-TPC-Ca 2+ signaling in human cells. Biochemical and functional analyses revealed that recombinant JPT2 and LSM12 both bound to NAADP with high affinity and that endogenous JPT2 and LSM12 independently associated with TPC1 and TPC2. On the basis of knockout and rescue analyses, both NAADP-binding proteins were required to support NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ signaling and contributed to endolysosomal trafficking of pseudotyped coronavirus particles.

Here, we showed that US28 increased the malignancy of U251 glioblastoma cells by enhancing signaling mediated by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid that stimulates oncogenic pathways in glioblastoma. US28 expression increased the abundance of the key components of the S1P signaling axis, including an enzyme that generates S1P [sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1)], an S1P receptor [S1P receptor 1 (S1P 1 )], and S1P itself. Enhanced S1P signaling promoted glioblastoma cell proliferation and survival by activating the kinases AKT and CHK1 and the transcriptional regulators cMYC and STAT3 and by increasing the abundance of cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), driving several feed-forward signaling loops. Inhibition of S1P signaling abrogated the proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of US28. US28 also activated the S1P signaling axis in HCMV-infected cells. This study uncovers central roles for S1P and CIP2A in feed-forward signaling that contributes to the US28-mediated exacerbation of glioblastoma.},

Here, we demonstrate that engineering approaches can be used to refocus an existing antibody that neutralizes one virus but not a related virus. Through a rapid affinity maturation strategy, we engineered CR3022, a SARS-CoV-1–neutralizing antibody, to bind to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 with &gt;1000-fold increased affinity. The engineered CR3022 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 and provided prophylactic protection from viral challenge in a small animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Deep sequencing throughout the engineering process paired with crystallographic analysis of engineered CR3022 elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which the antibody can accommodate sequence differences in the epitopes between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. This workflow provides a blueprint for the rapid broadening of neutralization of an antibody from one virus to closely related but resistant viruses.},

  abstract     = {G protein–coupled receptors engage both G proteins and β-arrestins, and their coupling can be biased by ligands and mutations. Here, to resolve structural elements and mechanisms underlying effector coupling to the angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R), we combined alanine scanning mutagenesis of the entire sequence of the receptor with pharmacological profiling of Gα q and β-arrestin engagement to mutant receptors and molecular dynamics simulations. We showed that Gα q coupling to AT1R involved a large number of residues spread across the receptor, whereas fewer structural regions of the receptor contributed to β-arrestin coupling regulation. Residue stretches in transmembrane domain 4 conferred β-arrestin bias and represented an important structural element in AT1R for functional selectivity. Furthermore, we identified allosteric small-molecule binding sites that were enclosed by communities of residues that produced biased signaling when mutated. Last, we showed that allosteric communication within AT1R emanating from the Gα q coupling site spread beyond the orthosteric AngII-binding site and across different regions of the receptor, including currently unresolved structural regions. Our findings reveal structural elements and mechanisms within AT1R that bias Gα q and β-arrestin coupling and that could be harnessed to design biased receptors for research purposes and to develop allosteric modulators.},

  abstract     = {Changes in metabolism of macrophages are required to sustain macrophage activation in response to different stimuli. We showed that the cytokine TGF-β (transforming growth factor–β) regulates glycolysis in macrophages independently of inflammatory cytokine production and affects survival in mouse models of sepsis. During macrophage activation, TGF-β increased the expression and activity of the glycolytic enzyme PFKL (phosphofructokinase-1 liver type) and promoted glycolysis but suppressed the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The increase in glycolysis was mediated by an mTOR–c-MYC–dependent pathway, whereas the inhibition of cytokine production was due to activation of the transcriptional coactivator SMAD3 and suppression of the activity of the proinflammatory transcription factors AP-1, NF-κB, and STAT1. In mice with LPS-induced endotoxemia and experimentally induced sepsis, the TGF-β–induced enhancement in macrophage glycolysis led to decreased survival, which was associated with increased blood coagulation. Analysis of septic patient cohorts revealed that the expression of PFKL , TGFBRI (which encodes a TGF-β receptor), and F13A1 (which encodes a coagulation factor) in myeloid cells positively correlated with COVID-19 disease. Thus, these results suggest that TGF-β is a critical regulator of macrophage metabolism and could be a therapeutic target in patients with sepsis.},

  abstract     = {Notch signaling relies on ligand-induced proteolysis of the transmembrane receptor Notch to liberate a nuclear effector that drives cell fate decisions. Upon ligand binding, sequential cleavage of Notch by the transmembrane protease ADAM10 and the intracellular protease γ-secretase releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus and forms a complex that induces target gene transcription. To map the location and timing of the individual steps required for the proteolysis and movement of Notch from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, we used proximity labeling with quantitative, multiplexed mass spectrometry to monitor the interaction partners of endogenous NOTCH2 after ligand stimulation in the presence of a γ-secretase inhibitor and as a function of time after inhibitor removal. Our studies showed that γ-secretase–mediated cleavage of NOTCH2 occurred in an intracellular compartment and that formation of nuclear complexes and recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes occurred within 45 min of inhibitor washout. These findings provide a detailed spatiotemporal map tracking the path of Notch from the plasma membrane to the nucleus and identify signaling events that are potential targets for modulating Notch activity.},

In BRAF-driven melanoma cells treated with BRAF inhibitors, subpopulations of cells escape drug-induced quiescence through a nongenetic manner of adaptation and resume slow proliferation. Here, we found that this phenomenon is common to many cancer types driven by EGFR, KRAS, or BRAF mutations in response to multiple, clinically approved MAPK pathway inhibitors. In 2D cultures and 3D spheroid models of various cancer cell lines, a subset of cells escaped drug-induced quiescence within 4 days to resume proliferation. These “escapee” cells exhibited DNA replication deficits, accumulated DNA lesions, and mounted a stress response that depended on the ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related (ATR) kinase. We further identified that components of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway are recruited to sites of mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS) in escapee cells, enabling successful completion of cell division. Analysis of patient tumor samples and clinical data correlated disease progression with an increase in DNA replication stress response factors. Our findings suggest that many MAPK pathway–mutant cancers rapidly escape drug action and that suppressing early stress tolerance pathways may achieve more durable clinical responses to MAPK pathway inhibitors.},

  abstract     = {CaMKII has molecular memory functions because transient calcium ion stimuli can induce long-lasting increases in its synaptic localization and calcium ion–independent (autonomous) activity, thereby leaving memory traces of calcium ion stimuli beyond their duration. The synaptic effects of two mechanisms that induce CaMKII autonomy are well studied: autophosphorylation at threonine-286 and binding to GluN2B. Here, we examined the neuronal functions of additional autonomy mechanisms: nitrosylation and oxidation of the CaMKII regulatory domain. We generated a knock-in mouse line with mutations that render the CaMKII regulatory domain nitrosylation/oxidation-incompetent, CaMKII ΔSNO , and found that it had deficits in memory and synaptic plasticity that were similar to those in aged wild-type mice. In addition, similar to aged wild-type mice, in which CaMKII was hyponitrosylated, but unlike mice with impairments of other CaMKII autonomy mechanisms, CaMKII ΔSNO mice showed reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) when induced by theta-burst stimulation but not high-frequency stimulation (HFS). As in aged wild-type mice, the HFS-LTP in the young adult CaMKII ΔSNO mice required L-type voltage-gated calcium ion channels. The effects in aged mice were likely caused by the loss of nitrosylation because no decline in CaMKII oxidation was detected. In hippocampal neurons, nitrosylation of CaMKII induced its accumulation at synapses under basal conditions in a manner mediated by GluN2B binding, like after LTP stimuli. However, LTP-induced synaptic CaMKII accumulation did not require nitrosylation. Thus, an aging-associated decrease in CaMKII nitrosylation may cause impairments by chronic synaptic effects, such as the decrease in basal synaptic CaMKII.},

This involves transsynaptic assembly between the dystroglycan-dystrophin complex on the photoreceptor and the orphan receptor GPR179 on the bipolar cell, which is mediated by the extracellular matrix protein pikachurin (also known as EGFLAM). This complex plays a critical role in the synaptic organization of photoreceptors and signal transmission, and mutations affecting its components cause blinding disorders in humans. Here, we investigated the structural organization and molecular mechanisms by which pikachurin orchestrates transsynaptic assembly and solved structures of the human pikachurin domains by x-ray crystallography and of the GPR179-pikachurin complex by single-particle, cryo–electron microscopy. The structures reveal molecular recognition principles of pikachurin by the Cache domains of GPR179 and show how the interaction is involved in the transsynaptic alignment of the signaling machinery. Together, these data provide a structural basis for understanding the synaptic organization of photoreceptors and ocular pathology.},

We identified ERK2 binding sites in the MYC promoter and detected ERK2 at the promoter in various serum-stimulated cell types. Expression of nuclear-localized ERK2 constructs in serum-starved cells revealed that ERK2 in the nucleus—regardless of its kinase activity—increased MYC mRNA expression and MYC protein abundance. ERK2 bound to the promoter through its amino-terminal insert domain and to the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK9 (which activates RNA polymerase II) through its carboxyl-terminal conserved docking domain. Both interactions were essential for ERK2-induced MYC expression, and depleting ERK impaired CDK9 occupancy and RNA polymerase II progression at the MYC promoter. Artificially tethering CDK9 to the MYC promoter by fusing it to the ERK2 insert domain was sufficient to stimulate MYC expression in serum-starved cells. Our findings demonstrate a role for ERK2 at the MYC promoter acting as a kinase-independent anchor for the recruitment of CDK9 to promote MYC expression.},

  abstract     = {Helicobacter pylori strains that deliver the oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells are the major etiologic agents of upper gastric diseases including gastric cancer. CagA promotes gastric carcinogenesis through interactions with multiple host proteins. Here, we show that CagA also disrupts Wnt-dependent planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP), which orients cells within the plane of an epithelium and coordinates collective cell behaviors such as convergent extension to enable epithelial elongation during development. Ectopic expression of CagA in Xenopus laevis embryos impaired gastrulation, neural tube formation, and axis elongation, processes driven by convergent extension movements that depend on the Wnt/PCP pathway. Mice specifically expressing CagA in the stomach epithelium had longer pyloric glands and mislocalization of the tetraspanin proteins VANGL1 and VANGL2 (VANGL1/2), which are critical components of Wnt/PCP signaling. The increased pyloric gland length was due to hyperproliferation of cells at the gland base, where Lgr5 + stem and progenitor cells reside, and was associated with fewer differentiated enteroendocrine cells. In cultured human gastric epithelial cells, the N terminus of CagA interacted with the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of VANGL1/2, which impaired Wnt/PCP signaling by inducing the mislocalization of VANGL1/2 from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. Thus, CagA may contribute to the development of gastric cancer by subverting a Wnt/PCP-dependent mechanism that restrains pyloric gland stem cell proliferation and promotes enteroendocrine differentiation.},

TRPM7 expression was decreased in hippocampal tissue samples from patients with AD and two mouse models of AD ( APP/PS1 and 5XFAD ). In cultures of hippocampal neurons from mice, overexpression of full-length TRPM7 or of its functional kinase domain M7CK prevented synapse loss induced by exogenous Aβ. In contrast, this neuroprotection was not afforded by overexpression of either the functional ion channel portion alone or a TRPM7 mutant lacking kinase activity. M7CK overexpression in the hippocampus of young and old 5XFAD mice prevented and reversed, respectively, memory deficits, synapse loss, and Aβ plaque accumulation. In both neurons and mice, M7CK interacted with and activated the metalloprotease MMP14 to promote Aβ degradation. Thus, TRPM7 loss in patients with AD may contribute to the associated Aβ pathology.},

Knockin mice expressing a cPLA 2 mutant lacking the C1P binding site ( cPLA 2 α KI/KI mice) showed enhanced and sustained neutrophil infiltration into wounds and the peritoneum during the inflammatory phase of wound healing and sepsis, respectively. The mice exhibited improved wound healing and reduced susceptibility to sepsis, which was associated with an increase in anti-inflammatory N2-type neutrophils demonstrating proresolution behaviors and a decrease in proinflammatory N1-type neutrophils. The N2 polarization of cPLA 2 α KI/KI neutrophils resulted from increased oxoeicosanoid biosynthesis and autocrine signaling through the oxoeicosanoid receptor OXER1 and partially depended on OXER1-dependent inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Thus, C1P binding to cPLA 2 α suppresses neutrophil N2 polarization, thereby impairing wound healing and the response to sepsis.},

The positioning of the cleavage plane is critical to faithful cell division and is determined by the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF)–mediated activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoA and the conserved motor protein complex centralspindlin. Here, we explored whether and how centralspindlin mediates the positioning of RhoGEF. In dividing neuroblasts from Drosophila melanogaster , we observed that immediately before cleavage, first centralspindlin and then RhoGEF localized to the sites where cleavage subsequently initiated. Using in vitro assays with purified Drosophila proteins and stabilized microtubules, we found that centralspindlin directly transported RhoGEF as cargo along single microtubules and sequestered it at microtubule plus-ends for prolonged periods of time. In addition, the binding of RhoGEF to centralspindlin appeared to stimulate centralspindlin motor activity. Thus, the motor activity and microtubule association of centralspindlin can translocate RhoGEF to areas where microtubule plus-ends are abundant, such as at overlapping astral microtubules, to locally activate RhoA and accurately position the cleavage plane during cell division.},

  abstract     = {Receptor-type protein phosphatase α (RPTPα) promotes fibroblast-dependent arthritis and fibrosis, in part, by enhancing the activation of the kinase SRC. Synovial fibroblasts lining joint tissue mediate inflammation and tissue damage, and their infiltration into adjacent tissues promotes disease progression. RPTPα includes an ectodomain and two intracellular catalytic domains (D1 and D2) and, in cancer cells, undergoes inhibitory homodimerization, which is dependent on a D1 wedge motif. Through single-molecule localization and labeled molecule interaction microscopy of migrating synovial fibroblasts, we investigated the role of RPTPα dimerization in the activation of SRC, the migration of synovial fibroblasts, and joint damage in a mouse model of arthritis. RPTPα clustered with other RPTPα and with SRC molecules in the context of actin-rich structures. A known dimerization-impairing mutation in the wedge motif (P210L/P211L) and the deletion of the D2 domain reduced RPTPα-RPTPα clustering; however, it also unexpectedly reduced RPTPα-SRC association. The same mutations also reduced recruitment of RPTPα to actin-rich structures and inhibited SRC activation and cellular migration. An antibody against the RPTPα ectodomain that prevented the clustering of RPTPα also inhibited RPTPα-SRC association and SRC activation and attenuated fibroblast migration and joint damage in arthritic mice. A catalytically inactivating RPTPα-C469S mutation protected mice from arthritis and reduced SRC activation in synovial fibroblasts. We conclude that RPTPα clustering retains it to actin-rich structures to promote SRC-mediated fibroblast migration and can be modulated through the extracellular domain.},

Here, we showed that peripheral naïve T cells in mice required the continued expression of IKK1 and IKK2 for their survival; however, the loss of these cells was only partially prevented when extrinsic cell death pathways were blocked by either deleting Casp8 (which encodes the apoptosis-inducing caspase 8) or inhibiting the kinase activity of RIPK1. Inducible deletion of Rela (which encodes the NF-κB p65 subunit) in mature CD4 + T cells also resulted in loss of naïve CD4 + T cells and in reduced abundance of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) encoded by the NF-κB target Il7r , revealing an additional reliance upon NF-κB for the long-term survival of mature T cells. Together, these data indicate that the IKK-dependent survival of naïve CD4 + T cells depends on both repression of extrinsic cell death pathways and activation of an NF-κB–dependent survival program.},

We elucidated the role of the transcription factor X-box–binding protein-1 (XBP1) in the induction of the T H 2 cell response through its role in generating TIM4 + DCs. We found that XBP1 was required for TIM4 mRNA and protein expression in airway DCs in response to the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and that this pathway was required for TIM4 expression on DCs in response to the allergens PM2.5 and Derf1. The IL-2–XBP1–TIM4 axis in DCs contributed to Derf1/PM2.5-induced, aberrant T H 2 cell responses in vivo. An interaction between the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Son of sevenless-1 (SOS1) and the GTPase RAS promoted XBP1 and TIM4 production in DCs. Targeting the XBP1-TIM4 pathway in DCs prevented or alleviated experimental airway allergy. Together, these data suggest that XBP1 is required for T H 2 cell responses by inducing the development of TIM4 + DCs, which depends on the IL-2–XBP1–SOS1 axis. This signaling pathway provides potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of T H 2 cell–dependent inflammation or allergic diseases.},

  abstract     = {Transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling is a critical driver of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression. In SMAD-dependent TGF-β signaling, activation of the TGF-β receptor complex stimulates the phosphorylation of the intracellular receptor-associated SMADs (SMAD2 and SMAD3), which translocate to the nucleus to promote target gene expression. SMAD7 inhibits signaling through the pathway by promoting the polyubiquitination of the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI). We identified an unannotated nuclear long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that we designated LETS1 (lncRNA enforcing TGF-β signaling 1) that was not only increased but also perpetuated by TGF-β signaling. Loss of LETS1 attenuated TGF-β–induced EMT and migration in breast and lung cancer cells in vitro and extravasation of the cells in a zebrafish xenograft model. LETS1 potentiated TGF-β–SMAD signaling by stabilizing cell surface TβRI, thereby forming a positive feedback loop. Specifically, LETS1 inhibited TβRI polyubiquitination by binding to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT5) and inducing the expression of the gene encoding the orphan nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1), a component of a destruction complex for SMAD7. Overall, our findings characterize LETS1 as an EMT-promoting lncRNA that potentiates signaling through TGF-β receptor complexes.},

Integrins facilitate T cell binding to endothelial cells and ECM proteins. Here, we report that Ca 2+ microdomains observed in the absence of T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 stimulation are initial signaling events triggered by adhesion to ECM proteins that increase the sensitivity of primary murine T cells to activation. Adhesion to the ECM proteins collagen IV and laminin-1 increased the number of Ca 2+ microdomains in a manner dependent on the kinase FAK, phospholipase C (PLC), and all three inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R) subtypes and promoted the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFAT-1. Mathematical modeling predicted that the formation of adhesion-dependent Ca 2+ microdomains required the concerted activity of two to six IP 3 Rs and ORAI1 channels to achieve the increase in the Ca 2+ concentration in the ER–plasma membrane junction that was observed experimentally and that required SOCE. Further, adhesion-dependent Ca 2+ microdomains were important for the magnitude of the TCR-induced activation of T cells on collagen IV as assessed by the global Ca 2+ response and NFAT-1 nuclear translocation. Thus, adhesion to collagen IV and laminin-1 sensitizes T cells through a mechanism involving the formation of Ca 2+ microdomains, and blocking this low-level sensitization decreases T cell activation upon TCR engagement.},

SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, directly antagonizes these defenses, leading to delayed immune engagement in the lungs that materializes only as cells succumb to infection and are phagocytosed. Leveraging the golden hamster model of COVID-19, we sought to understand the dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 infection in the airways and the systemic host response that ensues. We found that early SARS-CoV-2 replication was largely confined to the respiratory tract and olfactory system and, to a lesser extent, the heart and gastrointestinal tract but generated a host antiviral response in every organ as a result of circulating type I and III interferons. Moreover, we showed that diminishing the response in the airways by immunosuppression or administration of SARS-CoV-2 intravenously resulted in decreased immune priming, viremia, and increased viral tropism, including productive infection of the liver, kidney, spleen, and brain. Last, we showed that productive infection of the airways was required for mounting an effective and system-wide antiviral response. Together, these data illustrate how COVID-19 can result in diverse clinical presentations in which disease outcomes can be a by-product of the speed and strength of immune engagement. These studies provide additional evidence for the mechanistic basis of the diverse clinical presentations of COVID-19 and highlight the ability of the respiratory tract to generate a systemic immune defense after pathogen recognition.},

  abstract     = {The activation of at least 23 different mammalian kinases requires the phosphorylation of their hydrophobic motifs by the kinase PDK1. A linker connects the phosphoinositide-binding PH domain to the catalytic domain, which contains a docking site for substrates called the PIF pocket. Here, we used a chemical biology approach to show that PDK1 existed in equilibrium between at least three distinct conformations with differing substrate specificities. The inositol polyphosphate derivative HYG8 bound to the PH domain and disrupted PDK1 dimerization by stabilizing a monomeric conformation in which the PH domain associated with the catalytic domain and the PIF pocket was accessible. In the absence of lipids, HYG8 potently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt (also termed PKB) but did not affect the intrinsic activity of PDK1 or the phosphorylation of SGK, which requires docking to the PIF pocket. In contrast, the small-molecule valsartan bound to the PIF pocket and stabilized a second distinct monomeric conformation. Our study reveals dynamic conformations of full-length PDK1 in which the location of the linker and the PH domain relative to the catalytic domain determines the selective phosphorylation of PDK1 substrates. The study further suggests new approaches for the design of drugs to selectively modulate signaling downstream of PDK1.},

  abstract     = {Brain swelling causes morbidity and mortality in various brain injuries and diseases but lacks effective treatments. Brain swelling is linked to the influx of water into perivascular astrocytes through channels called aquaporins. Water accumulation in astrocytes increases their volume, which contributes to brain swelling. Using a mouse model of severe ischemic stroke, we identified a potentially targetable mechanism that promoted the cell surface localization of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) in perivascular astrocytic endfeet, which completely ensheathe the brain’s capillaries. Cerebral ischemia increased the abundance of the heteromeric cation channel SUR1-TRPM4 and of the Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger NCX1 in the endfeet of perivascular astrocytes. The influx of Na + through SUR1-TRPM4 induced Ca 2+ transport into cells through NCX1 operating in reverse mode, thus raising the intra-endfoot concentration of Ca 2+ . This increase in Ca 2+ stimulated calmodulin-dependent translocation of AQP4 to the plasma membrane and water influx, which led to cellular edema and brain swelling. Pharmacological inhibition or astrocyte-specific deletion of SUR1-TRPM4 or NCX1 reduced brain swelling and improved neurological function in mice to a similar extent as an AQP4 inhibitor and was independent of infarct size. Thus, channels in astrocyte endfeet could be targeted to reduce postischemic brain swelling in stroke patients.},

Here, we explored the role of ISGylation in the macrophage response to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis . In human and mouse macrophages, the E3 ubiquitin ligases HERC5 and mHERC6, respectively, mediated the ISGylation of the phosphatase PTEN, which promoted its degradation. The decreased abundance of PTEN led to an increase in the activity of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which stimulated the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. Bacterial growth was increased in culture and in vivo when human or mouse macrophages were deficient in the major E3 ISG15 ligase. The findings expand the role of ISGylation in macrophages to antibacterial immunity and suggest that HERC5 signaling may be a candidate target for adjunct host-directed therapy in patients with tuberculosis.},

We used T cells to ablate nearly all HSCs in the murine liver, enabling the unbiased characterization of HSC functions. In the normal liver, complete loss of HSCs persisted for up to 10 weeks and caused a gradual reduction in liver mass and in the number of CCND1 + hepatocytes. We identified neurotrophin-3 (Ntf-3) as an HSC-produced factor that induced the proliferation of midlobular hepatocytes through the activation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). Treating HSC-depleted mice with Ntf-3 restored CCND1 + hepatocytes in the midlobular region and increased liver mass.

Mice lacking FGF receptors 1 and 2 (Fgfr1 and Fgfr2) in hepatocytes are hypersensitive to cytotoxic injury during liver regeneration. Using these mice as a model for impaired liver regeneration, we identified a critical role for the ubiquitin ligase Uhrf2 in protecting hepatocytes from bile acid accumulation during liver regeneration. During regeneration after partial hepatectomy, Uhrf2 expression increased in an FGFR-dependent manner, and Uhrf2 was more abundant in the nuclei of liver cells in control mice compared with FGFR-deficient mice. Hepatocyte-specific Uhrf2 knockout or nanoparticle-mediated Uhrf2 knockdown caused extensive liver necrosis and impaired hepatocyte proliferation after partial hepatectomy, resulting in liver failure. In cultured hepatocytes, Uhrf2 interacted with several chromatin remodeling proteins and suppressed the expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes. In vivo, the loss of Uhrf2 resulted in cholesterol and bile acid accumulation in the liver during regeneration. Treatment with a bile acid scavenger rescued the necrotic phenotype, hepatocyte proliferation, and the regenerative capacity of the liver in Uhrf2-deficient mice subjected to partial hepatectomy. Our results identify Uhrf2 as a key target of FGF signaling in hepatocytes and its essential function in liver regeneration and highlight the importance of epigenetic metabolic regulation in this process.},

Here, we investigated the role of the transmembrane protein neuropilin-1 (NRP1) in ECs exposed to flow using cultured ECs, mice with an endothelium-specific knockout of NRP1, and a mouse model of atherosclerosis. We demonstrated that NRP1 was a constituent of adherens junctions that interacted with VE-cadherin and promoted its association with p120 catenin, stabilizing adherens junctions and inducing cytoskeletal remodeling in alignment with the direction of flow. We also showed that NRP1 interacted with transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) receptor II (TGFBR2) and reduced the plasma membrane localization of TGFBR2 and TGF-β signaling. NRP1 knockdown increased the abundance of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, resulting in increased leukocyte rolling and atherosclerotic plaque size. These findings describe a role for NRP1 in promoting endothelial function and reveal a mechanism by which NRP1 reduction in ECs may contribute to vascular disease by modulating adherens junction signaling and promoting TGF-β signaling and inflammation.},

  abstract     = {Macrophages clear apoptotic cells through a process called continual efferocytosis. We found that protocatechuic acid (PCA), a polyphenolic compound abundant in fruits and vegetables, increased the continual efferocytic capacity of macrophages and inhibited the progression of advanced atherosclerosis. PCA reduced the intracellular amounts of microRNA-10b (miR-10b) by promoting its secretion in extracellular vesicles, which led to an increase in the abundance of the miR-10b target Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). In turn, KLF4 transcriptionally induced the gene encoding Mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK), an efferocytic receptor for the recognition of apoptotic cells, resulting in increased continual efferocytic capacity. However, in naive macrophages, the PCA-induced secretion of miR-10b did not affect KLF4 and MerTK protein abundance or efferocytic capacity. In mice, oral administration of PCA increased continual efferocytosis in macrophages residing in the peritoneal cavities, thymi, and advanced atherosclerotic plaques through the miR-10b–KLF4–MerTK pathway. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of miR-10b with antagomiR-10b also increased the efferocytic capacity of efferocytic but not naive macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Together, these data describe a pathway that promotes continual efferocytosis in macrophages through miR-10b secretion and a KLF4-dependent increase in MerTK abundance, which can be activated by dietary PCA and which has implications for understanding the regulation of continual efferocytosis in macrophages.},

  abstract     = {Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive bacterium that mainly causes self-limiting emetic or diarrheal illness but can also cause skin infections and bacteremia. Symptoms of B. cereus ingestion depend on the production of various toxins that target the gastric and intestinal epithelia. From a screen of bacterial isolates from human stool samples that compromised intestinal barrier function in mice, we identified a strain of B. cereus that disrupted tight and adherens junctions in the intestinal epithelium. This activity was mediated by the pore-forming exotoxin alveolysin, which increased the production of the membrane-anchored protein CD59 and of cilia- and flagella-associated protein 100 (CFAP100) in intestinal epithelial cells. In vitro, CFAP100 interacted with microtubules and promoted microtubule polymerization. CFAP100 overexpression stabilized microtubules in intestinal epithelial cells, leading to disorganization of the microtubule network and perturbation of tight and adherens junctions. The disruption of cell junctions by alveolysin depended on the increase in CFAP100, which in turn depended on CD59 and the activation of PI3K-AKT signaling. These findings demonstrate that, in addition to forming membrane pores, B. cereus alveolysin can permeabilize the intestinal epithelium by disrupting epithelial cell junctions in a manner that is consistent with intestinal symptoms and may allow the bacteria to escape the intestine and cause systemic infections. Our results suggest the potential value of targeting alveolysin or CFAP100 to prevent B. cereus –associated intestinal diseases and systemic infections.},

  abstract     = {Although largely confined to the airways, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with sensory abnormalities that manifest in both acute and chronic phenotypes. To gain insight on the molecular basis of these sensory abnormalities, we used the golden hamster model to characterize and compare the effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) on the sensory nervous system. We detected SARS-CoV-2 transcripts but no infectious material in the cervical and thoracic spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) within the first 24 hours of intranasal virus infection. SARS-CoV-2–infected hamsters exhibited mechanical hypersensitivity that was milder but prolonged compared with that observed in IAV-infected hamsters. RNA sequencing analysis of thoracic DRGs 1 to 4 days after infection suggested perturbations in predominantly neuronal signaling in SARS-CoV-2–infected animals as opposed to type I interferon signaling in IAV-infected animals. Later, 31 days after infection, a neuropathic transcriptome emerged in thoracic DRGs from SARS-CoV-2–infected animals, which coincided with SARS-CoV-2–specific mechanical hypersensitivity. These data revealed potential targets for pain management, including the RNA binding protein ILF3, which was validated in murine pain models. This work elucidates transcriptomic signatures in the DRGs triggered by SARS-CoV-2 that may underlie both short- and long-term sensory abnormalities.},

  abstract     = {The T cell lineage–restricted protein THEMIS plays a critical role in T cell development at the positive selection stage. In the SHP1 activation model, THEMIS is proposed to enhance the activity of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 (encoded by Ptpn6 ), thereby dampening T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling and preventing the inappropriate negative selection of CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes by positively selecting ligands. In contrast, in the SHP1 inhibition model, THEMIS is proposed to suppress SHP1 activity, rendering CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes more sensitive to TCR signaling initiated by low-affinity ligands to promote positive selection. We sought to resolve the controversy regarding the molecular function of THEMIS. We found that the defect in positive selection in Themis −/− thymocytes was ameliorated by pharmacologic inhibition of SHP1 or by deletion of Ptpn6 and was exacerbated by SHP1 overexpression. Moreover, overexpression of SHP1 phenocopied the Themis −/− developmental defect, whereas deletion of Ptpn6 , Ptpn11 (encoding SHP2), or both did not result in a phenotype resembling that of Themis deficiency. Last, we found that thymocyte negative selection was not enhanced but was instead impaired in the absence of THEMIS. Together, these results provide evidence favoring the SHP1 inhibition model, supporting a mechanism whereby THEMIS functions to enhance the sensitivity of CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes to TCR signaling, enabling positive selection by low-affinity, self-ligand–TCR interactions.},

The papain-like proteases (PLPs) of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 function in viral innate immune evasion and have deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating activities. We identified the PLPs of HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43 and found that their enzymatic properties correlated with their ability to suppress innate immune responses. A conserved noncatalytic aspartic acid residue was critical for both DUB and deISGylating activities, but the PLPs had differing ubiquitin (Ub) chain cleavage selectivities and binding affinities for Ub, K48-linked diUb, and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) substrates. The crystal structure of HKU1-PLP2 in complex with Ub revealed binding interfaces that accounted for the unusually high binding affinity between this PLP and Ub. In cellular assays, the PLPs from the severe disease–causing coronaviruses strongly suppressed innate immune IFN-I and NF-κB signaling and stimulated autophagy, whereas the PLPs from the mild disease–causing coronaviruses generally showed weaker effects on immune suppression and autophagy induction. In addition, a PLP from a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern showed increased suppression of innate immune signaling pathways. Overall, these results demonstrated that the DUB and deISGylating activities and substrate selectivities of these PLPs differentially contribute to viral innate immune evasion and may affect viral pathogenicity.},

  abstract     = {The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro), which has deubiquitinating activity, suppresses the type I interferon (IFN-I) antiviral response. We investigated the mechanism by which PLpro antagonizes cellular antiviral responses. In HEK392T cells, PLpro removed K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from Lys 289 of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING). PLpro-mediated deubiquitination of STING disrupted the STING-IKKε-IRF3 complex that induces the production of IFN-β and IFN-stimulated cytokines and chemokines. In human airway cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, the combined treatment with the STING agonist diABZi and the PLpro inhibitor GRL0617 resulted in the synergistic inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication and increased IFN-I responses. The PLpros of seven human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63) and four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (α, β, γ, and δ) all bound to STING and suppressed STING-stimulated IFN-I responses in HEK293T cells. These findings reveal how SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibits IFN-I signaling through STING deubiquitination and a general mechanism used by seven human coronaviral PLpros to dysregulate STING and to facilitate viral innate immune evasion. We also identified simultaneous pharmacological STING activation and PLpro inhibition as a potentially effective strategy for antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2.},

In addition to common inflammatory pathways, studies have demonstrated the role of the mechanosensitive proteins and transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ) in inflammation and immunity. We review our knowledge of YAP/TAZ in controlling inflammation and immunity in innate immune cells. Furthermore, we discuss the roles of YAP/TAZ in inflammatory diseases, wound healing, and tissue regeneration and how they integrate mechanical cues with biochemical signaling during disease progression.

The SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 is present only on a subset of macrophages at sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Here, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 can enter macrophages, replicate, and release new viral progeny; whether macrophages need to sense a replicating virus to drive cytokine release; and, if so, whether ACE2 is involved in these mechanisms. We found that SARS-CoV-2 could enter, but did not replicate within, ACE2-deficient human primary macrophages and did not induce proinflammatory cytokine expression. By contrast, ACE2 overexpression in human THP-1–derived macrophages permitted SARS-CoV-2 entry, processing and replication, and virion release. ACE2-overexpressing THP-1 macrophages sensed active viral replication and triggered proinflammatory, antiviral programs mediated by the kinase TBK-1 that limited prolonged viral replication and release. These findings help elucidate the role of ACE2 and its absence in macrophage responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

CK2 enzymatic activity was stimulated by various DDX proteins at high substrate concentrations. DDX1, DDX24, DDX41, and DDX54 were required for full kinase activity in vitro and in Xenopus embryos. Mutational analysis of DDX3X indicated that CK1 and CK2 kinase stimulation engages its RNA binding but not catalytic motifs. Mathematical modeling of enzyme kinetics and stopped-flow spectroscopy showed that DDX proteins function as nucleotide exchange factors toward CK2 and reduce unproductive reaction intermediates and substrate inhibition. Our study reveals protein kinase stimulation by nucleotide exchange as important for kinase regulation and as a generic function of DDX proteins.},

MICU1 knockout mice display disorganized mitochondrial architecture, a phenotype that is distinct from that of mice with deficiencies in other mtCU subunits and, thus, is likely not explained by changes in mitochondrial matrix Ca 2+ content. Using proteomic and cellular imaging techniques, we found that MICU1 localized to the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) and directly interacted with the MICOS components MIC60 and CHCHD2 independently of the mtCU. We demonstrated that MICU1 was essential for MICOS complex formation and that MICU1 ablation resulted in altered cristae organization, mitochondrial ultrastructure, mitochondrial membrane dynamics, and cell death signaling. Together, our results suggest that MICU1 is an intermembrane space Ca 2+ sensor that modulates mitochondrial membrane dynamics independently of matrix Ca 2+ uptake. This system enables distinct Ca 2+ signaling in the mitochondrial matrix and at the intermembrane space to modulate cellular energetics and cell death in a concerted manner.},

  abstract     = {The transition between pluripotent and tissue-specific states is a key aspect of development. Understanding the pathways driving these transitions will facilitate the engineering of properly differentiated cells for experimental and therapeutic uses. Here, we showed that during mesoderm differentiation, the transcription factor Oct1 activated developmental lineage–appropriate genes that were silent in pluripotent cells. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with an inducible knockout of Oct1, we showed that Oct1 deficiency resulted in poor induction of mesoderm-specific genes, leading to impaired mesodermal and terminal muscle differentiation. Oct1-deficient cells exhibited poor temporal coordination of the induction of lineage-specific genes and showed inappropriate developmental lineage branching, resulting in poorly differentiated cell states retaining epithelial characteristics. In ESCs, Oct1 localized with the pluripotency factor Oct4 at mesoderm-associated genes and remained bound to those loci during differentiation after the dissociation of Oct4. Binding events for Oct1 overlapped with those for the histone lysine demethylase Utx, and an interaction between Oct1 and Utx suggested that these two proteins cooperate to activate gene expression. The specificity of the ubiquitous Oct1 for the induction of mesodermal genes could be partially explained by the frequent coexistence of Smad and Oct binding sites at mesoderm-specific genes and the cooperative stimulation of mesodermal gene transcription by Oct1 and Smad3. Together, these results identify Oct1 as a key mediator of mesoderm lineage–specific gene induction.},

Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified the activation of two MYC-controlled metabolic pathways, amino acid transport and glycolysis, both of which were necessary for MAIT cell proliferation. Last, we showed that MAIT cells isolated from people with obesity showed decreased MYC mRNA abundance upon activation, which was associated with defective MAIT cell proliferation and functional responses.

  abstract     = {Opioids and other agonists of the μ-opioid receptor are effective at managing acute pain, but their chronic use can lead to tolerance that limits their efficacy. We previously reported that inhibiting the chaperone protein HSP90 in the spinal cords of mice promotes the antinociceptive effects of opioids in a manner that involved increased activation of the kinase ERK. Here, we found that the underlying mechanism involves the relief of a negative feedback loop mediated by the kinase AMPK. Intrathecal treatment of male and female mice with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG decreased the abundance of the β1 subunit of AMPK in the spinal cord. The antinociceptive effects of 17-AAG with morphine were suppressed by intrathecal administration of AMPK activators and enhanced by an AMPK inhibitor. Opioid treatment increased the abundance of phosphorylated AMPK in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where it colocalized with a neuronal marker and the neuropeptide CGRP. Knocking down AMPK in CGRP-positive neurons enhanced the antinociceptive effects of morphine and demonstrated that AMPK mediated the signal transduction between HSP90 inhibition and ERK activation. These data suggest that AMPK mediates an opioid-induced negative feedback loop in CGRP neurons of the spinal cord and that this loop can be disabled by HSP90 inhibition to enhance the efficacy of opioids.},

  abstract     = {Natural killer (NK) cells recognize virally infected cells and tumors. NK cell function depends on balanced signaling from activating receptors, recognizing products from tumors or viruses, and inhibitory receptors (such as KIR/Ly49), which recognize major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. KIR/Ly49 signaling preserves tolerance to self but also conveys reactivity toward MHC-I–low target cells in a process known as NK cell education. Here, we found that NK cell tolerance and education were determined by the subcellular localization of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. In mice lacking MHC-I molecules, uneducated, self-tolerant Ly49A + NK cells showed accumulation of SHP-1 in the activating immune synapse, where it colocalized with F-actin and the signaling adaptor protein SLP-76. Education of Ly49A + NK cells by the MHC-I molecule H2D d led to reduced synaptic accumulation of SHP-1, accompanied by augmented signaling from activating receptors. Education was also linked to reduced transcription of Ptpn6 , which encodes SHP-1. Moreover, synaptic SHP-1 accumulation was reduced in NK cells carrying the H2D d -educated receptor Ly49G2 but not in those carrying the noneducating receptor Ly49I. Colocalization of Ly49A and SHP-1 outside of the synapse was more frequent in educated compared with uneducated NK cells, suggesting a role for Ly49A in preventing synaptic SHP-1 accumulation in NK cell education. Thus, distinct patterning of SHP-1 in the activating NK cell synapse may determine NK cell tolerance.},

  abstract     = {Frizzleds (FZDs) are G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that bind to WNT family ligands. FZDs signal through multiple effector proteins, including Dishevelled (DVL), which acts as a hub for several downstream signaling pathways. To understand how WNT binding to FZD stimulates intracellular signaling and influences downstream pathway selectivity, we investigated the dynamic changes in the FZD 5 -DVL2 interaction elicited by WNT-3A and WNT-5A. Ligand-induced changes in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between FZD 5 and DVL2 or the isolated FZD-binding DEP domain of DVL2 revealed a composite response consisting of both DVL2 recruitment and conformational dynamics in the FZD 5 -DVL2 complex. The combination of different BRET paradigms enabled us to identify ligand-dependent conformational dynamics in the FZD 5 -DVL2 complex and distinguish them from ligand-induced recruitment of DVL2 or DEP to FZD 5 . The observed agonist-induced conformational changes at the receptor-transducer interface suggest that extracellular agonist and intracellular transducers cooperate through transmembrane allosteric interaction with FZDs in a ternary complex reminiscent of that of classical GPCRs.},

  abstract     = {The chemotactic G protein–coupled receptor GPR183 and its most potent endogenous oxysterol ligand 7α, 25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α, 25-OHC) are important for immune cell positioning in secondary lymphoid tissues. This receptor-ligand pair is associated with various diseases, in some cases contributing favorably and in other cases adversely, making GPR183 an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. We investigated the mechanisms underlying GPR183 internalization and the role of internalization in the main biological function of the receptor, chemotaxis. We found that the C terminus of the receptor was important for ligand-induced internalization but less so for constitutive (ligand-independent) internalization. β-arrestin potentiated ligand-induced internalization but was not required for ligand-induced or constitutive internalization. Caveolin and dynamin were the main mediators of both constitutive and ligand-induced receptor internalization in a mechanism independent of G protein activation. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis also contributed to constitutive GPR183 internalization in a β-arrestin–independent manner, suggesting the existence of different pools of surface-localized GPR183. Chemotaxis mediated by GPR183 depended on receptor desensitization by β-arrestins but could be uncoupled from internalization, highlighting an important biological role for the recruitment of β-arrestin to GPR183. The role of distinct pathways in internalization and chemotaxis may aid in the development of GPR183-targeting drugs for specific disease contexts.},

Here, we showed that β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) stimulation induced the nuclear export of phosphodiesterase 4D5 (PDE4D5), an enzyme that degrades the second messenger cAMP, to enable memory consolidation. We demonstrated that the endocytosis of β 2 AR phosphorylated by GPCR kinases (GRKs) mediated arrestin3-dependent nuclear export of PDE4D5, which was critical for promoting nuclear cAMP signaling and gene expression in hippocampal neurons for memory consolidation. Inhibition of the arrestin3-PDE4D5 association prevented β 2 AR-induced nuclear cAMP signaling without affecting receptor endocytosis. Direct PDE4 inhibition rescued β 2 AR-induced nuclear cAMP signaling and ameliorated memory deficits in mice expressing a form of the β 2 AR that could not be phosphorylated by GRKs. These data reveal how β 2 AR phosphorylated by endosomal GRK promotes the nuclear export of PDE4D5, leading to nuclear cAMP signaling, changes in gene expression, and memory consolidation. This study also highlights the translocation of PDEs as a mechanism to promote cAMP signaling in specific subcellular locations downstream of GPCR activation.},

AML is characterized by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can induce cysteine oxidation in redox-sensitive signaling proteins. Here, we sought to characterize the specific pathways affected by ROS in AML by assessing oncogenic signaling in primary AML samples. The oxidation or phosphorylation of signaling proteins that mediate growth and proliferation was increased in samples from patient subtypes with FLT3 mutations. These samples also showed increases in the oxidation of proteins in the ROS-producing Rac/NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX2) complex. Inhibition of NOX2 increased the apoptosis of FLT3-mutant AML cells in response to FLT3 inhibitors. NOX2 inhibition also reduced the phosphorylation and cysteine oxidation of FLT3 in patient-derived xenograft mouse models, suggesting that decreased oxidative stress reduces the oncogenic signaling of FLT3. In mice grafted with FLT3 mutant AML cells, treatment with a NOX2 inhibitor reduced the number of circulating cancer cells, and combining FLT3 and NOX2 inhibitors increased survival to a greater extent than either treatment alone. Together, these data raise the possibility that combining NOX2 and FLT3 inhibitors could improve the treatment of FLT3 mutant AML.},

In mice, we found that deficiency in the adrenal stress response—with similarities to such in patients called relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI)—conferred a high risk for lethal CRS. Mice treated with CD3 antibodies were protected against lethal CRS by the production of glucocorticoids (GC) induced by the adrenal stress response in a manner dependent on the scavenger receptor B1 (SR-BI), a receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Mice with whole-body or adrenal gland-specific SR-BI deficiency exhibited impaired GC production, more severe CRS, and increased mortality in response to CD3 antibodies. Pretreatment with a low dose of GC effectively suppressed the development of CRS and rescued survival in SR-BI–deficient mice without compromising T cell function through apoptosis. Our findings suggest that RAI may be a risk factor for therapy-induced CRS and that pretreating RAI patients with GC may prevent lethal CRS.},

Using humanized mouse models, primary human cells, and patient samples, we identified a T cell–autonomous role for ZFYVE21 in promoting chronic vascular inflammation associated with allograft vasculopathy. Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) stimulated endothelial cells to produce Hedgehog (Hh) ligands, which in turn induced the production of ZFYVE21 in a population of T memory cells with high amounts of the Hh receptor PTCH1 (PTCH hi cells, CD3 + CD4 + CD45RO + PTCH1 hi PD-1 hi ), vigorous recruitment to injured endothelia, and increased effector responses in vivo. After priming by interferon-γ (IFN-γ), Hh-induced ZFYVE21 activated NLRP3 inflammasome activity in T cells, which potentiated IFN-γ responses. Hh-induced NLRP3 inflammasomes and T cell–specific ZFYVE21 augmented the vascular sequelae of chronic inflammation in mice engrafted with human endothelial cells or coronary arteries that had been subjected to IRI before engraftment. Moreover, the population of PTCH hi T cells producing high amounts of ZFYVE21 was expanded in patients with renal transplant–associated IRI, and sera from these patients expanded this population in control T cells in a manner that depended on Hh signaling. We conclude that Hh-induced ZFYVE21 activates NLRP3 inflammasomes in T cells, thereby promoting chronic inflammation.},

Here, we explored its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and identified that a posttranslational modification altered its nuclear activity and promoted immune escape for HCC. IL-33 abundance was overall decreased but more frequently localized to the nucleus in patient HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues. In human and mouse HCC cells in culture and in vivo, IL-33 overexpression inhibited proliferation and repressed the abundance of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) at the transcriptional level by promoting the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). However, this interaction was disrupted by SUMOylation of IL-33 at Lys 54 mediated by the E3 ligase RanBP2. IL-33 SUMOylation correlated with its nuclear localization in HCC cells and tumors. An increase in SUMOylated IL-33 in HCC cells in cocultures and in vivo stabilized IRF1 and increased PD-L1 abundance and chemokine IL-8 secretion, which prevented the activation of cytotoxic T cells and promoted the M2 polarization of macrophages, respectively. Mutating the SUMOylation site in IL-33 reversed these effects and suppressed tumor growth. These findings indicate that SUMOylation of nuclear IL-33 in HCC cells impairs antitumor immunity.},

  abstract     = {Cellular stress granules arise in cells subjected to stress and promote cell survival. A cellular protein that localizes to stress granules is Z-DNA–binding protein 1 (ZBP1), which plays a major role in necroptosis, a programmed cell death pathway mediated by the kinase RIPK3. Here, we showed that the stress granule inducer arsenite activated RIPK3-dependent necroptosis. This pathway required ZBP1, which localized to arsenite-induced stress granules. RIPK3 localized to stress granules in the presence of ZBP1, leading to the formation of ZBP1-RIPK3 necrosomes, phosphorylation of the RIPK3 effector MLKL, and execution of necroptosis. Cells that did not form stress granules did not induce necroptosis in response to arsenite. Together, these results show that arsenite induces ZBP1-mediated necroptosis in a manner dependent on stress granule formation.},

  abstract     = {The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) system is critical for various biological functions in numerous cell types, including the inflammatory response, cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and pathogenic responses. Each cell type is characterized by a subset of 15 NF-κB dimers whose activity is regulated in a stimulus-responsive manner. Numerous studies have produced different mathematical models that account for cell type–specific NF-κB activities. However, whereas the concentrations or abundances of NF-κB subunits may differ between cell types, the biochemical interactions that constitute the NF-κB signaling system do not. Here, we synthesized a consensus mathematical model of the NF-κB multidimer system, which could account for the cell type–specific repertoires of NF-κB dimers and their cell type–specific activation and cross-talk. Our review demonstrates that these distinct cell type–specific properties of NF-κB signaling can be explained largely as emergent effects of the cell type–specific expression of NF-κB monomers. The consensus systems model represents a knowledge base that may be used to gain insights into the control and function of NF-κB in diverse physiological and pathological scenarios and that describes a path for generating similar regulatory knowledge bases for other pleiotropic signaling systems.},

We investigated the mechanisms by which FcRγ generates divergent signals when coupled to Dectin-2 and Mincle, structurally similar C-type lectin receptors that induce the release of different cytokines from dendritic cells. Chronological tracing of transcriptomic and epigenetic changes upon stimulation revealed that Dectin-2 induced early and strong signaling, whereas Mincle-mediated signaling was delayed, which reflects their expression patterns. Generation of early and strong FcRγ-Syk signaling by engineered chimeric receptors was sufficient to recapitulate a Dectin-2–like gene expression profile. Early Syk signaling selectively stimulated the activity of the calcium ion–activated transcription factor NFAT, which rapidly altered the chromatin status and transcription of the Il2 gene. In contrast, proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, were induced regardless of FcRγ signaling kinetics. These results suggest that the strength and timing of FcRγ-Syk signaling can alter the quality of cellular responses through kinetics-sensing signaling machineries.},

Decidualization in mice also depends on ovarian hormones and the presence of a blastocyst. Hedgehog signaling is transduced by primary cilia in many tissues and is involved in epithelial-stromal cross-talk during decidualization. We found that primary cilia on mouse uterine stromal cells increased in number and length during early pregnancy and were required for decidualization. In vitro and in vivo, progesterone promoted stromal ciliogenesis and the production of Indian hedgehog (IHH) in the epithelium and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) in the stroma. Blastocyst-derived TNF-α also induced epithelial IHH, which stimulated the production of SHH in the stroma through a mechanism that may involve the release of arachidonic acid from epithelial cells. In the stroma, SHH activated canonical Hedgehog signaling through primary cilia and promoted decidualization through a mechanism that depended on interleukin-11 (IL-11) and primary cilia. Our findings identify a primary cilia–dependent network that controls endometrial decidualization and suggest primary cilia as a candidate therapeutic target for endometrial diseases.},

To avoid unwanted cross-talk with preexisting protein interaction networks in a cell, the specificity and selectivity of newly engineered proteins must be controlled. Here, we developed a computational strategy that mimics gene duplication and the divergence of preexisting interacting protein pairs to design new interactions. We used the bacterial PhoQ-PhoP two-component system as a model system to demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy and validated the approach with known experimental results. The designed protein pairs are predicted to exclusively interact with each other and to be insulated from potential cross-talk with their native partners. Thus, our approach enables exploration of uncharted regions of the protein sequence space and the design of new interacting protein pairs.},

We found that Akt2-specific activation predominantly affected Akt substrate phosphorylation and metabolite regulation rather than transcript regulation. The transomics network revealed that Akt2 regulated the lower glycolysis pathway and nucleotide metabolism and cooperated with Akt2-independent signaling to promote the rate-limiting steps in these processes, such as the first step of glycolysis, glucose uptake, and the activation of the pyrimidine metabolic enzyme CAD. Together, our findings reveal the mechanism of Akt2-dependent metabolic pathway regulation, paving the way for Akt2-targeting therapeutics in diabetes and metabolic disorders.},

NLRP3-activating stimuli disrupted endosome trafficking and triggered localization of NLRP3 to vesicles positive for endolysosomal markers and for the inositol lipid PI4P. Chemical disruption of endosome trafficking sensitized macrophages to the NLRP3 activator imiquimod, driving enhanced inflammasome activation and cytokine secretion. Together, these data suggest that NLRP3 can sense disruptions in the trafficking of endosomal cargoes, which may explain in part the spatial activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Likewise, the protein α-synuclein regulates vesicle trafficking, and its abnormal aggregation in neurons is the defining cytopathology of PD. Because of their functional similarities in the same disease context, we investigated whether the two proteins were connected. We found that Syt11 was palmitoylated in mouse and human brain tissue and in cultured cortical neurons and that this modification to Syt11 disrupted α-synuclein homeostasis in neurons. Palmitoylation of two cysteines adjacent to the transmembrane domain, Cys 39 and Cys 40 , localized Syt11 to digitonin-insoluble portions of intracellular membranes and protected it from degradation by the endolysosomal system. In neurons, palmitoylation of Syt11 increased its abundance and enhanced the binding of α-synuclein to intracellular membranes. As a result, the abundance of the physiologic tetrameric form of α-synuclein was decreased, and that of its aggregation-prone monomeric form was increased. These effects were replicated by overexpression of wild-type Syt11 but not a palmitoylation-deficient mutant. These findings suggest that palmitoylation-mediated increases in Syt11 amounts may promote pathological α-synuclein aggregation in PD.},

  abstract     = {Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding proteins (G proteins) that function as molecular switches for cellular growth and metabolism are activated by GTP and inactivated by GTP hydrolysis. In uveal melanoma, a conserved glutamine residue critical for GTP hydrolysis in the G protein α subunit is often mutated in Gα q or Gα 11 to either leucine or proline. In contrast, other glutamine mutations or mutations in other Gα subtypes are rare. To uncover the mechanism of the genetic selection and the functional role of this glutamine residue, we analyzed all possible substitutions of this residue in multiple Gα isoforms. Through cell-based measurements of activity, we showed that some mutants were further activated and inactivated by G protein–coupled receptors. Through biochemical, molecular dynamics, and nuclear magnetic resonance–based structural studies, we showed that the Gα mutants were functionally distinct and conformationally diverse, despite their shared inability to hydrolyze GTP. Thus, the catalytic glutamine residue contributes to functions beyond GTP hydrolysis, and these functions include subtype-specific, allosteric modulation of receptor-mediated subunit dissociation. We conclude that G proteins do not function as simple on-off switches. Rather, signaling emerges from an ensemble of active states, a subset of which are favored in disease and may be uniquely responsive to receptor-directed ligands.},

  abstract     = {Stormorken syndrome is a multiorgan hereditary disease caused by dysfunction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2+ sensor protein STIM1, which forms the Ca 2+ release–activated Ca 2+ (CRAC) channel together with the plasma membrane channel Orai1. ER Ca 2+ store depletion activates STIM1 by releasing the intramolecular “clamp” formed between the coiled coil 1 (CC1) and CC3 domains of the protein, enabling the C terminus to extend and interact with Orai1. The most frequently occurring mutation in patients with Stormorken syndrome is R304W, which destabilizes and extends the STIM1 C terminus independently of ER Ca 2+ store depletion, causing constitutive binding to Orai1 and CRAC channel activation. We found that in cis deletion of one amino acid residue, Glu 296 (which we called E296del) reversed the pathological effects of R304W. Homozygous Stim1 E296del+R304W mice were viable and phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type mice. NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and cellular experiments revealed that although the R304W mutation prevented CC1 from interacting with CC3, the additional deletion of Glu 296 opposed this effect by enabling CC1-CC3 binding and restoring the CC domain interactions within STIM1 that are critical for proper CRAC channel function. Our results provide insight into the activation mechanism of STIM1 by clarifying the molecular basis of mutation-elicited protein dysfunction and pathophysiology.},

  abstract     = {The Wnt–β-catenin signal transduction pathway is essential for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. Wnt signaling converts TCF from a transcriptional repressor to an activator in a process facilitated by the E3 ligase XIAP. XIAP-mediated monoubiquitylation of the transcriptional corepressor Groucho (also known as TLE) decreases its affinity for TCF, thereby allowing the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin to displace it on TCF. Through a genome-scale screen in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells, we identified the deubiquitylase USP47 as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling. We found that USP47 was required for Wnt signaling during Drosophila and Xenopus laevis development, as well as in human cells, indicating evolutionary conservation. In human cells, knockdown of USP47 inhibited Wnt reporter activity, and USP47 acted downstream of the β-catenin destruction complex. USP47 interacted with TLE3 and XIAP but did not alter their amounts; however, knockdown of USP47 enhanced XIAP-mediated ubiquitylation of TLE3. USP47 inhibited ubiquitylation of TLE3 by XIAP in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that USP47 is the deubiquitylase that counteracts the E3 ligase activity of XIAP on TLE. Our data suggest a mechanism by which regulated ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of TLE enhance the ability of β-catenin to cycle on and off TCF, thereby helping to ensure that the expression of Wnt target genes continues only as long as the upstream signal is present.},

  abstract     = {The degradation of macromolecules and organelles by the process of autophagy is critical for cellular homeostasis and is often compromised during aging and disease. Beclin1 and Beclin2 are implicated in autophagy induction, and these homologs share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity but have divergent N-terminal regions. Here, we investigated the functions of the Beclin homologs in regulating autophagy and mitophagy, a specialized form of autophagy that targets mitochondria. Both Beclin homologs contributed to autophagosome formation, but a mechanism of autophagosome formation independent of either Beclin homolog occurred in response to starvation or mitochondrial damage. Mitophagy was compromised only in Beclin1-deficient HeLa cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts because of defective autophagosomal engulfment of mitochondria, and the function of Beclin1 in mitophagy required the phosphorylation of the conserved Ser 15 residue by the kinase Ulk1. Mitochondria-ER–associated membranes (MAMs) are important sites of autophagosome formation during mitophagy, and Beclin1, but not Beclin2 or a Beclin1 mutant that could not be phosphorylated at Ser 15 , localized to MAMs during mitophagy. Our findings establish a regulatory role for Beclin1 in selective mitophagy by initiating autophagosome formation adjacent to mitochondria, a function facilitated by Ulk1-mediated phosphorylation of Ser 15 in its distinct N-terminal region.},

  abstract     = {C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) is a dual-function receptor. Similar to other G protein–coupled chemokine receptors, it promotes monocyte infiltration into tissues in response to the chemokine CCL2, and, like atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs), it scavenges chemokine from the extracellular environment. CCR2 therefore mediates CCL2-dependent signaling as a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) and also limits CCL2 signaling as a scavenger receptor. We investigated the mechanisms underlying CCR2 scavenging, including the involvement of intracellular proteins typically associated with GPCR signaling and internalization. Using CRISPR knockout cell lines, we showed that CCR2 scavenged by constitutively internalizing to remove CCL2 from the extracellular space and recycling back to the cell surface for further rounds of ligand sequestration. This process occurred independently of G proteins, GPCR kinases (GRKs), β-arrestins, and clathrin, which is distinct from other “professional” chemokine scavenger receptors that couple to GRKs, β-arrestins, or both. These findings set the stage for understanding the molecular regulators that determine CCR2 scavenging and may have implications for drug development targeting this therapeutically important receptor.},

In two-component systems (TCSs), the sensor histidine kinase and the response regulator are connected through phosphoryl transfer reactions that may be uni- or bidirectional. Directionality enables the construction of complex regulatory networks that optimize signal propagation and ensure the forward flow of information. We combined x-ray crystallography, hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations, and systems-integrative kinetic modeling approaches to study phosphoryl flow through the Bacillus subtilis thermosensing TCS DesK-DesR. The allosteric regulation of the histidine kinase DesK was critical to avoid back transfer of phosphoryl groups and futile phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles by isolating phosphatase, autokinase, and phosphotransferase activities. Interactions between the kinase’s ATP-binding domain and the regulator’s receiver domain placed the regulator in two distinct positions in the phosphotransferase and phosphatase complexes, thereby determining whether a key glutamine residue in DesK was properly situated to assist in the dephosphorylation reaction. Moreover, an energetically unfavorable phosphotransferase conformation when DesK was not phosphorylated minimized reverse phosphoryl transfer. DesR dimerization and a dissociative phosphoryl transfer reaction also enforced the direction of phosphoryl flow. Shorter or longer distances between the phosphoryl acceptor and donor residues shifted the phosphoryl transfer equilibrium by modulating the stabilizing effect of the Mg 2+ cofactor. These mechanisms control the directionality of signal transmission and show how structure-encoded allostery stores and transmits information in signaling systems.},

NET formation occurs in response to many stimuli through independent molecular pathways. Although NET release has been equated to a form of lytic cell death, live neutrophils can rapidly release antimicrobial NETs. Gasdermin D (GSDMD), which causes pyroptotic death in macrophages, is thought to be required for NET formation by neutrophils. Through experiments with known physiological activators of NET formation and ligands that activate canonical and noncanonical inflammasome signaling pathways, we demonstrated that Gsdmd -deficient mouse neutrophils were as competent as wild-type mouse neutrophils in producing NETs. Furthermore, GSDMD was not cleaved in wild-type neutrophils during NET release in response to inflammatory mediators. We found that activation of both canonical and noncanonical inflammasome signaling pathways resulted in GSDMD cleavage in wild-type neutrophils but was not associated with cell death. Moreover, NET formation as a result of either pathway of inflammasome activation did not require GSDMD. Together, these data suggest that NETs can be formed by viable neutrophils after inflammasome activation and that this function does not require GSDMD.},

Here, we discovered that the carboxyl-terminal fragment of CREBH (CREBH-C) derived from membrane-bound, full-length CREBH was secreted as a hepatokine in response to fasting or hepatic stress. Phosphorylation of CREBH-C mediated by the kinase CaMKII was required for efficient secretion of CREBH-C through exocytosis. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mediates the lipolysis of circulating triglycerides for tissue uptake and is inhibited by a complex consisting of angiopoietin-like (ANGPTL) 3 and ANGPTL8. Secreted CREBH-C blocked the formation of ANGPTL3-ANGPTL8 complexes, leading to increased LPL activity in plasma and metabolic tissues in mice. CREBH-C administration promoted plasma triglyceride clearance and partitioning into peripheral tissues and mitigated hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis in mice fed a high-fat diet. Individuals with obesity had higher circulating amounts of CREBH-C than control individuals, and human CREBH loss-of-function variants were associated with dysregulated plasma triglycerides. These results identify a stress-induced, secreted protein fragment derived from CREBH that functions as a hepatokine to stimulate LPL activity and triglyceride homeostasis.},

We investigated the mechanisms of activation for inflammasomes nucleated by NOD-like receptor (NLR) proteins. A screen of a small-molecule library revealed that several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)—including those that are clinically approved (such as imatinib and crizotinib) or are in clinical trials (such as masitinib)—activated the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, imatinib and masitinib caused lysosomal swelling and damage independently of their kinase target, leading to cathepsin-mediated destabilization of myeloid cell membranes and, ultimately, cell lysis that was accompanied by potassium (K + ) efflux, which activated NLRP3. This effect was specific to primary myeloid cells (such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mouse bone marrow–derived dendritic cells) and did not occur in other primary cell types or various cell lines. TKI-induced lytic cell death and NLRP3 activation, but not lysosomal damage, were prevented by stabilizing cell membranes.

  abstract     = {Essential functions of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) depend on their capacity to selectively phosphorylate a limited repertoire of substrates. MAPKs harbor a conserved groove located outside of the catalytic cleft that binds to short linear sequence motifs found in substrates and regulators. However, the weak and transient nature of these “docking” interactions poses a challenge to defining MAPK interactomes and associated sequence motifs. Here, we describe a yeast-based genetic screening pipeline to evaluate large collections of MAPK docking sequences in parallel. Using this platform, we analyzed a combinatorial library based on the docking sequences from the MAPK kinases MKK6 and MKK7, defining features critical for binding to the stress-activated MAPKs JNK1 and p38α. Our screen of a library consisting of ~12, 000 sequences from the human proteome revealed multiple MAPK-selective interactors, including many that did not conform to previously defined docking motifs. Analysis of p38α/JNK1 exchange mutants identified specific docking groove residues that mediate selective binding. Last, we verified that docking sequences identified in the screen functioned in substrate recruitment in vitro and in cultured cells. Together, these studies establish an approach to characterize MAPK docking sequences and provide a resource for future investigation of signaling downstream of p38 and JNK.},

  abstract     = {Escherichia coli are part of the normal intestinal microbiome, but some enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strains can cause potentially life-threatening gastroenteritis. Virulence factors underlying the ability of EHEC and EPEC to cause disease include those encoded in the locus of the enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. Here, we demonstrated that EsrL, a small RNA present in many E. coli strains, promoted pathogenicity, adhesion, and biofilm formation in EHEC and EPEC. PhoB, the response regulator of the two-component system that controls cellular responses to phosphate, directly repressed esrL expression under low-phosphate conditions. A phosphate-rich environment, similar to that of the human intestine, relieved PhoB-mediated repression of esrL . EsrL interacted with and stabilized the LEE-encoded regulator ( ler ) transcript, which encodes a transcription factor for LEE genes, leading to increased bacterial adhesion to cultured cells and colonization of the rabbit colon. EsrL also bound to and stabilized the fimC transcript, which encodes a chaperone that is required for the assembly of type 1 pili, resulting in enhanced cell adhesion in pathogenic E. coli and enhanced biofilm formation in pathogenic and nonpathogenic E. coli . Our findings demonstrate that EsrL stimulates the expression of virulence genes in both EHEC and EPEC under phosphate-rich conditions, thus promoting the pathogenicity of EHEC and EPEC in the nutrient-rich gut environment.},

  abstract     = {Mutations in TAOK1 , which encodes a serine-threonine kinase, are associated with both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurodevelopmental delay (NDD). Here, we investigated the molecular function of this evolutionarily conserved kinase and the mechanisms through which TAOK1 mutations may lead to neuropathology. We found that TAOK1 was abundant in neurons in the mammalian brain and remodeled the neuronal plasma membrane through direct association with phosphoinositides. Our characterization of four NDD-associated TAOK1 mutations revealed that these mutants were catalytically inactive and were aberrantly trapped in a membrane-bound state, which induced abnormal membrane protrusions. Expression of these TAOK1 mutants in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons led to abnormal growth of the dendritic arbor. The coiled-coil region carboxyl-terminal to the kinase domain was predicted to fold into a triple helix, and this region directly bound phospholipids and was required for both membrane association and induction of aberrant protrusions. Autophosphorylation of threonine-440 and threonine-443 in the triple-helical region by the kinase domain blocked the plasma membrane association of TAOK1. These findings define TAOK1 as a plasma membrane remodeling kinase and reveal the underlying mechanisms through which TAOK1 dysfunction may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders.},

  abstract     = {Staphylococcus aureus can cause infections that are often chronic and difficult to treat, even when the bacteria are not antibiotic resistant because most antibiotics act only on metabolically active cells. Subpopulations of persister cells are metabolically quiescent, a state associated with delayed growth, reduced protein synthesis, and increased tolerance to antibiotics. Serine-threonine kinases and phosphatases similar to those found in eukaryotes can fine-tune essential bacterial cellular processes, such as metabolism and stress signaling. We found that acid stress–mimicking conditions that S. aureus experiences in host tissues delayed growth, globally altered the serine and threonine phosphoproteome, and increased threonine phosphorylation of the activation loop of the serine-threonine protein kinase B (PknB). The deletion of stp , which encodes the only annotated functional serine-threonine phosphatase in S. aureus , increased the growth delay and phenotypic heterogeneity under different stress challenges, including growth in acidic conditions, the intracellular milieu of human cells, and abscesses in mice. This growth delay was associated with reduced protein translation and intracellular ATP concentrations and increased antibiotic tolerance. Using phosphopeptide enrichment and mass spectrometry–based proteomics, we identified targets of serine-threonine phosphorylation that may regulate bacterial growth and metabolism. Together, our findings highlight the importance of phosphoregulation in mediating bacterial quiescence and antibiotic tolerance and suggest that targeting PknB or Stp might offer a future therapeutic strategy to prevent persister formation during S. aureus infections.},
