  abstract     = {Introducing trifluoromethyl groups to aryl rings is an important step in the preparation of many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, but the chemistry often requires specialized, expensive reagents. Campbell et al . now report that photoexcitation of a silver complex can release reactive trifluoromethyl and higher perfluoroalkyl radicals directly from more readily available carboxylates such as trifluoroacetate. The silver can then be reoxidized electrochemically to render the arene perfluoroalkylation reaction catalytic. The method also highlights silver’s prospective role as a more general highly oxidizing photoredox catalyst. —Jake S. Yeston Molecular Ag(II) complexes are superoxidizing photoredox catalysts capable of generating radicals from redox-reticent substrates. In this work, we exploited the electrophilicity of Ag(II) centers in [Ag(bpy) 2 (TFA)][OTf] and Ag(bpy)(TFA) 2 (bpy, 2,2′-bipyridine; OTf, CF 3 SO 3 – ) complexes to activate trifluoroacetate (TFA) by visible light–induced homolysis. The resulting trifluoromethyl radicals may react with a variety of arenes to forge C(sp 2 )–CF 3 bonds. This methodology is general and extends to other perfluoroalkyl carboxylates of higher chain length (R F CO 2 – ; R F , CF 2 CF 3 or CF 2 CF 2 CF 3 ). The photoredox reaction may be rendered electrophotocatalytic by regenerating the Ag(II) complexes electrochemically during irradiation. Electrophotocatalytic perfluoroalkylation of arenes at turnover numbers exceeding 20 was accomplished by photoexciting the Ag(II)–TFA ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) state, followed by electrochemical reoxidation of the Ag(I) photoproduct back to the Ag(II) photoreactant.},

  abstract     = {High-volume olefin separations are a core chemical process, and efficient production in high purity is challenging. Cui et al . developed a crystalline porous coordination polymer, ZU-609, as a molecular sieve for propane and propylene separation. ZU-609 was prepared by the reaction of 1,2-ethanedisulfonate (EDS) and 4,4′-dipyridylsulfide (DPS) with copper(II) ions, and EDS anions acted as pillars to connect a two-dimensional network of DPS and copper nodes. The angular geometry of the dipyridyl ligands created one-dimensional pores of about 0.5 nanometers in diameter that enabled high sorption and diffusion for propylene while propane was excluded. —Marc S. Lavine The design of molecular sieves is vital for gas separation, but it suffers from a long-standing issue of slow adsorption kinetics due to the intrinsic contradiction between molecular sieving and diffusion within restricted nanopores. We report a molecular sieve ZU-609 with local sieving channels that feature molecular sieving gates and rapid diffusion channels. The precise cross-sectional cutoff of molecular sieving gates enables the exclusion of propane from propylene. The coexisting large channels constituted by sulfonic anions and helically arranged metal-organic architectures allow the fast adsorption kinetics of propylene, and the measured propylene diffusion coefficient in ZU-609 is one to two orders of magnitude higher than previous molecular sieves. Propylene with 99.9\% purity is obtained through breakthrough experiments with a productivity of 32.2 L kg −1 .},

Liu et al . show that after exposure to methanol vapor at 200°C, copper nanoparticles in dealuminated beta zeolite become smaller. The average size decreased from ~5.6 to ~2.4 nanometers because copper migrated and became trapped at new surface sites. This catalyst maintained nearly 100\% conversion and selectivity for ambient-pressure hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate to ethylene glycol at 400°C for 200 hours. —PDS Copper nanoparticle–based catalysts have been extensively applied in industry, but the nanoparticles tend to sinter into larger ones in the chemical atmospheres, which is detrimental to catalyst performance. In this work, we used dealuminated Beta zeolite to support copper nanoparticles (Cu/Beta-deAl) and showed that these particles become smaller in methanol vapor at 200°C, decreasing from ~5.6 to ~2.4 nanometers in diameter, which is opposite to the general sintering phenomenon. A reverse ripening process was discovered, whereby migratable copper sites activated by methanol were trapped by silanol nests and the copper species in the nests acted as new nucleation sites for the formation of small nanoparticles. This feature reversed the general sintering channel, resulting in robust catalysts for dimethyl oxalate hydrogenation performed with supported copper nanoparticles for use in industry.},

  abstract     = {In eukaryotic cells, general transcription factors (GTFs) support RNA polymerase (Pol) II to assemble a preinitiation complex on a core promoter, open double-stranded DNA, and start RNA synthesis. Chen et al . determined the structures of 16 de novo transcribing complexes, TC2 to TC17, containing nascent RNAs of two to 17 nucleotides, respectively. Connecting these structures revealed an abrupt transition from initially transcribing complexes (in TC2 to TC9, GTFs remained bound to the promoter and Pol II) to early elongation complexes (in TC10 to TC17, GTFs dissociated from the promoter). This transition was accompanied by remarkable conformational and compositional changes, including transcription bubble collapse and GTF dissociation, which allowed Pol II to escape the promoter for product RNA synthesis. —Di Jiang Transcription initiation is a complex process, and its mechanism is incompletely understood. We determined the structures of de novo transcribing complexes TC2 to TC17 with RNA polymerase II halted on G-less promoters when nascent RNAs reach 2 to 17 nucleotides in length, respectively. Connecting these structures generated a movie and a working model. As initially synthesized RNA grows, general transcription factors (GTFs) remain bound to the promoter and the transcription bubble expands. Nucleoside triphosphate (NTP)–driven RNA-DNA translocation and template-strand accumulation in a nearly sealed channel may promote the transition from initially transcribing complexes (ITCs) (TC2 to TC9) to early elongation complexes (EECs) (TC10 to TC17). Our study shows dynamic processes of transcription initiation and reveals why ITCs require GTFs and bubble expansion for initial RNA synthesis, whereas EECs need GTF dissociation from the promoter and bubble collapse for promoter escape.},

In each iteration, the property prediction models that guided exploration learned the structure-property space of diverse scaffold derivatives, which were realized with multistep syntheses and a variety of reactions.

  abstract     = {G protein–coupled receptors such the beta-adrenergic receptor for adrenaline are key targets for therapeutic drug development. Heydenreich et al . undertook systematic mutation of each receptor residue to determine which are important for receptor signaling (see the Perspective by Filizola and Javitch). The authors evaluated the contribution of each residue to the fundamental pharmacological properties of efficacy and potency of the endogenous receptor ligand adrenaline and found that one-fifth of residues contributed to efficacy or potency of signaling by the receptor. Some mapped to sites of ligand or G protein binding, but more than two-thirds did not. The important sites appeared to work together in an allosteric network that led to structural changes and signaling responses. Such detailed information may help to guide the development of new ligands that produce the desired signaling responses. —L. Bryan Ray Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs) bind to extracellular ligands and drugs and modulate intracellular responses through conformational changes. Despite their importance as drug targets, the molecular origins of pharmacological properties such as efficacy (maximum signaling response) and potency (the ligand concentration at half-maximal response) remain poorly understood for any ligand-receptor-signaling system. We used the prototypical adrenaline–β2 adrenergic receptor–G protein system to reveal how specific receptor residues decode and translate the information encoded in a ligand to mediate a signaling response. We present a data science framework to integrate pharmacological and structural data to uncover structural changes and allosteric networks relevant for ligand pharmacology. These methods can be tailored to study any ligand-receptor-signaling system, and the principles open possibilities for designing orthosteric and allosteric compounds with defined signaling properties.},

  abstract     = {Fruit flies can be taught to associate specific odors with painful electrical shocks. However, how these associative memories are formed and stored in their brains is not fully understood. Miyashita et al . unexpectedly discovered that ensheathing glia, the cells that wrap around the mushroom bodies and are the flies’ main neural processing centers, release glutamate from synaptic vesicles. The glutamate released binds to NMDA receptors on mushroom body neurons and kainate receptors on dopaminergic neurons. NMDA receptors require both glutamate binding and simultaneous cellular depolarization to open. Functional imaging experiments demonstrated that NMDA receptors permit the transmission of shock information to the mushroom bodies only when flies are exposed to an odor and shock simultaneously, but not when flies are exposed to shocks alone. —Peter Stern During Drosophila aversive olfactory conditioning, aversive shock information needs to be transmitted to the mushroom bodies (MBs) to associate with odor information. We report that aversive information is transmitted by ensheathing glia (EG) that surround the MBs. Shock induces vesicular exocytosis of glutamate from EG. Blocking exocytosis impairs aversive learning, whereas activation of EG can replace aversive stimuli during conditioning. Glutamate released from EG binds to N -methyl- d -aspartate receptors in the MBs, but because of Mg 2+ block, Ca 2+ influx occurs only when flies are simultaneously exposed to an odor. Vesicular exocytosis from EG also induces shock-associated dopamine release, which plays a role in preventing formation of inappropriate associations. These results demonstrate that vesicular glutamate released from EG transmits negative valence information required for associative learning.},

Despite major incentives, bitcoin was rarely adopted except among one privileged group: young, educated men with bank accounts. Compared with traditional banks, bitcoin offers improved privacy and transparency and rapid, inexpensive transactions. These are all features that economists assumed were desirable for Salvadorans because most are unbanked, need remittances, and can access Chivo Wallet because they usually own phones with Internet. However, Alvarez et al . found that Salvadorans’ preference for tangible cash and, ironically, privacy and transparency fears impeded bitcoin adoption. Unless populations are financially literate and trust virtual currencies, policies incentivizing their adoption may fail. —Ekeoma Uzogara A currency’s essential feature is to be a medium of exchange. This study explores the potential of cryptocurrencies to be used in daily transactions in El Salvador, the first country to make bitcoin legal tender.

Through a nationally representative, face-to-face survey of 1800 households and blockchain data encompassing all Chivo Wallet transactions, we document a pattern of low and decreasing usage of digital payments and bitcoin. Privacy and security concerns are key adoption barriers, which speaks to a policy debate on crypto and CBDCs with anonymity at its core. Additionally, we estimate Chivo Wallet’s adoption cost and complementarities among adopters.},

Recently, the 2D materials used in such superlattices have largely been graphene and various transition metal dichalcogenides. However, cuprate superconductors can also be thought of as 2D materials, with the copper-oxide planes coupled to each other through Josephson coupling. Zhao et al . created high-quality twisted structures of a bismuth-based cuprate by cleaving a single exfoliated crystal and placing the two halves on top of each other at various angles. Near the twist angle of 45°, Josephson coupling was suppressed by the d-wave superconducting order parameter of the material. The researchers also observed a Josephson diode effect caused by the breaking of time reversal symmetry. —Jelena Stajic Twisted interfaces between stacked van der Waals (vdW) cuprate crystals present a platform for engineering superconducting order parameters by adjusting stacking angles. Using a cryogenic assembly technique, we construct twisted vdW Josephson junctions (JJs) at atomically sharp interfaces between Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ x crystals, with quality approaching the limit set by intrinsic JJs. Near 45° twist angle, we observe fractional Shapiro steps and Fraunhofer patterns, consistent with the existence of two degenerate Josephson ground states related by time-reversal symmetry (TRS). By programming the JJ current bias sequence, we controllably break TRS to place the JJ into either of the two ground states, realizing reversible Josephson diodes without external magnetic fields.

  abstract     = {Astronomical observations show that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are abundant and widespread in the interstellar medium. PAH molecules consist of several adjacent aromatic rings terminated by hydrogens. Zeichner et al . performed laboratory isotopic analysis of PAHs in samples of the asteroid Ryugu that were collected by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft. They found that two 13 C nuclei occurred in the same molecule more often than would be expected if 13 C were randomly incorporated into PAHs. This isotope fractionation effect occurred during formation at temperatures under 100 kelvin. The authors argue that at least some of the Ryugu PAHs must have formed in cold interstellar clouds and thus predate the Solar System. —Keith T. Smith Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contain ≲20\% of the carbon in the interstellar medium. They are potentially produced in circumstellar environments (at temperatures ≳1000 kelvin), by (~10 kelvin) interstellar clouds, or by processing of carbon-rich dust grains. We report isotopic properties of PAHs extracted from samples of the asteroid Ryugu and the meteorite Murchison. The doubly- 13 C substituted compositions (Δ2× 13 C values) of the PAHs naphthalene, fluoranthene, and pyrene are 9 to 51‰ higher than values expected for a stochastic distribution of isotopes. The Δ2× 13 C values are higher than expected if the PAHs formed in a circumstellar environment, but consistent with formation in the interstellar medium. By contrast, the PAHs phenanthrene and anthracene in Ryugu samples have Δ2× 13 C values consistent with formation by higher-temperature reactions.},

  abstract     = {Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are implicated in the development of Parkinson’s disease, so this enzyme is a target for therapeutics currently in clinical trials. Zhu et al . determined the structures of LRRK2 bound to Rab29, a membrane-associated protein thought to target the kinase to specific organelles, and found that the resulting complexes adopted several oligomerization states. The largest complex included four copies of LRRK2 in two different conformations: one was similar to the inactive state seen previously and the other represented a proposed active state. Functional experiments and work with mutants provide insight into the structural features of this complex and may inspire new strategies for therapeutic inhibition. —Michael A. Funk Gain-of-function mutations in LRRK2 , which encodes the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), are the most common genetic cause of late-onset Parkinson’s disease. LRRK2 is recruited to membrane organelles and activated by Rab29, a Rab guanosine triphosphatase encoded in the PARK16 locus. We present cryo–electron microscopy structures of Rab29–LRRK2 complexes in three oligomeric states, providing key snapshots during LRRK2 recruitment and activation. Rab29 induces an unexpected tetrameric assembly of LRRK2, formed by two kinase-active central protomers and two kinase-inactive peripheral protomers. The central protomers resemble the active-like state trapped by the type I kinase inhibitor DNL201, a compound that underwent a phase 1 clinical trial. Our work reveals the structural mechanism of LRRK2 spatial regulation and provides insights into LRRK2 inhibitor design for Parkinson’s disease treatment.},

A device with 25.2\% certified PCE was fabricated and retained 85\% of its initial efficiency after 500 hours of accelerated aging at 85°C. —Phil Szuromi The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is still lagging behind that of conventional PSCs, in part because of inefficient carrier transport and poor morphology of hole transport layers (HTLs). We optimized self-assembly of [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz) onto nickel oxide (NiO x ) nanoparticles as an HTL through treatment with hydrogen peroxide, which created a more uniform dispersion of nanoparticles with high conductivity attributed to the formation of Ni 3+ as well as surface hydroxyl groups for bonding. A 25.2\% certified PCE for a mask size of 0.074 square centimeters was obtained. This device maintained 85.4\% of the initial PCE after 1000 hours of stabilized power output operation under 1 sun light irradiation at about 50°C and 85.1\% of the initial PCE after 500 hours of accelerated aging at 85°C.

  abstract     = {Racism in America is a system of oppression that produces and sustains racially unequal outcomes across education, the economy, health, incarceration, and other institutions. These intertwined institutions place Black Americans at a compounded disadvantage even in the absence of overt discrimination. An effective way to challenge systemic racism is through social movements or policies. However, Black-White disparities in some domains (e.g., poverty and alienation) may not mobilize resistance toward racism as much as disparities in other domains (e.g., health and physical harm), although all domains are pernicious and reinforce each other. Brown et al . found that threats to health or body (e.g., aggressive police encounters) spark outrage and motivate more action because they trigger morality concerns (see the Perspective by Earl and Derricks). Framing disparities to engage moral injustice feelings may better motivate policy reform to dismantle systemic racism. —Ekeoma Uzogara Racial disparities arise across many vital areas of American life, including employment, health, and interpersonal treatment. For example, one in three Black children lives in poverty (versus one in nine white children), and, on average, Black Americans live four fewer years compared with white Americans. Which disparity is more likely to spark reduction efforts? We find that highlighting disparities in health-related (versus economic) outcomes spurs greater social media engagement and support for disparity-mitigating policy. Further, reading about racial health disparities elicits greater support for action (e.g., protesting) compared with economic- or belonging-based disparities. This occurs in part because people view health disparities as violating morally sacred values, which enhances perceived injustice. This work elucidates which manifestations of racial inequality are most likely to prompt Americans to action.},

  abstract     = {Glutamate delta receptors look like ionotropic glutamate channels but do not behave like classic neurotransmitter receptors because of their insensitivity to glutamate and inability to gate the ion channel pore upon ligand binding. Piot et al . found that GluD1, the least characterized member of this receptor family, instead binds GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in vertebrates (see the Perspective by Coombs and Farrant). GABA binds to the ligand-binding domain of GluD1 and drives conformational rearrangements in the receptor. GluD1 receptors localize at hippocampal GABAergic synapses, where they regulate the efficacy of GABAergic transmission. Activation of GluD1 receptors at hippocampal GABAergic synapses induces inhibitory synaptic plasticity. —Peter Stern Fast synaptic neurotransmission in the vertebrate central nervous system relies primarily on ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), which drive neuronal excitation, and type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA A Rs), which are responsible for neuronal inhibition. However, the GluD1 receptor, an iGluR family member, is present at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Whether and how GluD1 activation may affect inhibitory neurotransmission is unknown. In this work, by using a combination of biochemical, structural, and functional analyses, we demonstrate that GluD1 binds GABA, a previously unknown feature of iGluRs. GluD1 activation produces long-lasting enhancement of GABAergic synaptic currents in the adult mouse hippocampus through a non-ionotropic mechanism that is dependent on trans-synaptic anchoring. The identification of GluD1 as a GABA receptor that controls inhibitory synaptic plasticity challenges the classical dichotomy between glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors.},

  abstract     = {How the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) responded to warmer climates in the geologic past has obvious relevance to our understanding of what its future could be as global temperatures rise due to human activities. Using genetic analyses of a type of circum-Antarctic octopus, Pareledone turqueti , Lau et al . showed that the WAIS collapsed completely during the last interglacial period, when global sea levels were 5 to 10 meters higher than today and global average temperatures were only about 1°C warmer (see the Perspective by Dutton and DeConto). The implication of this finding is that major WAIS collapse and the consequent rise in sea level could be caused even by the minimal temperature rises projected for stringent climate change mitigation. —H. Jesse Smith The marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is considered vulnerable to irreversible collapse under future climate trajectories, and its tipping point may lie within the mitigated warming scenarios of 1.5° to 2°C of the United Nations Paris Agreement. Knowledge of ice loss during similarly warm past climates could resolve this uncertainty, including the Last Interglacial when global sea levels were 5 to 10 meters higher than today and global average temperatures were 0.5° to 1.5°C warmer than preindustrial levels. Using a panel of genome-wide, single-nucleotide polymorphisms of a circum-Antarctic octopus, we show persistent, historic signals of gene flow only possible with complete WAIS collapse. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that the tipping point of WAIS loss could be reached even under stringent climate mitigation scenarios.},

Wu et al . were inspired by this structure in developing an encapsulated aerogel fiber (see the Perspective by Sheng and Zhang). The synthetic fibers have mechanical properties that allow for weaving and knitting while at the same time being excellent thermal insulators. They can also be produced at scale with a simple two-step freeze-spinning and encapsulation process. —Brent Grocholski Aerogels have been considered as an ideal material for thermal insulation. Unfortunately, their application in textiles is greatly limited by their fragility and poor processability. We overcame these issues by encapsulating the aerogel fiber with a stretchable layer, mimicking the core-shell structure of polar bear hair. Despite its high internal porosity over 90\%, our fiber is stretchable up to 1000\% strain, which is greatly improved compared with that of traditional aerogel fibers (~2\% strain). In addition to its washability and dyeability, our fiber is mechanically robust, retaining its stable thermal insulation property after 10,000 stretching cycles (100\% strain). A sweater knitted with our fiber was only one-fifth as thick as down, with similar performance. Our strategy for this fiber provides rich possibilities for developing multifunctional aerogel fibers and textiles.},

  abstract     = {Ion channels activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate underlie excitatory signaling between neurons in the brain. In mammals, these ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) belong to three families formed from GluA, GluN, and GluK subunits, respectively: the α-amino-3-hydroxy- 5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and kainate receptors ( 1 ). By contrast, receptors of a fourth homologous iGluR family—the δ or GluD receptors—do not respond to glutamate. Despite sharing a similar architecture with other iGluRs, including a transmembrane pore, the question of whether GluD receptors pass current has been controversial ( 2 , 3 ). Instead, they are best known as synaptic organizing proteins ( 2 , 4 ). On page 1389 of this issue, Piot et al. ( 5 ) show that one GluD family member, GluD1, can bind the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and trigger potentiation of GABA-mediated synaptic currents. This challenges the dogmatic distinction between glutamate and GABA receptors and identifies GluD1 as a regulator of inhibitory signaling.},

The successful adoption of aerogels, which are made by replacing the liquid in a gel with gas while maintaining a stable network, in NASA vehicles such as the Mars rover has inspired the use of aerogels in personal warming. But applications of aerogels in textiles have been limited by their insufficient moisture permeability. Aerogel fibers are being developed to address the trade-off between thermal insulation and moisture permeability. However, aerogel fibers presently lack the strength and flexibility necessary to allow weaving or knitting into a wearable fabric. On page 1379 of this issue, Wu et al. ( 1 ) report a feasible strategy to construct bioinspired knittable aerogel fibers with superb thermal insulation and mechanical robustness, which allows weaving into fabric with air permeability.

Understanding how compounds activate GPCRs and modulate their interactions with intracellular proteins such as G proteins and β-arrestins is crucial for drug discovery because these proteins transduce signals to downstream effectors, triggering biological responses. This includes elucidating the molecular details behind the ability of the drug–GPCR complex to generate a functional response (efficacy) and the concentration of the drug required to produce half-maximal response (potency) ( 2 ). Although agonist binding to a GPCR triggers conformational rearrangements throughout the receptor and its transducer ( 3 ), the molecular mechanisms that govern ligand efficacy and potency are difficult to ascertain. On page 1378 of this issue, Heydenreich et al.

Despite decades of probing the region from the surface and from space, some important aspects of Antarctic history remain elusive. On page 1384 of this issue, Lau et al . ( 1 ) make headway to fill one such knowledge gap by reporting genetic evidence that two distinct populations of octopus were connected by a waterway across an area now completely covered by the ice sheet.

  abstract     = {The microbiota plays an important part in host defense by excluding pathogenic species in a process called colonization resistance. This property is elusive and not endowed by one or two species alone. Spragge et al . discovered that colonization resistance is a higher-order effect of a diverse community of bacteria underpinned by essential key species such as Escherichia coli (see the Perspective by Radlinski and Bäumler). In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that given the right composition, a diverse microbiota will collectively consume the nutrients that an incoming species requires to grow and establish in a host. Colonization resistance is predictable because if the symbiont community encodes many of the same (or similar) proteins as the pathogen, then it provides better colonization resistance and can potentially deliver health benefits to the host. —Caroline Ash The human gut microbiome plays an important role in resisting colonization of the host by pathogens, but we lack the ability to predict which communities will be protective. We studied how human gut bacteria influence colonization of two major bacterial pathogens, both in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Whereas single species alone had negligible effects, colonization resistance greatly increased with community diversity. Moreover, this community-level resistance rested critically upon certain species being present. We explained these ecological patterns through the collective ability of resistant communities to consume nutrients that overlap with those used by the pathogen. Furthermore, we applied our findings to successfully predict communities that resist a novel target strain. Our work provides a reason why microbiome diversity is beneficial and suggests a route for the rational design of pathogen-resistant communities.},

However, how these master TFs drive pluripotency progression in early embryos remains poorly understood. Li et al . investigated spatiotemporal chromatin occupancy of SOX2 in mouse early embryos across 4 days. In early blastocysts, SOX2 regulates the pluripotency program not just by opening global enhancers, but also by occupying preaccessible enhancers opened by early-stage-expressing TFs. SOX2 then redistributes and opens enhancers or primes enhancers for future activation when cells acquire naive and formative pluripotency. These data revealed flexible pioneer TF-chromatin interactions and a transitionary “prepluripotency” state that connects totipotency and pluripotency. —Di Jiang Pioneer transcription factors (TFs), such as OCT4 and SOX2, play crucial roles in pluripotency regulation. However, the master TF-governed pluripotency regulatory circuitry was largely inferred from cultured cells. In this work, we investigated SOX2 binding from embryonic day 3.5 (E3.5) to E7.5 in the mouse. In E3.5 inner cell mass (ICM), SOX2 regulates the ICM-trophectoderm program but is dispensable for opening global enhancers. Instead, SOX2 occupies preaccessible enhancers in part opened by early-stage expressing TFs TFAP2C and NR5A2. SOX2 then widely redistributes when cells adopt naive and formative pluripotency by opening enhancers or poising them for rapid future activation. Hence, multifaceted pioneer TF–enhancer interaction underpins pluripotency progression in embryos, including a distinctive state in E3.5 ICM that bridges totipotency and pluripotency.},

In plants, protons accumulate highly in the extracellular space, whereas Ca 2+ stores can be found in the endoplasmic reticulum and other cellular compartments. H + and Ca 2+ concentrations in the cytoplasm are often closely correlated during signaling events. Huang et al . introduced a light-gated protist-derived ion channel into plant cells, allowing selective transport of H + but not Ca 2+ . They found that induction of H + transport into the cytoplasm led to subsequent Ca 2+ release. This work establishes a causal relationship between intracellular pH and Ca 2+ signaling in guard cells and offers a new tool for manipulating ion movement in other contexts. —Madeleine Seale Although there has been long-standing recognition that stimuli-induced cytosolic pH alterations coincide with changes in calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) levels, the interdependence between protons (H + ) and Ca 2+ remains poorly understood. We addressed this topic using the light-gated channelrhodopsin Hc KCR2 from the pseudofungus Hyphochytrium catenoides , which operates as a H + conductive, Ca 2+ impermeable ion channel on the plasma membrane of plant cells. Light activation of Hc KCR2 in Arabidopsis guard cells evokes a transient cytoplasmic acidification that sparks Ca 2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. A H + -induced cytosolic Ca 2+ signal results in membrane depolarization through the activation of Ca 2+ -dependent SLAC1/SLAH3 anion channels, which enabled us to remotely control stomatal movement. Our study suggests a H + -induced Ca 2+ release mechanism in plant cells and establishes Hc KCR2 as a tool to dissect the molecular basis of plant intracellular pH and Ca 2+ signaling.},

  abstract     = {How are new particles formed in the air above the oceans, where ammonia, an important species in the process, is not very abundant? He et al . report that iodine oxoacids, which are plentiful in marine environments, can substantially increase the rate of new particle formation in the low-ammonia conditions commonly found in pristine marine and polar regions. This effect could be particularly important in low-level marine stratocumulus clouds, which reflect a large fraction of incident solar radiation back into space and have an important influence on global radiation balance and climate. —H. Jesse Smith The main nucleating vapor in the atmosphere is thought to be sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), stabilized by ammonia (NH 3 ). However, in marine and polar regions, NH 3 is generally low, and H 2 SO 4 is frequently found together with iodine oxoacids [HIO x , i.e., iodic acid (HIO 3 ) and iodous acid (HIO 2 )]. In experiments performed with the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) chamber, we investigated the interplay of H 2 SO 4 and HIO x during atmospheric particle nucleation. We found that HIO x greatly enhances H 2 SO 4 (-NH 3 ) nucleation through two different interactions. First, HIO 3 strongly binds with H 2 SO 4 in charged clusters so they drive particle nucleation synergistically. Second, HIO 2 substitutes for NH 3 , forming strongly bound H 2 SO 4 -HIO 2 acid-base pairs in molecular clusters. Global observations imply that HIO x is enhancing H 2 SO 4 (-NH 3 ) nucleation rates 10- to 10,000-fold in marine and polar regions.},

  abstract     = {Multiple Indigenous groups, such as the Coast Salish in the Pacific Northwest, bred and maintained dogs with a distinctive woolly undercoat, and hair from these dogs was used in weaving. Lin et al . sequenced the only known specimen of a Coast Salish woolly dog named Mutton from 1859 (see the Perspective by Orlando). Mutton was found to have limited introgression from European colonial dogs and otherwise lacked much genetic diversity, suggesting that these dogs were carefully reproductively managed to maintain their coats. By incorporating traditional knowledge, historical records, and genetic data, the cultural importance of these dogs and the role of colonialism in their loss are illuminated. This study joins the growing number attempting to incorporate Indigenous groups in historical studies. —Corinne Simonti Ancestral Coast Salish societies in the Pacific Northwest kept long-haired “woolly dogs” that were bred and cared for over millennia. However, the dog wool–weaving tradition declined during the 19th century, and the population was lost. In this study, we analyzed genomic and isotopic data from a preserved woolly dog pelt from “Mutton,” collected in 1859. Mutton is the only known example of an Indigenous North American dog with dominant precolonial ancestry postdating the onset of settler colonialism. We identified candidate genetic variants potentially linked with their distinct woolly phenotype. We integrated these data with interviews from Coast Salish Elders, Knowledge Keepers, and weavers about shared traditional knowledge and memories surrounding woolly dogs, their importance within Coast Salish societies, and how colonial policies led directly to their disappearance.},

  abstract     = {The recent development of large-scale deep neural networks (NNs) and other artificial intelligence (AI) applications is accompanied by growing concerns about the energy consumption needed to train and operate them. Physical NNs could become a solution to this problem, but the direct hardware implementation of conventional algorithms faces multiple difficulties. For instance, training NNs using conventional backpropagation algorithms is associated with challenges such as lack of scalability, complexity of operation during training, and dependency on digitally trained models. Inspired by the forward-forward algorithm, Momeni et al . report the practical demonstration of backpropagation-free training of wave-based physical NNs. Their work is an important step in optimizing the energy-intensive training step in NNs for more efficient solutions for modern AI systems. —Yury Suleymanov Recent successes in deep learning for vision and natural language processing are attributed to larger models but come with energy consumption and scalability issues. Current training of digital deep-learning models primarily relies on backpropagation that is unsuitable for physical implementation. In this work, we propose a simple deep neural network architecture augmented by a physical local learning (PhyLL) algorithm, which enables supervised and unsupervised training of deep physical neural networks without detailed knowledge of the nonlinear physical layer’s properties. We trained diverse wave-based physical neural networks in vowel and image classification experiments, showcasing the universality of our approach. Our method shows advantages over other hardware-aware training schemes by improving training speed, enhancing robustness, and reducing power consumption by eliminating the need for system modeling and thus decreasing digital computation.},

  abstract     = {Clothing often helps to regulate comfort, but it is normally focused on keeping a person either warmer or cooler. Wang et al . developed a thermoregulatory clothing system that combines an organic photovoltaic with bidirectional electrocaloric devices that are capable of heating or cooling (see the Perspective by Huang and Li). Both components are flexible, which is important for personal thermal regulation applications. The device runs off of sunlight, so no additional power sources are needed, and it could be useful in a variety of harsh environments. —Brent Grocholski The human body must stay within a certain temperature range for comfort and safety. However, challenges for thermoregulatory clothing exist for harsh application scenarios, such as full day/night cycles, frigid polar regions, and space travel. We developed a flexible and sustainable personal thermoregulatory clothing system by integrating a flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) module to directly acquire energy from sunlight and bidirectional electrocaloric (EC) devices. The flexible OPV-EC thermoregulatory clothing (OETC) can extend the human thermal comfort zone from 22°–28°C to 12.5°–37.6°C with a fast thermoregulation rate. The low energy consumption and high efficiency of the EC device allows for 24 hours of controllable and dual-mode thermoregulation with 12 hours of sunlight energy input. This self-powered wearable thermoregulatory platform has a simple structure, compact design, high efficiency, and strong self-adaptability with sunlight as the sole energy source.},

  abstract     = {Removing the hydrogen-rich layers from a main sequence star exposes the helium-rich core. Such stripped helium stars are known at high and low masses, but not at intermediate masses, despite theoretical predictions that they should be common (see the Perspective by Sundqvist and Sana). Drout et al. used ultraviolet photometry to identify candidate stripped helium stars in two nearby dwarf galaxies and then observed 25 such candidate stars with optical spectroscopy. They found eight stars with spectra matching predictions for intermediate-mass stripped helium stars and another eight with similar spectra that were blended with a main sequence companion. Most of these systems were shown to be binaries, in which the companion stars probably stripped the outer hydrogen-rich layers off the helium stars. —Keith T. Smith The hydrogen-rich outer layers of massive stars can be removed by interactions with a binary companion. Theoretical models predict that this stripping produces a population of hot helium stars of ~2 to 8 solar masses ( M ☉ ), however, only one such system has been identified thus far. We used ultraviolet photometry to identify potential stripped helium stars then investigated 25 of them using optical spectroscopy. We identified stars with high temperatures (~60,000 to 100,000 kelvin), high surface gravities, and hydrogen-depleted surfaces; 16 stars also showed binary motion. These properties match expectations for stars with initial masses of 8 to 25 M ☉ that were stripped by binary interaction. Their masses fall in the gap between subdwarf helium stars and Wolf-Rayet stars. We propose that these stars could be progenitors of stripped-envelope supernovae.},

Identifying the source of poached pangolins and the path of transit of pangolin scales could greatly improve our ability to reduce illegal trade of these animals, which at current rates could lead to their extinction. Tinsman et al . used a genomic approach to identify the populations of origin for white-bellied pangolin ( Phataginus tricuspis ) samples and seizures. They found a shift from west to central Africa over the past decade and further identified Nigeria as an important hub. —Sacha Vignieri The white-bellied pangolin ( Phataginus tricuspis ) is the world’s most trafficked mammal and is at risk of extinction. Reducing the illegal wildlife trade requires an understanding of its origins. Using a genomic approach for tracing confiscations and analyzing 111 samples collected from known geographic localities in Africa and 643 seized scales from Asia between 2012 and 2018, we found that poaching pressures shifted over time from West to Central Africa. Recently, Cameroon’s southern border has emerged as a site of intense poaching. Using data from seizures representing nearly 1 million African pangolins, we identified Nigeria as one important hub for trafficking, where scales are amassed and transshipped to markets in Asia. This origin-to-destination approach offers new opportunities to disrupt the illegal wildlife trade and to guide anti-trafficking measures.},

Fiddaman et al . studied ancient DNA from chickens to reveal the evolutionary history of this once mild disease (see the Perspective by Duchene). They sequenced MDV DNA from 15 ancient chickens, finding that these strains were basal to modern ones and identifying multiple fixed genetic changes. Testing the ancient version of the gene Meq , a regulator of tumor formation, the authors found that virulence was greatly reduced compared with modern versions. These results shed light on the evolution of virulence in a major disease in modern agriculture. —Corinne Simonti The pronounced growth in livestock populations since the 1950s has altered the epidemiological and evolutionary trajectory of their associated pathogens. For example, Marek’s disease virus (MDV), which causes lymphoid tumors in chickens, has experienced a marked increase in virulence over the past century. Today, MDV infections kill &gt;90\% of unvaccinated birds, and controlling it costs more than US$1 billion annually. By sequencing MDV genomes derived from archeological chickens, we demonstrate that it has been circulating for at least 1000 years. We functionally tested the Meq oncogene, one of 49 viral genes positively selected in modern strains, demonstrating that ancient MDV was likely incapable of driving tumor formation. Our results demonstrate the power of ancient DNA approaches to trace the molecular basis of virulence in economically relevant pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Although preclinical work in SIV- and SHIV-challenged nonhuman primates suggests that vaccine-triggered CD8 + T cells can suppress or wipe out infection, several trials of HIV vaccines known to induce CD8 + T cells have failed to show efficacy. Migueles et al. examined the functions of CD8 + T cells generated by HIV vaccines in detail to try to better understand this disconnect. They found that low-sensitivity T cell receptors (TCRs) could not properly respond to the low amounts of antigen present on HIV-infected target cells, causing impaired degranulation and low CD8 + T cell–mediated cytotoxicity. Approaches that drive further T cell clonal selection, such as administering additional vaccinations or using vaccine vectors that persist, might be one way to potentially enhance the polyclonal low-avidity CD8 + T cell responses that these HIV vaccines induce. —Seth Thomas Scanlon Current HIV vaccines designed to stimulate CD8 + T cells have failed to induce immunologic control upon infection. The functions of vaccine-induced HIV-specific CD8 + T cells were investigated here in detail. Cytotoxic capacity was significantly lower than in HIV controllers and was not a consequence of low frequency or unaccumulated functional cytotoxic proteins. Low cytotoxic capacity was attributable to impaired degranulation in response to the low antigen levels present on HIV-infected targets. The vaccine-induced T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire was polyclonal and transduction of these TCRs conferred the same reduced functions. These results define a mechanism accounting for poor antiviral activity induced by these vaccines and suggest that an effective CD8 + T cell response may require a vaccination strategy that drives further TCR clonal selection.},

Liu et al . demonstrate that a thermal switch can be made from lead zirconium oxide controlled with a small voltage. The material can be changed from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric with an electric field that also dramatically changes the thermal properties. This switch changes the thermal transport by a factor of two in one direction, creating a useful thermal switch. —Brent Grocholski Effective control of heat transfer is vital for energy saving and carbon emission reduction. In contrast to achievements in electrical conduction, active control of heat transfer is much more challenging. Ferroelectrics are promising candidates for thermal switching as a result of their tunable domain structures. However, switching ratios in ferroelectrics are low (2.2), fast-speed (10 7 ) thermal switching under a small voltage (&lt;10 V). In situ reciprocal space mapping and atomistic modelings reveal that the field-driven antiferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transition induces a substantial change of primitive cell size, which modulates phonon-phonon scattering phase space drastically and results in high switching ratio.

The job of propagating quantum information is usually given to photons. However, photons do not interact with each other, and it would be advantageous to implement a propagating (“flying”) qubit using electrons. Assouline et al . achieved this goal by preparing and controlling single-electron flying qubit states in monolayer graphene. —Jelena Stajic Flying qubits encode quantum information in propagating modes instead of stationary discrete states. Although photonic flying qubits are available, the weak interaction between photons limits the efficiency of conditional quantum gates. Conversely, electronic flying qubits can use Coulomb interactions, but the weaker quantum coherence in conventional semiconductors has hindered their realization. In this work, we engineered on-demand injection of a single electronic flying qubit state and its manipulation over the Bloch sphere. The flying qubit is a Leviton propagating in quantum Hall edge channels of a high-mobility graphene monolayer. Although single-shot qubit readout and two-qubit operations are still needed for a viable manipulation of flying qubits, the coherent manipulation of an itinerant electronic state at the single-electron level presents a highly promising alternative to conventional qubits.},

The region plays a pivotal role in global climate regulation and biodiversity preservation (1). Because of its high altitude, low temperatures, and arid conditions, the QTP’s ecosystems are inherently fragile and exceptionally responsive to human activities. To better safeguard the QTP within China, the Chinese government has enacted the Ecological Protection Law, effective since September (2). However, comprehensive protection of the QTP requires changes and cooperation beyond this legislation.},

It could become a cornerstone of Europe’s ambitions to restore biodiversity and ecosystem services for decades to come ( 1 ) and demonstrate global leadership in addressing ongoing environmental crises. The draft of the law, which is a first globally, has been under political pressure from various sides, and scientists have contributed intensively to the discussion ( 2 ). After trilogue negotiations among the European Parliament, the Council of Europe, and the European Commission, the final text of the NRL has been agreed on (see the box). However, it will still be subject to final votes within the Council and Parliament. Here, we assess the potential for the NRL to overcome problems associated with implementation of related European Union (EU) legislation, strategies, and policies and what can be learned for implementation of the NRL.},

The authors found that MDV has circulated in poultry for at least 1000 years but only acquired genetic changes for increased virulence in the past century.

For example, mice raised without a microbiota are viable in their sterile isolators but rapidly succumb to infection when exposed to the outside world. Similarly, disruption of gut microbiota in patients through treatment with antibiotics incurs the risk of subsequent life-threatening opportunistic infection. Despite its importance, what constitutes a protective microbiota and the types of communities involved are poorly understood. On page 1259 of this issue, Spragge et al . ( 1 ) take a systematic approach to determine the functional characteristics of a protective microbiota, and apply these findings toward predicting bacterial communities that guard against important human pathogens. As a result, the authors integrate decades of descriptive studies into a mechanistic understanding of how microbe-microbe interactions influence human health. This could guide the rational design of probiotic communities that confer protection against opportunistic infection.},

This pairing, however, comes neither without risk nor without consequence. Theoretical models predict that for many stars with birth masses 8 to 25 times that of the Sun, their outer layers are stolen by nearby partners ( 2 ). Yet despite the high predicted numbers, detection of such stripped stars has been elusive. On page 1287 of this issue, Drout et al. ( 3 ) report electromagnetic observations that finally reveal the missing population, confirming a key prediction of binary star evolution. Additional analysis of the stars’ physical properties by Götberg et al .

  abstract     = {The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is a fundamental driver of climate, but its value is difficult to determine for times older than the roughly 800,000 years for which ice core records are available. The Cenozoic Carbon dioxide Proxy Integration Project (CenCO2PIP) Consortium assessed a comprehensive collection of proxy determinations to define the atmospheric carbon dioxide record for the past 66 million years. This synthesis provides the most complete record yet available and will help to better establish the role of carbon dioxide in climate, biological, and cryosphere evolution. —H. Jesse Smith The geological record encodes the relationship between climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) over long and short timescales, as well as potential drivers of evolutionary transitions. However, reconstructing CO 2 beyond direct measurements requires the use of paleoproxies and herein lies the challenge, as proxies differ in their assumptions, degree of understanding, and even reconstructed values. In this study, we critically evaluated, categorized, and integrated available proxies to create a high-fidelity and transparently constructed atmospheric CO 2 record spanning the past 66 million years. This newly constructed record provides clearer evidence for higher Earth system sensitivity in the past and for the role of CO 2 thresholds in biological and cryosphere evolution.},

  abstract     = {Although current spatial transcriptomics technologies can locate gene expression within tissues, they are unable to map full-length B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) sequences in this context. Engblom et al . developed a method called spatial transcriptomics for variable, diversity, and joining sequences (Spatial VDJ), which spatially annotates full-length immunoglobulin and T cell antigen receptor transcripts in frozen human tissue sections. This approach, which also resolves whole transcriptomes and tissue morphology, results in high-fidelity mapping and spatial lineage tracing of B and T cell clones in both human lymphoid and tumor tissues. This technology has the potential to advance our understanding of lymphocyte spatial dynamics in various clinically relevant phenomena such as infection, vaccination, and cancer. —Seth Thomas Scanlon The spatial distribution of lymphocyte clones within tissues is critical to their development, selection, and expansion. We have developed spatial transcriptomics of variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ) sequences (Spatial VDJ), a method that maps B cell and T cell receptor sequences in human tissue sections. Spatial VDJ captures lymphocyte clones that match canonical B and T cell distributions and amplifies clonal sequences confirmed by orthogonal methods. We found spatial congruency between paired receptor chains, developed a computational framework to predict receptor pairs, and linked the expansion of distinct B cell clones to different tumor-associated gene expression programs. Spatial VDJ delineates B cell clonal diversity and lineage trajectories within their anatomical niche. Thus, Spatial VDJ captures lymphocyte spatial clonal architecture across tissues, providing a platform to harness clonal sequences for therapy.},

  abstract     = {Under conditions of food scarcity, metabolic flexibility was historically important for humans to optimize storage and access to energy when food was not readily available. By contrast, the constant access to high-calorie foods in modern societies has become a liability, contributing to the rise in obesity and metabolic diseases. Reactive oxygen species are thought to contribute to the metabolic dysregulation associated with obesity and aging, but the underlying process was not well understood. Snieckute et al . have now identified a mechanism linking reactive oxygen species, a protein called ZAKα, and resulting changes in ribosome function, which then contribute to the observed metabolic changes across multiple model animal species. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich The ribotoxic stress response (RSR) is a signaling pathway in which the p38- and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)–activating mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) ZAKα senses stalling and/or collision of ribosomes. Here, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS)–generating agents trigger ribosomal impairment and ZAKα activation. Conversely, zebrafish larvae deficient for ZAKα are protected from ROS-induced pathology. Livers of mice fed a ROS-generating diet exhibit ZAKα-activating changes in ribosomal elongation dynamics. Highlighting a role for the RSR in metabolic regulation, ZAK-knockout mice are protected from developing high-fat high-sugar (HFHS) diet-induced blood glucose intolerance and liver steatosis. Finally, ZAK ablation slows animals from developing the hallmarks of metabolic aging. Our work highlights ROS-induced ribosomal impairment as a physiological activation signal for ZAKα that underlies metabolic adaptation in obesity and aging.},

Ensign et al . investigated whether watershed sediment loads are enough to keep up with sea-level rise at US coasts (see the Perspective by Larsen and Milligan). Their model conservatively estimated that incoming sediment loads may be sufficient in the western Gulf of Mexico and Pacific coasts but insufficient in other regions where most watersheds are smaller. Local accretion is often higher than predicted from the model, suggesting an important role for biological processes to raise marsh elevation in the face of sea-level rise. —Bianca Lopez Watershed sediment can increase elevation of tidal wetlands struggling against rising seas, but where and how much watershed sediment helps is unknown. By combining contiguous US datasets on sediment loads and tidal wetland areas for 4972 rivers and their estuaries, we calculated that river sediment accretion will be insufficient to match sea level rise in 72\% of cases because most watersheds are too small (median 21 square kilometers) to generate adequate sediment. Nearly half the tidal wetlands would require 10 times more river sediment to match sea level, a magnitude not generally achievable by dam removal in some regions. The realization that watershed sediment has little effect on most tidal wetland elevations shifts research priorities toward biological processes and coastal sediment dynamics that most influence elevation change.},

A kinetochore-mediated error correction mechanism ensures that chromosomes are correctly oriented so that DNA is equally segregated into two daughter cells. Muir et al . present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the budding yeast outer kinetochore bound to microtubules. The error correction machinery resets incorrect attachments by breaking contacts between outer kinetochore components, including dismantling a protein ring that encircles the microtubule. This study helps to explain how kinetochores harness the energy of microtubule depolymerization to move chromosomes to opposite poles of the cell. —Stella M. Hurtley Kinetochores couple chromosomes to the mitotic spindle to segregate the genome during cell division. An error correction mechanism drives the turnover of kinetochore-microtubule attachments until biorientation is achieved. The structural basis for how kinetochore-mediated chromosome segregation is accomplished and regulated remains an outstanding question. In this work, we describe the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the budding yeast outer kinetochore Ndc80 and Dam1 ring complexes assembled onto microtubules. Complex assembly occurs through multiple interfaces, and a staple within Dam1 aids ring assembly. Perturbation of key interfaces suppresses yeast viability. Force-rupture assays indicated that this is a consequence of impaired kinetochore-microtubule attachment. The presence of error correction phosphorylation sites at Ndc80-Dam1 ring complex interfaces and the Dam1 staple explains how kinetochore-microtubule attachments are destabilized and reset.},

Such movements not only benefit the breeding females, but also connect populations and habitats in a way that a population with only smaller females would be unable to do. —Sacha Vignieri The Earth’s ecosystems are increasingly deprived of large animals. Global simulations suggest that this downsizing of nature has serious consequences for biosphere functioning. However, the historical loss of large animals means that it is now often impossible to secure empirical data revealing their true ecological importance. We tracked 465 mature Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ) during their winter spawning season and show that large females (up to 114 centimeters in length), which are still found in mid-Norway, were characterized by more complex movement networks compared with smaller females. Large males were sparse but displayed similar movement patterns.

Roederer et al . analyzed r-process element abundances previously observed in stars. They identified correlated excess abundances of certain elements in some stars, which is consistent with these elements being fission products of even heavier elements. These results indicate that some r-process events make elements heavier than uranium, which then decay into the elements observed in stars. —Keith T. Smith The heaviest chemical elements are naturally produced by the rapid neutron-capture process ( r -process) during neutron star mergers or supernovae. The r -process production of elements heavier than uranium (transuranic nuclei) is poorly understood and inaccessible to experiments so must be extrapolated by using nucleosynthesis models. We examined element abundances in a sample of stars that are enhanced in r -process elements. The abundances of elements ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, and silver (atomic numbers Z = 44 to 47; mass numbers A = 99 to 110) correlate with those of heavier elements (63 ≤ Z ≤ 78, A &gt; 150).

In drier areas, trees increasingly experience more severe conditions but may also be better adapted to withstand drought. Using tree ring measurement records from more than 100 tree species, the authors found that trees growing in the wetter parts of their range are more drought sensitive, and hot, wet regions are predicted to have the greatest declines in growth under future climate change. Therefore, land management and policy focused solely on drought effects in drier regions will underestimate climate change vulnerability in forests. —Bianca Lopez Climate change is shifting the structure and function of global forests, underscoring the critical need to predict which forests are most vulnerable to a hotter and drier future. We analyzed 6.6 million tree rings from 122 species to assess trees’ sensitivity to water and energy availability. We found that trees growing in wetter portions of their range exhibit the greatest drought sensitivity. To test how these patterns of drought sensitivity influence vulnerability to climate change, we predicted tree growth through 2100.

Roque et al . report that an optimized ligand confers high site selectivity for borylation catalyzed by the Earth-abundant cobalt (see the Perspective by Berionni). The catalyst substitutes boron two carbons away from a fluoride substituent, an especially challenging target site. Moreover, use of a different boron reagent can switch the regioselectivity to the adjacent ortho site. —Jake S.

Mechanistic studies established a kinetic preference for C–H bond activation at the meta -position despite cobalt-aryl complexes resulting from ortho C–H activation being thermodynamically preferred. Switchable site selectivity in C–H borylation as a function of the boron reagent was thereby preliminarily demonstrated using a single precatalyst.},

Maize is a staple for many in sub-Saharan Africa, but the edible portions are typically low in iron. By investigating a population of natural genetic maize variants, Yan et al . identified a transcription factor that regulates iron content in the kernels. The authors found that some maize lines exhibited different sequences in the NAC78 promoter, and the presence of these promoter variants was correlated with the expression of NAC78 in the endosperm transfer cells. In these cells, iron transporters are up-regulated, suggesting that more iron is transferred into the kernel. This work opens a route to enhancing maize iron content, which may help to address iron deficiency where it is prevalent. —Madeleine Seale Iron (Fe) deficiency remains widespread among people in developing countries. To help solve this problem, breeders have been attempting to develop maize cultivars with high yields and high Fe concentrations in the kernels. We conducted a genome-wide association study and identified a gene, ZmNAC78 ( NAM/ATAF/CUC DOMAIN TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 78 ), that regulates Fe concentrations in maize kernels. We cultivated maize varieties with both high yield and high Fe concentrations in their kernels by using a molecular marker developed from a 42–base pair insertion or deletion (indel) in the promoter of ZmNAC78 . ZmNAC78 expression is enriched in the basal endosperm transfer layer of kernels, and the ZmNAC78 protein directly regulates messenger RNA abundance of Fe transporters. Our results thus provide an approach to develop maize varieties with Fe-enriched kernels.},

Looking at these interactions in Tanzania and Mozambique, Spottiswoode and Wood have shown that honeyguides respond more readily to the specific calls of their local honey-hunting partners than they do to the calls of honey hunters from other regions (see the Perspective by Searcy and Nowicki). Thus, honeyguides appear to learn the calls of their local partners, and honey hunters maintain these successful calls over generations. —Sacha Vignieri Species interactions that vary across environments can create geographical mosaics of genetic coevolution. However, traits mediating species interactions are sometimes culturally inherited. Here we show that traditions of interspecies communication between people and wild birds vary in a culturally determined geographical mosaic. Honey hunters in different parts of Africa use different calls to communicate with greater honeyguides ( Indicator indicator ) that lead them to bees’ nests. We show experimentally that honeyguides in Tanzania and Mozambique discriminate among honey hunters’ calls, responding more readily to local than to foreign calls. This was not explained by variation in sound transmission and instead suggests that honeyguides learn local human signals. We discuss the forces stabilizing and diversifying interspecies communication traditions, and the potential for cultural coevolution between species.},

A key feature of the technique is the sono-ink they used, which prevents curing beyond the focal point, thus preventing solidification beyond the intended voxel. A key advantage of using ultrasound is that it can penetrate multiple centimeters deep into opaque media. —Marc S.

We used experiments and acoustic modeling to study the frequency and scanning rate–dependent acoustic printing behaviors. DAVP achieves the key features of low acoustic streaming, rapid sonothermal polymerization, and large printing depth, enabling the printing of volumetric hydrogels and nanocomposites with various shapes regardless of their optical properties.

Because of their rich internal structure and interactions, molecules have been proposed as a promising platform for quantum science. Deterministic entanglement of individually controlled molecules has nevertheless been a long-standing experimental challenge. We demonstrate on-demand entanglement of individually prepared molecules. Using the electric dipolar interaction between pairs of molecules prepared by using a reconfigurable optical tweezer array, we deterministically created Bell pairs of molecules. Our results demonstrate the key building blocks needed for quantum applications and may advance quantum-enhanced fundamental physics tests that use trapped molecules.},

We realized the spin- 1 2 quantum XY model by encoding an effective spin- 1 2 system into the rotational states of the molecules and used it to generate a Bell state through an iSWAP operation. Conditioned on the verified existence of molecules in both tweezers at the end of the measurement, we obtained a Bell state fidelity of 0.89(6).

For example, in the United States, if women, racial minorities, and people from low-income backgrounds invented at the same rate as that of high-income white men, the overall invention rate would quadruple ( 1 ). Disparities in patenting are far larger than disparities in other measures of innovation, such as scientific paper authorship or STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workforce participation ( 2 ). One driver of this “innovator-inventor” gap may be the nature of attribution practices: Bias in who receives credit and differing standards for patent inventorship and scientific paper authorship suggest that marginalized scientists are more likely to be excluded as inventors, limiting their future inventive opportunities. Recent legislation requires the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to address this problem of patenting disparities, and many firms and nonprofits have committed to improving inventor equity. Here, we identify opportunities to better understand what policy interventions would be most effective at closing these attribution gaps.},

One such system involves the greater honeyguide ( Indicator indicator ), a small African bird that leads humans to sources of honey, principally the nests of African honey bees ( Apis mellifera). Once a nest is found, the human honey hunters break into it to obtain honey and bee larvae, and the birds benefit from consuming beeswax in the now-exposed honeycomb. Both the birds and the humans use specialized sounds to communicate their availability to participate in this cooperative interaction ( 2 ). On page 1155 of this issue, Spottiswoode and Wood ( 3 ) reveal a new layer of complexity in this remarkable mutualism, demonstrating that humans in two geographic areas use different sounds to communicate to the honeyguides, and that the birds respond preferentially to the signals used in their own local area. The coordination between signal and response suggests that cultural coevolution has occurred.},

Marshes continually build elevation by accreting sediment, but whether riverine sediment supplies are adequate to support accretion that keeps pace with RSLR has remained uncertain. On page 1191 of this issue, Ensign et al. ( 1 ) show that even in a best-case scenario, when all riverine sediment is deposited on marshes in the receiving estuaries across the United States, existing supplies are generally insufficient for accretion to keep pace with RSLR. This finding underscores the need for creative coastal planning in a time of sediment austerity that recognizes that change is inevitable and capitalizes on natural sediment redistribution processes that will prolong marsh persistence.},

  abstract     = {Meiotic recombination allows for new combinations of alleles to arise in populations and, thus, for selection to act more effectively. However, this process is also known to be inherently mutagenic, causing high turnover of recombination hotspots during evolution. Hinch et al . assembled variant data to create high-resolution mutational profiles near recombination hotspots in humans (see the Perspective by Baudat and de Massy). They found that these mutation profiles fit with known biases of DNA repair mechanisms, happen at higher frequency than previously thought, and are consistent with the higher burden of mutation in the paternal germline. This study offers a detailed look at mutational processes and enumerates the burden of de novo mutations due to meiotic recombination. —Corinne Simonti Meiotic recombination commences with hundreds of programmed DNA breaks; however, the degree to which they are accurately repaired remains poorly understood. We report that meiotic break repair is eightfold more mutagenic for single-base substitutions than was previously understood, leading to de novo mutation in one in four sperm and one in 12 eggs. Its impact on indels and structural variants is even higher, with 100- to 1300-fold increases in rates per break. We uncovered new mutational signatures and footprints relative to break sites, which implicate unexpected biochemical processes and error-prone DNA repair mechanisms, including translesion synthesis and end joining in meiotic break repair. We provide evidence that these mechanisms drive mutagenesis in human germ lines and lead to disruption of hundreds of genes genome wide.},

  abstract     = {Domestication of plants and animals is often characterized by selection for specific traits interspersed with introduction of new desirable traits from wild relatives. Yang et al . examined genetic data from more than 1000 varieties of maize and related species to clarify the complex origins of this agricultural staple. They found evidence that after initial domestication, introgression from a relative of domesticated maize, Zea mays ssp. mexicana , occurred in the highlands of Mexico before propagating across Central America. Alleles from this wild relative affect photoperiodicity and flowering time, which suggests that traits from Zea mays ssp. mexicana may have been beneficial during domestication. These results demonstrate the importance of broad sampling in elucidating the history of domesticates. —Corinne Simonti The origins of maize were the topic of vigorous debate for nearly a century, but neither the current genetic model nor earlier archaeological models account for the totality of available data, and recent work has highlighted the potential contribution of a wild relative, Zea mays ssp. mexicana . Our population genetic analysis reveals that the origin of modern maize can be traced to an admixture between ancient maize and Zea mays ssp. mexicana in the highlands of Mexico some 4000 years after domestication began. We show that variation in admixture is a key component of maize diversity, both at individual loci and for additive genetic variation underlying agronomic traits. Our results clarify the origin of modern maize and raise new questions about the anthropogenic mechanisms underlying dispersal throughout the Americas.},

  abstract     = {Ultraviolet radiation can generate lesions in DNA in which two adjacent bases become covalently linked as a cyclobutene pyrimidine dimer. However, the enzyme that fixes these lesions also takes advantage of the energy in light to initiate the repair reaction. Two independent groups, Maestre-Reyna et al . and Christou et al ., used time-resolved crystallography at an x-ray free electron laser to capture the process of DNA repair from picoseconds to microseconds (see the Perspective by Vos). A bent flavin conformation appears very early after the excitation pulse, and the enzyme constrains the cofactor conformation to favor electron transfer to the lesion rather than deexcitation. The cyclobutane dimer is cleaved one bond at a time with a transient intermediate predominating at 1 nanosecond. After cleavage, the separated bases occupy more space in the active site than in the lesion, which facilitates dissociation from the enzyme. —Michael A. Funk Photolyases, a ubiquitous class of flavoproteins, use blue light to repair DNA photolesions. In this work, we determined the structural mechanism of the photolyase-catalyzed repair of a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) lesion using time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX). We obtained 18 snapshots that show time-dependent changes in four reaction loci. We used these results to create a movie that depicts the repair of CPD lesions in the picosecond-to-nanosecond range, followed by the recovery of the enzymatic moieties involved in catalysis, completing the formation of the fully reduced enzyme-product complex at 500 nanoseconds. Finally, back-flip intermediates of the thymine bases to reanneal the DNA were captured at 25 to 200 microseconds. Our data cover the complete molecular mechanism of a photolyase and, importantly, its chemistry and enzymatic catalysis at work across a wide timescale and at atomic resolution.},

Two important T RM cell subsets in human skin are interferon-γ–producing CD8 + T RM 1 cells, which have antiviral and anticancer roles, and interleukin-17–secreting CD8 + T RM 17 cells, which participate in antibacterial immunity and wound-healing responses. However, both T RM cell subtypes can also contribute to skin pathologies. Studying mice, Park et al . established that skin T RM 1 cells require a different signaling pathway for their differentiation relative to T RM 17 cells. T RM 17 cells could be selectively ablated by targeting elements of the signaling axis that is involved in T RM 1 development. —Seth Thomas Scanlon Skin-resident CD8 + T cells include distinct interferon-γ–producing [tissue-resident memory T type 1 (T RM 1)] and interleukin-17 (IL-17)–producing (T RM 17) subsets that differentially contribute to immune responses. However, whether these populations use common mechanisms to establish tissue residence is unknown. In this work, we show that T RM 1 and T RM 17 cells navigate divergent trajectories to acquire tissue residency in the skin. T RM 1 cells depend on a T-bet–Hobit–IL-15 axis, whereas T RM 17 cells develop independently of these factors. Instead, c-Maf commands a tissue-resident program in T RM 17 cells parallel to that induced by Hobit in T RM 1 cells, with an ICOS–c-Maf–IL-7 axis pivotal to T RM 17 cell commitment. Accordingly, by targeting this pathway, skin T RM 17 cells can be ablated without compromising their T RM 1 counterparts. Thus, skin-resident T cells rely on distinct molecular circuitries, which can be exploited to strategically modulate local immunity.},

  abstract     = {Close to absolute zero, the ratio of thermal and charge conductivities of many materials has been found to be proportional to the temperature. This behavior, referred to as the Wiedemann-Franz law, is expected if the same quasiparticles are the carriers of both heat and charge transport. In strongly correlated materials, however, quasiparticles may no longer be well defined. W. Wang et al . undertook a comprehensive numerical study of heat and charge transport within the doped Hubbard model, which incorporates strong interactions. Surprisingly, they found that as they lowered the temperature as far as their numerical methods allowed, the system approached the Wiedemann-Franz law limit. —Jelena Stajic Many metallic quantum materials display anomalous transport phenomena that defy a Fermi liquid description. Here, we use numerical methods to calculate thermal and charge transport in the doped Hubbard model and observe a crossover separating high- and low-temperature behaviors. Distinct from the behavior at high temperatures, the Lorenz number L becomes weakly doping dependent and less sensitive to parameters at low temperatures. At the lowest numerically accessible temperatures, L roughly approaches the Wiedemann-Franz constant L 0 , even in a doped Mott insulator that lacks well-defined quasiparticles. Decomposing the energy current operator indicates a compensation between kinetic and potential contributions, which may help to clarify the interpretation of transport experiments beyond Boltzmann theory in strongly correlated metals.},

He et al . tracked crystal grains in polycrystalline nickel through deformation cycles. The authors found that these grains not only rotate in both directions but also sometimes experience internal rotation of the lattice. This unexpected lattice rotation occurs more often in the larger grains and is due to a phenomenon called back stress, which drives dislocation slip that generates the rotation. This discovery represents an important and distinct mechanism for accommodating deformation and could lead to better material design. —Brent Grocholski In polycrystalline metals, plastic deformation is accompanied by lattice rotations resulting from dislocation glide. Following these rotations in three dimensions requires nondestructive methods that so far have been limited to grain sizes at the micrometer scale. We tracked the rotations of individual grains in nanograined nickel by using three-dimensional orientation mapping in a transmission electron microscope before and after in situ nanomechanical testing. Many of the larger-size grains underwent unexpected lattice rotations, which we attributed to a reversal of rotation during unloading. This inherent reversible rotation originated from a back stress–driven dislocation slip process that was more active for larger grains. These results provide insights into the fundamental deformation mechanisms of nanograined metals and will help to guide strategies for material design and engineering applications.},

The radical catalysts can be generated from easily prepared NHC-borane complexes, and the broad availability of the chiral NHC component provides substantial benefits for stereochemical control. Mechanistic studies support a catalytic cycle comprising a sequence of boryl radical addition, hydrogen atom transfer, cyclization, and elimination of the boryl radical catalyst, wherein the chiral NHC subunit determines the enantioselectivity of the radical cyclization.

Doubling the atmospheric CO 2 concentration increases the impact of any given increase in CO 2 by about 25\%, owing to changes induced in the climatological base state. The more anthropogenic CO 2 emissions raise the atmospheric CO 2 concentration, the more serious the consequences will be. —H. Jesse Smith When evaluating the effect of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) changes on Earth’s climate, it is widely assumed that instantaneous radiative forcing from a doubling of a given CO 2 concentration (IRF 2×CO2 ) is constant and that variances in climate sensitivity arise from differences in radiative feedbacks or dependence of these feedbacks on the climatological base state. Here, we show that the IRF 2×CO2 is not constant, but rather depends on the climatological base state, increasing by about 25\% for every doubling of CO 2 , and has increased by about 10\% since the preindustrial era primarily due to the cooling within the upper stratosphere, implying a proportionate increase in climate sensitivity. This base-state dependence also explains about half of the intermodel spread in IRF 2×CO2 , a problem that has persisted among climate models for nearly three decades.},

EphA2 is unusual in that both the bound and unbound states are involved in signaling—the former produces tumor suppressive effects, and the latter promotes oncogenesis. Shi et al . observed structural properties of EphA2 in live monkey kidney cells by an advanced time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy method called pulsed interleaved excitation–fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS). This method enabled the measurement of receptor diffusion and oligomerization. The unbound receptors formed multimers that kept the receptor’s own kinase domains apart and promoted signaling through other associated kinases. Ligand binding promoted conformational changes into distinct clusters in which the intrinsic kinase domains engaged in transphosphorylation of receptor tyrosine residues. —L. Bryan Ray Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that initiates both ligand-dependent tumor-suppressive and ligand-independent oncogenic signaling. We used time-resolved, live-cell fluorescence spectroscopy to show that the ligand-free EphA2 assembles into multimers driven by two types of intermolecular interactions in the ectodomain. The first type entails extended symmetric interactions required for ligand-induced receptor clustering and tumor-suppressive signaling that inhibits activity of the oncogenic extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (AKT) protein kinases and suppresses cell migration. The second type is an asymmetric interaction between the amino terminus and the membrane proximal domain of the neighboring receptors, which supports oncogenic signaling and promotes migration in vitro and tumor invasiveness in vivo. Our results identify the molecular interactions that drive the formation of the EphA2 multimeric signaling clusters and reveal the pivotal role of EphA2 assembly in dictating its opposing functions in oncogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Prokaryotic type III CRISPR-Cas systems are complex and efficient barriers that protect host cells against foreign nucleic acids. To cope with viral infections, these systems often combine CRISPR RNA-guided viral RNA and DNA cleavage with the synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylate (cA n ) signaling molecules, which activate a diverse range of auxiliary proteins that reinforce CRISPR-Cas defense. Mogila et al . identified a cA n -dependent effector (named Cami1) that, in response to type III CRISPR-Cas signaling, cleaves messenger RNA in a translating bacterial ribosome, thereby blocking protein synthesis and cell growth. Cami1 uses an active ribosome stalk-dependent capture mechanism, which is similar to that of eukaryotic antiviral ribosome-inactivating proteins. —Di Jiang Prokaryotic type III CRISPR-Cas antiviral systems employ cyclic oligoadenylate (cA n ) signaling to activate a diverse range of auxiliary proteins that reinforce the CRISPR-Cas defense. Here we characterize a class of cA n -dependent effector proteins named CRISPR-Cas-associated messenger RNA (mRNA) interferase 1 (Cami1) consisting of a CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold sensor domain fused to winged helix-turn-helix and a RelE-family mRNA interferase domain. Upon activation by cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA 4 ), Cami1 cleaves mRNA exposed at the ribosomal A-site thereby depleting mRNA and leading to cell growth arrest. The structures of apo-Cami1 and the ribosome-bound Cami1-cA 4 complex delineate the conformational changes that lead to Cami1 activation and the mechanism of Cami1 binding to a bacterial ribosome, revealing unexpected parallels with eukaryotic ribosome-inactivating proteins.},

  abstract     = {Planets form in protoplanetary disks of gas and dust around young stars that are undergoing their own formation process. The amount of material in the disk determines how big the planets can grow. Stefánsson et al . observed a nearby low-mass star using near-infrared spectroscopy. They detected Doppler shifts due to an orbiting exoplanet of at least 13 Earth masses, which is almost the mass of Neptune. Theoretical models do not predict the formation of such a massive planet around a low-mass star (see the Perspective by Masset). The authors used simulations to show that its presence could be explained if the protoplanetary disk were 10 times more massive than expected for the host star. —Keith T. Smith Theories of planet formation predict that low-mass stars should rarely host exoplanets with masses exceeding that of Neptune. We used radial velocity observations to detect a Neptune-mass exoplanet orbiting LHS 3154, a star that is nine times less massive than the Sun. The exoplanet’s orbital period is 3.7 days, and its minimum mass is 13.2 Earth masses. We used simulations to show that the high planet-to-star mass ratio (&gt;3.5 × 10 −4 ) is not an expected outcome of either the core accretion or gravitational instability theories of planet formation. In the core-accretion simulations, we show that close-in Neptune-mass planets are only formed if the dust mass of the protoplanetary disk is an order of magnitude greater than typically observed around very low-mass stars.},

  abstract     = {Anyone who has driven late at night will likely recognize microsleeps, those seconds-long “sleep” bouts that pop, unwelcome, into our otherwise wakeful attention. In some contexts, such interruptions of wakefulness are dangerous, but if they provide cumulative sleep benefits, they could be useful in animals that otherwise need to be continually vigilant. Libourel et al . tested this hypothesis in breeding chinstrap penguins ( Pygoscelis antarcticus ) using remote electroencephalogram monitoring (see the Perspective by Harding and Vyazovskiy). The penguins nodded off more than 10,000 times a day, for only around 4 seconds at a time, but still managed to accumulate close to 11 hours of sleep. Their breeding success suggests that this strategy allows them to get the sleep they need. —Sacha Vignieri Microsleeps, the seconds-long interruptions of wakefulness by eye closure and sleep-related brain activity, are dangerous when driving and might be too short to provide the restorative functions of sleep. If microsleeps do fulfill sleep functions, then animals faced with a continuous need for vigilance might resort to this sleep strategy. We investigated electroencephalographically defined sleep in wild chinstrap penguins, at sea and while nesting in Antarctica, constantly exposed to an egg predator and aggression from other penguins. The penguins nodded off &gt;10,000 times per day, engaging in bouts of bihemispheric and unihemispheric slow-wave sleep lasting on average only 4 seconds, but resulting in the accumulation of &gt;11 hours of sleep for each hemisphere. The investment in microsleeps by successfully breeding penguins suggests that the benefits of sleep can accrue incrementally.},

  abstract     = {Electrocaloric materials can pump heat in response to a changing electric field, which makes them useful in solid-state cooling applications. Zheng et al . discovered that a very large electrocaloric effect emerges in a terpolymer when pores are introduced with a sacrificial organic crystal with a low boiling temperature. The polymer interface around the pores has a large fraction of polarizable material, which gives rise to the large electrocaloric effect. The authors show that this porous material is stable after cycling it through an electric field 3 million times. —Brent Grocholski The electrocaloric effect demands the maximized degree of freedom (DOF) of polar domains and the lowest energy barrier to facilitate the transition of polarization. However, optimization of the DOF and energy barrier—including domain size, crystallinity, multiconformation coexistence, polar correlation, and other factors in bulk ferroelectrics—has reached a limit. We used organic crystal dimethylhexynediol (DMHD) as a three-dimensional sacrificial master to assemble polar conformations at the heterogeneous interface in poly(vinylidene fluoride)–based terpolymer. DMHD was evaporated, and the epitaxy-like process induced an ultrafinely distributed, multiconformation-coexisting polar interface exhibiting a giant conformational entropy. Under a low electric field, the interface-augmented terpolymer had a high entropy change of 100 J/(kg·K). This interface polarization strategy is generally applicable to dielectric capacitors, supercapacitors, and other related applications.},

  abstract     = {Ultraviolet radiation can generate lesions in DNA in which two adjacent bases become covalently linked as a cyclobutene pyrimidine dimer. However, the enzyme that fixes these lesions also takes advantage of the energy in light to initiate the repair reaction. Two independent groups, Maestre-Reyna et al . and Christou et al ., used time-resolved crystallography at an x-ray free electron laser to capture the process of DNA repair from picoseconds to microseconds (see the Perspective by Vos). A bent flavin conformation appears very early after the excitation pulse, and the enzyme constrains the cofactor conformation to favor electron transfer to the lesion rather than deexcitation. The cyclobutane dimer is cleaved one bond at a time with a transient intermediate predominating at 1 nanosecond. After cleavage, the separated bases occupy more space in the active site than in the lesion, which facilitates dissociation from the enzyme. —Michael A. Funk Photolyase is an enzyme that uses light to catalyze DNA repair. To capture the reaction intermediates involved in the enzyme’s catalytic cycle, we conducted a time-resolved crystallography experiment. We found that photolyase traps the excited state of the active cofactor, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), in a highly bent geometry. This excited state performs electron transfer to damaged DNA, inducing repair. We show that the repair reaction, which involves the lysis of two covalent bonds, occurs through a single-bond intermediate. The transformation of the substrate into product crowds the active site and disrupts hydrogen bonds with the enzyme, resulting in stepwise product release, with the 3′ thymine ejected first, followed by the 5′ base.},

These de novo mutations (DNMs) can have deleterious consequences but are also a source of genetic diversity and adaptability. On page 1012 of this issue, Hinch et al . ( 2 ) investigated the occurrence of mutations during meiotic recombination in the human genome. Meiotic recombination is a genome-wide program of exchanges between the paternal and maternal chromosomes that occurs in germ cells ( 3 ). They found that the mutation rate at meiotic recombination sites was several hundred–fold higher than the genome average. Some mutations were products of the meiotic recombination pathway, and others resulted from other DNA repair pathways. These mutations are transmitted to the offspring and can be linked to pathologies.},

By contrast, in natural photoenzymes, enzyme-substrate complexes can be preformed and catalysis can be initiated by ultrashort light pulses. The photoenzyme cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) DNA photolyase repairs the potentially mutagenic DNA CPDs that are induced by ultraviolet light.

Some of the discovered genes are linked to precise DNA-editing systems that may enable safer therapeutic genome editing. The authors also identified a CRISPR-Cas enzyme, Cas14, which cuts RNA precisely. These discoveries may help to further improve DNA- and RNA-editing technologies, with wide-ranging applications in medicine and biotechnology. —Di Jiang Microbial systems underpin many biotechnologies, including CRISPR, but the exponential growth of sequence databases makes it difficult to find previously unidentified systems. In this work, we develop the fast locality-sensitive hashing–based clustering (FLSHclust) algorithm, which performs deep clustering on massive datasets in linearithmic time. We incorporated FLSHclust into a CRISPR discovery pipeline and identified 188 previously unreported CRISPR-linked gene modules, revealing many additional biochemical functions coupled to adaptive immunity. We experimentally characterized three HNH nuclease–containing CRISPR systems, including the first type IV system with a specified interference mechanism, and engineered them for genome editing.

In a review, Buller et al . collect this recent progress in biocatalysis research and look ahead toward increasing the use of computational tools, accelerating design test cycles, and expanding chemistry beyond what is familiar in nature. Engineered enzymes provide a green chemistry solution to the synthesis of complex organic molecules and can be used in the degradation of waste plastic and chemicals. —Michael A.

This green technology is used in countless applications from bench scale to industrial production and allows practitioners to access complex organic molecules, often with fewer synthetic steps and reduced waste. The last decade has seen an explosion in the development of experimental and computational tools to tailor enzymatic properties, equipping enzyme engineers with the ability to create biocatalysts that perform reactions not present in nature. By using (chemo)-enzymatic synthesis routes or orchestrating intricate enzyme cascades, scientists can synthesize elaborate targets ranging from DNA and complex pharmaceuticals to starch made in vitro from CO 2 -derived methanol. In addition, new chemistries have emerged through the combination of biocatalysis with transition metal catalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis.

The resulting landscape is highly rugged and harbors 514 fitness peaks. However, its highest peaks are accessible to evolving populations via abundant fitness-increasing paths. Different peaks share large basins of attraction that render the outcome of adaptive evolution highly contingent on chance events.

Functional effects of morphogens in large tissues can thus be understood by consideration of emergent supracellular properties. —Stella M. Hurtley During vertebrate organogenesis, increases in morphological complexity are tightly coupled to morphogen expression. In this work, we studied how morphogens influence self-organizing processes at the collective or “supra”-cellular scale in avian skin. We made physical measurements across length scales, which revealed morphogen-enabled material property differences that were amplified at supracellular scales in comparison to cellular scales. At the supracellular scale, we found that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) promoted “solidification” of tissues, whereas bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) promoted fluidity and enhanced mechanical activity. Together, these effects created basement membrane–less compartments within mesenchymal tissue that were mechanically primed to drive avian skin tissue budding. Understanding this multiscale process requires the ability to distinguish between proximal effects of morphogens that occur at the cellular scale and their functional effects, which emerge at the supracellular scale.},

In the adult mouse ventricular-subventricular zone, NSCs are heterogeneous and, depending on their location in the niche, give rise to different subtypes of olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons. Here, we show that multiple regionally distinct NSCs, including domains that are usually quiescent, are recruited on different gestation days during pregnancy. Synchronized activation of these adult NSC pools generates transient waves of short-lived OB interneurons, especially in layers with less neurogenesis under homeostasis. Using spatial transcriptomics, we identified molecular markers of pregnancy-associated interneurons and showed that some subsets are temporarily needed for own pup recognition. Thus, pregnancy triggers transient yet behaviorally relevant neurogenesis, highlighting the physiological relevance of adult stem cell heterogeneity.},

Alkylation at the α-position of the amide (hook) is followed by highly selective branched-to-linear isomerization (slide) to effect amide migration to the end of the newly introduced alkyl chain; thus, the choice of alkylation reagent sets the homologation length. The key step involves a carbon-carbon bond activation process by a carbene-coordinated rhodium complex with assistance from a removable directing group.

However, the resulting interpretations can be complicated by the competing effects of physical and biological processes. Halevy et al . show that inorganic reactions and transport in depositional environments, rather than microbial influence, leads to the wide range of sulfur isotopic values observed. The observed increase in sulfate–pyrite isotope fractionation over most of Earth’s history primarily reflects the effects of increasing marine sulfate concentration, except over the past 550 million years, when supercontinent breakup and assembly and variations in sea level were more important. Bryant et al . present a microanalytical method applied to individual pyrite grains that deconvolves the multiple signals influencing sulfur isotopes. They were able to determine both the microbial isotopic effects and inorganic fractionation produced by depositional conditions. Their approach will help in reassessing conflicting interpretations of the sulfur isotopic record. —H. Jesse Smith Reconstructions of coupled carbon, oxygen, and sulfur cycles rely heavily on sedimentary pyrite sulfur isotope compositions (δ 34 S pyr ). With a model of sediment diagenesis, paired with global datasets of sedimentary parameters, we show that the wide range of δ 34 S pyr (~100 per mil) in modern marine sediments arises from geographic patterns in the relative rates of diffusion, burial, and microbial reduction of sulfate. By contrast, the microbial sulfur isotope fractionation remains large and relatively uniform. Over Earth history, the effect of increasing seawater sulfate and oxygen concentrations on sulfate and sulfide transport and reaction may explain the corresponding increase observed in the δ 34 S offset between sulfate and pyrite. More subtle variations may be related to changes in depositional environments associated with sea level fluctuations and supercontinent cycles.},

The authors found that air spaces between hypocotyl cells were impaired, preventing scattering of light across the tissue. Intercellular air spaces have been known to aid gas exchange and facilitate buoyancy in aquatic plants. The work here demonstrates an additional functional role for air spaces in setting up a light gradient and also provides insight into how they form. —Madeleine Seale In plants, light direction is perceived by the phototropin photoreceptors, which trigger directional growth responses known as phototropism. The formation of a phototropin activation gradient across a photosensitive organ initiates this response. However, the optical tissue properties that functionally contribute to phototropism remain unclear. In this work, we show that intercellular air channels limit light transmittance through various organs in several species. Air channels enhance light scattering in Arabidopsis hypocotyls, thereby steepening the light gradient. This is required for an efficient phototropic response in Arabidopsis and Brassica. We identified an embryonically expressed ABC transporter required for the presence of air channels in seedlings and a structure surrounding them.

  abstract     = {Glycosylations are an important feature of many natural products, but methods to install sugars can suffer from limitations on stereospecificity because many reactions proceed through an oxocarbenium intermediate in which stereochemistry is lost. Deng et al . developed a versatile palladium-catalyzed reaction for the glycosylation of phenols that resembles palladium-catalyzed aryl carbon–oxygen cross-coupling reactions. Palladium oxidative addition to an easily prepared ortho-iodobiphenyl S-glycoside yields a complex that reacts with a wide range of phenolates through a S N 2 mechanism to afford the glycosylated phenols with inversion of stereochemistry. This reaction works well with, but it is not limited to, 2-deoxy sugars and can be performed in one pot with other palladium-catalyzed cross-couplings to yield complex O-glycosides. —Michael A. Funk Despite their importance in life and material sciences, the efficient construction of stereo-defined glycosides remains a challenge. Studies of carbohydrate functions would be advanced if glycosylation methods were as reliable and modular as palladium (Pd)-catalyzed cross-coupling. However, Pd-catalysis excels in forming sp 2 -hybridized carbon centers whereas glycosylation mostly builds sp 3 -hybridized C–O linkages. We report a glycosylation platform through Pd-catalyzed S N 2 displacement from phenols toward bench-stable, aryl-iodide–containing glycosyl sulfides. The key Pd(II) oxidative addition intermediate diverges from an arylating agent (Csp 2 electrophile) to a glycosylating agent (Csp 3 electrophile). This method inherits many merits of cross-coupling reactions, including operational simplicity and functional group tolerance. It preserves the S N 2 mechanism for various substrates and is amenable to late-stage glycosylation of commercial drugs and natural products.},

  abstract     = {Thermoelectric modules convert waste heat into electricity, but finding materials that go in between the thermoelectric material and the electrodes is challenging because inappropriate interface materials can drive failure of the thermoelectric module. Xie et al . developed a screening strategy for isolating more chemically complex interface candidate materials (see the Perspective by Xu and Tian). Using this strategy, the authors identified a magnesium–copper–antimony semimetal that is an excellent interface material for a specific type of high-performance thermoelectric module. This approach should apply to a wide range of material chemistries. —Brent Grocholski Thermoelectric interface materials (TEiMs) are essential to the development of thermoelectric generators. Common TEiMs use pure metals or binary alloys but have performance stability issues. Conventional selection of TEiMs generally relies on trial-and-error experimentation. We developed a TEiM screening strategy that is based on phase diagram predictions by density functional theory calculations. By combining the phase diagram with electrical resistivity and melting points of potential reaction products, we discovered that the semimetal MgCuSb is a reliable TEiM for high-performance MgAgSb. The MgCuSb/MgAgSb junction exhibits low interfacial contact resistivity (ρ c &lt;1 microhm square centimeter) even after annealing at 553 kelvin for 16 days. The fabricated two-pair MgAgSb/Mg 3.2 Bi 1.5 Sb 0.5 module demonstrated a high conversion efficiency of 9.25\% under a 300 kelvin temperature gradient. We performed an international round-robin testing of module performance to confirm the measurement reliability. The strategy can be applied to other thermoelectric materials, filling a vital gap in the development of thermoelectric modules.},

  abstract     = {Dolomite, a calcium magnesium carbonate, is one of the major minerals in carbonate rocks. However, growing the mineral under laboratory conditions has proven very difficult, resulting in the so-called “dolomite problem.” Kim et al . may have solved this problem by identifying the need to cycle the solution between undersaturated and supersaturated conditions (see the Perspective by García-Ruiz). Cycling speeds up crystal growth 10 million times and may be imperative for making large amounts of dolomite. This observation is consistent with where we see dolomite formation in nature: in coastal and evaporative environments. —Brent Grocholski Crystals grow in supersaturated solutions. A mysterious counterexample is dolomite CaMg(CO 3 ) 2 , a geologically abundant sedimentary mineral that does not readily grow at ambient conditions, not even under highly supersaturated solutions. Using atomistic simulations, we show that dolomite initially precipitates a cation-disordered surface, where high surface strains inhibit further crystal growth. However, mild undersaturation will preferentially dissolve these disordered regions, enabling increased order upon reprecipitation. Our simulations predict that frequent cycling of a solution between supersaturation and undersaturation can accelerate dolomite growth by up to seven orders of magnitude. We validated our theory with in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy, directly observing bulk dolomite growth after pulses of dissolution. This mechanism explains why modern dolomite is primarily found in natural environments with pH or salinity fluctuations. More generally, it reveals that the growth and ripening of defect-free crystals can be facilitated by deliberate periods of mild dissolution.},

  abstract     = {The sulfur isotope composition of pyrite found in marine sediments and sedimentary rocks is often used to try to reconstruct the coupled cycles of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur. However, the resulting interpretations can be complicated by the competing effects of physical and biological processes. Halevy et al . show that inorganic reactions and transport in depositional environments, rather than microbial influence, leads to the wide range of sulfur isotopic values observed. The observed increase in sulfate–pyrite isotope fractionation over most of Earth’s history primarily reflects the effects of increasing marine sulfate concentration, except over the past 550 million years, when supercontinent breakup and assembly and variations in sea level were more important. Bryant et al . present a microanalytical method applied to individual pyrite grains that deconvolves the multiple signals influencing sulfur isotopes. They were able to determine both the microbial isotopic effects and inorganic fractionation produced by depositional conditions. Their approach will help in reassessing conflicting interpretations of the sulfur isotopic record. —H. Jesse Smith Reconstructions of past environmental conditions and biological activity are often based on bulk stable isotope proxies, which are inherently open to multiple interpretations. This is particularly true of the sulfur isotopic composition of sedimentary pyrite (δ 34 S pyr ), which is used to reconstruct ocean-atmosphere oxidation state and track the evolution of several microbial metabolic pathways. We present a microanalytical approach to deconvolving the multiple signals that influence δ 34 S pyr , yielding both the unambiguous determination of microbial isotopic fractionation (ε mic ) and new information about depositional conditions. We applied this approach to recent glacial-interglacial sediments, which feature over 70‰ variations in bulk δ 34 S pyr across these environmental transitions. Despite profound environmental change, ε mic remained essentially invariant throughout this interval and the observed range in δ 34 S pyr was instead driven by climate-induced variations in sedimentation.},

  abstract     = {Charge current in solids is carried by discrete entities called quasiparticles that give rise to associated shot noise. For the peculiar phase called the strange metal, however, this quasiparticle scenario is expected to break down, leading to a reduction in shot noise. Chen et al . tested this prediction by measuring shot noise in nanowires made of the heavy fermion material YbRh 2 Si 2 in the strange metal phase. In these samples, shot noise was indeed reduced compared with the values measured in a comparable gold nanowire and with the theoretical expectations for a system of quasiparticles. —Jelena Stajic Strange-metal behavior has been observed in materials ranging from high-temperature superconductors to heavy fermion metals. In conventional metals, current is carried by quasiparticles; although it has been suggested that quasiparticles are absent in strange metals, direct experimental evidence is lacking. We measured shot noise to probe the granularity of the current-carrying excitations in nanowires of the heavy fermion strange metal YbRh 2 Si 2 . When compared with conventional metals, shot noise in these nanowires is strongly suppressed. This suppression cannot be attributed to either electron-phonon or electron-electron interactions in a Fermi liquid, which suggests that the current is not carried by well-defined quasiparticles in the strange-metal regime that we probed. Our work sets the stage for similar studies of other strange metals.},

At low energies, they mostly originate from the Sun, whereas at high energies, they are expected to be emitted by nearby active galaxies. The Telescope Array Collaboration now reports the detection of a cosmic ray event with an energy of about 240 exa–electron volts, more than a million times higher than that achieved by artificial particle accelerators. Such high-energy particles should experience only small deflections by foreground magnetic fields, but tracing back the arrival direction shows no obvious source galaxy. The authors suggest that the foreground magnetic fields might be stronger than expected, or there could be unknown particle physics at high energies. —Keith T.

  abstract     = {As climate change warms Earth, the melting cryosphere creates nascent ecosystems that have future value as habitat but that are also the frontlines for resource extraction ( 1 ). For example, glacier retreat uncovers rivers and valleys that go through rapid ecological succession to provide new habitats for important species, such as moose and Pacific salmon ( 2 – 5 ). However, mining companies are looking to retreating glaciers for newly exposed mineral deposits ( 6 ). This proglacial mining is a global pressure, from Greenland to Kyrgyzstan to western Canada ( 6 ). Yet environmental and mining policies might fail to consider the future ecological value and capacity of emerging habitats. We illustrate these issues below by exploring the overlap of glacial retreat, Pacific salmon future habitats, and mining pressures in western Canada and southern Alaska. Stewardship of glacierized landscapes, and other ecosystems that are being transformed by climate change, urgently need forward-looking science and environmental policy.},

This combination of molecular sensing and physical bending of light allows humans to respond more accurately to their surroundings. Plants also sense and respond to light through photoreceptors—for example, by using directional growth to bend toward strong light (phototropism). Decades of work has identified the molecular mechanisms that underlie phototropism ( 1 , 2 ), but whether plants also physically alter beams of light to enhance their ability to respond was not known. On page 935 of this issue, Nawkar et al . ( 3 ) report that plants can use intercellular air spaces to actively modify the path of light and perform accurate phototropism. This finding highlights the importance of physical organ structure in environmental sensing and opens new avenues to understand the role of air spaces in other contexts.},

However, their use in thermoelectric generators has been hampered by the lack of robust materials that constitute the interface between electrodes and thermoelectric materials within the device ( 4 ). On page 921 of this issue, Xie et al . ( 5 ) report a promising strategy for identifying optimal interface materials for different thermoelectric materials.

Classically, symmetry breaking was thought to be initiated by spatial differences in gene expression caused by morphogens ( 1 ). On page 902 of this issue, Yang et al .

However, the accuracy of these multicomponent enzymes is currently limited, and the root cause of this shortcoming has been unknown. George et al . now show that type V-K CASTs exhibit an RNA-independent integration pathway primarily driven by the AAA+ ATPase TnsC (see the Perspective by Dhingra and Sashital). Untargeted transposition events occur preferentially at A/T-rich sites, with further context effects imposed by sequence motifs recognized by the transposase TnsB. Using mechanistic insights gained from biochemical and genetic experiments, the authors tuned TnsC availability in cells and substantially improved overall integration specificity, enabling downstream applications for precision genome engineering. —Di Jiang CRISPR-associated transposases (CASTs) repurpose nuclease-deficient CRISPR effectors to catalyze RNA-guided transposition of large genetic payloads. Type V-K CASTs offer potential technology advantages but lack accuracy, and the molecular basis for this drawback has remained elusive. Here, we reveal that type V-K CASTs maintain an RNA-independent, “untargeted” transposition pathway alongside RNA-dependent integration, driven by the local availability of TnsC filaments. Using cryo–electron microscopy, single-molecule experiments, and high-throughput sequencing, we found that a minimal, CRISPR-less transpososome preferentially directs untargeted integration at AT-rich sites, with additional local specificity imparted by TnsB. By exploiting this knowledge, we suppressed untargeted transposition and increased type V-K CAST specificity up to 98.1\% in cells without compromising on-target integration efficiency. These findings will inform further engineering of CAST systems for accurate, kilobase-scale genome engineering applications.},

Owen et al . developed a model built on prior experimental findings, which reveals that the three-dimensional folding of the genome can help cells remember as long as the systems that write the marks satisfy certain design principles that they discovered. The model unites many classic observations and makes predictions that emerging experimental techniques can test. It also hints at a surprising analogy between how cells remember and how memories can be stored in neural networks. —Di Jiang Cells remember their identities, in part, by using epigenetic marks—chemical modifications placed along the genome. How can mark patterns remain stable over cell generations despite their constant erosion by replication and other processes? We developed a theoretical model that reveals that three-dimensional (3D) genome organization can stabilize epigenetic memory as long as (i) there is a large density difference between chromatin compartments, (ii) modifying “reader-writer” enzymes spread marks in three dimensions, and (iii) the enzymes are limited in abundance relative to their histone substrates. Analogous to an associative memory that encodes memory in neuronal connectivity, mark patterns are encoded in a 3D network of chromosomal contacts.

  abstract     = {There are many strategies in nature and biomedicine for establishing strong connections between living tissue and nonliving surfaces, but the mechanisms for separating these biointerfaces quickly and on demand are less well understood. Mytilus mussels can strongly adhere to inorganic surfaces, but they can also rapidly detach when threatened. Sivasundarampillai et al . use advanced imaging and spectroscopy methods to study the detachment process (see the Perspective by Pan and Li). They found that the responsiveness of this quick release relies on the oscillating motion of cilia and subsequently the change of mechanical interaction between the byssus stem and mussel foot tissues. The beating movement can be influenced by the application of serotonin and dopamine, thus implicating neurotransmitters in controlling the mechanical interaction between living and nonliving tissues. —Marc S. Lavine The mussel byssus stem provides a strong and compact mechanically mismatched biointerface between living tissue and a nonliving biopolymer. Yet, in a poorly understood process, mussels can simply jettison their entire byssus, rebuilding a new one in just hours. We characterized the structure and composition of the byssus biointerface using histology, confocal Raman mapping, phase contrast–enhanced microcomputed tomography, and advanced electron microscopy, revealing a sophisticated junction consisting of abiotic biopolymer sheets interdigitated between living extracellular matrix. The sheet surfaces are in intimate adhesive contact with billions of motile epithelial cilia that control biointerface strength and stem release through their collective movement, which is regulated neurochemically. We posit that this may involve a complex sensory pathway by which sessile mussels respond to environmental stresses to release and relocate.},

  abstract     = {Glutathione (GSH) has important roles as an antioxidant and in iron homeostasis and other cellular functions. It is transported into mitochondria by the transporter protein SLC25A39, and the abundance of SLC25A39 increases if concentrations of GSH in mitochondria are low, providing a feedback control to maintain GSH concentrations. Liu et al . report that the abundance of SLC25A39 is regulated by its association with a protease, AFG3L2. They propose that when mitochondrial GSH concentrations are low, binding of AFG3L2 to SLC25A3p (and thus its degradation) is prevented because an iron–sulfur cluster competitively binds to SLC25A30. Such a mechanism could help to coordinate iron homeostasis and maintenance of GSH concentrations in the mitochondria. —L. Bryan Ray Mitochondria must maintain adequate amounts of metabolites for protective and biosynthetic functions. However, how mitochondria sense the abundance of metabolites and regulate metabolic homeostasis is not well understood. In this work, we focused on glutathione (GSH), a critical redox metabolite in mitochondria, and identified a feedback mechanism that controls its abundance through the mitochondrial GSH transporter, SLC25A39. Under physiological conditions, SLC25A39 is rapidly degraded by mitochondrial protease AFG3L2. Depletion of GSH dissociates AFG3L2 from SLC25A39, causing a compensatory increase in mitochondrial GSH uptake. Genetic and proteomic analyses identified a putative iron-sulfur cluster in the matrix-facing loop of SLC25A39 as essential for this regulation, coupling mitochondrial iron homeostasis to GSH import. Altogether, our work revealed a paradigm for the autoregulatory control of metabolic homeostasis in organelles.},

  abstract     = {The conversion of methanol to acetic acid and related ester carbonylation reactions are cornerstones of modern industrial chemistry. Current practice relies on precious rhodium or iridium catalysts for the carbon monoxide insertion chemistry. Yoo et al . now report promising laboratory-scale results using more Earth-abundant nickel as the catalyst. Key to the robustness of the nickel under the reaction conditions is complexation with N-heterocycle carbene ligands in place of more conventional phosphines. —Jake S. Yeston Millions of tons of acetyl derivatives such as acetic acid and acetic anhydride are produced each year. These building blocks of chemical industry are elaborated into esters, amides, and eventually polymer materials, pharmaceuticals, and other consumer products. Most acetyls are produced industrially using homogeneous precious metal catalysts, principally rhodium and iridium complexes. We report here that abundant nickel can be paired with imidazole-derived carbenes or the corresponding salts to catalyze methyl ester carbonylation with turnover frequency (TOF) exceeding 150 hour –1 and turnover number (TON) exceeding 1600, benchmarks that invite comparisons to state-of-the-art rhodium-based systems and considerably surpass known triphenylphosphine-based nickel catalysts, which operate with TOF ~7 hour –1 and TON ~100 under the same conditions.},

  abstract     = {Although inverted perovskite solar cells minimize losses at hole-transport layers, recombination-induced losses occur at top electron-transport layers. Liu et al . used two different passivation molecules to tackle this problem. A sulfur-modified methylthio molecule provided chemical passivation, and a diammonium molecule repelled minority charge carriers and reduced contact-induced recombination. These cells had a certified quasi–steady-state power conversion efficiency and operated stably at 65°C for more than 2000 hours in ambient air. —Phil Szuromi Compared with the n-i-p structure, inverted (p-i-n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) promise increased operating stability, but these photovoltaic cells often exhibit lower power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) because of nonradiative recombination losses, particularly at the perovskite/C 60 interface. We passivated surface defects and enabled reflection of minority carriers from the interface into the bulk using two types of functional molecules. We used sulfur-modified methylthio molecules to passivate surface defects and suppress recombination through strong coordination and hydrogen bonding, along with diammonium molecules to repel minority carriers and reduce contact-induced interface recombination achieved through field-effect passivation. This approach led to a fivefold longer carrier lifetime and one-third the photoluminescence quantum yield loss and enabled a certified quasi-steady-state PCE of 25.1\% for inverted PSCs with stable operation at 65°C for &gt;2000 hours in ambient air. We also fabricated monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells with 28.1\% PCE.},

Although cooperation among individuals within groups is also common in other animals, doing so outside of such groups has rarely been observed. Samuni and Surbeck looked at cooperative behaviors such as grooming and food sharing in bonobos and found that individuals that cooperated more within their own group were also more likely to cooperate with those in other groups (see the Perspective by Silk). Furthermore, such cooperation was neither rare nor opportunistic. Social openness in one of our closest relatives suggests that our cooperativeness may be older than we thought. —Sacha Vignieri Cooperation beyond familial and group boundaries is core to the functioning of human societies, yet its evolution remains unclear. To address this, we examined grooming, coalition, and food-sharing patterns in bonobos ( Pan paniscus ), one of our closest living relatives whose rare out-group tolerance facilitates interaction opportunities between groups. We show that, as in humans, positive assortment supports bonobo cooperation across borders. Bonobo cooperative attitudes toward in-group members informed their cooperative relationships with out-groups, in particular, forming connections with out-group individuals who also exhibited high cooperation tendencies. Our findings show that cooperation between unrelated individuals across groups without immediate payoff is not exclusive to humans and suggest that such cooperation can emerge in the absence of social norms or strong cultural dispositions.},

Despite recent efforts, devices that are potentially commercially competitive have not been developed. We present an electrocaloric cooler with a maximum temperature span of 20.9 kelvin and a maximum cooling power of 4.2 watts under the moderate applied electric field of 10 volts per micrometer without any observed breakdown. Moreover, the maximum coefficient of performance, even taking into account energy expended on fluid pumping, reaches 64\% of Carnot’s efficiency as long as energy is properly recovered.

Methane emissions from solid waste sites provide a considerable fraction of the global methane budget and are an important target for reductions. Hoy et al . report that the global solid waste sector is not currently on track to meet Paris targets unless abrupt interventions are made (see the Perspective by Webber and Glazer). With appropriate action, however, a net-zero warming contribution from the solid waste sector relative to 2020 can be realized. —H. Jesse Smith No global analysis has considered the warming that could be averted through improved solid waste management and how much that could contribute to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5° and 2°C pathway goals or the terms of the Global Methane Pledge. With our estimated global solid waste generation of 2.56 to 3.33 billion tonnes by 2050, implementing abrupt technical and behavioral changes could result in a net-zero warming solid waste system relative to 2020, leading to 11 to 27 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide warming–equivalent emissions under the temperature limits. These changes, however, require accelerated adoption within 9 to 17 years (by 2033 to 2041) to align with the Global Methane Pledge. Rapidly reducing methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide emissions is necessary to maximize the short-term climate benefits and stop the ongoing temperature rise.},

  abstract     = {The concept of emergent symmetry applies to systems in which a more symmetric state emerges at low temperatures from an initial high-temperature state. Demonstrating this emergence in an experiment is very challenging. In search of experimental signatures, Chudzinski et al . studied the one-dimensional material, Li 0.9 Mo 6 O 17 , which lies close to the Mott transition but can also host superconductivity. The researchers measured a surprisingly isotropic magnetoresistance, indicating that rather than being a Mott insulator or a superconductor, the system has fallen into a state with higher, emergent symmetry. —Jelena Stajic Upon cooling, condensed-matter systems typically transition into states of lower symmetry. The converse—i.e., the emergence of higher symmetry at lower temperatures—is extremely rare. In this work, we show how an unusually isotropic magnetoresistance in the highly anisotropic, one-dimensional conductor Li 0.9 Mo 6 O 17 and its temperature dependence can be interpreted as a renormalization group (RG) flow toward a so-called separatrix. This approach is equivalent to an emergent symmetry in the system. The existence of two distinct ground states, Mott insulator and superconductor, can then be traced back to two opposing RG trajectories. By establishing a direct link between quantum field theory and an experimentally measurable quantity, we uncover a path through which emergent symmetry might be identified in other candidate materials.},

The production of low-volatility dimeric compounds through accretion reactions is a key aspect of SOA formation.

In this work, we elucidate the structures of several major dimer esters in SOA from ozonolysis of α-pinene and β-pinene—substantial global SOA sources—through independent synthesis of authentic standards. We show that these dimer esters are formed in the particle phase and propose a mechanism of nucleophilic addition of alcohols to a cyclic acylperoxyhemiacetal.

The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), a global convention addressing the control of tobacco and smokeless tobacco (including mixtures of betel nut and tobacco) (4), initiated measures to limit the use of tobacco in 2003 and smokeless tobacco in 2005. According to a July WHO report, the number of people who smoke tobacco is decreasing (5). However, the number of people who consume betel nut has increased over the past 2 decades (6). Heightened efforts are required to curb betel nut consumption.},

  abstract     = {Electrocaloric heat pumping is a caloric solid-state technology that, along with magnetocaloric and mechanocaloric counterparts, represents promising alternatives to the traditional, relatively inefficient, and environmentally harmful vapor-compression systems. Electrocaloric technologies are based on ferroelectric materials exposed to an electric field, which triggers changes in the material’s polarization, so that applying an electric field increases the material’s temperature, whereas its removal induces cooling. A thermodynamic cycle can be built around this effect, offering environmentally friendly and, theoretically, highly efficient cooling and heat-pump systems. However, prototypes of caloric devices have so far failed to achieve 40\% of maximum efficiency (Carnot efficiency) ( 1 ). On page 801 of this issue, Li et al. ( 2 ) demonstrate a regenerative electrocaloric device that could reach 67\% of Carnot efficiency, a maximum temperature span of &gt;20 K, and a maximum cooling power of ~4 W. This high efficiency is an important improvement because it finally confirms numerous theoretical studies that predict high efficiency of caloric technologies.},

CASTs can introduce large DNA cargoes for genome engineering in bacterial and human cells ( 1 – 5 ). Type V-K CASTs consist of the Cas effector Cas12k, the transposase TnsB, the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) TnsC, and the adaptor protein TniQ. These CASTs are particularly attractive genome engineering tools owing to their minimal size and number of subunits and their ability to integrate cargo DNA unidirectionally ( 2 ). However, a limitation of type V-K CASTs is their high propensity for genome-wide off-target integration ( 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 ). On page 784 of this issue, George et al . ( 8 ) report that off-target integration by type V-K CASTs occurs independently of Cas12k, revealing a mechanism of untargeted transposition. This untargeted transposition was dependent on TnsC concentration, which allowed the authors to engineer a CAST system with much improved specificity.},

Fast neurotransmitters induce ion currents in the postsynaptic neuron. By contrast, slow neurotransmitters and neuromodulators act on metabotropic G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the postsynaptic membrane to trigger intracellular second messenger cascades. Neuropeptides are a superfamily of neuromodulators—more than 100 have been identified . However, studying neuropeptides is challenging owing to the limitations of available tools for their detection. Furthermore, despite decades of drug development aimed at neuropeptide-GPCRs, neither their localization nor the dynamics of ligand-induced activation is sufficiently understood. On page 786 of this issue, Wang et al. ( 1 ) describe GPCR-activation–based sensors (GRABs) that can track neuropeptide action in vivo. Such GRABs have the potential to provide new information on physiological processes ( 2 ) and the role of GPCRs in brain diseases.},

However, most studies focus on the chemical binding mechanism of mussel byssus, an adhesive secreta, to surfaces ( 4 ), whereas the connections between living tissue and the byssus have rarely been explored. Although strong adherence of mussels on rocky reefs is necessary for survival, these sessile organisms can liberate themselves from anchored substrates to regain mobility when encountering predators or harsh environments ( 5 ). How do mussels ensure strong and compact connection to byssus yet quickly release it when needed? On page 829 of this issue, Sivasundarampillai et al. ( 6 ) reveal that the dynamic biointerface between mussel tissue and byssus plays an important role in Mytilus mussels. Their finding could be informative about how nonliving materials can be dynamically interfaced with living tissue, as in the case of detachable biosensors and medical implants.},

In particular, the authors determined that proteins called Aster-B and Aster-C are required for cholesterol to get from the exterior of intestinal cells to their endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes further processing. This pathway is targetable with a small-molecule inhibitor of Aster proteins, suggesting a potential pharmacological approach for lowering the intake of cholesterol. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Intestinal absorption is an important contributor to systemic cholesterol homeostasis. Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) assists in the initial step of dietary cholesterol uptake, but how cholesterol moves downstream of NPC1L1 is unknown. We show that Aster-B and Aster-C are critical for nonvesicular cholesterol movement in enterocytes. Loss of NPC1L1 diminishes accessible plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol and abolishes Aster recruitment to the intestinal brush border. Enterocytes lacking Asters accumulate PM cholesterol and show endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol depletion. Aster-deficient mice have impaired cholesterol absorption and are protected against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Finally, the Aster pathway can be targeted with a small-molecule inhibitor to manipulate cholesterol uptake. These findings identify the Aster pathway as a physiologically important and pharmacologically tractable node in dietary lipid absorption.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic prompted many groups to rethink how to perform and communicate science. Although their work has been freely available from the beginning, Boby et al . now formally report the results of the COVID Moonshot project, a fully open-science drug discovery campaign to identify, synthesize, and test inhibitors against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease, a key antiviral target (see the Perspective by Shoichet and Craik). Starting with data from a fragment-based screen, candidate inhibitor designs were crowdsourced from volunteer submitters using a variety of design approaches. An experienced team, aided by computational tools, evaluated proposals and designed synthetic routes. Noncovalent, nonpeptidomimetic inhibitors were identified and characterized functionally and structurally. Iterative medicinal chemistry and community input yielded a lead with promising bioavailability, safety, and antiviral activity. —Michael A. Funk We report the results of the COVID Moonshot, a fully open-science, crowdsourced, and structure-enabled drug discovery campaign targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease. We discovered a noncovalent, nonpeptidic inhibitor scaffold with lead-like properties that is differentiated from current main protease inhibitors. Our approach leveraged crowdsourcing, machine learning, exascale molecular simulations, and high-throughput structural biology and chemistry. We generated a detailed map of the structural plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, extensive structure-activity relationships for multiple chemotypes, and a wealth of biochemical activity data. All compound designs (&gt;18,000 designs), crystallographic data (&gt;490 ligand-bound x-ray structures), assay data (&gt;10,000 measurements), and synthesized molecules (&gt;2400 compounds) for this campaign were shared rapidly and openly, creating a rich, open, and intellectual property–free knowledge base for future anticoronavirus drug discovery.},

  abstract     = {Ultracompaction of sperm DNA in many species is often associated with genome-wide replacement of histones with protamines, but the actual role of this radical change in chromatin organization remains largely enigmatic. Looking at a multidecade-old Drosophila mutant, Dubruille et al . found that histones were massively retained in sperm without affecting its ability to fertilize (see the Perspective by Levine). However, at fertilization, male chromosomes were aberrantly recognized by maternal factors that control female meiotic progression, leading to a deleterious premature division and early loss of male chromosomes. This work highlights the role of sperm chromatin in protecting male chromosomes in the egg. —Di Jiang The global replacement of histones with protamines in sperm chromatin is widespread in animals, including insects, but its actual function remains enigmatic. We show that in the Drosophila paternal effect mutant paternal loss ( pal ), sperm chromatin retains germline histones H3 and H4 genome wide without impairing sperm viability. However, after fertilization, pal sperm chromosomes are targeted by the egg chromosomal passenger complex and engage into a catastrophic premature division in synchrony with female meiosis II. We show that pal encodes a rapidly evolving transition protein specifically required for the eviction of (H3-H4) 2 tetramers from spermatid DNA after the removal of H2A-H2B dimers. Our study thus reveals an unsuspected role of histone eviction from insect sperm chromatin: safeguarding the integrity of the male pronucleus during female meiosis.},

In growing pollen tubes, the proteins RALF4 and LRX8 are required to monitor integrity of the cell wall. Moussu et al . demonstrated that these proteins form a complex with pectic polysaccharides, the gel-like component of the cell wall (see the Perspective by Mohnen). In addition to the roles of RALF4 and LRX8 in signaling to the intracellular environment, the protein-polysaccharide complex performs a structural role in patterning the cell wall. This work contributes to our understanding of how signaling proteins can react to changes in the physical state of the extracellular structure. —Madeleine Seale Assembly of cell wall polysaccharides into specific patterns is required for plant growth. A complex of RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR 4 (RALF4) and its cell wall–anchored LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT EXTENSIN 8 (LRX8)–interacting protein is crucial for cell wall integrity during pollen tube growth, but its molecular connection with the cell wall is unknown. Here, we show that LRX8-RALF4 complexes adopt a heterotetrametric configuration in vivo, displaying a dendritic distribution. The LRX8-RALF4 complex specifically interacts with demethylesterified pectins in a charge-dependent manner through RALF4’s polycationic surface. The LRX8-RALF4-pectin interaction exerts a condensing effect, patterning the cell wall’s polymers into a reticulated network essential for wall integrity and expansion. Our work uncovers a dual structural and signaling role for RALF4 in pollen tube growth and in the assembly of complex extracellular polymers.},

Combing a III-V gain medium with a lithium-niobate phase modulator, they demonstrated the operation of a mode-locked laser with good performance metrics.

In this work, we demonstrate an electrically pumped actively MLL in nanophotonic lithium niobate based on its hybrid integration with a III-V semiconductor optical amplifier. Our MLL generates ∼ 4.8-ps optical pulses around 1065 nm at a repetition rate of ∼10 GHz, with energies exceeding 2.6 pJ and peak powers beyond 0.5 W. The repetition rate and the carrier-envelope offset frequency of the output can be controlled in a wide range by using the driving frequency and the pump current, providing a route for fully stabilized on-chip frequency combs.},

The number of homes destroyed by wildfires has doubled over the past 30 years, and most of them were in grasslands and shrublands, not near forests. —H. Jesse Smith Wildfire risks to homes are increasing, especially in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where wildland vegetation and houses are in close proximity. Notably, we found that more houses are exposed to and destroyed by grassland and shrubland fires than by forest fires in the United States. Destruction was more likely in forest fires, but they burned less WUI. The number of houses within wildfire perimeters has doubled since the 1990s because of both housing growth (47\% of additionally exposed houses) and more burned area (53\%). Most exposed houses were in the WUI, which grew substantially during the 2010s (2.6 million new WUI houses), albeit not as rapidly as before. Any WUI growth increases wildfire risk to houses though, and more fires increase the risk to existing WUI houses.},

Luo et al . have shown that chiral phonons driven by ultrafast pulses of circularly polarized terahertz radiation can induce magnetic fields on the order of one tesla in the rare earth trihalide cerium fluoride (see the Perspective by Kaindl). Such control of spin-phonon coupling provides a route to on-demand ultrafast, large magnetic fields on an atomic scale that would be useful for both fundamental materials science and the development of energy-efficient spintronic devices. —Ian S. Osborne Time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is pivotal for materials’ optical, magnetic, topological, and transport properties. Chiral phonons, characterized by atoms rotating unidirectionally around their equilibrium positions, generate dynamic lattice structures that break TRS. Here, we report that coherent chiral phonons, driven by circularly polarized terahertz light pulses, polarize the paramagnetic spins in cerium fluoride in a manner similar to that of a quasi-static magnetic field on the order of 1 tesla. Through time-resolved Faraday rotation and Kerr ellipticity, we found that the transient magnetization is only excited by pulses resonant with phonons, proportional to the angular momentum of the phonons, and growing with magnetic susceptibility at cryogenic temperatures. The observation quantitatively agrees with our spin-phonon coupling model and may enable new routes to investigating ultrafast magnetism, energy-efficient spintronics, and nonequilibrium phases of matter with broken TRS.},

  abstract     = {Passive radiative cooling materials emit heat through the atmospheric window and into outer space, providing an attractive way to reduce temperatures in buildings. Zhao et al . created a passive cooling glass and Lin et al . developed a passive cooling ceramic, both of which are mechanically strong and relatively easy to scale (see the Perspective by Zhao and Tang). Unlike strategies that rely on polymers, these hard materials should be more robust to long-term weathering, which may make them far more useful for outdoor applications. —Brent Grocholski Passive daytime radiative cooling materials could reduce the energy needed for building cooling up to 60\% by reflecting sunlight and emitting long-wave infrared (LWIR) radiation into the cold Universe (~3 kelvin). However, developing passive cooling structures that are both practical to manufacture and apply while also displaying long-term environmental stability is challenging. We developed a randomized photonic composite consisting of a microporous glass framework that features selective LWIR emission along with relatively high solar reflectance and aluminum oxide particles that strongly scatter sunlight and prevent densification of the porous structure during manufacturing. This microporous glass coating enables a temperature drop of ~3.5° and 4°C even under high-humidity conditions (up to 80\%) during midday and nighttime, respectively. This radiative “cooling glass” coating maintains high solar reflectance even when exposed to harsh conditions, including water, ultraviolet radiation, soiling, and high temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Herbivory is a major selection pressure on plants, which have evolved many different physical and chemical adaptations to prevent animals from eating their tissues. However, herbivory pressure can be highly variable, even between plants in the same population. The Herbivory Variability Network consortium used standardized surveys to compare herbivory variability within populations at 790 sites across five continents. They found that the weak increase in mean herbivory at lower latitudes was accompanied by lower variation between individuals. Smaller plant species had higher herbivory variability, which also showed a phylogenetic signal. These findings highlight how variation in species interactions can influence eco-evolutionary outcomes. —Bianca Lopez Interactions between plants and herbivores are central in most ecosystems, but their strength is highly variable. The amount of variability within a system is thought to influence most aspects of plant-herbivore biology, from ecological stability to plant defense evolution. Our understanding of what influences variability, however, is limited by sparse data. We collected standardized surveys of herbivory for 503 plant species at 790 sites across 116° of latitude. With these data, we show that within-population variability in herbivory increases with latitude, decreases with plant size, and is phylogenetically structured. Differences in the magnitude of variability are thus central to how plant-herbivore biology varies across macroscale gradients. We argue that increased focus on interaction variability will advance understanding of patterns of life on Earth.},

  abstract     = {Real communities are characterized by complex interaction networks among species. The interaction is described as “nested” if there are specialist species interacting with subsets of species and “modular” if species interact within a group but not between different groups. A mixed pattern is known as a “multiscale” network. Borin et al . examined if and how a multiscale interaction network can develop through rapid evolution in a simple community with one type of bacteria and one type of phage. The authors were able to recapitulate the range of host interactions using receptor knock-out experiments. This means that phage-host interactions in a laboratory setting are sufficient to form complex ecological patterns and could be a valuable model system for informing phage therapy. —Caroline Ash Interactions between species catalyze the evolution of multiscale ecological networks, including both nested and modular elements that regulate the function of diverse communities. One common assumption is that such complex pattern formation requires spatial isolation or long evolutionary timescales. We show that multiscale network structure can evolve rapidly under simple ecological conditions without spatial structure. In just 21 days of laboratory coevolution, Escherichia coli and bacteriophage Φ21 coevolve and diversify to form elaborate cross-infection networks. By measuring ~10,000 phage-bacteria infections and testing the genetic basis of interactions, we identify the mechanisms that create each component of the multiscale pattern. Our results demonstrate how multiscale networks evolve in parasite-host systems, illustrating Darwin’s idea that simple adaptive processes can generate entangled banks of ecological interactions.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, there has been rapid progress in the development of large-scale machine learning (ML) systems that provide predictions related to various scientific phenomena. Unfortunately, the standard statistical approaches used to calculate confidence intervals and P values from gold standard data lose their statistical validity for ML-derived data. Angelopoulos et al . introduced “prediction-powered inference,” a standardized protocol for constructing valid confidence intervals and P values that enables the power and scale of ML systems to be used as predictors while ensuring responsible and reliable scientific inferences. The method has been demonstrated on a broad range of real datasets and offers a promising statistical approach for using ML to derive scientific conclusions responsibly. —Yury Suleymanov Prediction-powered inference is a framework for performing valid statistical inference when an experimental dataset is supplemented with predictions from a machine-learning system. The framework yields simple algorithms for computing provably valid confidence intervals for quantities such as means, quantiles, and linear and logistic regression coefficients without making any assumptions about the machine-learning algorithm that supplies the predictions. Furthermore, more accurate predictions translate to smaller confidence intervals. Prediction-powered inference could enable researchers to draw valid and more data-efficient conclusions using machine learning. The benefits of prediction-powered inference were demonstrated with datasets from proteomics, astronomy, genomics, remote sensing, census analysis, and ecology.},

Researchers have used diatomic molecules for this purpose. Polyatomic molecules have even more favorable properties but are more difficult to control. Anderegg et al . demonstrate coherent control of individual quantum states in the polyatomic molecule calcium monohydroxide. Their findings enable the measurement of eEDM in this and related systems, which is expected to lead to improved precision. —Jelena Stajic Ultracold polyatomic molecules are promising candidates for experiments in quantum science and precision searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. A key requirement is the ability to achieve full quantum control over the internal structure of the molecules. In this work, we established coherent control of individual quantum states in calcium monohydroxide (CaOH) and demonstrated a method for searching for the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). Optically trapped, ultracold CaOH molecules were prepared in a single quantum state, polarized in an electric field, and coherently transferred into an eEDM-sensitive state where an electron spin precession measurement was performed. To extend the coherence time, we used eEDM-sensitive states with tunable, near-zero magnetic field sensitivity. Our results establish a path for eEDM searches with trapped polyatomic molecules.},

Because little is known about these programs, we investigated them using a resource of gene expression profiles in males and females throughout the development of five organs in five mammals (human, mouse, rat, rabbit, and opossum) and a bird (chicken). We found that sex-biased gene expression varied considerably across organs and species and was often cell-type specific. Sex differences increased abruptly around sexual maturity instead of increasing gradually during organ development. Finally, sex-biased gene expression evolved rapidly at the gene level, with differences between organs in the evolutionary mechanisms used, but more slowly at the cellular level, with the same cell types being sexually dimorphic across species.},

In this work, we show how formaldehyde (FA), a one-carbon unit derived from both endogenous sources and environmental exposure, regulates one-carbon metabolism by inhibiting the biosynthesis of S -adenosylmethionine (SAM), the major methyl donor in cells. FA reacts with privileged, hyperreactive cysteine sites in the proteome, including Cys120 in S-adenosylmethionine synthase isoform type-1 (MAT1A). FA exposure inhibited MAT1A activity and decreased SAM production with MAT-isoform specificity. A genetic mouse model of chronic FA overload showed a decrease n SAM and in methylation on selected histones and genes. Epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of Mat1a and related genes function as compensatory mechanisms for FA-dependent SAM depletion, revealing a biochemical feedback cycle between FA and SAM one-carbon units.},

In this study, we identified −KTS, a major, alternatively spliced isoform of the Wilms tumor suppressor WT1, as a key determinant of female sex determination. Loss of − KTS variants blocked gonadal differentiation in mice, whereas increased expression, as found in Frasier syndrome, induced precocious differentiation of ovaries independently of their genetic sex. In XY embryos, this antagonized Sry expression, resulting in male-to-female sex reversal. Our results identify −KTS as an ovarian-determining factor and demonstrate that its time of activation is critical in gonadal sex differentiation.},

However, in May 2022, human cases of mpox were detected spreading internationally beyond countries with known endemic reservoirs. When the first cases from 2022 were sequenced, they shared 42 nucleotide differences from the closest mpox virus (MPXV) previously sampled. Nearly all these mutations are characteristic of the action of APOBEC3 deaminases, host enzymes with antiviral function. Assuming APOBEC3 editing is characteristic of human MPXV infection, we developed a dual-process phylogenetic molecular clock that—inferring a rate of ~6 APOBEC3 mutations per year—estimates that MPXV has been circulating in humans since 2016. These observations of sustained MPXV transmission present a fundamental shift to the perceived paradigm of MPXV epidemiology as a zoonosis and highlight the need for revising public health messaging around MPXV as well as outbreak management and control.},

By synthesizing terrestrial and aquatic studies globally (2594 experimental tests from 610 articles), we reveal substantial herbivore control of vegetation under restoration. Herbivores at restoration sites reduced vegetation abundance more strongly (by 89\%, on average) than those at relatively undegraded sites and suppressed, rather than fostered, plant diversity. These effects were particularly pronounced in regions with higher temperatures and lower precipitation. Excluding targeted herbivores temporarily or introducing their predators improved restoration by magnitudes similar to or greater than those achieved by managing plant competition or facilitation. Thus, managing herbivory is a promising strategy for enhancing vegetation restoration efforts.},

In this work, we demonstrate an electronically gated solid-state thermal switch using self-assembled molecular junctions to achieve excellent performance at room temperature. In this three-terminal device, heat flow is continuously and reversibly modulated by an electric field through carefully controlled chemical bonding and charge distributions within the molecular interface. The devices have ultrahigh switching speeds above 1 megahertz, have on/off ratios in thermal conductance greater than 1300\%, and can be switched more than 1 million times. We anticipate that these advances will generate opportunities in molecular engineering for thermal management systems and thermal circuit design.},

Using an ensemble of observations, we quantified global land water availability over the past two decades. We show that the Southern Hemisphere has dominated the declining trend in global water availability from 2001 to 2020. The significant decrease occurs mainly in South America, southwestern Africa, and northwestern Australia. In the Northern Hemisphere, the complex regional increasing and decreasing trends cancel each other, resulting in a negligible hemispheric trend. The variability and trend in water availability in the Southern Hemisphere are largely driven by precipitation associated with climate modes, particularly the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. This study highlights their dominant role in controlling global water availability.},

We show that the superionic conduction in a trigonal halide, such as Li 3 MCl 6 [where metal (M) is Y or Er], is governed by the in-plane lithium percolation paths and stacking interlayer distance. These two factors are inversely correlated with each other by the partial occupancy of M, serving as both a diffusion inhibitor and pillar for maintaining interlayer distance. These findings suggest that a critical range or ordering of M exists in trigonal halides, and we showcase the achievement of high ionic conductivity by adjusting the simple M ratio (per Cl or Li).

  abstract     = {The hippocampus is critical for recollecting and imagining experiences. This is believed to involve voluntarily drawing from hippocampal memory representations of people, events, and places, including maplike representations of familiar environments. However, whether representations in such “cognitive maps” can be volitionally accessed is unknown. We developed a brain–machine interface to test whether rats can do so by controlling their hippocampal activity in a flexible, goal-directed, and model-based manner. We found that rats can efficiently navigate or direct objects to arbitrary goal locations within a virtual reality arena solely by activating and sustaining appropriate hippocampal representations of remote places. This provides insight into the mechanisms underlying episodic memory recall, mental simulation and planning, and imagination and opens up possibilities for high-level neural prosthetics that use hippocampal representations.},

Thus, a mechanism of gating transmission for multiple biosignals in such devices is needed to match and modulate complex aqueous-phase biological systems. Here we report the use of cascade-heterogated biphasic gel iontronics to achieve diverse electronic-to-multi-ionic signal transmission. The cascade-heterogated property determined the transfer free energy barriers experienced by ions and ionic hydration-dehydration states under an electric potential field, fundamentally enhancing the distinction of cross-interface transmission between different ions by several orders of magnitude. Such heterogated or chemical-heterogated iontronics with programmable features can be coupled with multi-ion cross-interface mobilities for hierarchical and selective cross-stage signal transmission. We expect that such iontronics would be ideal candidates for a variety of biotechnology applications.},

The accretion process in about the central 10 parsecs has not been directly resolved in previous observations because of the small apparent angular sizes involved. We observed the active nucleus of the Circinus Galaxy using submillimeter interferometry. A dense inflow of molecular gas was evident on subparsec scales. We calculated that less than 3\% of this inflow is accreted by the black hole, with the rest being ejected by multiphase outflows, providing feedback to the host galaxy. Our observations also reveal a dense gas disk surrounding the inflow that is gravitationally unstable, which drives the accretion into about the central 1 parsec.},

Although synthetic chemists have long sought to mimic this reactivity, the enzyme-like activation of O 2 to form high-spin iron(IV) = O species remains an unrealized goal. Here, we report a metal–organic framework featuring iron(II) sites with a local structure similar to that in α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. The framework reacts with O 2 at low temperatures to form high-spin iron(IV) = O species that are characterized using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform, in situ and variable-field Mössbauer, Fe Kβ x-ray emission, and nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopies. In the presence of O 2 , the framework is competent for catalytic oxygenation of cyclohexane and the stoichiometric conversion of ethane to ethanol.},

The scaling exponent is predicted to be quantized when tunneling into a single isolated chiral edge state of the fractional quantum Hall effect. We report conductance measurements across a point contact linking integer and fractional quantum Hall edge states (at fillings 1 and 1 3 , respectively). At weak coupling, we observe the predicted universal quadratic scaling with temperature and voltage. At strong coupling, we demonstrate perfect Andreev reflection of fractionalized quasiparticles at the point contact. We use the strong coupling physics to realize a nearly dissipationless direct current voltage step-up transformer, whose gain arises directly from topological fractionalization of electrical charge.},

However, we report that, in mice, CD8 T cell tolerance instead results from premature thymic eviction of immature autoreactive CD8 thymocytes into the periphery, where they differentiate into self-tolerant mature CD8 T cells. Premature thymic eviction is triggered by T cell receptor (TCR)–driven down-regulation of the transcriptional repressor Gfi1, which induces expression of sphingosine-1–phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1) on negatively selected immature CD8 thymocytes. Thus, premature thymic eviction is the basis for CD8 T cell tolerance and is the mechanism responsible for the appearance in the periphery of mature CD8 T cells bearing autoreactive TCRs that are absent from the thymus.},

Post-reproductive representation was 0.195, indicating that a female who reached adulthood could expect to live about one-fifth of her adult life in a post-reproductive state, around half as long as human hunter-gatherers. Post-reproductive females exhibited hormonal signatures of menopause, including sharply increasing gonadotropins after age 50. We discuss whether post-reproductive life spans in wild chimpanzees occur only rarely, as a short-term response to favorable ecological conditions, or instead are an evolved species-typical trait as well as the implications of these alternatives for our understanding of the evolution of post-reproductive life spans.},

How this diffusion barrier is structured has been partially defined, but its lignin polymerization and assembly steps remain elusive. Here, we characterize a family of dirigent proteins (DPs) essential for both the localized polymerization of lignin required for Casparian strip biogenesis in the cell wall and for attachment of the strip to the plasma membrane to seal the apoplast. We reveal a Casparian strip lignification mechanism that requires cooperation between DPs and the Schengen pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DPs directly mediate lignin polymerization as part of this mechanism.},

We report a photochemically driven deracemization protocol in which a single chiral catalyst effects two mechanistically different steps, C–C bond cleavage and C–C bond formation, to achieve multiplicative enhancement of stereoinduction, which leads to high levels of stereoselectivity. Ligand-to-metal charge transfer excitation of a titanium catalyst coordinated by a chiral phosphoric acid or bisoxazoline efficiently enriches racemic alcohols that feature adjacent and fully substituted stereogenic centers to enantiomeric ratios up to 99:1. Mechanistic investigations support a pathway of sequential radical-mediated bond scission and bond formation through a common prochiral intermediate and reveal that, although the overall stereoenrichment is high, the selectivity in each individual step is moderate.},

In this work, we report a CRISPR knockout screen of the entire repertoire of transcription factors (TFs) in adult human SI organoids to identify dominant TFs controlling EEC differentiation. We discovered ZNF800 as a master repressor for endocrine lineage commitment, which particularly restricts enterochromaffin cell differentiation by directly controlling an endocrine TF network centered on PAX4.

More than 60 years ago, Lifshitz discussed a counterintuitive possibility: lattice softening driven by conduction electrons at topological Fermi surface transitions. The effect that he predicted, however, was small and has not been convincingly observed. Using a piezo-based uniaxial pressure cell to tune the ultraclean metal strontium ruthenate while measuring the stress-strain relationship, we reveal a huge softening of the Young’s modulus at a Lifshitz transition of a two-dimensional Fermi surface and show that it is indeed driven entirely by the conduction electrons of the relevant energy band.},

In this study, we report the measurement of universal dynamics triggered by a quench from the superfluid to normal phase across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in a two-dimensional (2D) Bose gas. We reduced the density by splitting the 2D gas in two, realizing a quench across the critical point. The subsequent relaxation dynamics were probed with matter-wave interferometry to measure the local phase fluctuations. We show that the time evolution of both the phase correlation function and vortex density obeys universal scaling laws. This conclusion is supported by classical-field simulations and interpreted by means of real-time renormalization group theory.},

We directly imaged polaron transport in Re 6 Se 8 Cl 2 at room temperature, revealing quasi-ballistic, wavelike propagation sustained for a nanosecond and several micrometers. Shielded polaron transport leads to electronic energy propagation lengths orders of magnitude greater than in other vdW semiconductors, exceeding even silicon over a nanosecond. We propose that, counterintuitively, quasi-flat electronic bands and strong exciton–acoustic phonon coupling are together responsible for the transport properties of Re 6 Se 8 Cl 2 , establishing a path to ballistic room-temperature semiconductors.},

Our device produces a low-noise, nearly flat broadband comb (reaching 100 per centimeter bandwidth) and offers a promising platform to generate broadband, tunable, and stable frequency combs.},

In this work, we used superconducting diamagnetism to shape the magnetic environment governing the transport of spin waves—collective spin excitations in magnets that are promising on-chip signal carriers—in a thin-film magnet. Using diamond-based magnetic imaging, we observed hybridized spin-wave–Meissner-current transport modes with strongly altered, temperature-tunable wavelengths and then demonstrated local control of spin-wave refraction using a focused laser. Our results demonstrate the versatility of superconductor-manipulated spin-wave transport and have potential applications in spin-wave gratings, filters, crystals, and cavities.},

However, this template-directed phosphoryl transfer activity remains orders of magnitude slower than native phosphodiester synthesis. Here, we used time-resolved x-ray crystallography to show that NP-DNA synthesis proceeds with a single detectable calcium ion in the active site. Using insights from isotopic and elemental effects, we propose that one-metal-ion electrophilic substrate activation is inferior to the native two-metal-ion mechanism. We found that this deficiency in divalent activation could be ameliorated by trivalent rare earth and post–transition metal cations, substantially enhancing NP-DNA synthesis. Scandium(III), in particular, confers highly specific NP activity with kinetics enhanced by more than 100-fold over calcium(II), yielding NP-DNA strands up to 100 nucleotides in length.},

  abstract     = {Faces and voices are the dominant social signals used to recognize individuals among primates. Yet, it is not known how these signals are integrated into a cross-modal representation of individual identity in the primate brain. We discovered that, although single neurons in the marmoset hippocampus exhibited selective responses when presented with the face or voice of a specific individual, a parallel mechanism for representing the cross-modal identities for multiple individuals was evident within single neurons and at the population level. Manifold projections likewise showed the separability of individuals as well as clustering for others’ families, which suggests that multiple learned social categories are encoded as related dimensions of identity in the hippocampus. Neural representations of identity in the hippocampus are thus both modality independent and reflect the primate social network.},

  abstract     = {Neural substrates of wakefulness, rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), and non-REMS (NREMS) in the mammalian hypothalamus overlap both anatomically and functionally with cellular networks that support physiological and behavioral homeostasis. Here, we review the roles of sleep neurons of the hypothalamus in the homeostatic control of thermoregulation or goal-oriented behaviors during wakefulness. We address how hypothalamic circuits involved in opposing behaviors such as core body temperature and sleep compute conflicting information and provide a coherent vigilance state. Finally, we highlight some of the key unresolved questions and challenges, and the promise of a more granular view of the cellular and molecular diversity underlying the integrative role of the hypothalamus in physiological and behavioral homeostasis.},

  abstract     = {Sexual, parental, and aggressive behaviors are central to the reproductive success of individuals and species survival and thus are supported by hardwired neural circuits. The reproductive behavior control column (RBCC), which comprises the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl), and the ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv), is essential for all social behaviors. The RBCC integrates diverse hormonal and metabolic cues and adjusts an animal’s physical activity, hence the chance of social encounters. The RBCC further engages the mesolimbic dopamine system to maintain social interest and reinforces cues and actions that are time-locked with social behaviors. We propose that the RBCC and brainstem form a dual-control system for generating moment-to-moment social actions. This Review summarizes recent progress regarding the identities of RBCC cells and their pathways that drive different aspects of social behaviors.},

Although the precise behavioral repertoires required for distinct motivated behaviors are diverse, common features such as approach or avoidance suggest that common brain substrates are required for a wide range of motivated behaviors. In this Review, I describe a framework by which neural circuits specified for some innate drives regulate the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons to reinforce ongoing or planned actions to fulfill motivational demands. This framework may explain why signaling from VTA dopamine neurons is ubiquitously involved in many types of diverse volitional motivated actions, as well as how sensory and interoceptive cues can initiate specific goal-directed actions.},

Sitting at the interface between peripheral, environmental, and neural inputs, the hypothalamus integrates these sensory inputs to influence a range of physiologies and behaviors. Unlike the neocortex, in which a stereotyped cytoarchitecture mediates complex functions across a comparatively small number of neuronal fates, the hypothalamus comprises upwards of thousands of distinct cell types that form redundant yet functionally discrete circuits. With single-cell RNA sequencing studies revealing further cellular heterogeneity and modern photonic tools enabling high-resolution dissection of complex circuitry, a new era of hypothalamic mapping has begun. Here, we provide a general overview of mammalian hypothalamic organization, development, and connectivity to help welcome newcomers into this exciting field.},

Those memories can be further used to generate internal models of the world that enable predictions to be made. The mechanisms that support these associative and predictive aspects of memory are not yet understood. In this study, we used an optogenetic manipulation to perturb the sequential structure, but not global network dynamics, of place cells as rats traversed specific spatial trajectories. This perturbation abolished replay of those trajectories and the development of predictive representations, leading to impaired learning of new optimal trajectories during memory-guided navigation. However, place cell assembly reactivation and reward-context associative learning were unaffected. Our results show a mechanistic dissociation between two complementary hippocampal codes: an associative code (through coactivity) and a predictive code (through sequences).},

Balloon-borne observations near Réunion Island revealed the unprecedented amount of water vapor injected by the volcano. The enhanced stratospheric humidity, radiative cooling, and expanded aerosol surface area in the volcanic plume created the ideal conditions for swift ozone depletion of 5\% in the tropical stratosphere in just 1 week. The decrease in hydrogen chloride by 0.4 parts per million by volume (ppbv) and the increase in chlorine monoxide by 0.4 ppbv provided compelling evidence for chlorine activation within the volcanic plume. This study enhances our understanding of the effect of this unusual volcanic eruption on stratospheric chemistry and provides insights into possible chemistry changes that may occur in a changing climate.},

Lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs) harness receptors, such as the cation-independent mannose 6–phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR), to direct extracellular proteins to lysosomes. In this work, we used a genome-wide CRISPR knockout approach to identify modulators of LYTAC-mediated membrane protein degradation in human cells. We found that disrupting retromer genes improved target degradation by reducing LYTAC recycling to the plasma membrane. Neddylated cullin-3 facilitated LYTAC-complex lysosomal maturation and was a predictive marker for LYTAC efficacy. A substantial fraction of cell surface CI-M6PR remains occupied by endogenous M6P-modified glycoproteins. Thus, inhibition of M6P biosynthesis increased the internalization of LYTAC-target complexes. Our findings inform design strategies for next-generation LYTACs and elucidate aspects of cell surface receptor occupancy and trafficking.},

On the ResNet50 benchmark image classification network, relative to a graphics processing unit (GPU) that uses a comparable 12-nanometer technology process, NorthPole achieves a 25 times higher energy metric of frames per second (FPS) per watt, a 5 times higher space metric of FPS per transistor, and a 22 times lower time metric of latency.

A potentially general, though challenging, approach toward their selective creation would be asymmetric unimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S N 1) reactions that proceed through highly reactive benzylic cations. We now report a broadly applicable solution to this problem by identifying chiral counteranions that pair with secondary benzylic cations to engage in catalytic asymmetric C−C, C−O, and C−N bond-forming reactions with excellent enantioselectivity. The critical cationic intermediate can be accessed from different precursors via Lewis- or Brønsted acid catalysis. Key to our strategy is the use of only weakly basic, confined counteranions that are posited to prolong the lifetime of the carbocation, thereby avoiding nonproductive deprotonation pathways to the corresponding styrene.},

In this study, we used natural and engineered cis-regulatory alleles in a plant stem-cell circuit to systematically evaluate epistatic relationships controlling tomato fruit size. Combining a promoter allelic series with two other loci, we collected over 30,000 phenotypic data points from 46 genotypes to quantify how allele strength transforms epistasis. We revealed a saturating dose-dependent relationship but also allele-specific idiosyncratic interactions, including between alleles driving a step change in fruit size during domestication. Our approach and findings expose an underexplored dimension of epistasis, in which cis-regulatory allelic diversity within gene regulatory networks elicits nonlinear, unpredictable interactions that shape phenotypes.},

The multiblock polymers exhibit broad mechanical properties, spanning elastomers to plastomers to thermoplastics, while integrating a high melting transition temperature ( T m ) and low glass transition temperature ( T g ), making them suitable for use across diverse applications ( T m as high as 128°C and T g as low as –60°C). After use, the different plastics can be combined and efficiently deconstructed back to the fundamental hard and soft building blocks for separation and repolymerization to realize a closed-loop recycling process.},

However, the ultrashort time and length scales associated with the behavior of these highly out-of-equilibrium carriers have impaired experimental verification of ab initio quantum theories. Here, we present an approach to studying plasmonic hot-carrier dynamics that analyzes the temporal waveform of coherent terahertz bursts radiated by photo-ejected hot carriers from designer nano-antennas with a broken symmetry. For ballistic carriers ejected from gold antennas, we find an ~11-femtosecond timescale composed of the plasmon lifetime and ballistic transport time. Polarization- and phase-sensitive detection of terahertz fields further grant direct access to their ballistic transport trajectory. Our approach opens explorations of ultrafast carrier dynamics in optically excited nanostructures.},

We found that in forests, extreme heat increased nest success, but birds nesting in agricultural settings were much less likely to successfully fledge young when temperatures reached anomalously high levels. Species that build exposed cup nests and species of higher conservation concern were particularly vulnerable to maximum temperature anomalies in agricultural settings.

Correspondingly, the Bayes factors in favor of multiple introductions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the human population relative to a single introduction were overestimated. The text now represents the corrected Bayes factors and topology frequency (Fig. 2C), which still favors the multiple introduction scenario. Bayes factor significance cutoffs from Kass and Raftery (1995) are now used throughout the text, including Table 1, where the probability of inferred ancestral haplotypes is reported. These cutoffs highlight the disagreement between the rooting inferred when using only human viruses (lineage B rooting) by comparison with incorporating the bat viruses through the recombinant common ancestor (lineage A rooting). This analysis independently supports the conclusion that lineages A and B were most likely the result of at least two cross-species transmissions of SARS-CoV-2.},

Thalamic neurons are organized into spatially distinct nuclei, but the molecular architecture of thalamic development is poorly understood, especially in humans. To begin to delineate the molecular trajectories of cell fate specification and organization in the developing human thalamus, we used single-cell and multiplexed spatial transcriptomics. We show that molecularly defined thalamic neurons differentiate in the second trimester of human development and that these neurons organize into spatially and molecularly distinct nuclei. We identified major subtypes of glutamatergic neuron subtypes that are differentially enriched in anatomically distinct nuclei and six subtypes of γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) neurons that are shared and distinct across thalamic nuclei.},

However, the regulatory programs governing cell identity and function remain unclear. Using a single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq), we explored open chromatin landscapes across 1.1 million cells in 42 brain regions from three adults. Integrating this data unveiled 107 distinct cell types and their specific utilization of 544,735 candidate cis-regulatory DNA elements (cCREs) in the human genome. Nearly a third of the cCREs demonstrated conservation and chromatin accessibility in the mouse brain cells. We reveal strong links between specific brain cell types and neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and major depression, and have developed deep learning models to predict the regulatory roles of noncoding risk variants in these disorders.},

We used single cell transcriptomics and performed cellular characterization of the human cortex to better understand cortical areal specialization. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of 8 areas spanning cortical structural variation showed a highly consistent cellular makeup for 24 cell subclasses. However, proportions of excitatory neuron subclasses varied substantially, likely reflecting differences in connectivity across primary sensorimotor and association cortices. Laminar organization of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes also differed across areas. Primary visual cortex showed characteristic organization with major changes in the excitatory to inhibitory neuron ratio, expansion of layer 4 excitatory neurons, and specialized inhibitory neurons. These results lay the groundwork for a refined cellular and molecular characterization of human cortical cytoarchitecture and areal specialization.},

  abstract     = {Human cortex transcriptomic studies have revealed a hierarchical organization of γ-aminobutyric acid–producing (GABAergic) neurons from subclasses to a high diversity of more granular types. Rapid GABAergic neuron viral genetic labeling plus Patch-seq (patch-clamp electrophysiology plus single-cell RNA sequencing) sampling in human brain slices was used to reliably target and analyze GABAergic neuron subclasses and individual transcriptomic types. This characterization elucidated transitions between PVALB and SST subclasses, revealed morphological heterogeneity within an abundant transcriptomic type, identified multiple spatially distinct types of the primate-specialized double bouquet cells (DBCs), and shed light on cellular differences between homologous mouse and human neocortical GABAergic neuron types. These results highlight the importance of multimodal phenotypic characterization for refinement of emerging transcriptomic cell type taxonomies and for understanding conserved and specialized cellular properties of human brain cell types.},

  abstract     = {Delineating the gene-regulatory programs underlying complex cell types is fundamental for understanding brain function in health and disease. Here, we comprehensively examined human brain cell epigenomes by probing DNA methylation and chromatin conformation at single-cell resolution in 517 thousand cells (399 thousand neurons and 118 thousand non-neurons) from 46 regions of three adult male brains. We identified 188 cell types and characterized their molecular signatures. Integrative analyses revealed concordant changes in DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, chromatin organization, and gene expression across cell types, cortical areas, and basal ganglia structures. We further developed single-cell methylation barcodes that reliably predict brain cell types using the methylation status of select genomic sites. This multimodal epigenomic brain cell atlas provides new insights into the complexity of cell-type–specific gene regulation in adult human brains.},

However, our understanding of these processes in primates, including both conserved and species-specific features, remains limited. Here, we profiled 761,529 single-cell transcriptomes from multiple regions of the prenatal macaque telencephalon. We deciphered the molecular programs of the early organizing centers and their cross-talk with NSCs, revealing primate-biased galanin-like peptide ( GALP ) signaling in the anteroventral telencephalon. Regional transcriptomic variations were observed along the frontotemporal axis during early stages of neocortical NSC progression and in neurons and astrocytes. Additionally, we found that genes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and brain cancer risk might play critical roles in the early telencephalic organizers and during NSC progression.},

We identified 12 major classes that are organized as ~600 distinct cell states, which map to precise spatial anatomical domains at 5 pcw. We described detailed differentiation trajectories of the human forebrain and midbrain and found a large number of region-specific glioblasts that mature into distinct pre-astrocytes and pre–oligodendrocyte precursor cells.

By leveraging single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data, we delineated enhancer gene regulatory networks and transcription factors that control commitment of specific cortical lineages. By intersecting our results with genetic risk factors for human brain diseases, we identified the cortical cell types and lineages most vulnerable to genetic insults of different brain disorders, especially autism. We find that lineage-specific gene expression programs up-regulated in female cells are especially enriched for the genetic risk factors of autism.

Evolutionary expansion of human neocortex is marked by distinctive pyramidal neurons with extensive L1 branching, but whether L1 interneurons are similarly diverse is underexplored. Using Patch-seq recordings from human neurosurgical tissue, we identified four transcriptomic subclasses with mouse L1 homologs, along with distinct subtypes and types unmatched in mouse L1. Subclass and subtype comparisons showed stronger transcriptomic differences in human L1 and were correlated with strong morphoelectric variability along dimensions distinct from mouse L1 variability. Accompanied by greater layer thickness and other cytoarchitecture changes, these findings suggest that L1 has diverged in evolution, reflecting the demands of regulating the expanded human neocortical circuit.},

We used comparative single-nucleus transcriptomics to analyze samples of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from adult humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, rhesus macaques, and common marmosets to understand human-specific features of the neocortex. Human, chimpanzee, and gorilla MTG showed highly similar cell-type composition and laminar organization as well as a large shift in proportions of deep-layer intratelencephalic-projecting neurons compared with macaque and marmoset MTG. Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes had more-divergent expression across species compared with neurons or oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and neuronal expression diverged more rapidly on the human lineage. Only a few hundred genes showed human-specific patterning, suggesting that relatively few cellular and molecular changes distinctively define adult human cortical structure.},

Our results show that the rare late endosomal signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P 2 ] directs the axonal cotransport of synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins in precursor vesicles in human neurons. Precursor vesicles are distinct from conventional secretory organelles, endosomes, and degradative lysosomes and are transported by coincident detection of PI(3,5)P 2 and active ARL8 via kinesin KIF1A to the presynaptic compartment. Our findings identify a crucial mechanism that mediates the delivery of synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins to developing synapses.},

We show single-molecule analysis of glycoconjugates by direct imaging of individual glycoconjugate molecules using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Intact glycoconjugate ions from electrospray are soft-landed on a surface for their direct single-molecule imaging. The submolecular imaging resolution corroborated by quantum mechanical modeling unveils whole structures and attachment sites of glycans in glycopeptides, glycolipids, N-glycoproteins, and O-glycoproteins densely decorated with glycans.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge facing tumor-antigen targeting therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–T cells is the identification of suitable targets that are specifically and uniformly expressed on heterogeneous solid tumors. By contrast, certain species of bacteria selectively colonize immune-privileged tumor cores and can be engineered as antigen-independent platforms for therapeutic delivery. To bridge these approaches, we developed a platform of probiotic-guided CAR-T cells (ProCARs), in which tumor-colonizing probiotics release synthetic targets that label tumor tissue for CAR-mediated lysis in situ. This system demonstrated CAR-T cell activation and antigen-agnostic cell lysis that was safe and effective in multiple xenograft and syngeneic models of human and mouse cancers. We further engineered multifunctional probiotics that co-release chemokines to enhance CAR-T cell recruitment and therapeutic response.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is affecting a wide range of global systems, with polar ecosystems experiencing the most rapid change. Although climate impacts affect lower-trophic-level and short-lived species most directly, it is less clear how long-lived and mobile species will respond to rapid polar warming because they may have the short-term ability to accommodate ecological disruptions while adapting to new conditions. We found that the population dynamics of an iconic and highly mobile polar-associated species are tightly coupled to Arctic prey availability and access to feeding areas. When low prey biomass coincided with high ice cover, gray whales experienced major mortality events, each reducing the population by 15 to 25\%. This suggests that even mobile, long-lived species are sensitive to dynamic and changing conditions as the Arctic warms.},

Although chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) has been demonstrated in molecules bound to substrates, experimental information about whether this process influences spin dynamics in the molecules themselves is lacking. Here we used time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that CISS strongly influences the spin dynamics of isolated covalent donor–chiral bridge–acceptor (D-Bχ-A) molecules in which selective photoexcitation of D is followed by two rapid, sequential electron-transfer events to yield D •+ -Bχ-A •– . Exploiting this phenomenon affords the possibility of using chiral molecular building blocks to control electron spin states in quantum information applications.},

We report an unforeseen reactivity mode for productive photocatalysis that uses cobalt polypyridyl complexes as photocatalysts by exploiting Marcus inverted region behavior that couples increases in excited-state energies with increased excited-state lifetimes. These cobalt (III) complexes can engage in bimolecular reactivity by virtue of their strong redox potentials and sufficiently long excited-state lifetimes, catalyzing oxidative C(sp 2 )–N coupling of aryl amides with challenging sterically hindered aryl boronic acids. More generally, the results imply that chromophores can be designed to increase excited-state lifetimes while simultaneously increasing excited-state energies, providing a pathway for the use of relatively abundant metals as photoredox catalysts.},

We experimentally report an attractive strain hardening rate throughout the deformation stage at 77 kelvin in a stable single-phase alloy with gradient dislocation cells that even surpasses its coarse-grained counterparts. Contrary to conventional understanding, the exceptional strain hardening arises from a distinctive dynamic structural refinement mechanism facilitated by the emission and motion of massive multiorientational tiny stacking faults (planar defects), which are fundamentally distinct from the traditional linear dislocation–mediated deformation. The dominance of atomic-scale planar deformation faulting in plastic deformation introduces a different approach for strengthening and hardening metallic materials, offering promising properties and potential applications.},

Quantifying changes in response breadth over time and with additional vaccine doses, our results show the largest increase between 4 weeks and &gt;3 months after a second dose.

  abstract     = {Disruption of cellular activities by pathogen virulence factors can trigger innate immune responses. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–inducible antimicrobial factors, such as the guanylate binding proteins (GBPs), promote cell-intrinsic defense by attacking intracellular pathogens and by inducing programmed cell death. Working in human macrophages, we discovered that GBP1 expression in the absence of IFN-γ killed the cells and induced Golgi fragmentation. IFN-γ exposure improved macrophage survival through the activity of the kinase PIM1. PIM1 phosphorylated GBP1, leading to its sequestration by 14-3-3σ, which thereby prevented GBP1 membrane association. During Toxoplasma gondii infection, the virulence protein TgIST interfered with IFN-γ signaling and depleted PIM1, thereby increasing GBP1 activity. Although infected cells can restrain pathogens in a GBP1-dependent manner, this mechanism can protect uninfected bystander cells. Thus, PIM1 can provide a bait for pathogen virulence factors, guarding the integrity of IFN-γ signaling.},

We present a high-resolution room temperature structure of the class Ie R2 protein radical captured by x-ray free electron laser serial femtosecond crystallography. The structure reveals conformational reorganization to shield the radical and connect it to the translocation path, with structural changes propagating to the surface where the protein interacts with the catalytic R1 subunit. Restructuring of the hydrogen bond network, including a notably short O–O interaction of 2.41 angstroms, likely tunes and gates the radical during PCET. These structural results help explain radical handling and mobilization in RNR and have general implications for radical transfer in proteins.},

We report the discovery, using LIDAR (light detection and ranging) information from across the basin, of 24 previously undetected pre-Columbian earthworks beneath the forest canopy. Modeled distribution and abundance of large-scale archaeological sites across Amazonia suggest that between 10,272 and 23,648 sites remain to be discovered and that most will be found in the southwest. We also identified 53 domesticated tree species significantly associated with earthwork occurrence probability, likely suggesting past management practices. Closed-canopy forests across Amazonia are likely to contain thousands of undiscovered archaeological sites around which pre-Columbian societies actively modified forests, a discovery that opens opportunities for better understanding the magnitude of ancient human influence on Amazonia and its current state.},

We reveal nonisothermal rate-and-selectivity oscillations that are self-sustained over extended periods of time (&gt;24 hours) for a cobalt/cerium oxide catalyst with an atomic ratio of cobalt to cerium of 2:1 (Co 2 Ce 1 ) at 220°C and equal partial pressures of the reactants. A microkinetic mechanism was used to generate rate-and-selectivity oscillations through forced temperature oscillations. Experimental and theoretical oscillations were in good agreement over an extended range of reactant pressure ratios. Additionally, phase portraits for hydrocarbon production were constructed that support the thermokinetic origin of our rate-and-selectivity oscillations.},

The enzymes that mediate Chl c biosynthesis have long remained elusive. In this work, we identified the CHLC dioxygenase (Phatr3_J43737) from the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum as the Chl c synthase. The chlc mutants lacked Chl c , instead accumulating its precursors, and exhibited growth defects. In vitro, recombinant CHLC protein converted these precursors into Chl c , thereby confirming its identity. Phylogenetic evidence demonstrates conserved use of CHLC across phyla but also the existence of distinct Chl c synthases in different algal groups. Our study addresses a long-outstanding question with implications for both contemporary and ancient marine photosynthesis.},

Here, we realized atom-by-atom construction, coherent operations, and readout of coupled electron-spin qubits using a scanning tunneling microscope. To enable the coherent control of “remote” qubits that are outside of the tunnel junction, we complemented each electron spin with a local magnetic field gradient from a nearby single-atom magnet. Readout was achieved by using a sensor qubit in the tunnel junction and implementing pulsed double electron spin resonance. Fast single-, two-, and three-qubit operations were thereby demonstrated in an all-electrical fashion. Our angstrom-scale qubit platform may enable quantum functionalities using electron spin arrays built atom by atom on a surface.},

These orbital magnetism effects led to substantial deviations from the standard Onsager relation, which manifested as a breakdown in scaling of Landau-level orbits. These substantial magnetic responses emerged from the nontrivial quantum geometry of the electronic structure and the large length scale of the moiré lattice potential. Going beyond traditional measurements, Landau-level spectroscopy performed with a scanning tunneling microscope offers a complete quantum ruler that resolves the full energy dependence of orbital magnetic properties in moiré quantum matter.},

  abstract     = {During pregnancy, physiological adaptations prepare the female body for the challenges of motherhood. Becoming a parent also requires behavioral adaptations. Such adaptations can occur as early as during pregnancy, but how pregnancy hormones remodel parenting circuits to instruct preparatory behavioral changes remains unknown. We found that action of estradiol and progesterone on galanin (Gal)–expressing neurons in the mouse medial preoptic area (MPOA) is critical for pregnancy-induced parental behavior. Whereas estradiol silences MPOA Gal neurons and paradoxically increases their excitability, progesterone permanently rewires this circuit node by promoting dendritic spine formation and recruitment of excitatory synaptic inputs. This MPOA Gal -specific neural remodeling sparsens population activity in vivo and results in persistently stronger, more selective responses to pup stimuli. Pregnancy hormones thus remodel parenting circuits in anticipation of future behavioral need.},

  abstract     = {Human footprints at White Sands National Park, New Mexico, USA, reportedly date to between ~23,000 and 21,000 years ago according to radiocarbon dating of seeds from the aquatic plant Ruppia cirrhosa . These ages remain controversial because of potential old carbon reservoir effects that could compromise their accuracy. We present new calibrated 14 C ages of terrestrial pollen collected from the same stratigraphic horizons as those of the Ruppia seeds, along with optically stimulated luminescence ages of sediments from within the human footprint–bearing sequence, to evaluate the veracity of the seed ages. The results show that the chronologic framework originally established for the White Sands footprints is robust and reaffirm that humans were present in North America during the Last Glacial Maximum.},

  abstract     = {The motion of line defects (dislocations) has been studied for more than 60 years, but the maximum speed at which they can move is unresolved. Recent models and atomistic simulations predict the existence of a limiting velocity of dislocation motion between the transonic and subsonic ranges at which the self-energy of dislocation diverges, though they do not deny the possibility of the transonic dislocations. We used femtosecond x-ray radiography to track ultrafast dislocation motion in shock-compressed single-crystal diamond. By visualizing stacking faults extending faster than the slowest sound wave speed of diamond, we show the evidence of partial dislocations at their leading edge moving transonically. Understanding the upper limit of dislocation mobility in crystals is essential to accurately model, predict, and control the mechanical properties of materials under extreme conditions.},

Much early work has focused on continental-level questions, leaving many regional questions, especially those relevant to the Global South, comparatively underexplored. A few success stories of aDNA studies from smaller laboratories involve more local aspects of human histories and health in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. In this Review, we cover some of these contributions by synthesizing finer-scale questions of importance to the archaeogenetics field, as well as to Indigenous and Descendant communities. We further highlight the potential of aDNA to uncover past histories in regions where colonialism has neglected the oral histories of oppressed peoples.},

Emerging deep-time genomic transects, including from DNA preserved in sediments, will enable inference of adaptive evolution, discovery of unrecognized species, and exploration of how glaciations, volcanism, and paleomagnetic reversals shaped demography and community composition. In this Review, we explore the state-of-the-art in paleogenomics and discuss key challenges, including technical limitations, evolutionary divergence and associated biases, and the need for more precise dating of remains and sediments. We conclude that with improvements in laboratory and computational methods, the emerging field of deep-time paleogenomics will expand the range of questions addressable using ancient DNA.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the genetic architecture of adaptive traits. Using whole-genome data of 3955 of Darwin’s finches on the Galápagos Island of Daphne Major, we identified six loci of large effect that explain 45\% of the variation in the highly heritable beak size of Geospiza fortis, a key ecological trait. The major locus is a supergene comprising four genes. Abrupt changes in allele frequencies at the loci accompanied a strong change in beak size caused by natural selection during a drought. A gradual change in Geospiza scandens occurred across 30 years as a result of introgressive hybridization with G. fortis . This study shows how a few loci with large effect on a fitness-related trait contribute to the genetic potential for rapid adaptive radiation.},

In Africa’s Lake Victoria region, one cichlid lineage radiated in every lake, with the largest radiation taking place in a lake less than 16,000 years old. We show that all of its ecological guilds evolved in situ. Cycles of lineage fusion through admixture and lineage fission through speciation characterize the history of the radiation. It was jump-started when several swamp-dwelling refugial populations, each of which were of older hybrid descent, met in the newly forming lake, where they fused into a single population, resuspending old admixture variation. Each population contributed a different set of ancient alleles from which a new adaptive radiation assembled in record time, involving additional fusion-fission cycles. We argue that repeated fusion-fission cycles in the history of a lineage make adaptive radiation fast and predictable.},

Therefore, the brain integrates multiple homeostatic signals with numerous cues that predict future deviations in energy supply. Recently, our understanding of the neural pathways underlying these regulatory principles—as well as their convergence in the hypothalamus as the key coordinator of food intake, energy expenditure, and glucose metabolism—have been revealed. These advances have changed our view of brain-dependent control of metabolic physiology. In this Review, we discuss new concepts about how alterations in these pathways contribute to the development of prevalent metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus and how this emerging knowledge may provide new targets for their treatment.},

We genetically engineered a mouse that expresses the optogenetic cationic channel ChR2 (H134R) exclusively in cardiac fibroblasts. After myocardial infarction, optical stimulation of scar tissue elicited organ-wide cardiac excitation and induced arrhythmias in these animals.

We report a site-directable aryl C-to-N replacement reaction allowing unified access to various pyridine isomers through a nitrene-internalization process. In a two-step, one-pot procedure, aryl azides are first photochemically converted to 3 H -azepines, which then undergo an oxidatively triggered C2-selective cheletropic carbon extrusion through a spirocyclic azanorcaradiene intermediate to afford the pyridine products. Because the ipso carbon of the aryl nitrene is excised from the molecule, the reaction proceeds regioselectively without perturbation of the remainder of the substrate. Applications are demonstrated in the abbreviated synthesis of a pyridyl derivative of estrone, as well as in a prototypical nitrogen scan.},

Colloidal nanocrystals are used as building blocks and photochemically bonded through their native ligands. Without resins, this bonding process produces arbitrary three-dimensional (3D) structures with a large inorganic mass fraction (~90\%) and high mechanical strength. The printed materials preserve the intrinsic properties of constituent nanocrystals and create structure-dictated functionalities, such as the broadband chiroptical responses with an anisotropic factor of ~0.24 for semiconducting cadmium chalcogenide nanohelical arrays.},

SCF1 is apparently specific to C. auris , and its expression mediates adhesion to inert and biological surfaces across isolates from all five clades. Unlike canonical fungal adhesins, which function through hydrophobic interactions, Scf1 relies on exposed cationic residues for surface association.

Gas-MOF reagents are prepared on gram-scale and used to facilitate fluorovinylation and fluoroalkylation reactions. Encapsulation of gas-MOF reagents within wax enables stable storage on the benchtop and controlled release into solution upon sonication, which represents a safer alternative to handling the gas directly. Furthermore, our approach enables high-throughput reaction development with these gases.},

We show experimentally that epimutation clocks recapitulate known topologies and branching times of intraspecies phylogenetic trees in the self-fertilizing plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the clonal seagrass Zostera marina , which represent two major modes of plant reproduction.

This effect was achieved by integrating a tungsten disulfide monolayer into a photonic cavity that supports two orthogonal spin modes with high quality factors. The spin-pumped lasing effectively broke the population symmetry of valley excitons, resulting in highly coherent emission with valley-switchable radiation modes due to distinct laser thresholds.

  abstract     = {Assembly of the CMG (CDC-45–MCM-2-7–GINS) helicase is the key regulated step during eukaryotic DNA replication initiation. Until now, it was unclear whether metazoa require additional factors that are not present in yeast. In this work, we show that Caenorhabditis elegans DNSN-1, the ortholog of human DONSON, functions during helicase assembly in a complex with MUS-101/TOPBP1. DNSN-1 is required to recruit the GINS complex to chromatin, and a cryo–electron microscopy structure indicates that DNSN-1 positions GINS on the MCM-2-7 helicase motor (comprising the six MCM-2 to MCM-7 proteins), by direct binding of DNSN-1 to GINS and MCM-3, using interfaces that we show are important for initiation and essential for viability. These findings identify DNSN-1 as a missing link in our understanding of DNA replication initiation, suggesting that initiation defects underlie the human disease syndrome that results from DONSON mutations.},

  abstract     = {CDC45-MCM2-7-GINS (CMG) helicase assembly is the central event in eukaryotic replication initiation. In yeast, a multi-subunit “pre-loading complex” (pre-LC) accompanies GINS to chromatin-bound MCM2-7, leading to CMG formation. Here, we report that DONSON, a metazoan protein mutated in microcephalic primordial dwarfism, is required for CMG assembly in vertebrates. Using AlphaFold to screen for protein-protein interactions followed by experimental validation, we show that DONSON scaffolds a vertebrate pre-LC containing GINS, TOPBP1, and DNA pol ε. Our evidence suggests that DONSON docks the pre-LC onto MCM2-7, delivering GINS to its binding site in CMG. A patient-derived DONSON mutation compromises CMG assembly and recapitulates microcephalic dwarfism in mice. These results unify our understanding of eukaryotic replication initiation, implicate defective CMG assembly in microcephalic dwarfism, and illustrate how in silico protein-protein interaction screening accelerates mechanistic discovery.},

We present AlphaMissense, an adaptation of AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate variant population frequency databases to predict missense variant pathogenicity. By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible human single amino acid substitutions and classify 89\% of missense variants as either likely benign or likely pathogenic.},

We found that STRs modulate transcription factor (TF)–DNA affinities and apparent on-rates by about 70-fold by directly binding TF DNA-binding domains, with energetic impacts exceeding many consensus motif mutations. STRs maximize the number of weakly preferred microstates near target sites, thereby increasing TF density, with impacts well predicted by statistical mechanics. Confirming that STRs also affect TF binding in cells, neural networks trained only on in vivo occupancies predicted effects identical to those observed in vitro. Approximately 90\% of TFs preferentially bound STRs that need not resemble known motifs, providing a cis -regulatory mechanism to target TFs to genomic sites.},

In batteries with solid-solid interfaces, mechanical contacts, and the development of stresses during operation of the solid-state batteries, become as critical as the electrochemical stability to keep steady charge transfer at these interfaces. This review will focus on stress and strain that result from normal and extended battery cycling and the associated mechanisms for stress relief, some of which lead to failure of these batteries.},

However, this reaction typically requires ultraviolet light, which limits applicability. In this study, we introduce disequilibration by sensitization under confinement (DESC), a supramolecular approach to induce the E -to- Z isomerization by using light of a desired color, including red. DESC relies on a combination of a macrocyclic host and a photosensitizer, which act together to selectively bind and sensitize E -azobenzenes for isomerization. The Z isomer lacks strong affinity for and is expelled from the host, which can then convert additional E- azobenzenes to the Z state. In this way, the host–photosensitizer complex converts photon energy into chemical energy in the form of out-of-equilibrium photostationary states, including ones that cannot be accessed through direct photoexcitation.},

We present a solid-solvent processing strategy to fabricate an ultrathin MMM (thickness less than 100 nanometers) with filler loading up to 80 volume\%. We used polymer as a solid solvent to dissolve metal salts to form an ultrathin precursor layer, which immobilizes the metal salt and regulates its conversion to a metal-organic framework (MOF) and provides adhesion to the MOF in the matrix. The resultant membrane exhibits fast gas-sieving properties, with hydrogen permeance and/or hydrogen–carbon dioxide selectivity one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of state-of-the-art membranes.},

Whether restoring neurological functions requires directed regeneration of axons from specific neuronal subpopulations to their natural target regions remains unclear. To address this question, we applied projection-specific and comparative single-nucleus RNA sequencing to identify neuronal subpopulations that restore walking after incomplete SCI. We show that chemoattracting and guiding the transected axons of these neurons to their natural target region led to substantial recovery of walking after complete SCI in mice, whereas regeneration of axons simply across the lesion had no effect. Thus, reestablishing the natural projections of characterized neurons forms an essential part of axon regeneration strategies aimed at restoring lost neurological functions.},

In this work, we present a 3.3-Å-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of PRC2 bound to a G-quadruplex RNA. Notably, RNA mediates the dimerization of PRC2 by binding both protomers and inducing a protein interface composed of two copies of the catalytic subunit EZH2, thereby blocking nucleosome DNA interaction and histone H3 tail accessibility. Furthermore, an RNA-binding loop of EZH2 facilitates the handoff between RNA and DNA, another activity implicated in PRC2 regulation by RNA. We identified a gain-of-function mutation in this loop that activates PRC2 in zebrafish. Our results reveal mechanisms for RNA-mediated regulation of a chromatin-modifying enzyme.},

Maternal microchimeric cells and accumulation of T reg cells with noninherited maternal antigen (NIMA) specificity are similarly overturned in daughters after pregnancy, highlighting a fixed microchimeric cell niche. Whereas NIMA-specific tolerance is functionally erased by pregnancy, partner-specific resiliency against pregnancy complications persists in mothers despite paternity changes in intervening pregnancy. Persistent fetal tolerance reflects FOXP3 expression plasticity, which allows mothers to more durably remember their babies, whereas daughters forget their mothers with new pregnancy-imprinted immunological memories.},

This is driven by succinate-mediated transcriptional and epigenetic activation of major histocompatibility complex–antigen processing and presentation (MHC-APP) genes independent of interferon signaling. Furthermore, knockout of methylation-controlled J protein (MCJ), to promote electron entry preferentially through CI, provides proof of concept of ETC rewiring to achieve antitumor responses without side effects associated with an overall reduction in mitochondrial respiration in noncancer cells.

Recruiting between 350 and 370 people per week is essential to avoid their collapse because of aggregate losses.

This indicates that the CO 2 is derived from an internal carbon source.

Urbanization (2) and climate change (3) have increased the frequency and intensity of urban floods, which have caused damage in other Chinese cities as well (4). Urban flood events, and the population exposed to floods, are expected to increase (5). China’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021–2025) emphasizes the importance of urban flooding resilience (6) but provides insufficient details about how to implement the changes. To prevent casualties and damage, cities in China must implement the goals outlined in the plan by enhancing the flood resilience of urban infrastructure.},

To determine whether this biology is conserved in humans, we characterized the colonic γδ T cell compartment, identifying a diverse repertoire that includes a phenotypically distinct subset coexpressing T cell receptor Vγ4 and the epithelium-binding integrin CD103. This subset was disproportionately diminished and dysregulated in inflammatory bowel disease, whereas on-treatment CD103 + γδ T cell restoration was associated with sustained inflammatory bowel disease remission. Moreover, CD103 + Vγ4 + cell dysregulation and loss were also displayed by humans with germline BTNL3/BTNL8 hypomorphism, which we identified as a risk factor for penetrating Crohn’s disease (CD). Thus, BTNL-dependent selection and/or maintenance of distinct tissue-intrinsic γδ T cells appears to be an evolutionarily conserved axis limiting the progression of a complex, multifactorial, tissue-damaging disease of increasing global incidence.},

Little is known about the molecular mechanism of its activation by double phosphorylation from MAPK kinases (MAP2Ks), because of the challenge of trapping a transient and dynamic heterokinase complex. We applied a multidisciplinary approach to generate a structural model of p38α in complex with its MAP2K, MKK6, and to understand the activation mechanism. Integrating cryo–electron microscopy with molecular dynamics simulations, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and experiments in cells, we demonstrate a dynamic, multistep phosphorylation mechanism, identify catalytically relevant interactions, and show that MAP2K-disordered amino termini determine pathway specificity. Our work captures a fundamental step of cell signaling: a kinase phosphorylating its downstream target kinase.},

We demonstrate a 325-milligram soft combustion microactuator that can achieve displacements of 140\%, operate at frequencies &gt;100 hertz, and generate forces &gt;9.5 newtons. With these actuators, we powered an insect-scale quadrupedal robot, which demonstrated a variety of gait patterns, directional control, and a payload capacity 22 times its body weight.

Despite the enriched localization of Ube3a in the axon terminals including presynapses, little is known about the presynaptic function of Ube3a and mechanisms underlying its presynaptic localization. We show that developmental synapse elimination requires presynaptic Ube3a activity in Drosophila neurons. We further identified the domain of Ube3a that is required for its interaction with the kinesin motor. Angelman syndrome–associated missense mutations in the interaction domain attenuate presynaptic targeting of Ube3a and prevent synapse elimination. Conversely, increased Ube3a activity in presynapses leads to precocious synapse elimination and impairs synaptic transmission. Our findings reveal the physiological role of Ube3a and suggest potential pathogenic mechanisms associated with Ube3a dysregulation.},

  abstract     = {Eosinophils are granulocytes that play an essential role in type 2 immunity and regulate multiple homeostatic processes in the small intestine (SI). However, the signals that regulate eosinophil activity in the SI at steady state remain poorly understood. Through transcriptome profiling of eosinophils from various mouse tissues, we found that a subset of SI eosinophils expressed neuromedin U (NMU) receptor 1 (NMUR1). Fate-mapping analyses showed that NMUR1 expression in SI eosinophils was programmed by the local microenvironment and further enhanced by inflammation. Genetic perturbation and eosinophil-organoid coculture experiments revealed that NMU-mediated eosinophil activation promotes goblet cell differentiation. Thus, NMU regulates epithelial cell differentiation and barrier immunity by stimulating NMUR1-expressing eosinophils in the SI, which highlights the importance of neuroimmune-epithelial cross-talk in maintaining tissue homeostasis.},

  abstract     = {Lysosomes critically rely on bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) to stimulate lipid catabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, and lysosomal function. Alterations in BMP levels in monogenic and complex neurodegeneration suggest an essential function in human health. However, the site and mechanism responsible for BMP synthesis have been subject to debate for decades. Here, we report that the Batten disease gene product CLN5 is the elusive BMP synthase (BMPS). BMPS-deficient cells exhibited a massive accumulation of the BMP synthesis precursor lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG), depletion of BMP species, and dysfunctional lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, we found that BMPS mediated synthesis through an energy-independent base exchange reaction between two LPG molecules with increased activity on BMP-laden vesicles. Our study elucidates BMP biosynthesis and reveals an anabolic function of late endosomes/lysosomes.},

  abstract     = {Neuronal cell loss is a defining feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We xenografted human or mouse neurons into the brain of a mouse model of AD. Only human neurons displayed tangles, Gallyas silver staining, granulovacuolar neurodegeneration (GVD), phosphorylated tau blood biomarkers, and considerable neuronal cell loss. The long noncoding RNA MEG3 was strongly up-regulated in human neurons . This neuron-specific long noncoding RNA is also up-regulated in AD patients. MEG3 expression alone was sufficient to induce necroptosis in human neurons in vitro. Down-regulation of MEG3 and inhibition of necroptosis using pharmacological or genetic manipulation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3, or mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) rescued neuronal cell loss in xenografted human neurons. This model suggests potential therapeutic approaches for AD and reveals a human-specific vulnerability to AD.},

  abstract     = {Complex vocal learning, a critical component of human spoken language, has been assumed to be associated with more-advanced cognitive abilities. Tests of this hypothesis between individuals within a species have been inconclusive and have not been done across species. In this work, we measured an array of cognitive skills—namely, problem-solving, associative and reversal learning, and self-control—across 214 individuals of 23 bird species, including 19 wild-caught songbird species, two domesticated songbird species, and two wild-caught vocal nonlearning species. We found that the greater the vocal learning abilities of a species, the better their problem-solving skills and the relatively larger their brains. These conclusions held when controlling for noncognitive variables and phylogeny. Our results support a hypothesis of shared genetic and cognitive mechanisms between vocal learning, problem-solving, and bigger brains in songbirds.},

  abstract     = {Rising consumer demand for online food delivery has increased the consumption of disposable cutlery, leading to plastic pollution worldwide. In this work, we investigate the impact of green nudges on single-use cutlery consumption in China. In collaboration with Alibaba’s food-delivery platform, Eleme (which is similar to Uber Eats and DoorDash), we analyzed detailed customer-level data and found that the green nudges—changing the default to “no cutlery” and rewarding consumers with “green points”—increased the share of no-cutlery orders by 648\%. The environmental benefits are sizable: If green nudges were applied to all of China, more than 21.75 billion sets of single-use cutlery could be saved annually, equivalent to preventing the generation of 3.26 million metric tons of plastic waste and saving 5.44 million trees.},

Liver cirrhosis drastically alters vascular architecture, but how KCs adapt is unclear. We used a mouse model of liver fibrosis and human tissue to examine immune adaptation. Fibrosis forced KCs to lose contact with parenchymal cells, down-regulating “KC identity,” which rendered them incapable of clearing bacteria. Commensals stimulated the recruitment of monocytes through CD44 to a spatially distinct vascular compartment. There, recruited monocytes formed large aggregates of multinucleated cells (syncytia) that expressed phenotypical KC markers and displayed enhanced bacterial capture ability. Syncytia formed via CD36 and were observed in human cirrhosis as a possible antimicrobial defense that evolved with fibrosis.},

Here, we report proteostasis reprogramming as a key convergence point of multiple KRASi-resistance mechanisms. Inactivation of oncogenic KRAS down-regulated both the heat shock response and the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) branch of the unfolded protein response, causing severe proteostasis disturbances. However, IRE1α was selectively reactivated in an ER stress–independent manner in acquired KRASi-resistant tumors, restoring proteostasis. Oncogenic KRAS promoted IRE1α protein stability through extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)–dependent phosphorylation of IRE1α, leading to IRE1α disassociation from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase degradation (HRD1) E3-ligase. In KRASi-resistant tumors, both reactivated ERK and hyperactivated AKT restored IRE1α phosphorylation and stability. Suppression of IRE1α overcame resistance to KRASi. This study reveals a druggable mechanism that leads to proteostasis reprogramming and facilitates KRASi resistance.},

The detected morphology is consistent with the presence of a radiation belt. Comparison with models indicates that the radiation belt contains energetic particles confined by magnetic mirroring.

We found that although the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of cerebellar granule neurons mature in early postnatal life, 3D genome architecture gradually remodels throughout life, establishing ultra–long-range intrachromosomal contacts and specific interchromosomal contacts that are rarely seen in neurons. These results reveal unexpected evolutionarily conserved molecular processes that underlie distinctive features of neural development and aging across the mammalian life span.},

The system detects ultradian rhythms, disruption of the circadian cycle, and/or a rise in kidney temperature.

In this work, we describe a mammalian adaptation to dietary chitin that is coordinated by gastric innate immune activation and acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase). Chitin consumption causes gastric distension and cytokine production by stomach tuft cells and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in mice, which drives the expansion of AMCase-expressing zymogenic chief cells that facilitate chitin digestion. Although chitin influences gut microbial composition, ILC2-mediated tissue adaptation and gastrointestinal responses are preserved in germ-free mice. In the absence of AMCase, sustained chitin intake leads to heightened basal type 2 immunity, reduced adiposity, and resistance to obesity. These data define an endogenous metabolic circuit that enables nutrient extraction from an insoluble dietary constituent by enhancing digestive function.},

This mechanism diverges from those involving Cu(I) and Cu(III) intermediates that have been posited for other Ullmann-type couplings.

Using the Price equation to partition this change into within-species body size versus compositional changes, we detected prevailing decreases in body size through time driven primarily by fish, with more variable patterns in other taxa. We found that change in assemblage composition contributes more to body size changes than within-species trends, but both components show substantial variation in magnitude and direction. The biomass of assemblages remains quite stable as decreases in body size trade off with increases in abundance.},

Plasma tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity is negatively associated with atherogenic apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol levels in humans, but the mechanisms are unknown. We found that tPA, partially through the lysine-binding site on its Kringle 2 domain, binds to the N terminus of apoB, blocking the interaction between apoB and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in hepatocytes, thereby reducing very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and plasma apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) sequesters tPA away from apoB and increases VLDL assembly. Humans with PAI-1 deficiency have smaller VLDL particles and lower plasma levels of apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol. These results suggest a mechanism that fine-tunes VLDL assembly by intracellular interactions among tPA, PAI-1, and apoB in hepatocytes.},

  abstract     = {Plant mitochondria represent the largest group of respiring organelles on the planet. Plant mitochondrial messenger RNAs (mRNAs) lack Shine-Dalgarno-like ribosome-binding sites, so it is unknown how plant mitoribosomes recognize mRNA. We show that “mitochondrial translation factors” mTRAN1 and mTRAN2 are land plant–specific proteins, required for normal mitochondrial respiration chain biogenesis. Our studies suggest that mTRANs are noncanonical pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR)–like RNA binding proteins of the mitoribosomal “small” subunit. We identified conserved Adenosine (A)/Uridine (U)-rich motifs in the 5′ regions of plant mitochondrial mRNAs. mTRAN1 binds this motif, suggesting that it is a mitoribosome homing factor to identify mRNAs. We demonstrate that mTRANs are likely required for translation of all plant mitochondrial mRNAs. Plant mitochondrial translation initiation thus appears to use a protein-mRNA interaction that is divergent from bacteria or mammalian mitochondria.},

  abstract     = {A long-standing problem associated with silicone synthesis is contamination of the polymer products with 10 to 15\% cyclic oligosiloxanes that results from backbiting reactions at the polymer chain ends. This process, in competition with chain propagation through ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic monomers, was thought to be unavoidable and routinely leads to a thermodynamically controlled reaction mixture (polymer/cyclic oligosiloxanes = 85/15). Here, we report that simple alcohol coordination to the anionic chain ends prevents the backbiting process and that a well-designed phosphonium cation acts as a self-quenching system in response to loss of coordinating alcohols to stop the reaction before the backbiting process begins. The combination of both effects allows a thermodynamically controlled ROP of the eight-membered siloxane ring D 4 without producing undesirable cyclic oligosiloxanes.},

  abstract     = {Organisms have evolved under gravitational force, and many sense the direction of gravity by means of statoliths in specialized cells. In flowering plants, starch-accumulating plastids, known as amyloplasts, act as statoliths to facilitate downstream gravitropism. The gravity-sensing mechanism has long been considered a mechanosensing process by which amyloplasts transmit forces to intracellular structures, but the molecular mechanism underlying this has not been elucidated. We show here that LAZY1-LIKE (LZY) family proteins involved in statocyte gravity signaling associate with amyloplasts and the proximal plasma membrane. This results in polar localization according to the direction of gravity. We propose a gravity-sensing mechanism by which LZY translocation to the plasma membrane signals the direction of gravity by transmitting information on the position of amyloplasts.},

  abstract     = {Mapping molecular structure to odor perception is a key challenge in olfaction. We used graph neural networks to generate a principal odor map (POM) that preserves perceptual relationships and enables odor quality prediction for previously uncharacterized odorants. The model was as reliable as a human in describing odor quality: On a prospective validation set of 400 out-of-sample odorants, the model-generated odor profile more closely matched the trained panel mean than did the median panelist. By applying simple, interpretable, theoretically rooted transformations, the POM outperformed chemoinformatic models on several other odor prediction tasks, indicating that the POM successfully encoded a generalized map of structure-odor relationships. This approach broadly enables odor prediction and paves the way toward digitizing odors.},

Traditional, lecture-based calculus instruction may present a barrier for students seeking STEM degrees, limit their access to STEM professions, and block their potential to address society’s challenges. A large-scale pragmatic trial with randomized student allocation was conducted to compare two calculus instruction styles: active student engagement (treatment condition) versus traditional, lecture-based instruction (control condition). A sample of 811 university students were studied across 32 sections taught by 19 instructors over three semesters at a large, US-based Hispanic-serving institution. Large effect sizes were consistently measured for student learning outcomes in the treatment condition, which demonstrates a new standard for calculus instruction and increased opportunities for completion of STEM degrees.},

We estimated μ directly from pedigrees in four baleen whale species for both the mitochondrial control region and nuclear genome. The results suggest values higher than those obtained through phylogeny-based estimates and similar to pedigree-based values for primates and toothed whales. Applying our estimate of μ reduces previous genetic-based estimates of preexploitation whale abundance by 86\% and suggests that μ cannot explain low cancer rates in gigantic mammals. Our study shows that it is feasible to estimate μ directly from pedigrees in natural populations, with wide-ranging implications for ecological and evolutionary research.},

We integrated multiscale seismic and space-geodetic observations with multifault kinematic inversions and dynamic rupture modeling to unravel the events’ complex rupture history and stress-mediated fault interactions. Our analysis reveals three subshear slip episodes during the initial M w 7.8 earthquake with a delayed rupture initiation to the southwest. The M w 7.7 event occurred 9 hours later with a larger slip and supershear rupture on its western branch. Mechanically consistent dynamic models accounting for fault interactions can explain the unexpected rupture paths and require a heterogeneous background stress. Our results highlight the importance of combining near- and far-field observations with data-driven and physics-based models for seismic hazard assessment.},

In this study, we developed a fast infinitesimal time coalescent process (FitCoal) to circumvent this difficulty and calculated the composite likelihood for present-day human genomic sequences of 3154 individuals. Results showed that human ancestors went through a severe population bottleneck with about 1280 breeding individuals between around 930,000 and 813,000 years ago. The bottleneck lasted for about 117,000 years and brought human ancestors close to extinction. This bottleneck is congruent with a substantial chronological gap in the available African and Eurasian fossil record. Our results provide new insights into our ancestry and suggest a coincident speciation event.},

In this work, we show that the atmospheric Arctic Dipole (AD) associated with anticyclonic winds over North America and cyclonic winds over Eurasia modulates inflows from the North Atlantic across the Nordic Seas. The alternating AD phases create a “switchgear mechanism.” From 2007 to 2021, this switchgear mechanism weakened northward inflows and enhanced sea-ice export across Fram Strait and increased inflows throughout the Barents Sea. By favoring stronger Arctic Ocean circulation, transferring freshwater into the Amerasian Basin, boosting stratification, and lowering oceanic heat fluxes there after 2007, AD+ contributed to slowing sea-ice loss. A transition to an AD− phase may accelerate the Arctic sea-ice decline, which would further change the Arctic climate system.},

The design and construction of this tool required the generation of an experimental dataset that explores a diverse network of reactant pairings across a set of reaction conditions. A large scope of C–N couplings was actively learned by neural network models by using a systematic process to design experiments. The models showed good performance in experimental validation: Ten products were isolated in more than 85\% yield from a range of couplings with out-of-sample reactants designed to challenge the models. Importantly, the developed workflow continually improves the prediction capability of the tool as the corpus of data grows.},

Theory predicts that sufficiently strong magnetic fields can halt the accretion flow, producing a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). We analyzed archival multiwavelength observations of an outburst from the black hole x-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 in 2018. The radio and optical fluxes were delayed compared with the x-ray flux by about 8 and 17 days, respectively. We interpret this as evidence for the formation of a MAD. In this scenario, the magnetic field is amplified by an expanding corona, forming a MAD around the time of the radio peak. We propose that the optical delay is due to thermal viscous instability in the outer disk.},

Although the proteasome also eliminates proteins that are not ubiquitinated, how this occurs mechanistically is unclear. Here, we found that midnolin promoted the destruction of many nuclear proteins, including transcription factors encoded by the immediate-early genes. Diverse stimuli induced midnolin, and its overexpression was sufficient to cause the degradation of its targets by a mechanism that did not require ubiquitination. Instead, midnolin associated with the proteasome via an α helix, used its Catch domain to bind a region within substrates that can form a β strand, and used a ubiquitin-like domain to promote substrate destruction. Thus, midnolin contains three regions that function in concert to target a large set of nuclear proteins to the proteasome for degradation.},

Here, we describe ReDACT (Restoring Disomy in Aneuploid cells using CRISPR Targeting), a set of chromosome engineering tools that allow us to eliminate specific aneuploidies from cancer genomes. Using ReDACT, we created a panel of isogenic cells that have or lack common aneuploidies, and we demonstrate that trisomy of chromosome 1q is required for malignant growth in cancers harboring this alteration. Mechanistically, gaining chromosome 1q increases the expression of MDM4 and suppresses p53 signaling, and we show that TP53 mutations are mutually exclusive with 1q aneuploidy in human cancers. Thus, tumor cells can be dependent on specific aneuploidies, raising the possibility that these “aneuploidy addictions” could be targeted as a therapeutic strategy.},

One histone H3-H4 heterodimer is bound by one CAF-1 complex mainly through the p60 subunit and the acidic domain of the p150 subunit. We also observed a dimeric CAF-1–H3-H4 supercomplex in which two H3-H4 heterodimers are poised for tetramer assembly and discovered that CAF-1 facilitates right-handed DNA wrapping of H3-H4 tetramers. These findings signify the involvement of DNA in H3-H4 tetramer formation and suggest a right-handed nucleosome precursor in chromatin replication.},

We explored how mechanosensation affords exquisite awareness of the genitals and controls reproduction in mice and humans. Using genetic strategies and in vivo functional imaging, we demonstrated that the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO2 (piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2) is necessary for behavioral sensitivity to perineal touch. PIEZO2 function is needed for triggering a touch-evoked erection reflex and successful mating in both male and female mice. Humans with complete loss of PIEZO2 function have genital hyposensitivity and experience no direct pleasure from gentle touch or vibration. Together, our results help explain how perineal mechanoreceptors detect the gentlest of stimuli and trigger physiologically important sexual responses, thus providing a platform for exploring the sensory basis of sexual pleasure and its relationship to affective touch.},

Because the aging myocardium is characterized by microcirculatory dysfunction, and because nerves align with vessels, we assessed the impact of aging on the cardiac neurovascular interface. We report that aging reduces nerve density in the ventricle and dysregulates vascular-derived neuroregulatory genes. Aging down-regulates microRNA 145 (miR-145) and derepresses the neurorepulsive factor semaphorin-3A. miR-145 deletion, which increased Sema3a expression or endothelial Sema3a overexpression, reduced axon density, mimicking the aged-heart phenotype. Removal of senescent cells, which accumulated with chronological age in parallel to the decline in nerve density, rescued age-induced denervation, reversed Sema3a expression, preserved heart rate patterns, and reduced electrical instability. These data suggest that senescence-mediated regulation of nerve density contributes to age-associated cardiac dysfunction.},

We have isolated potato surface receptor Pep-13 receptor unit (PERU) that senses Pep-13, a conserved immunogenic peptide pattern from plant pathogenic Phytophthora species. PERU, a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, is a bona fide PRR that binds Pep-13 and enhances immunity to Phytophthora infestans infection. Diversification in ligand binding specificities of PERU can be traced to sympatric wild tuber-bearing Solanum populations in the Central Andes. Our study reveals the evolution of cell surface immune receptor alleles in wild potato populations that recognize ligand variants not recognized by others.},

Routes that oxidatively remove hydrogen as water have safety and cost challenges. We coupled chemical looping–selective hydrogen (H 2 ) combustion and PDH with multifunctional ferric vanadate–vanadium oxide (FeVO 4 -VO x ) redox catalysts. Well-dispersed VO x supported on aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) provides dehydrogenation sites, and adjacent nanoscale FeVO 4 acts as an oxygen carrier for subsequent H 2 combustion. We achieved an integral performance of 81.3\% propylene selectivity at 42.7\% propane conversion at 550°C for 200 chemical looping cycles for the reoxidization of FeVO 4 . Based on catalytic experiments, spectroscopic characterization, and theory calculations, we propose a hydrogen spillover–mediated coupling mechanism. The hydrogen species generated at the VO x sites migrated to adjacent FeVO 4 for combustion, which shifted PDH toward propylene. This mechanism is favored by the proximity between the dehydrogenation and combustion sites.},

Furthermore, we have coupled abundantly available terpenes and terpenoids with nitrogen nucleophiles to access artificial terpenoid alkaloids and complex chiral amines. In addition, we applied a commodity chemical, α-methylstyrene, as a methylation reagent to prepare methylated nucleosides directly from canonical nucleosides in one synthetic step.

We identified jets on scales of a few hundred kilometers, which last 20 to 100 seconds and reach speeds of ~100 kilometers per second. The jets are powered by magnetic reconnection and have kinetic energy in the picoflare range. They are intermittent but widespread within the observed coronal hole. We suggest that such picoflare jets could produce enough high-temperature plasma to sustain the solar wind and that the wind emerges from coronal holes as a highly intermittent outflow at small scales.},

  abstract     = {On a flat map of the Earth, continents are inevitably distorted. Reciprocally, curving a plate simultaneously in two directions requires a modification of in-plane distances, as Gauss stated in his seminal theorem. Although emerging architectured materials with programmed in-plane distortions are capable of such shape morphing, an additional control of local bending is required to precisely set the final shape of the resulting three-dimensional surface. Inspired by bulliform cells in leaves of monocotyledon plants, we show how the internal structure of flat panels can be designed to program bending and in-plane distortions simultaneously when pressurized, leading to a targeted shell shape. These surfaces with controlled stiffness and fast actuation are manufactured using consumer-grade materials and open a route to large-scale shape-morphing robotics applications.},

  abstract     = {Methane pyrolysis (MP) is a potential technology for CO 2 -free hydrogen production that generates only solid carbon by-products. However, developing a highly efficient catalyst for stable methane pyrolysis at a moderate temperature has been challenging. We present a new and highly efficient catalyst created by modifying a Ni-Bi liquid alloy with the addition of Mo to produce a ternary NiMo-Bi liquid alloy catalyst (LAC). This catalyst exhibited a considerably low activation energy of 81.2 kilojoules per mole, which enabled MP at temperatures between 450 and 800 Celsius and a hydrogen generation efficiency of 4.05 ml per gram of nickel per minute. At 800 Celsius, the catalyst exhibited 100\% H 2 selectivity and 120 hours of stability.},

  abstract     = {The intestinal microbiota regulates mammalian lipid absorption, metabolism, and storage. We report that the microbiota reprograms intestinal lipid metabolism in mice by repressing the expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Snhg9 (small nucleolar RNA host gene 9) in small intestinal epithelial cells. Snhg9 suppressed the activity of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARγ)—a central regulator of lipid metabolism—by dissociating the PPARγ inhibitor sirtuin 1 from cell cycle and apoptosis protein 2 (CCAR2). Forced expression of Snhg9 in the intestinal epithelium of conventional mice impaired lipid absorption, reduced body fat, and protected against diet-induced obesity. The microbiota repressed Snhg9 expression through an immune relay encompassing myeloid cells and group 3 innate lymphoid cells. Our findings thus identify an unanticipated role for a lncRNA in microbial control of host metabolism.},

Two unpaved roads of equivalent length run through the park, linking the regional capitals of Mpanda and Sumbawanga. One road cuts across the center of the park, crossing the Katuma River, a dry season hotspot for very large mammals, especially hippopotamus (3). The other runs farther west through miombo woodland with much lower animal densities. After a hiatus due to lack of funding, construction to pave the road that bisects the central area frequented by animals in the dry season has recently started, putting animal populations at risk. Yet Tanzania could still craft a win-win solution to this environment-development conflict if it reassesses its paving decision.},

  abstract     = {The extraembryonic yolk sac (YS) ensures delivery of nutritional support and oxygen to the developing embryo but remains ill-defined in humans. We therefore assembled a comprehensive multiomic reference of the human YS from 3 to 8 postconception weeks by integrating single-cell protein and gene expression data. Beyond its recognized role as a site of hematopoiesis, we highlight roles in metabolism, coagulation, vascular development, and hematopoietic regulation. We reconstructed the emergence and decline of YS hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from hemogenic endothelium and revealed a YS-specific accelerated route to macrophage production that seeds developing organs. The multiorgan functions of the YS are superseded as intraembryonic organs develop, effecting a multifaceted relay of vital functions as pregnancy proceeds.},

We obtained 172 new radiocarbon dates on megafauna from Rancho La Brea in California spanning 15.6 to 10.0 thousand calendar years before present (ka). Seven species of extinct megafauna disappeared by 12.9 ka, before the onset of the Younger Dryas. Comparison with high-resolution regional datasets revealed that these disappearances coincided with an ecological state shift that followed aridification and vegetation changes during the Bølling-Allerød (14.69 to 12.89 ka). Time-series modeling implicates large-scale fires as the primary cause of the extirpations, and the catalyst of this state shift may have been mounting human impacts in a drying, warming, and increasingly fire-prone ecosystem.},

Despite their large size, ubiquitous expression, and irreplaceable roles in an ever-growing list of physiological processes, few Piezo channel–binding proteins have emerged. In this work, we found that MyoD (myoblast determination)–family inhibitor proteins (MDFIC and MDFI) are PIEZO1/2 interacting partners. These transcriptional regulators bind to PIEZO1/2 channels, regulating channel inactivation. Using single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy, we mapped the interaction site in MDFIC to a lipidated, C-terminal helix that inserts laterally into the PIEZO1 pore module. These Piezo-interacting proteins fit all the criteria for auxiliary subunits, contribute to explaining the vastly different gating kinetics of endogenous Piezo channels observed in many cell types, and elucidate mechanisms potentially involved in human lymphatic vascular disease.},

Proteins that lack this feature are considered undruggable and require innovative strategies for therapeutic targeting. KRAS is the most frequently activated oncogene in cancer, and the active state of mutant KRAS is such a recalcitrant target. We designed a natural product–inspired small molecule that remodels the surface of cyclophilin A (CYPA) to create a neomorphic interface with high affinity and selectivity for the active state of KRAS G12C (in which glycine-12 is mutated to cysteine). The resulting CYPA:drug:KRAS G12C tricomplex inactivated oncogenic signaling and led to tumor regressions in multiple human cancer models. This inhibitory strategy can be used to target additional KRAS mutants and other undruggable cancer drivers. Tricomplex inhibitors that selectively target active KRAS G12C or multiple RAS mutants are in clinical trials now (NCT05462717 and NCT05379985).},

In this work, we consider two-dimensional metals of fermions coupled to quantum critical scalars, the latter representing order parameters or fractionalized particles. We show that at low temperatures ( T ), such metals generically exhibit strange metal behavior with a T -linear resistivity arising from spatially random fluctuations in the fermion-scalar Yukawa couplings about a nonzero spatial average. We also find a T ln(1/ T ) specific heat and a rationale for the Planckian bound on the transport scattering time. These results are in agreement with observations and are obtained in the large N expansion of an ensemble of critical metals with N fermion flavors.},

We explored ligand-protected metal nanoclusters (LPMNCs), which can have strong, stable, and tunable emission, as waveguides. Two alloy LPMNCs, Pt 1 Ag 18 and Au x Ag 19– x (7 ≤ x ≤ 9), were synthesized and structurally determined. Crystals of both exhibited excellent optical waveguide performance, with optical loss coefficients of 5.26 × 10 −3 and 7.77 × 10 −3 decibels per micrometer, respectively, lower than those demonstrated by most inorganic, organic, and hybrid materials. The crystal packing and molecular orientation of the Pt 1 Ag 18 compound led to an extremely high polarization ratio of 0.91. Aggregation enhanced the quantum yields of Pt 1 Ag 18 and Au x Ag 19– x LPMNCs by 115- and 1.5-fold, respectively. This photonic cluster with low loss and high polarization provides a generalizable and versatile platform for active waveguides and polarizable materials.},

Mechanisms for violating ergodicity are of interest for probing nonequilibrium matter and protecting quantum coherence in complex systems. Polyatomic molecules have long served as a platform for probing ergodicity breaking in vibrational energy transport. Here, we report the observation of rotational ergodicity breaking in an unprecedentedly large molecule, 12 C 60 , determined from its icosahedral rovibrational fine structure. The ergodicity breaking occurs well below the vibrational ergodicity threshold and exhibits multiple transitions between ergodic and nonergodic regimes with increasing angular momentum. These peculiar dynamics result from the molecule’s distinctive combination of symmetry, size, and rigidity, highlighting its relevance to emergent phenomena in mesoscopic quantum systems.},

What precludes the DDR machinery from accessing the telomeric double-stranded–single-stranded junction is unknown. We demonstrate that human POT1 binds this junction by recognizing the phosphorylated 5′ end of the chromosome. High-resolution crystallographic structures reveal that the junction is capped by POT1 through a “POT-hole” surface, the mutation of which compromises junction protection in vitro and telomeric 5′-end definition and DDR suppression in human cells. Whereas both mouse POT1 paralogs bind the single-stranded overhang, POT1a, not POT1b, contains a POT-hole and binds the junction, which explains POT1a’s sufficiency for end protection. Our study shifts the paradigm for DDR suppression at telomeres by highlighting the importance of protecting the double-stranded–single-stranded junction.},

Optical waves of complex frequency that exhibit a temporally attenuating behavior have been proposed to offset the intrinsic losses in superlenses through the introduction of virtual gain, but experimental realization has been lacking because of the difficulty of imaging measurements with temporal decay. In this work, we present a multifrequency approach to constructing synthetic excitation waves of complex frequency based on measurements at real frequencies. This approach allows us to implement virtual gain experimentally and observe deep-subwavelength images. Our work offers a practical solution to overcome the intrinsic losses of plasmonic systems for imaging and sensing applications.},

In situ microfluidic tracking enabled us to correlate tubulation to localized defects in the interfacial cell ordering. We demonstrate control over droplet deformation by using confinement to position defects, inducing dimpling in the droplets.

Yet large uncertainties associated with hydroclimatic and socioeconomic changes challenge hydropower planning. In this work, we show that only 40 to 68\% of the candidate hydropower capacity in Africa is economically attractive. By analyzing the African energy systems’ development from 2020 to 2050 for different scenarios of energy demand, land-use change, and climate impacts on water availability, we find that wind and solar outcompete hydropower by 2030. An additional 1.8 to 4\% increase in annual continental investment ensures reliability against future hydroclimatic variability. However, cooperation between countries is needed to overcome the divergent spatial distribution of investment costs and potential energy deficits.},

We identified 169 functionally diverse genes that converge on melanosome biogenesis, endosomal transport, and gene regulation, of which 135 represented previously unknown associations with pigmentation. In agreement with their melanin-promoting function, the majority of screen hits were up-regulated in melanocytes from darkly pigmented individuals. We further unraveled functions of KLF6 as a transcription factor that regulates melanosome maturation and pigmentation in vivo, and of the endosomal trafficking protein COMMD3 in modulating melanosomal pH. Our study reveals a plethora of melanin-promoting genes, with broad implications for human variation, cell biology, and medicine.},

Using unsupervised clustering across all samples, we identified 55 distinct cytosine modules, of which 30 are related to traits such as maximum life span, adult weight, age, sex, and human mortality risk. Maximum life span is associated with methylation levels in HOXL subclass homeobox genes and developmental processes and is potentially regulated by pluripotency transcription factors. The methylation state of some modules responds to perturbations such as caloric restriction, ablation of growth hormone receptors, consumption of high-fat diets, and expression of Yamanaka factors. This study reveals an intertwined evolution of the genome and epigenome that mediates the biological characteristics and traits of different mammalian species.},

We study the potential for Neanderthal-Denisovan admixture using species distribution models that integrate extensive fossil, archaeological, and genetic data with transient coupled general circulation model simulations of global climate and biomes. Our Pleistocene hindcast of past hominins’ habitat suitability reveals pronounced climate-driven zonal shifts in the main overlap region of Denisovans and Neanderthals in central Eurasia. These shifts, which influenced the timing and intensity of potential interbreeding events, can be attributed to the response of climate and vegetation to past variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide and Northern Hemisphere ice-sheet volume. Therefore, glacial-interglacial climate swings likely played an important role in favoring gene flow between archaic humans.},

  abstract     = {The oldest known hominin remains in Europe [~1.5 to ~1.1 million years ago (Ma)] have been recovered from Iberia, where paleoenvironmental reconstructions have indicated warm and wet interglacials and mild glacials, supporting the view that once established, hominin populations persisted continuously. We report analyses of marine and terrestrial proxies from a deep-sea core on the Portugese margin that show the presence of pronounced millennial-scale climate variability during a glacial period ~1.154 to ~1.123 Ma, culminating in a terminal stadial cooling comparable to the most extreme events of the last 400,000 years. Climate envelope–model simulations reveal a drastic decrease in early hominin habitat suitability around the Mediterranean during the terminal stadial. We suggest that these extreme conditions led to the depopulation of Europe, perhaps lasting for several successive glacial-interglacial cycles.},

For transistor-type bioelectronic devices, the semiconductors that need to have direct interfacing with biotissues for effective signal transduction do not adhere well with wet tissues, thereby limiting the stability and conformability at the interface. We report a bioadhesive polymer semiconductor through a double-network structure formed by a bioadhesive brush polymer and a redox-active semiconducting polymer. The resulting semiconducting film can form rapid and strong adhesion with wet tissue surfaces together with high charge-carrier mobility of ~1 square centimeter per volt per second, high stretchability, and good biocompatibility. Further fabrication of a fully bioadhesive transistor sensor enabled us to produce high-quality and stable electrophysiological recordings on an isolated rat heart and in vivo rat muscles.},

However, the moiré pattern is highly sensitive to the interlayer atomic registry, and current assembly techniques suffer from imprecise control of the average twist angle, spatial inhomogeneity in the local twist angle, and distortions caused by random strain. We manipulated the moiré patterns in hetero- and homobilayers through in-plane bending of monolayer ribbons, using the tip of an atomic force microscope. This technique achieves continuous variation of twist angles with improved twist-angle homogeneity and reduced random strain, resulting in moiré patterns with tunable wavelength and ultralow disorder. Our results may enable detailed studies of ultralow-disorder moiré systems and the realization of precise strain-engineered devices.},

  abstract     = {The ratio of carbon assimilation to water evapotranspiration (ET) of an ecosystem, referred to as ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE eco ), is widely expected to increase because of the rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ( C a ). However, little is known about the interactive effects of rising C a and climate change on WUE eco . On the basis of upscaled estimates from machine learning methods and global FLUXNET observations, we show that global WUE eco has not risen since 2001 because of the asymmetric effects of an increased vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which depressed photosynthesis and enhanced ET. An undiminished ET trend indicates that rising temperature and VPD may play a more important role in regulating ET than declining stomatal conductance. Projected increases in VPD are predicted to affect the future coupling of the terrestrial carbon and water cycles.},

The process is applicable to municipal PE and PP wastes and their mixtures. Temperature-gradient thermolysis is the key to controllably degrading PE and PP into waxes and inhibiting the production of small molecules. The waxes are upcycled to fatty acids by oxidation over manganese stearate and subsequent processing. PP ꞵ-scission produces more olefin wax and yields higher acid-number fatty acids than does PE ꞵ-scission. We further convert the fatty acids to high-value, large–market-volume surfactants.

  abstract     = {Waste plastics are an abundant feedstock for the production of renewable chemicals. Pyrolysis of waste plastics produces pyrolysis oils with high concentrations of olefins (&gt;50 weight\%). The traditional petrochemical industry uses several energy-intensive steps to produce olefins from fossil feedstocks such as naphtha, natural gas, and crude oil. In this work, we demonstrate that pyrolysis oil can be used to produce aldehydes through hydroformylation, taking advantage of the olefin functionality. These aldehydes can then be reduced to mono- and dialcohols, oxidized to mono- and dicarboxylic acids, or aminated to mono- and diamines by using homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. This route produces high-value oxygenated chemicals from low-value postconsumer recycled polyethylene. We project that the chemicals produced by this route could lower greenhouse gas emissions ~60\% compared with their production through petroleum feedstocks.},

Through CRISPR-Cas9–based synthetic lethal screens in cancer cells, we identified subunits of the 9-1-1 complex (RAD9A-RAD1-HUS1) and its interacting partner, RHINO, as crucial MMEJ factors. We uncovered an unexpected function for RHINO in restricting MMEJ to mitosis. RHINO accumulates in M phase, undergoes Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) phosphorylation, and interacts with polymerase θ (Polθ), enabling its recruitment to DSBs for subsequent repair. Additionally, we provide evidence that MMEJ activity in mitosis repairs persistent DSBs that originate in S phase. Our findings offer insights into the synthetic lethal relationship between the genes POLQ and BRCA1 and BRAC2 and the synergistic effect of Polθ and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.},

The extreme thinness provides a light-trapping mechanism analogous to a δ-potential well in quantum mechanics and enables the guided waves that are essentially a plane wave freely propagating along the in-plane, but confined along the out-of-plane, direction of the waveguide. We further demonstrate key functionalities essential for two-dimensional photonics, including refraction, focusing, grating, interconnection, and intensity modulation, by integrating thin-film optical components with δ waveguides using microfabricated dielectric, metal, or patterned MoS 2 .},

Extinction rates, already far exceeding the global average for mammals, are predicted to escalate across all taxa, and ecosystems are collapsing. These losses are symptomatic of shortcomings in resourcing, law, policy, and management. Informed by examples of advances in conservation practice from invasive species control, Indigenous land management, and citizen science, we describe interventions needed to enhance future resilience.

One of the highest concentrations of close relatives is in Maryland, suggesting that descendants of the Catoctin individuals remain in the area. We find that many of the Catoctin individuals derived African ancestry from the Wolof or Kongo groups and European ancestry from Great Britain and Ireland.

We developed an enzyme activity–screening platform to investigate how gut microbiota–derived enzymes might influence host physiology. We discovered that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is expressed by specific bacterial taxa of the microbiota. Microbial DPP4 was able to decrease the active glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and disrupt glucose metabolism in mice with a leaky gut. Furthermore, the current drugs targeting human DPP4, including sitagliptin, had little effect on microbial DPP4. Using high-throughput screening, we identified daurisoline-d4 (Dau-d4) as a selective microbial DPP4 inhibitor that improves glucose tolerance in diabetic mice.},

Although the field came of age in the past 5 years, it still suffers from some growing pains: barriers to entry, robustness, unclear best practices for experimental design and analysis, and lack of standardization. In this Review, we present a systematic catalog of the different families of spatial omics technologies; highlight their principles, power, and limitations; and give some perspective and suggestions on the biggest challenges that lay ahead in this incredibly powerful—but still hard to navigate—landscape.},

In this work, we find that direct interactions between the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of both the γc and the interleukin receptors (ILRs) are also required for receptor activation. Moreover, the same γc TMD can specifically recognize multiple ILR TMDs of diverse sequences within the family. Heterodimer structures of γc TMD bound to IL-7 and IL-9 receptor TMDs—determined in a lipid bilayer–like environment by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy—reveal a conserved knob-into-hole mechanism of recognition that mediates receptor sharing within the membrane. Thus, signaling in the γc receptor family requires specific heterotypic interactions of the TMDs.},

  abstract     = {For species to coexist, performance must decline as the density of conspecific individuals increases. Although evidence for such conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) exists in forests, the within-species spatial repulsion it should produce has rarely been demonstrated in adults. In this study, we show that in comparison to a null model of stochastic birth, death, and limited dispersal, the adults of dozens of tropical forest tree species show strong spatial repulsion, some to surprising distances of approximately 100 meters. We used simulations to show that such strong repulsion can only occur if CNDD considerably exceeds heterospecific negative density dependence—an even stronger condition required for coexistence—and that large-scale repulsion can indeed result from small-scale CNDD. These results demonstrate substantial niche differences between species that may stabilize species diversity.},

  abstract     = {Hafnium oxide–based ferroelectric materials are promising candidates for next-generation nanoscale devices because of their ability to integrate into silicon electronics. However, the intrinsic high coercive field of the fluorite-structure oxide ferroelectric devices leads to incompatible operating voltage and limited endurance performance. We discovered a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)–compatible rhombohedral ferroelectric Hf(Zr) 1+ x O 2 material rich in hafnium-zirconium [Hf(Zr)]. X-ray diffraction combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals that the excess Hf(Zr) atoms intercalate within the hollow sites. We found that the intercalated atoms expand the lattice and increase the in-plane and out-of-plane stresses, which stabilize both the rhombohedral phase (r-phase) and its ferroelectric properties. Our ferroelectric devices, which are based on the r-phase Hf(Zr) 1+ x O 2 , exhibit an ultralow coercive field (~0.65 megavolts per centimeter). Moreover, we achieved a high endurance of more than 10 12 cycles at saturation polarization. This material discovery may help to realize low-cost and long-life memory chips.},

  abstract     = {Seismic tremor signals, also known as long-period, long-duration signals, have been reported in several locations where fluid injection for enhanced oil and gas exploration is taking place. However, the origin of these signals remains poorly constrained. We studied seismic tremor signals in Wellington Field, Kansas, using a seismic array during a carbon dioxide injection program. We show that these signals are generated below the surface during the time of carbon dioxide injection. They have a distinct spectral signature, similar to those observed in glacial and volcanic environments. The tremor sources are located near the injection site and aligned with preexisting faults. Modeling results imply that such tremors are generated by frictional slip on fault. These observations may reveal an important deformation mode, which is useful for studying associated stress, seismicity, and triggering, as well as for tracking fault activities during injection operations of all fluids, including supercritical carbon dioxide.},

The most prolific technique for their synthesis is the metal-catalyzed reaction of an alkene with a diazoalkane, a highly energetic reagent requiring stringent safety precautions. Discovery of alternative innocuous reagents remains an ongoing challenge. Herein, we report a simple photoredox-catalyzed intermolecular cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes with active methylene compounds. The reaction proceeds in neutral solvent under air or dioxygen (O 2 ) with a photoredox catalyst excited by blue light-emitting diode light and an iodine co-catalyst that is either added as molecular iodine or generated in situ from alkyl iodides. Mechanistic investigations indicate that photosensitized O 2 plays a vital role in the generation of carbon-centered radicals for both the addition of active methylene compounds to alkenes and the ring closure.},

However, their usage in emerging wearable electronics is limited by inelastic deformation. We developed intrinsically elastic ferroelectrics by combining ferroelectric response and elastic resilience into one material by slight cross-linking of plastic ferroelectric polymers. The precise slight cross-linking can realize the complex balance between crystallinity and resilience. Thus, we obtained an elastic ferroelectric with a stable ferroelectric response under mechanical deformation up to 70\% strain. This elastic ferroelectric exerts potentials in applications related to wearable electronics, such as elastic ferroelectric sensors, information storage, and energy transduction.},

We describe the properties of a naturally occurring, non–genetically modified symbiotic bacterium, Delftia tsuruhatensis TC1, which was isolated from mosquitoes incapable of sustaining the development of Plasmodium falciparum parasites. D. tsuruhatensis TC1 inhibits early stages of Plasmodium development and subsequent transmission by the Anopheles mosquito through secretion of a small-molecule inhibitor. We have identified this inhibitor to be the hydrophobic molecule harmane. We also found that, on mosquito contact, harmane penetrates the cuticle, inhibiting Plasmodium development. D. tsuruhatensis TC1 stably populates the mosquito gut, does not impose a fitness cost on the mosquito, and inhibits Plasmodium development for the mosquito’s life. Contained field studies in Burkina Faso and modeling showed that D. tsuruhatensis TC1 has the potential to complement mosquito-targeted malaria transmission control.},

X-ray photocrystallographic analysis of the Rh-dioxazolone complex allowed structural elucidation of the targeted Rh-acylnitrenoid and provided firm evidence that the singlet nitrenoid species is primarily responsible for acylamino transfer reactions.

Considering that microenvironment variations may reveal rules governing intratumoral cellular programs and disease outcome, we focused on tumor-to-tumor variation to examine 52 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. We found that macrophage polarity—defined by CXCL9 and SPP1 (CS) expression but not by conventional M1 and M2 markers—had a noticeably strong prognostic association. CS macrophage polarity also identified a highly coordinated network of either pro- or antitumor variables, which involved each tumor-associated cell type and was spatially organized. We extended these findings to other cancer indications. Overall, these results suggest that, despite their complexity, TMEs coordinate coherent responses that control human cancers and for which CS macrophage polarity is a relevant yet simple variable.},

On the basis of structural analysis, we hypothesized that human STING is a proton channel. Indeed, we found that STING activation induced a pH increase in the Golgi and that STING reconstituted in liposomes enabled transmembrane proton transport. Compound 53 (C53), a STING agonist that binds the putative channel interface, blocked STING-induced proton flux in the Golgi and in liposomes. STING-induced LC3B lipidation and inflammasome activation were also inhibited by C53, suggesting that STING’s channel activity is critical for these two processes. Thus, STING’s interferon-induction function can be decoupled from its roles in LC3B lipidation and inflammasome activation.},

We have found that peptide YY (PYY 1-36 ), but not endocrine PYY 3-36 , acts as an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expressed by gut epithelial paneth cells (PC). PC-PYY is packaged into secretory granules and is secreted into and retained by surface mucus, which optimizes PC-PYY activity. Although PC-PYY shows some antibacterial activity, it displays selective antifungal activity against virulent Candida albicans hyphae—but not the yeast form. PC-PYY is a cationic molecule that interacts with the anionic surfaces of fungal hyphae to cause membrane disruption and transcriptional reprogramming that selects for the yeast phenotype. Hence, PC-PYY is an antifungal AMP that contributes to the maintenance of gut fungal commensalism.},

Although both GmNSP1 and GmNIN are marker genes of the nodulation pathway, this created an error in follow-up research and affected some of the panels in Fig. 5, associated supplementary figures, and a supplementary table. In the corrected version, the gene name GmNIN in the original figures has been replaced with GmNSP1, and the GmNIN (Glyma.02g311000)–related results have been added in the updated Fig 5 (A, B, C, and E) and figs. S9, S10, S12, and S14. The affected figure legends and table S1 have also been revised. In the nodulation pathway, GmNSP1, GmNIN, NF-YA1, and NF-YB1 are marker genes that are responsible for nodule initiation, and their expression levels are induced by rhizobium infection. The updated data still support the original conclusion that GmSTF3–GmFT2a transcriptional complex activates expression of key transcriptional factors (GmNSP1, GmNIN, NF-YA1, and NF-YB1) in the nodulation pathway. Therefore, these corrections do not change the conclusion of the study.},

This large dataset of coevolved complexes drove a systems-level analysis of molecular recognition between Z domain–affibody pairs spanning a wide range of structures, affinities, cross-reactivities, and orthogonalities, and captured a broad spectrum of coevolutionary networks. Furthermore, we harnessed pretrained protein language models to expand, in silico, the amino acid diversity of our coevolution screen, predicting remodeled interfaces beyond the reach of the experimental library. The integration of these approaches provides a means of simulating protein coevolution and generating protein complexes with diverse molecular recognition properties for biotechnology and synthetic biology.},

  abstract     = {Aggregation of tau into filamentous inclusions underlies Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and numerous other neurodegenerative tauopathies. The pathogenesis of tauopathies remains unclear, which impedes the development of disease-modifying treatments. Here, by systematically analyzing human tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, we identified a few TRIMs that could potently inhibit tau aggregation. Among them, TRIM11 was markedly down-regulated in AD brains. TRIM11 promoted the proteasomal degradation of mutant tau as well as superfluous normal tau. It also enhanced tau solubility by acting as both a molecular chaperone to prevent tau misfolding and a disaggregase to dissolve preformed tau fibrils. TRIM11 maintained the connectivity and viability of neurons. Intracranial delivery of TRIM11 through adeno-associated viruses ameliorated pathology, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments in multiple animal models of tauopathies. These results suggest that TRIM11 down-regulation contributes to the pathogenesis of tauopathies and that restoring TRIM11 expression may represent an effective therapeutic strategy.},

Ancestry-enabled phylogenetic analysis of this dataset indicates that few ancient languages are direct ancestors of modern clades and produces a root age of ~8120 yr B.P. for the family. Although this date is not consistent with the Steppe hypothesis, it does not rule out an initial homeland south of the Caucasus, with a subsequent branch northward onto the steppe and then across Europe. We reconcile this hybrid hypothesis with recently published ancient DNA evidence from the steppe and the northern Fertile Crescent.},

Using engineered PLP enzymes, either enantiomeric product could be produced in a biocatalyst-controlled fashion.

Diseased HSCs can be replaced with gene-engineered or healthy HSCs through HSC transplantation (HSCT). However, current protocols carry major side effects and have limited access. We developed CD117/LNP–messenger RNA (mRNA), a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that encapsulates mRNA and is targeted to the stem cell factor receptor (CD117) on HSCs. Delivery of the anti–human CD117/LNP–based editing system yielded near-complete correction of hematopoietic sickle cells. Furthermore, in vivo delivery of pro-apoptotic PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis) mRNA with CD117/LNP affected HSC function and permitted nongenotoxic conditioning for HSCT. The ability to target HSCs in vivo offers a nongenotoxic conditioning regimen for HSCT, and this platform could be the basis of in vivo genome editing to cure genetic disorders, which would abrogate the need for HSCT.},

  abstract     = {A defining property of human language is the creative use of words to express multiple meanings through word meaning extension. Such lexical creativity is manifested at different timescales, ranging from language development in children to the evolution of word meanings over history. We explored whether different manifestations of lexical creativity build on a common foundation. Using computational models, we show that a parsimonious set of semantic knowledge types characterize developmental data as well as evolutionary products of meaning extension spanning over 1400 languages. Models for evolutionary data account very well for developmental data, and vice versa. These findings suggest a unified foundation for human lexical creativity underlying both the fleeting products of individual ontogeny and the evolutionary products of phylogeny across languages.},

  abstract     = {The Hall effect, which originates from the motion of charged particles in magnetic fields, has deep consequences for the description of materials, extending far beyond condensed matter. Understanding such an effect in interacting systems represents a fundamental challenge, even for small magnetic fields. In this work, we used an atomic quantum simulator in which we tracked the motion of ultracold fermions in two-leg ribbons threaded by artificial magnetic fields. Through controllable quench dynamics, we measured the Hall response for a range of synthetic tunneling and atomic interaction strengths. We unveil a universal interaction-independent behavior above an interaction threshold, in agreement with theoretical analyses. The ability to reach hard-to-compute regimes demonstrates the power of quantum simulation to describe strongly correlated topological states of matter.},

  abstract     = {Canonically, each Purkinje cell (PC) in the adult cerebellum receives only one climbing fiber (CF) from the inferior olive. Underlying current theories of cerebellar function is the notion that this highly conserved one-to-one relationship renders Purkinje dendrites into a single computational compartment. However, we discovered that multiple primary dendrites are a near-universal morphological feature in humans. Using tract tracing, immunolabeling, and in vitro electrophysiology, we found that in mice ~25\% of mature multibranched cells receive more than one CF input. Two-photon calcium imaging in vivo revealed that separate dendrites can exhibit distinct response properties to sensory stimulation, indicating that some multibranched cells integrate functionally independent CF-receptive fields. These findings indicate that PCs are morphologically and functionally more diverse than previously thought.},

  abstract     = {Brittle materials fail by means of rapid cracks. Classical fracture mechanics describes the motion of tensile cracks that dissipate released elastic energy within a point-like zone at their tips. Within this framework, a “classical” tensile crack cannot exceed the Rayleigh wave speed, c R . Using brittle neo-hookean materials, we experimentally demonstrate the existence of “supershear” tensile cracks that exceed shear wave speeds, c R . Supershear cracks smoothly accelerate beyond c R , to speeds that could approach dilatation wave speeds. Supershear dynamics are governed by different principles than those guiding “classical” cracks; this fracture mode is excited at critical (material dependent) applied strains. This nonclassical mode of tensile fracture represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of the fracture process.},

Further, we observe that removing reshared content produces clear decreases in news knowledge within the sample, although there is some uncertainty about how this would generalize to all users.

We show that (i) ideological segregation is high and increases as we shift from potential exposure to actual exposure to engagement; (ii) there is an asymmetry between conservative and liberal audiences, with a substantial corner of the news ecosystem consumed exclusively by conservatives; and (iii) most misinformation, as identified by Meta’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program, exists within this homogeneously conservative corner, which has no equivalent on the liberal side.

Using mutations affecting the two Diptericins ( Dpt ) of Drosophila melanogaster , we reveal the specific role of DptA for the pathogen Providencia rettgeri and DptB for the gut mutualist Acetobacter . The presence of DptA- or DptB- like genes across Diptera correlates with the presence of Providencia and Acetobacter in their environment. Moreover, DptA- and DptB- like sequences predict host resistance against infection by these bacteria across the genus Drosophila . Our study explains the evolutionary logic behind the bursts of rapid evolution of an antimicrobial peptide family and reveals how the host immune repertoire adapts to changing microbial environments.},

Structural equation modeling suggested that limb proportions exhibited strong genetic sharing but were independent of width and torso proportions. Polygenic score analysis identified specific associations between osteoarthritis and hip and knee SPs. In contrast to other traits, SP loci were enriched in human accelerated regions and in regulatory elements of genes that are differentially expressed between humans and great apes. Combined, our work identifies specific genetic variants that affect the skeletal form and ties a major evolutionary facet of human anatomical change to pathogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the mechanisms that maintain microbial biodiversity is a critical aspiration in ecology. Past work on microbial coexistence has largely focused on species pairs, but it is unclear whether pairwise coexistence in isolation is required for coexistence in a multispecies community. To address this question, we conducted hundreds of pairwise competition experiments among the stably coexisting members of 12 different enrichment communities in vitro. To determine the outcomes of these experiments, we developed an automated image analysis pipeline to quantify species abundances. We found that competitive exclusion was the most common outcome, and it was strongly hierarchical and transitive. Because many species that coexist within a stable multispecies community fail to coexist in pairwise co-culture under identical conditions, we concluded that multispecies coexistence is an emergent phenomenon. This work highlights the importance of community context for understanding the origins of coexistence in complex ecosystems.},

We find that six of the eight largest English Omicron lineages were already transmitting when Omicron was first reported in southern Africa (22 November 2021). Multiple datasets show that importation of Omicron continued despite subsequent restrictions on travel from southern Africa as a result of export from well-connected secondary locations. Initiation and dispersal of Omicron transmission lineages in England was a two-stage process that can be explained by models of the country’s human geography and hierarchical travel network. Our results enable a comparison of the processes that drive the invasion of Omicron and other VOCs across multiple spatial scales.},

Here we report that subglacial sediment from the Camp Century ice core preserves direct evidence that northwestern Greenland was ice free during the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 interglacial. Luminescence dating shows that sediment just beneath the ice sheet was deposited by flowing water in an ice-free environment 416 ± 38 thousand years ago. Provenance analyses and cosmogenic nuclide data and calculations suggest the sediment was reworked from local materials and exposed at the surface &lt;16 thousand years before deposition. Ice sheet modeling indicates that ice-free conditions at Camp Century require at least 1.4 meters of sea level equivalent contribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet.},

At zero electric field, we observed a correlated ferromagnetic insulator near one hole per moiré unit cell with a widely tunable Curie temperature up to 14 K. Applying an electric field switched the system into a half-filled triangular lattice with antiferromagnetic interactions; further doping this layer-polarized superlattice tuned the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction back to ferromagnetic.

  abstract     = {Unlike other chromatin remodelers, INO80 preferentially mobilizes hexasomes, which can form during transcription. Why INO80 prefers hexasomes over nucleosomes remains unclear. Here, we report structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae INO80 bound to a hexasome or a nucleosome. INO80 binds the two substrates in substantially different orientations. On a hexasome, INO80 places its ATPase subunit, Ino80, at superhelical location –2 (SHL –2), in contrast to SHL –6 and SHL –7, as previously seen on nucleosomes. Our results suggest that INO80 action on hexasomes resembles action by other remodelers on nucleosomes such that Ino80 is maximally active near SHL –2. The SHL –2 position also plays a critical role for nucleosome remodeling by INO80. Overall, the mechanistic adaptations used by INO80 for preferential hexasome sliding imply that subnucleosomal particles play considerable regulatory roles.},

In this work, we report the structural mechanism for adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent chromatin remodeling of hexasomes by the INO80 complex. We show how INO80 recognizes noncanonical DNA and histone features of hexasomes that emerge from the loss of H2A–H2B. A large structural rearrangement switches the catalytic core of INO80 into a distinct, spin-rotated mode of remodeling while its nuclear actin module remains tethered to long stretches of unwrapped linker DNA. Direct sensing of an exposed H3–H4 histone interface activates INO80, independently of the H2A–H2B acidic patch. Our findings reveal how the loss of H2A–H2B grants remodelers access to a different, yet unexplored layer of energy-driven chromatin regulation.},

  abstract     = {All fluorochemicals—including elemental fluorine and nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical fluorinating reagents—are prepared from hydrogen fluoride (HF). This highly toxic and corrosive gas is produced by the reaction of acid-grade fluorspar (&gt;97\% CaF 2 ) with sulfuric acid under harsh conditions. The use of fluorspar to produce fluorochemicals via a process that bypasses HF is highly desirable but remains an unsolved problem because of the prohibitive insolubility of CaF 2 . Inspired by calcium phosphate biomineralization, we herein disclose a protocol of treating acid-grade fluorspar with dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K 2 HPO 4 ) under mechanochemical conditions. The process affords a solid composed of crystalline K 3 (HPO 4 )F and K 2− x Ca y (PO 3 F) a (PO 4 ) b , which is found suitable for forging sulfur-fluorine and carbon-fluorine bonds.},

  abstract     = {The existence of an observable precursory phase of slip on the fault before large earthquakes has been debated for decades. Although observations preceding several large earthquakes have been proposed as possible indicators of precursory slip, these observations do not directly precede earthquakes, are not seen before most events, and are also commonly observed without being followed by earthquakes. We conducted a global search for short-term precursory slip in GPS data. We summed the displacements measured by 3026 high-rate GPS time series—projected onto the directions expected from precursory slip at the hypocenter—during 48 hours before 90 (moment magnitude ≥7) earthquakes. Our approach reveals a ≈2-hour-long exponential acceleration of slip before the ruptures, suggesting that large earthquakes start with a precursory phase of slip, which improvements in measurement precision and density could more effectively detect and possibly monitor.},

We report an in situ photocatalytically enhanced redox reaction that generates hydrogen and oxygen to realize a continuous concentration gradient of redox ions in thermogalvanic devices. A linear relation between thermopower and hydrogen production rate was established as an essential design principle for devices. The system exhibited a thermopower of 8.2 millivolts per kelvin and a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of up to 0.4\%. A large-area generator (112 square centimeters) consisting of 36 units yielded an open-circuit voltage of 4.4 volts and a power of 20.1 milliwatts, as well 0.5 millimoles of hydrogen and 0.2 millimoles of oxygen after 6 hours of outdoor operation.},

  abstract     = {Disruption of the physiologic sleep-wake cycle and low melatonin levels frequently accompany cardiac disease, yet the underlying mechanism has remained enigmatic. Immunostaining of sympathetic axons in optically cleared pineal glands from humans and mice with cardiac disease revealed their substantial denervation compared with controls. Spatial, single-cell, nuclear, and bulk RNA sequencing traced this defect back to the superior cervical ganglia (SCG), which responded to cardiac disease with accumulation of inflammatory macrophages, fibrosis, and the selective loss of pineal gland–innervating neurons. Depletion of macrophages in the SCG prevented disease-associated denervation of the pineal gland and restored physiological melatonin secretion. Our data identify the mechanism by which diurnal rhythmicity in cardiac disease is disturbed and suggest a target for therapeutic intervention.},

Using single-particle electron cryo–microscopy, we demonstrate that protein E bridges two bacterial proteins to form the transmembrane YES complex [MraY, protein E, sensitivity to lysis D (SlyD)]. Protein E inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis by obstructing the MraY active site leading to loss of lipid I production. We experimentally validate this result for two different viral species, providing a clear model for bacterial lysis and unifying previous experimental data. Additionally, we characterize the Escherichia coli MraY structure—revealing features of this essential enzyme—and the structure of the chaperone SlyD bound to a protein.

  abstract     = {Methylations on nucleosomal histones play fundamental roles in regulating eukaryotic transcription. Jumonji C domain–containing histone demethylases (JMJs) dynamically control the level of histone methylations. However, how JMJ activity is generally regulated is unknown. We found that the tricarboxylic acid cycle–associated enzyme α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) dehydrogenase (KGDH) entered the nucleus, where it interacted with various JMJs to regulate α-KG–dependent histone demethylations by JMJs, and thus controlled genome-wide gene expression in plants. We show that nuclear targeting is regulated by environmental signals and that KGDH is enriched at thousands of loci in Arabidopsis thaliana . Chromatin-bound KGDH catalyzes α-KG decarboxylation and thus may limit its local availability to KGDH-coupled JMJs, inhibiting histone demethylation. Thus, our results uncover a regulatory mechanism for histone demethylations by JMJs.},

Single-cell transcriptomes from HOMER mouse atria recapitulated cell composition and transcriptome changes observed in patients. Inhibiting monocyte migration reduced arrhythmia in Ccr2 −∕− HOMER mice. Cell-cell interaction analysis identified SPP1 as a pleiotropic signal that promotes atrial fibrillation through cross-talk with local immune and stromal cells. Deleting Spp1 reduced atrial fibrillation in HOMER mice. These results identify SPP1 + macrophages as targets for immunotherapy in atrial fibrillation.},

The microscopic mechanism of this trend remains elusive. In this study, we used advanced electron microscopy to image the atomic structure of cuprates in the Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca n -1 Cu n O 2 n +4+δ family with 1 ≤ n ≤ 9; the evolution of the charge-transfer gap size (Δ) with n can be measured simultaneously. We determined that the n dependence of Δ follows an inverted bell-shaped curve with the minimum Δ value at n = 3. The correlation between Δ, n , and T c,max may clarify the origin of superconductivity in cuprates.},

We demonstrate a multichip multidimensional quantum entanglement network based on mass-manufacturable integrated-nanophotonic quantum node chips fabricated on a silicon wafer by means of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor processes. Using hybrid multiplexing, we show that multiple multidimensional entangled states can be distributed across multiple chips connected by few-mode fibers.

By assessing every possible combination of 69,123 multigenic editing strategies for 21 lignin biosynthesis genes, we deduced seven different genome editing strategies targeting the concurrent alteration of up to six genes and produced 174 edited poplar variants. CRISPR editing increased the wood carbohydrate-to-lignin ratio up to 228\% that of wild type, leading to more-efficient fiber pulping. The edited wood alleviates a major fiber-production bottleneck regardless of changes in tree growth rate and could bring unprecedented operational efficiencies, bioeconomic opportunities, and environmental benefits.},

However, as the field continues to seek ever-higher durability, additional tools that avoid progressive ligand intercalation are needed to minimize degradation at high temperatures. We used ammonium ligands that are nonreactive with the bulk of perovskites and investigated a library that varies ligand molecular structure systematically. We found that fluorinated aniliniums offer interfacial passivation and simultaneously minimize reactivity with perovskites. Using this approach, we report a certified quasi–steady-state power-conversion efficiency of 24.09\% for inverted-structure PSCs.

Many potential applications of randomness rely on controllable probability distributions. We show that vacuum-level bias fields injected into multistable optical systems enable a controllable source of quantum randomness, and we demonstrated this concept in an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). By injecting bias pulses with less than one photon on average, we controlled the probabilities of the two possible OPO output states. The potential of our approach for sensing sub–photon-level fields was demonstrated by reconstructing the temporal shape of fields below the single-photon level. Our results provide a platform to study quantum dynamics in nonlinear driven-dissipative systems and point toward applications in probabilistic computing and weak field sensing.},

Repression is mediated by specialized transcription factors (TFs) that recruit co-repressors (CoRs) to silence transcription, even in the presence of activating cues. However, whether CoRs can dominantly silence all enhancers or display distinct specificities is unclear. In this work, we report that most enhancers in Drosophila can be repressed by only a subset of CoRs, and enhancers classified by CoR sensitivity show distinct chromatin features, function, TF motifs, and binding. Distinct TF motifs render enhancers more resistant or sensitive to specific CoRs, as we demonstrate by motif mutagenesis and addition. These CoR-enhancer compatibilities constitute an additional layer of regulatory specificity that allows differential regulation at close genomic distances and is indicative of distinct mechanisms of transcriptional repression.},

We report on the realization of quantum vortices of photons that result from a strong photon-photon interaction in a quantum nonlinear optical medium. The interaction causes faster phase accumulation for copropagating photons, producing a quantum vortex-antivortex pair within the two-photon wave function. For three photons, the formation of vortex lines and a central vortex ring confirms the existence of a genuine three-photon interaction. The wave function topology, governed by two- and three-photon bound states, imposes a conditional phase shift of π per photon, a potential resource for deterministic quantum logic operations.},

  abstract     = {Despite advances in molecular biology, genetics, computation, and medicinal chemistry, infectious disease remains an ominous threat to public health. Addressing the challenges posed by pathogen outbreaks, pandemics, and antimicrobial resistance will require concerted interdisciplinary efforts. In conjunction with systems and synthetic biology, artificial intelligence (AI) is now leading to rapid progress, expanding anti-infective drug discovery, enhancing our understanding of infection biology, and accelerating the development of diagnostics. In this Review, we discuss approaches for detecting, treating, and understanding infectious diseases, underscoring the progress supported by AI in each case. We suggest future applications of AI and how it might be harnessed to help control infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics.},

Here, we report a series of cryo–electron microscopy structures of human nucleolar and nuclear pre-60 S assembly intermediates at resolutions of 2.5 to 3.2 angstroms. These structures show how protein interaction hubs tether assembly factor complexes to nucleolar particles and how guanosine triphosphatases and adenosine triphosphatase couple irreversible nucleotide hydrolysis steps to the installation of functional centers. Nuclear stages highlight how a conserved RNA-processing complex, the rixosome, couples large-scale RNA conformational changes with pre–ribosomal RNA processing by the RNA degradation machinery. Our ensemble of human pre-60 S particles provides a rich foundation with which to elucidate the molecular principles of ribosome formation.},

The mechanism of information transfer from gRNA to mRNA is unclear owing to a lack of high-resolution structures for these complexes. With cryo–electron microscopy and functional studies, we have captured gRNA-stabilizing RESC-A and gRNA-mRNA–binding RESC-B and RESC-C particles. RESC-A sequesters gRNA termini, thus promoting hairpin formation and blocking mRNA access. The conversion of RESC-A into RESC-B or -C unfolds gRNA and allows mRNA selection. The ensuing gRNA-mRNA duplex protrudes from RESC-B, likely exposing editing sites to RECC-catalyzed cleavage, uridine insertion or deletion, and ligation. Our work reveals a remodeling event facilitating gRNA-mRNA hybridization and assembly of a macromolecular substrate for the editosome’s catalytic modality.},

Using satellite, ground, carbon flux, and experimental data, we show that early-season and late-season warming have opposite effects on leaf senescence, with a reversal occurring after the year’s longest day (the summer solstice). Across 84\% of the northern forest area, increased temperature and vegetation activity before the solstice led to an earlier senescence onset of, on average, 1.9 ± 0.1 days per °C, whereas warmer post-solstice temperatures extended senescence duration by 2.6 ± 0.1 days per °C. The current trajectories toward an earlier onset and slowed progression of senescence affect Northern Hemisphere–wide trends in growing-season length and forest productivity.},

Although chromatin is notably reprogrammed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA), the organization of chromatin regulatory factors during this universal process remains unclear. In this work, we developed chromatin expansion microscopy (ChromExM) to visualize chromatin, transcription, and transcription factors in vivo. ChromExM of embryos during ZGA revealed how the pioneer factor Nanog interacts with nucleosomes and RNA polymerase II (Pol II), providing direct visualization of transcriptional elongation as string-like nanostructures. Blocking elongation led to more Pol II particles clustered around Nanog, with Pol II stalled at promoters and Nanog-bound enhancers. This led to a new model termed &quot;kiss and kick&quot;, in which enhancer–promoter contacts are transient and released by transcriptional elongation. Our results demonstrate that ChromExM is broadly applicable to study nanoscale nuclear organization.},

Here, analysis of more than 20,000 vertebrate species with a model of geoclimate and biological diversification shows that broad precipitation tolerance and dispersal ability were key for exchange across the deep-time precipitation gradient spanning the region. Sundanian (Southeast Asian) lineages evolved in a climate similar to the humid “stepping stones” of Wallacea, facilitating colonization of the Sahulian (Australian) continental shelf. By contrast, Sahulian lineages predominantly evolved in drier conditions, hampering establishment in Sunda and shaping faunal distinctiveness. We demonstrate how the history of adaptation to past environmental conditions shapes asymmetrical colonization and global biogeographic structure.},

It features a crossover between Bose-Einstein condensation of tightly bound pairs and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluidity of long-range Cooper pairs, and a “pseudo-gap” region where pairs form above the superfluid critical temperature. We directly observe the nonlocal nature of fermion pairing in a Hubbard lattice gas, using spin- and density-resolved imaging of ∼ 1000 fermionic potassium-40 atoms under a bilayer microscope. Complete fermion pairing is revealed by the vanishing of global spin fluctuations with increasing attraction. In the strongly correlated regime, the fermion pair size is found to be on the order of the average interparticle spacing. Our study informs theories of pseudo-gap behavior in strongly correlated fermion systems.},

In metazoans, preferential inheritance of fate determinants into one daughter cell frequently depends on polarity-cytoskeleton interactions. Despite the prevalence of asymmetric divisions throughout plant development, evidence for analogous mechanisms that segregate fate determinants remains elusive. Here, we describe a mechanism in the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis that ensures unequal inheritance of a fate-enforcing polarity domain. By defining a cortical region depleted of stable microtubules, the polarity domain limits possible division orientations. Accordingly, uncoupling the polarity domain from microtubule organization during mitosis leads to aberrant division planes and accompanying cell identity defects. Our data highlight how a common biological module, coupling polarity to fate segregation through the cytoskeleton, can be reconfigured to accommodate unique features of plant development.},

However, the underlying mechanisms of transfer and their impact on genome evolution are still poorly understood. While studying the evolutionary origin of a selfish element in the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae , we discovered that Mavericks , ancient virus-like transposons related to giant viruses and virophages, are one of the long-sought vectors of horizontal gene transfer. We found that Mavericks gained a novel herpesvirus-like fusogen in nematodes, leading to the widespread exchange of cargo genes between extremely divergent species, bypassing sexual and genetic barriers spanning hundreds of millions of years. Our results show how the union between viruses and transposons causes horizontal gene transfer and ultimately genetic incompatibilities in natural populations.},

Here, we report the development of ribosome-bound mRNA mapping (RIBOmap), a highly multiplexed three-dimensional in situ profiling method to detect cellular translatome. RIBOmap profiling of 981 genes in HeLa cells revealed cell cycle–dependent translational control and colocalized translation of functional gene modules. We mapped 5413 genes in mouse brain tissues, yielding spatially resolved single-cell translatomic profiles for 119,173 cells and revealing cell type–specific and brain region–specific translational regulation, including translation remodeling during oligodendrocyte maturation. Our method detected widespread patterns of localized translation in neuronal and glial cells in intact brain tissue networks.},

  abstract     = {Some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have a tera–electron volt (TeV) afterglow, but the early onset of this has not been observed. We report observations with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) of the bright GRB 221009A, which serendipitously occurred within the instrument’s field of view. More than 64,000 photons &gt;0.2 TeV were detected within the first 3000 seconds. The TeV flux began several minutes after the GRB trigger and then rose to a peak ~10 seconds later. This was followed by a decay phase, which became more rapid ~650 seconds after the peak. We interpret the emission using a model of a relativistic jet with half-opening angle of ~0.8°. This is consistent with the core of a structured jet and could explain the high isotropic energy of this GRB.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal assembly into chiral superstructures is usually accomplished with templating or lithographic patterning methods that are only applicable to materials with specific compositions and morphologies over narrow size ranges. Here, chiral superstructures can be rapidly formed by magnetically assembling materials of any chemical compositions at all scales, from molecules to nano- and microstructures. We show that a quadrupole field chirality is generated by permanent magnets caused by consistent field rotation in space. Applying the chiral field to magnetic nanoparticles produces long-range chiral superstructures controlled by field strength at the samples and orientation of the magnets. Transferring the chirality to any achiral molecules is enabled by incorporating guest molecules such as metals, polymers, oxides, semiconductors, dyes, and fluorophores into the magnetic nanostructures.},

  abstract     = {Quantum scrambling describes the spreading of information into many degrees of freedom in quantum systems, such that the information is no longer accessible locally but becomes distributed throughout the system. This idea can explain how quantum systems become classical and acquire a finite temperature, or how in black holes the information about the matter falling in is seemingly erased. We probe the exponential scrambling of a multiparticle system near a bistable point in phase space and utilize it for entanglement-enhanced metrology. A time-reversal protocol is used to observe a simultaneous exponential growth of both the metrological gain and the out-of-time-order correlator, thereby experimentally verifying the relation between quantum metrology and quantum information scrambling. Our results show that rapid scrambling dynamics capable of exponentially fast entanglement generation are useful for practical metrology, resulting in a 6.8(4)-decibel gain beyond the standard quantum limit.},

  abstract     = {Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity is stimulated to promote metabolic adaptation upon energy stress. However, sustained metabolic stress may cause cell death. The mechanisms by which AMPK dictates cell death are not fully understood. We report that metabolic stress promoted receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) activation mediated by TRAIL receptors, whereas AMPK inhibited RIPK1 by phosphorylation at Ser 415 to suppress energy stress–induced cell death. Inhibiting pS415-RIPK1 by Ampk deficiency or RIPK1 S415A mutation promoted RIPK1 activation. Furthermore, genetic inactivation of RIPK1 protected against ischemic injury in myeloid Ampkα1 -deficient mice. Our studies reveal that AMPK phosphorylation of RIPK1 represents a crucial metabolic checkpoint, which dictates cell fate response to metabolic stress, and highlight a previously unappreciated role for the AMPK-RIPK1 axis in integrating metabolism, cell death, and inflammation.},

Lately, the rise of two-dimensional moiré superlattices with highly tunable periodic potentials provides a possible pathway. Here, we experimentally demonstrate this capability through the spectroscopic evidence of Rydberg moiré excitons (X RM ), which are moiré-trapped Rydberg excitons in monolayer semiconductor tungsten diselenide adjacent to twisted bilayer graphene. In the strong coupling regime, the X RM manifest as multiple energy splittings, pronounced red shift, and narrowed linewidth in the reflectance spectra, highlighting their charge-transfer character wherein electron–hole separation is enforced by strongly asymmetric interlayer Coulomb interactions. Our findings establish the excitonic Rydberg states as candidates for exploitation in quantum technologies.},

It has been suggested that sublimation of carbon dioxide ice alone could have formed Martian gullies. We used a general circulation model to show that the highest-elevation Martian gullies coincide with the boundary of terrain that experienced pressures above the triple point of water when Mars’ rotational axis tilt reached 35°. Those conditions have occurred repeatedly over the past several million years, most recently ~630,000 years ago. Surface water ice, if present at these locations, could have melted when temperatures rose &gt;273 kelvin. We propose a dual gully formation scenario that is driven by melting of water ice followed by carbon dioxide ice sublimation.},

  abstract     = {Chromosomes in the eukaryotic nucleus are highly compacted. However, for many functional processes, including transcription initiation, the pairwise motion of distal chromosomal elements such as enhancers and promoters is essential and necessitates dynamic fluidity. Here, we used a live-imaging assay to simultaneously measure the positions of pairs of enhancers and promoters and their transcriptional output while systematically varying the genomic separation between these two DNA loci. Our analysis reveals the coexistence of a compact globular organization and fast subdiffusive dynamics. These combined features cause an anomalous scaling of polymer relaxation times with genomic separation leading to long-ranged correlations. Thus, encounter times of DNA loci are much less dependent on genomic distance than predicted by existing polymer models, with potential consequences for eukaryotic gene expression.},

Improved HAT treatments are available, but Chagas disease therapies rely on two nitroheterocycles, which suffer from lengthy drug regimens and safety concerns that cause frequent treatment discontinuation. We performed phenotypic screening against trypanosomes and identified a class of cyanotriazoles (CTs) with potent trypanocidal activity both in vitro and in mouse models of Chagas disease and HAT. Cryo–electron microscopy approaches confirmed that CT compounds acted through selective, irreversible inhibition of trypanosomal topoisomerase II by stabilizing double-stranded DNA:enzyme cleavage complexes. These findings suggest a potential approach toward successful therapeutics for the treatment of Chagas disease.},

The extent and speed of farming expansion across the South American plains over the past four decades provide an unprecedented case of the effects of rainfed farming on hydrology. Remote sensing analysis shows that as annual crops replaced native vegetation and pastures, floods gradually doubled their coverage, increasing their sensitivity to precipitation. Groundwater shifted from deep (12 to 6 meters) to shallow (4 to 0 meters) states, reducing drawdown levels. Field studies and simulations suggest that declining rooting depths and evapotranspiration in croplands are the causes of this hydrological transformation. These findings show the escalating flooding risks associated with rainfed agriculture expansion at subcontinental and decadal scales.},

However, cosmic rays interact with matter near their sources and during propagation, which produces high-energy neutrinos. We searched for neutrino emission using machine learning techniques applied to 10 years of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. By comparing diffuse emission models to a background-only hypothesis, we identified neutrino emission from the Galactic plane at the 4.5σ level of significance. The signal is consistent with diffuse emission of neutrinos from the Milky Way but could also arise from a population of unresolved point sources.},

  abstract     = {In eukaryotic cells, different organelles interact at membrane contact sites stabilized by tethers. Mitochondrial mitofusin 2 (MFN2) acts as a membrane tether that interacts with an unknown partner on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this work, we identified the MFN2 splice variant ERMIT2 as the ER tethering partner of MFN2. Splicing of MFN2 produced ERMIT2 and ERMIN2, two ER-specific variants. ERMIN2 regulated ER morphology, whereas ERMIT2 localized at the ER-mitochondria interface and interacted with mitochondrial mitofusins to tether ER and mitochondria. This tethering allowed efficient mitochondrial calcium ion uptake and phospholipid transfer. Expression of ERMIT2 ameliorated the ER stress, inflammation, and fibrosis typical of liver-specific Mfn2 knockout mice. Thus, ER-specific MFN2 variants display entirely extramitochondrial MFN2 functions involved in interorganellar tethering and liver metabolic activities.},

In mammals, deterministic expression of the same Pcdh isoform promotes minimal overlap of tiled projections of serotonergic neuron axons throughout the brain, while stochastic expression of Pcdh genes allows for convergence of tightly packed, overlapping olfactory sensory neuron axons into targeted structures. How can the same gene locus generate opposite transcriptional programs that orchestrate distinct spatial arrangements of axonal patterns? Here, we reveal that cell type–specific Pcdh expression and axonal behavior depend on the activity of cohesin and its unloader, WAPL (wings apart–like protein homolog). While cohesin erases genomic-distance biases in Pcdh choice, WAPL functions as a rheostat of cohesin processivity that determines Pcdh isoform diversity.},

These efforts are motivated by the goals of demonstrating quantum statistics of quasiparticles beyond those of fermions and bosons and of establishing the underlying science for the creation of topologically protected quantum bits. In this Review, we focus on efforts to create topological superconducting phases that host Majorana zero modes. We consider the lessons learned from existing experimental efforts, which are motivating both improvements to present platforms and the exploration of new approaches. Although the experimental detection of non-abelian quasiparticles remains challenging, the knowledge gained thus far and the opportunities ahead offer high potential for discovery and advances in this exciting area of quantum physics.},

We describe cryo-electron microscopy structures of the free and capped ends of F-actin. Terminal subunits at the free barbed end adopt a “flat” F-actin conformation. CapZ binds with minor changes to the barbed end but with major changes to itself. By contrast, subunits at the free pointed end adopt a “twisted” monomeric actin (G-actin) conformation. Tropomodulin binding forces the second subunit into an F-actin conformation.

  abstract     = {Biodiversity is declining globally in response to multiple human stressors, including climate forcing. Nonetheless, local diversity trends are inconsistent in some taxa, obscuring contributions of local processes to global patterns. Arctic tundra diversity, including plants, fungi, and lichens, declined during a 15-year experiment that combined warming with exclusion of large herbivores known to influence tundra vegetation composition. Tundra diversity declined regardless of experimental treatment, as background growing season temperatures rose with sea ice loss. However, diversity declined slower with large herbivores than without them. This difference was associated with an increase in effective diversity of large herbivores as formerly abundant caribou declined and muskoxen increased. Efforts that promote herbivore diversity, such as rewilding, may help mitigate impacts of warming on tundra diversity.},

Coordination may be mediated by molecular signaling and/or mechanical connectivity between cells, but how genes modify mechanical interactions between layers is unknown. Here we show that genes driving brassinosteroid synthesis promote growth of internal tissue, at least in part, by reducing mechanical epidermal constraint. We identified a brassinosteroid-deficient dwarf mutant in the aquatic plant Utricularia gibba with twisted internal tissue, likely caused by mechanical constraint from a slow-growing epidermis. We tested this hypothesis by showing that a brassinosteroid mutant in Arabidopsis enhances epidermal crack formation, indicative of increased tissue stress. We propose that by remodeling cell walls, brassinosteroids reduce epidermal constraint, showing how genes can control growth coordination between layers by means of mechanics.},

Existing approaches fail to achieve the speed and sensitivity required for voltage imaging in neuroscience applications. We demonstrated that wide-field electro-optic fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (EO-FLIM) allows lifetime imaging at kilohertz frame-acquisition rates, spatially resolving action potential propagation and subthreshold neural activity in live adult Drosophila . Lifetime resolutions of &lt;5 picoseconds at 1 kilohertz were achieved for single-cell voltage recordings. Lifetime readout is limited by photon shot noise, and the method provides strong rejection of motion artifacts and technical noise sources. Recordings revealed local transmembrane depolarizations, two types of spikes with distinct fluorescence lifetimes, and phase locking of spikes to an external mechanical stimulus.},

  abstract     = {Scaling up invariably error-prone quantum processors is a formidable challenge. Although quantum error correction ultimately promises fault-tolerant operation, the required qubit overhead and error thresholds are daunting. In a complementary proposal, colocated, auxiliary “spectator” qubits act as in situ probes of noise and enable real-time, coherent corrections of data qubit errors. We used an array of cesium spectator qubits to correct correlated phase errors on an array of rubidium data qubits. By combining in-sequence readout, data processing, and feedforward operations, these correlated errors were suppressed within the execution of the quantum circuit. The protocol is broadly applicable to quantum information platforms and establishes key tools for scaling neutral-atom quantum processors: mid-circuit readout of atom arrays, real-time processing and feedforward, and coherent mid-circuit reloading of atomic qubits.},

Cross-presentation relies on the unusual “leakiness” of endocytic compartments in DCs, whereby internalized proteins escape into the cytosol for proteasome-mediated generation of MHC I–binding peptides. Given that type 1 conventional DCs excel at cross-presentation, we searched for cell type–specific effectors of endocytic escape. We devised an assay suitable for genetic screening and identified a pore-forming protein, perforin-2 ( Mpeg1 ), as a dedicated effector exclusive to cross-presenting cells. Perforin-2 was recruited to antigen-containing compartments, where it underwent maturation, releasing its pore-forming domain. Mpeg1 −/− mice failed to efficiently prime CD8 + T cells to cell-associated antigens, revealing an important role for perforin-2 in cytosolic entry of antigens during cross-presentation.},

We studied the hierarchical design of the mineralized tissue in the hinge of the bivalve Cristaria plicata , which endows the tissue with deformability and fatigue resistance and consequently underlies the repeating motion capability. This folding fan–shaped tissue consists of radially aligned, brittle aragonite nanowires embedded in a resilient matrix and can translate external radial loads to circumferential deformation. The hard-soft complex microstructure can suppress stress concentration within the tissue. Coherent nanotwin boundaries along the longitudinal direction of the nanowires increase their resistance to bending fracture. The unusual biomineral, which exploits the inherent properties of each component through multiscale structural design, provides insights into the evolution of antifatigue structural materials.},

We report that cyclobutane-based mechanophore cross-linkers that break through force-triggered cycloreversion lead to networks that are up to nine times as tough as conventional analogs. The response is attributed to a combination of long, strong primary polymer strands and cross-linker scission forces that are approximately fivefold smaller than control cross-linkers at the same timescales. The enhanced toughness comes without the hysteresis associated with noncovalent cross-linking, and it is observed in two different acrylate elastomers, in fatigue as well as constant displacement rate tension, and in a gel as well as elastomers.},

In many locations, we observed objects that carried only part of a flux quantum, with a magnitude that varied continuously with temperature.

However, how METAPs interact with ribosomes and how their cleavage specificity is ensured is unknown. We discovered that in eukaryotes the nascent polypeptide–associated complex (NAC) controls ribosome binding of METAP1. NAC recruits METAP1 using a long, flexible tail and provides a platform for the formation of an active methionine excision complex at the ribosomal tunnel exit. This mode of interaction ensures the efficient excision of methionine from cytosolic proteins, whereas proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum are spared. Our results suggest a broader mechanism for how access of protein biogenesis factors to translating ribosomes is controlled.},

We further developed aging clock models to predict fly age and show that ribosomal gene expression is a conserved predictive factor for age. Combining all aging features, we find distinctive cell type–specific aging patterns. This atlas provides a valuable resource for studying fundamental principles of aging in complex organisms.},

We found that neuronal activity induces widespread transcriptional up-regulation and down-regulation in astrocytes, highlighted by the identification of Slc22a3 as an activity-inducible astrocyte gene that encodes neuromodulator transporter Slc22a3 and regulates sensory processing in the mouse olfactory bulb. Loss of astrocytic Slc22a3 reduced serotonin levels in astrocytes, leading to alterations in histone serotonylation. Inhibition of histone serotonylation in astrocytes reduced the expression of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) biosynthetic genes and GABA release, culminating in olfactory deficits. Our study reveals that neuronal activity orchestrates transcriptional and epigenomic responses in astrocytes while illustrating new mechanisms for how astrocytes process neuromodulatory input to gate neurotransmitter release for sensory processing.},

Most extant plants exhibit phyllotactic patterns that are mathematically described by the Fibonacci series. However, it remains unclear what lateral organ arrangements were present in early leafy plants. To investigate this, we quantified phyllotaxis in fossils of the Early Devonian lycopod Asteroxylon mackiei . We report diverse phyllotaxis in leaves, including whorls and spirals. Spirals were all n:(n+1) non-Fibonacci types. We also show that leaves and reproductive structures occurred in the same phyllotactic series, indicating developmental similarities between the organs. Our findings shed light on the long-standing debate about leaf origins and demonstrate the antiquity of non-Fibonacci spirals in plants.},

However, no precise timing and duration exists for the formation of OJP, and its connection to OAE1a relies mainly on proxies in the sedimentary record. We provide high-precision 40 Ar/ 39 Ar data from OJP drill and dredge sites that considerably improve OJP’s eruptive history. The ages determined from this work are as much as 10 million years younger than previous dates and indicate a protracted formation over at least 6 million years. OJP now appears too young to have caused OAE1a, but we suggest that it may have had a role in the later OAE1b. The protracted eruptive sequence has implications for the emplacement dynamics of OJP and other large igneous provinces.},

Its experimental realization, however, has remained elusive. Using high-pressure 11 B nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on the quantum magnet SrCu 2 (BO 3 ) 2 , we here demonstrate a magnetic field–induced plaquette singlet to antiferromagnetic transition above 1.8 gigapascals at a notably low temperature, T c ≃ 0.07 kelvin. First-order signatures of the transition weaken with increasing pressure, and we observe quantum critical scaling at the highest pressure, 2.4 gigapascals. Supported by model calculations, we suggest that these observations can be explained by a proximate DQCP inducing critical quantum fluctuations and emergent O(3) symmetry of the order parameters. Our findings offer a concrete experimental platform for investigation of the DQCP.},

In single-atom metal catalysts, the support itself can strongly affect the catalytic properties. Here, we demonstrate that the size of cerium dioxide (CeO 2 ) support governs the reactivity of atomically dispersed palladium (Pd) in carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation. Catalysts with small CeO 2 nanocrystals (~4 nanometers) exhibit unusually high activity in a CO-rich reaction feed, whereas catalysts with medium-size CeO 2 (~8 nanometers) are preferred for lean conditions. Detailed spectroscopic investigations reveal support size–dependent redox properties of the Pd-CeO 2 interface.},

Our detector combines graphene with metamaterial perfect absorbers with direct illumination from a single-mode fiber, which breaks with the conventional miniaturization of photodetectors on an integrated photonic platform. This design allows for much higher optical powers while still allowing record-high bandwidths and data rates. Our results demonstrate that graphene photodetectors can outperform conventional technologies in terms of speed, bandwidth, and operation across a large spectral range.},

We observed up to an 80\% suppression of the rate by tuning cavity modes to be resonant with the reactant isocyanate (NCO) stretch, the product carbonyl (CO) stretch, and cooperative reactant-solvent modes (CH). These results were interpreted using an open quantum system model that predicted resonant modifications of the vibrational distribution of reactants from canonical statistics as a result of light–matter quantum coherences, suggesting links to explore between chemistry and quantum science.},

In this work, we show how ultraviolet (UV) photoexcitation of metal-ammonia clusters could be used to generate tunable low-energy electrons in situ. Specifically, we identified UV light–induced generation of spin-paired solvated dielectrons and their subsequent relaxation by an unconventional electron transfer–mediated decay as an efficient, low-energy electron source. The process is robust and straightforward to induce with the prospect of improving our understanding of radiation damage and fostering mechanistic studies of solvated electron reduction reactions.},

Our species-level analysis revealed global declines of 60 to 73\% for five common resident reef shark species and that individual shark species were not detected at 34 to 47\% of surveyed reefs. As reefs become more shark-depleted, rays begin to dominate assemblages. Shark-dominated assemblages persist in wealthy nations with strong governance and in highly protected areas, whereas poverty, weak governance, and a lack of shark management are associated with depauperate assemblages mainly composed of rays. Without action to address these diversity deficits, loss of ecological function and ecosystem services will increasingly affect human communities.},

Existing synthetic methods use stepwise extension of sequences immobilized on solid supports and are limited by their scalability and sustainability. We report a biocatalytic approach to efficiently produce oligonucleotides in a single operation where polymerases and endonucleases work in synergy to amplify complementary sequences embedded within catalytic self-priming templates. This approach uses unprotected building blocks and aqueous conditions. We demonstrate the versatility of this methodology through the synthesis of clinically relevant oligonucleotide sequences containing diverse modifications.},

We report the preparation and isolation of the compound by the reduction of beryllocene (BeCp 2 ) with a dimeric magnesium(I) complex and determination of its structure in the solid state by means of x-ray crystallography. Diberyllocene acts as a reductant in reactions that form beryllium-aluminum and beryllium-zinc bonds. Quantum chemical calculations indicate parallels between the electronic structure of diberyllocene and the simple homodiatomic species diberyllium (Be 2 ).},

Astronomy has been a common element in all cultures and civilizations, being used to establish calendars, navigate and discover new lands, and drive numerous scientific and technical breakthroughs. This Review discusses how it is becoming increasingly difficult for professional and amateur astronomers to observe the night sky because of light pollution. Artificial light at night, radio interference, and the deployment of satellite constellations are all rapidly increasing and are having adverse impacts on astronomical observations, limiting scientific discoveries, cultural connections to the night sky, and opportunities presented by astrotourism. Potential mitigation strategies to preserve the night sky are discussed.},

There is a growing body of work pointing to adverse effects of outdoor lighting on human health, including the risk of chronic diseases, but this knowledge is in a more nascent stage. In this Review, we synthesize recent research on the context-specific factors and physiology relevant to nocturnal light exposure in relation to human health and society, identify critical areas for future research, and highlight recent policy steps and recommendations for mitigating light pollution in the urban environment.},

This has far-reaching consequences for most species and their ecosystems. The effects of anthropogenic light on natural ecosystems are highly variable and complex. Many species suffer from adverse effects and often respond in a highly specific manner. Ostensibly surveyable effects such as attraction and deterrence become complicated because these can depend on the type of behavior and specific locations. Here, we considered how solutions and new technologies could reduce the adverse effects of anthropogenic light. A simple solution to reducing and mitigating the ecological effects of anthropogenic light seems unattainable, because frugal lighting practices and turning off lights may be necessary to eliminate them.},

We review how ALAN is measured, both from the ground and through remote sensing by satellites in Earth orbit. A variety of techniques are described, including single-channel photometers, all-sky cameras, and drones. Spectroscopic differences between light sources can be used to determine which are most responsible for light pollution, but they complicate the interpretation of photometric data. The variability of Earth’s atmosphere leads to difficulty in comparisons between datasets. Theoretical models provide complementary information to calibrate experiments and interpret their results. Here, we identify several shortcomings and challenges in current approaches to measuring light pollution and suggest ways forward.},

  abstract     = {Antibiotics (ABX) compromise the efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade in cancer patients, but the mechanisms underlying their immunosuppressive effects remain unknown. By inducing the down-regulation of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) in the ileum, post-ABX gut recolonization by Enterocloster species drove the emigration of enterotropic α4β7 + CD4 + regulatory T 17 cells into the tumor. These deleterious ABX effects were mimicked by oral gavage of Enterocloster species, by genetic deficiency, or by antibody-mediated neutralization of MAdCAM-1 and its receptor, α4β7 integrin. By contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation or interleukin-17A neutralization prevented ABX-induced immunosuppression. In independent lung, kidney, and bladder cancer patient cohorts, low serum levels of soluble MAdCAM-1 had a negative prognostic impact. Thus, the MAdCAM-1–α4β7 axis constitutes an actionable gut immune checkpoint in cancer immunosurveillance.},

  abstract     = {Aging is associated with changes in circulating levels of various molecules, some of which remain undefined. We find that concentrations of circulating taurine decline with aging in mice, monkeys, and humans. A reversal of this decline through taurine supplementation increased the health span (the period of healthy living) and life span in mice and health span in monkeys. Mechanistically, taurine reduced cellular senescence, protected against telomerase deficiency, suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammaging. In humans, lower taurine concentrations correlated with several age-related diseases and taurine concentrations increased after acute endurance exercise. Thus, taurine deficiency may be a driver of aging because its reversal increases health span in worms, rodents, and primates and life span in worms and rodents. Clinical trials in humans seem warranted to test whether taurine deficiency might drive aging in humans.},

After the supernova appeared in 2014, lens models of the galaxy cluster predicted that an additional image of the supernova would appear in 2015, which was subsequently observed. We use the time delays between the images to perform a blinded measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe, quantified by the Hubble constant ( H 0 ). Using eight cluster lens models, we infer H 0 = 64.8 − 4.3 + 4.4 kilometers per second per megaparsec . Using the two models most consistent with the observations, we find H 0 = 66.6 − 3.3 + 4.1 kilometers per second per megaparsec . The observations are best reproduced by models that assign dark-matter halos to individual galaxies and the overall cluster.},

Using fossil dental metrics, we reconstructed body mass and mass–abundance distributions in Late Miocene to recent African large mammal communities. Despite collection biases, fossil and extant mass–abundance distributions are highly similar, with unimodal distributions likely reflecting savanna environments. Above 45 kilograms, abundance decreases exponentially with mass, with slopes close to −0.75, as predicted by metabolic scaling. Furthermore, communities before ~4 million years ago had considerably more large-sized individuals, with a greater proportion of total biomass allocated in larger size categories, than did later communities. Over time, individuals and biomass were redistributed into smaller size categories, reflecting a gradual loss of large-sized individuals from the fossil record paralleling the long-term decline of Plio-Pleistocene large mammal diversity.},

However, a method that allows simultaneous profiling of chromatin architecture and gene expression has not been reported. Here, we developed an assay named “Hi-C and RNA-seq employed simultaneously” (HiRES) and performed it on thousands of single cells from developing mouse embryos. Single-cell three-dimensional genome structures, despite being heavily determined by the cell cycle and developmental stages, gradually diverged in a cell type–specific manner as development progressed. By comparing the pseudotemporal dynamics of chromatin interactions with gene expression, we found a widespread chromatin rewiring that occurred before transcription activation. Our results demonstrate that the establishment of specific chromatin interactions is tightly related to transcriptional control and cell functions during lineage specification.},

In an emissions scenario consistent with current mitigation pledges, increased ENSO amplitude and teleconnections from warming are projected to cause $84 trillion in 21st-century economic losses, but these effects are shaped by stochastic variation in the sequence of El Niño and La Niña events. Our results highlight the sensitivity of the economy to climate variability independent of warming and the potential for future losses due to anthropogenic intensification of such variability.},

Using GPS data, we compared movements and road avoidance of 2300 terrestrial mammals (43 species) during the lockdowns to the same period in 2019. Individual responses were variable with no change in average movements or road avoidance behavior, likely due to variable lockdown conditions. However, under strict lockdowns 10-day 95th percentile displacements increased by 73\%, suggesting increased landscape permeability. Animals’ 1-hour 95th percentile displacements declined by 12\% and animals were 36\% closer to roads in areas of high human footprint, indicating reduced avoidance during lockdowns. Overall, lockdowns rapidly altered some spatial behaviors, highlighting variable but substantial impacts of human mobility on wildlife worldwide.},

The rate dependences on pressure were unexpectedly strong, and substantial differences were observed between the dienophiles. Multiscale modeling demonstrated that in proximity to a surface, mechanochemical trajectories ensued that were distinct from those observed solvothermally or under hydrostatic pressure.

Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, combined with ab initio calculations, we showed that artificial atoms could be made from localized states created from patterned cesium rings. These artificial atoms served as building blocks to realize artificial molecular structures with different orbital symmetries. These corresponding molecular orbitals allowed us to simulate two-dimensional structures reminiscent of well-known organic molecules. This platform could further be used to monitor the interplay between atomic structures and the resulting molecular orbital landscape with submolecular precision.},

In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of a monocoordinate bismuthinidene that features a rigid and bulky ligand. All magnetic measurements [superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)] point to a diamagnetic compound. However, multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations predict the ground state of the compound to be dominated (76\%) by a spin triplet. The apparent diamagnetism is explained by an extremely large SOC-induced positive zero-field splitting of more than 4500 wavenumbers that leaves the M S = 0 magnetic sublevel thermally isolated in the electronic ground state.},

  abstract     = {One of the foundational premises of ecology is that climate determines ecosystems. This has been challenged by alternative ecosystem state models, which illustrate that internal ecosystem dynamics acting on the initial ecosystem state can overwhelm the influence of climate, and by observations suggesting that climate cannot reliably discriminate forest and savanna ecosystem types. Using a novel phytoclimatic transform, which estimates the ability of climate to support different types of plants, we show that climatic suitability for evergreen trees and C4 grasses are sufficient to discriminate between forest and savanna in Africa. Our findings reassert the dominant influence of climate on ecosystems and suggest that the role of feedbacks causing alternative ecosystem states is less prevalent than has been suggested.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectric wurtzites have the potential to revolutionize modern microelectronics because they are easily integrated with multiple mainstream semiconductor platforms. However, the electric fields required to reverse their polarization direction and unlock electronic and optical functions need substantial reduction for operational compatibility with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics. To understand this process, we observed and quantified real-time polarization switching of a representative ferroelectric wurtzite (Al 0.94 B 0.06 N) at the atomic scale with scanning transmission electron microscopy. The analysis revealed a polarization reversal model in which puckered aluminum/boron nitride rings in the wurtzite basal planes gradually flatten and adopt a transient nonpolar geometry. Independent first-principles simulations reveal the details and energetics of the reversal process through an antipolar phase. This model and local mechanistic understanding are a critical initial step for property engineering efforts in this emerging material class.},

  abstract     = {Linear optical quantum computing provides a desirable approach to quantum computing, with only a short list of required computational elements. The similarity between photons and phonons points to the interesting potential for linear mechanical quantum computing using phonons in place of photons. Although single-phonon sources and detectors have been demonstrated, a phononic beam splitter element remains an outstanding requirement. Here we demonstrate such an element, using two superconducting qubits to fully characterize a beam splitter with single phonons. We further use the beam splitter to demonstrate two-phonon interference, a requirement for two-qubit gates in linear computing. This advances a new solid-state system for implementing linear quantum computing, further providing straightforward conversion between itinerant phonons and superconducting qubits.},

The authors remind us that data, however responsibly curated, can be fallible. With this comment, we underscore the importance of conducting principled quality assessment of official statistical data products. We observe that the quality assessment procedure employed by Steed et al . needs improvement, due to (i) the inadmissibility of the estimator used, and (ii) the inconsistent probability model it induces on the joint space of the estimator and the observed data. We discuss the design of alternative statistical methods to conduct principled quality assessments for official statistical data products, showcasing two simulation-based methods for admissible minimax shrinkage estimation via multilevel empirical Bayesian modeling. For policymakers and stakeholders to accurately gauge the context-specific usability of data, the assessment should take into account both uncertainty sources inherent to the data and the downstream use cases, such as policy decisions based on those data products.},

Consequently, an individual at the phenotypic extreme and at the greatest risk for severe, early-onset disease is better identified by a few rare penetrant variants than by the collective action of many common variants with weak effects.

  abstract     = {Personalized genome sequencing has revealed millions of genetic differences between individuals, but our understanding of their clinical relevance remains largely incomplete. To systematically decipher the effects of human genetic variants, we obtained whole-genome sequencing data for 809 individuals from 233 primate species and identified 4.3 million common protein-altering variants with orthologs in humans. We show that these variants can be inferred to have nondeleterious effects in humans based on their presence at high allele frequencies in other primate populations. We use this resource to classify 6\% of all possible human protein-altering variants as likely benign and impute the pathogenicity of the remaining 94\% of variants with deep learning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy for diagnosing pathogenic variants in patients with genetic diseases.},

We used high-coverage whole-genome sequences from 225 wild baboons representing 19 geographic localities to investigate population genomics and interspecies gene flow. Our analyses provide an expanded picture of evolutionary reticulation among species and reveal patterns of population structure within and among species, including differential admixture among conspecific populations. We describe the first example of a baboon population with a genetic composition that is derived from three distinct lineages. The results reveal processes, both ancient and recent, that produced the observed mismatch between phylogenetic relationships based on matrilineal, patrilineal, and biparental inheritance. We also identified several candidate genes that may contribute to species-specific phenotypes.},

We identified 80 associated genomic loci ( P &lt; 6.09 × 10 −10 ) for heart MRI traits, which shared genetic influences with cardiovascular and brain diseases. Genetic correlations were observed between heart MRI traits and brain-related traits and disorders. Mendelian randomization suggests that heart conditions may causally contribute to brain disorders.

In this work, we investigate the frequencies and determinants of ILS in 29 major ancestral nodes across the entire primate phylogeny. We find up to 64\% of the genome affected by ILS at individual nodes. We exploit ILS to reconstruct speciation times and ancestral population sizes. Estimated speciation times are much more recent than genomic divergence times and are in good agreement with the fossil record. We show extensive variation of ILS along the genome, mainly driven by recombination but also by the distance to genes, highlighting a major impact of selection on variation along the genome. In many nodes, ILS is reduced more on the X chromosome compared with autosomes than expected under neutrality, which suggests higher impacts of natural selection on the X chromosome. Finally, we show an excess of ILS in genes with immune functions and a deficit of ILS in housekeeping genes. The extensive ILS in primates discovered in this study provides insights into the speciation times, ancestral population sizes, and patterns of natural selection that shape primate evolution.},

Asian colobines display a range of social organizations, which makes them good models for investigating social evolution. By integrating ecological, geological, fossil, behavioral, and genomic analyses, we found that colobine primates that inhabit colder environments tend to live in larger, more complex groups. Specifically, glacial periods during the past 6 million years promoted the selection of genes involved in cold-related energy metabolism and neurohormonal regulation. More-efficient dopamine and oxytocin pathways developed in odd-nosed monkeys, which may have favored the prolongation of maternal care and lactation, increasing infant survival in cold environments. These adaptive changes appear to have strengthened interindividual affiliation, increased male-male tolerance, and facilitated the stepwise aggregation from independent one-male groups to large multilevel societies.},

We report that primary cilia are required for intercellular coupling among SCN neurons to maintain the robustness of the internal clock in mice. Cilia in neuromedin S–producing (NMS) neurons exhibit pronounced circadian rhythmicity in abundance and length. Genetic ablation of ciliogenesis in NMS neurons enabled a rapid phase shift of the internal clock under jet-lag conditions. The circadian rhythms of individual neurons in cilia-deficient SCN slices lost their coherence after external perturbations. Rhythmic cilia changes drive oscillations of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling and clock gene expression. Inactivation of Shh signaling in NMS neurons phenocopied the effects of cilia ablation. Thus, cilia-Shh signaling in the SCN aids intercellular coupling.},

Contrary to particle-loaded sacrificial binders, our POSS resin itself constitutes a continuous silicon-oxygen molecular network that forms transparent fused silica at only 650°C. This temperature is 500°C lower than the sintering temperatures for fusing discrete silica particles to a continuum, which brings silica 3D printing below the melting points of essential microsystem materials.

Using time-resolved x-ray spectroscopy, we track the charge-transfer interactions during C–H activation of octane by a cyclopentadienyl rhodium carbonyl complex. Changes in oxidation state as well as valence-orbital energies and character emerge in the data on a femtosecond to nanosecond timescale. The x-ray spectroscopic signatures reflect how alkane-to-metal donation determines metal-alkane complex stability and how metal-to-alkane back-donation facilitates C–H bond cleavage by oxidative addition.

When multilayered polymer films are misaligned after damage, these structures autonomously realign during healing to minimize interfacial free energy. We fabricated devices with conductive, dielectric, and magnetic particles that functionally heal after damage, enabling thin-film pressure sensors, magnetically assembled soft robots, and underwater circuit assembly.},

  abstract     = {Comparative analysis of primate genomes within a phylogenetic context is essential for understanding the evolution of human genetic architecture and primate diversity. We present such a study of 50 primate species spanning 38 genera and 14 families, including 27 genomes first reported here, with many from previously less well represented groups, the New World monkeys and the Strepsirrhini. Our analyses reveal heterogeneous rates of genomic rearrangement and gene evolution across primate lineages. Thousands of genes under positive selection in different lineages play roles in the nervous, skeletal, and digestive systems and may have contributed to primate innovations and adaptations. Our study reveals that many key genomic innovations occurred in the Simiiformes ancestral node and may have had an impact on the adaptive radiation of the Simiiformes and human evolution.},

  abstract     = {The rich diversity of morphology and behavior displayed across primate species provides an informative context in which to study the impact of genomic diversity on fundamental biological processes. Analysis of that diversity provides insight into long-standing questions in evolutionary and conservation biology and is urgent given severe threats these species are facing. Here, we present high-coverage whole-genome data from 233 primate species representing 86\% of genera and all 16 families. This dataset was used, together with fossil calibration, to create a nuclear DNA phylogeny and to reassess evolutionary divergence times among primate clades. We found within-species genetic diversity across families and geographic regions to be associated with climate and sociality, but not with extinction risk. Furthermore, mutation rates differ across species, potentially influenced by effective population sizes. Lastly, we identified extensive recurrence of missense mutations previously thought to be human specific. This study will open a wide range of research avenues for future primate genomic research.},

Throughout the world, roads threaten biodiversity and ecosystem functions (4).

To protect the collected data, random noise was added to the tabulated statistics, and the data and noise were stored together in a Noisy Measurement File (NMF). The NMF is critical for understanding biases in the Census data and for performing valid statistical inferences, as it potentially allows data users to adjust for the noise in their analyses. However, in 2021, the Census Bureau released only the final tabulated statistics that were produced after postprocessing the NMF (1). This postprocessing ensured the final published data met data consistency requirements (such as nonnegative population counts), but it may have also introduced systematic biases (2–7). The Census Bureau must provide data users access to the NMF in usable form to facilitate the wide array of use cases for Census data.},

Here, using super-resolution microscopy, we found that the two essential subcomplexes of the proteasome, the regulatory (19 S ) and catalytic (20 S ) particles, are differentially distributed within individual rat cortical neurons. We discovered an unexpected abundance of free 19 S particles near synapses. The free neuronal 19 S particles bind and deubiquitylate lysine 63–ubiquitin (Lys 63 -ub), a non–proteasome-targeting ubiquitin linkage. Pull-down assays revealed a significant overrepresentation of synaptic molecules as Lys 63 -ub interactors. Inhibition of the 19 S deubiquitylase activity significantly altered excitatory synaptic transmission and reduced the synaptic availability of AMPA receptors at multiple trafficking points in a proteasome-independent manner. Together, these results reveal a moonlighting function of the regulatory proteasomal subcomplex near synapses.},

We report the observation of a bosonic correlated insulator in tungsten diselenide/tungsten disulfide (WSe 2 /WS 2 ) moiré superlattices composed of excitons, that is, tightly bound electron-hole pairs. We develop a pump probe spectroscopy method that we use to observe an exciton incompressible state at exciton filling ν ex = 1 and charge neutrality, indicating a correlated insulator of excitons. With varying charge density, the bosonic correlated insulator continuously transitions into an electron correlated insulator at charge filling ν e = 1, suggesting a mixed correlated insulating state between the two limits. Our studies establish semiconducting moiré superlattices as an intriguing platform for engineering bosonic phases.},

Freshwater biodiversity is high not only in tectonically active settings but also in tectonically quiescent montane regions such as the Appalachian Mountains. We show that erosion through different rock types drove allopatric divergence between lineages of the Greenfin Darter ( Nothonotus chlorobranchius ), a fish species endemic to rivers draining metamorphic rocks in the Tennessee River basin in the United States. In the past, metamorphic rock preferred by N. chlorobranchius was more widespread, but as erosion exposed other rock types, lineages of this species were progressively isolated in tributaries farther upstream, where metamorphic rock remained. Our results suggest a geologic mechanism for initiating allopatric diversification in mountains long after tectonic activity ceases.},

The loss of ancestral French population structure and the appearance of spatial and regional structure highlights a wide range of population expansion models. Geographic features shaped migrations, and we find enrichments for migration, genetic, and genealogical relatedness patterns within river networks across regions of Quebec. Finally, we provide a freely accessible simulated whole-genome sequence dataset with spatiotemporal metadata for 1,426,749 individuals reflecting intricate French Canadian population structure. Such realistic population-scale simulations provide opportunities to investigate population genetics at an unprecedented resolution.},

In our study spanning 25 years in the Alaskan Arctic, we demonstrate that climate change is affecting the timing of freeze-thaw cycles in the active layer of permafrost soils and altering the physiology of arctic ground squirrels ( Urocitellus parryii ). Soil freeze has been delayed and, in response, arctic ground squirrels have delayed when they up-regulate heat production during torpor to prevent freezing. Further, the termination of hibernation in spring has advanced 4 days per decade in females but not males. Continued warming and phenological shifts will alter hibernation energetics, change the seasonal availability of this important prey species, and potentially disrupt intraspecific interactions.},

The extensive off-stoichiometric defects have a larger impact on the transport properties of SnSe, which motivated us to develop a lattice plainification strategy for defects engineering. We demonstrated that Cu can fill Sn vacancies to weaken defects scattering and boost carrier mobility, facilitating a power factor exceeding ~100 microwatts per centimeter per square kelvin and a dimensionless figure of merit ( ZT ) of ~1.5 at 300 kelvin, with an average ZT of ~2.2 at 300 to 773 kelvin. We further realized a single-leg efficiency of ~12.2\% under a temperature difference (Δ T ) of ~300 kelvin and a seven-pair Peltier cooling Δ T max of ~61.2 kelvin at ambient temperature. Our observations are important for practical applications of SnSe crystals in power generation as well as electronic cooling.},

However, because plants associate with diverse microbial communities that shape their phenotypes, shifts in microbial associations may provide an alternative source of climate tolerance. Here, we show that tree seedlings inoculated with microbial communities sourced from drier, warmer, or colder sites displayed higher survival when faced with drought, heat, or cold stress, respectively. Microbially mediated drought tolerance was associated with increased diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, whereas cold tolerance was associated with lower fungal richness, likely reflecting a reduced burden of nonadapted fungal taxa. Understanding microbially mediated climate tolerance may enhance our ability to predict and manage the adaptability of forest ecosystems to changing climates.},

  abstract     = {The ocean’s nitrogen is largely fixed by cyanobacteria, including Trichodesmium , which forms aggregates comprising hundreds of filaments arranged in organized architectures. Aggregates often form upon exposure to stress and have ecological and biophysical characteristics that differ from those of single filaments. Here, we report that Trichodesmium aggregates can rapidly modulate their shape, responding within minutes to changes in environmental conditions. Combining video microscopy and mathematical modeling, we discovered that this reorganization is mediated by “smart reversals” wherein gliding filaments reverse when their overlap with other filaments diminishes. By regulating smart reversals, filaments control aggregate architecture without central coordination. We propose that the modulation of gliding motility at the single-filament level is a determinant of Trichodesmium ’s aggregation behavior and ultimately of its biogeochemical role in the ocean.},

How CTLs terminate signaling and disengage to allow serial killing has remained a mystery. TCR activation triggers membrane specialization within the immune synapse, including the production of diacylglycerol (DAG), a lipid that can induce negative membrane curvature. We found that activated TCRs were shed into DAG-enriched ectosomes at the immune synapse rather than internalized through endocytosis, suggesting that DAG may contribute to the outward budding required for ectocytosis. Budding ectosomes were endocytosed directly by target cells, thereby terminating TCR signaling and simultaneously disengaging the CTL from the target cell to allow serial killing. Thus, ectocytosis renders TCR signaling self-limiting.},

Compared with deep (&gt;2000 meter) hydrothermal activity at mid-ocean ridges that provide iron to the ocean’s interior, shallow (&lt;500 meter) hydrothermal fluids are likely to influence the surface’s ecosystem. However, their effect is unknown. In this work, we show that fluids emitted along the Tonga volcanic arc (South Pacific) have a substantial impact on iron concentrations in the photic layer through vertical diffusion. This enrichment stimulates biological activity, resulting in an extensive patch of chlorophyll (360,000 square kilometers). Diazotroph activity is two to eight times higher and carbon export fluxes are two to three times higher in iron-enriched waters than in adjacent unfertilized waters. Such findings reveal a previously undescribed mechanism of natural iron fertilization in the ocean that fuels regional hotspot sinks for atmospheric CO 2 .},

Using precise variant insertion through base editing, we connected specific variants with gene expression changes. We also identified trans -effect networks of noncoding loci when cis target genes encoded transcription factors or microRNAs. Networks were themselves enriched for GWAS variants and demonstrated polygenic contributions to complex traits.

In response to Semieniuk et al . we would like to first point out that, in defining the required global mitigation investments for the 2020 to 2030 period, our study relies on the estimates in the sixth assessment report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) WGIII ( 2 ). These are based on diverse sources and underlying models that to varying degrees reflect regional differences in technology costs and consider both purchasing power parity (PPP) and market exchange rates (MERs). We use these IPCC estimates as a starting point and focus entirely on the question of how much of the needed regional investments, given different fairness considerations, should be financed from sources within a region.},

Although the steps leading up to the proliferation of surviving cardiomyocytes have been extensively studied, little is known about the mechanisms that control proliferation and redifferentiation to a mature state. We found that the cardiac dyad, a structure that regulates calcium handling and excitation-contraction coupling, played a key role in the redifferentiation process. A component of the cardiac dyad called leucine-rich repeat–containing 10 (Lrrc10) acted as a negative regulator of proliferation, prevented cardiomegaly, and induced redifferentiation. We found that its function was conserved in mammalian cardiomyocytes. This study highlights the importance of the underlying mechanisms required for heart regeneration and their application to the generation of fully functional cardiomyocytes.},

In this study, we examined the movements and fates of mesopredators and large carnivores across rural landscapes characterized by substantial human influences. Mesopredators shifted their movements toward areas with twofold-greater human influence in regions occupied by large carnivores, indicating that they perceived humans to be less of a threat. However, rather than shielding mesopredators, human-caused mortality was more than three times higher than large carnivore–caused mortality. Mesopredator suppression by apex predators may thus be amplified, rather than dampened, outside protected areas, because fear of large carnivores drives mesopredators into areas of even greater risk from human super predators.},

However, the global impact of management (for example, harvesting) on the carbon budget of forests remains poorly quantified. We integrated global maps of forest biomass and management with machine learning to show that by removing human intervention, under current climatic conditions and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration, existing global forests could increase their aboveground biomass by up to 44.1 (error range: 21.0 to 63.0) petagrams of carbon. This is an increase of 15 to 16\% over current levels, equating to about 4 years of current anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Therefore, without strong reductions in emissions, this strategy holds low mitigation potential, and the forest sink should be preserved to offset residual carbon emissions rather than to compensate for present emissions levels.},

Here, we analyze the 1972 largest global lakes using three decades of satellite observations, climate data, and hydrologic models, finding statistically significant storage declines for 53\% of these water bodies over the period 1992–2020. The net volume loss in natural lakes is largely attributable to climate warming, increasing evaporative demand, and human water consumption, whereas sedimentation dominates storage losses in reservoirs. We estimate that roughly one-quarter of the world’s population resides in a basin of a drying lake, underscoring the necessity of incorporating climate change and sedimentation impacts into sustainable water resources management.},

However, achieving such a biomimetic system that can seamlessly integrate with the human body remains a challenge. Through rational design and engineering of material properties, device structures, and system architectures, we realized a monolithic soft prosthetic electronic skin (e-skin). It is capable of multimodal perception, neuromorphic pulse-train signal generation, and closed-loop actuation. With a trilayer, high-permittivity elastomeric dielectric, we achieved a low subthreshold swing comparable to that of polycrystalline silicon transistors, a low operation voltage, low power consumption, and medium-scale circuit integration complexity for stretchable organic devices. Our e-skin mimics the biological sensorimotor loop, whereby a solid-state synaptic transistor elicits stronger actuation when a stimulus of increasing pressure is applied.},

  abstract     = {Breaking the trade-off between activity and selectivity has been a long-standing challenge in the field of catalysis. We demonstrate the importance of disentangling the target reaction from the secondary reactions for the case of direct syngas conversion to light olefins by incorporating germanium-substituted AlPO-18 within the framework of the metal oxide–zeolite (OXZEO) catalyst concept. The attenuated strength of the catalytically active Brønsted acid sites allows enhancing the targeted carbon-carbon coupling of ketene intermediates to form olefins by increasing the active site density while inhibiting secondary reactions that consume the olefins. Thus, a light-olefins selectivity of 83\% among hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide conversion of 85\% were obtained simultaneously, leading to an unprecedented light-olefins yield of 48\% versus current reported light-olefins yields of ≤27\%.},

  abstract     = {Developing zero–global warming potential refrigerants has emerged as one area that helps address global climate change concerns. Various high-efficiency caloric cooling techniques meet this goal, but scaling them up to technologically meaningful performance remains challenging. We have developed an elastocaloric cooling system with a maximum cooling power of 260 watts and a maximum temperature span of 22.5 kelvin. These values are among the highest reported for any caloric cooling system. Its key feature is the compression of fatigue-resistant elastocaloric nitinol (NiTi) tubes configured in a versatile multimode heat exchange architecture, which allows the harnessing of both high delivered cooling power and large temperature spans. Our system shows that elastocaloric cooling, which only emerged 8 years ago, is a promising direction for commercializing caloric cooling.},

Sharing this fragile property between superconducting microwave circuits and optical or atomic systems would enable new functionalities, but this has been hindered by an energy scale mismatch of &gt;10 4 and the resulting mutually imposed loss and noise. In this work, we created and verified entanglement between microwave and optical fields in a millikelvin environment. Using an optically pulsed superconducting electro-optical device, we show entanglement between propagating microwave and optical fields in the continuous variable domain. This achievement not only paves the way for entanglement between superconducting circuits and telecom wavelength light, but also has wide-ranging implications for hybrid quantum networks in the context of modularization, scaling, sensing, and cross-platform verification.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the relaxation pathways of photoexcited molecules is essential to gain atomistic-level insight into photochemistry. We performed a time-resolved study of ultrafast molecular symmetry breaking through geometric relaxation (Jahn-Teller distortion) on the methane cation. Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with soft x-rays at the carbon K-edge revealed that the distortion occurred within 10 ± 2 femtoseconds after few-femtosecond strong-field ionization of methane. The distortion activated coherent oscillations in the asymmetric scissoring vibrational mode of the symmetry-broken cation, which were detected in the x-ray signal. These oscillations were damped within 58 ± 13 femtoseconds because vibrational coherence was lost with the energy redistributing into lower-frequency vibrational modes. This study completely reconstructs the molecular relaxation dynamics of this prototypical example and opens avenues for exploring complex systems.},

Advancements in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)–based polymer ferroelectrics provide flexural, coupling-efficient, and multifunctional material platforms for applications that demand portable, lightweight, wearable, and durable features. We highlight the recent advances in fluoropolymer ferroelectrics, their energetic cross-coupling effects, and emerging technologies, including wearable, highly efficient electromechanical actuators and sensors, electrocaloric refrigeration, and dielectric devices. These developments reveal that the molecular and nanostructure manipulations of the polarization-field interactions, through facile defect biasing, could introduce enhancements in the physical effects that would enable the realization of multisensory and multifunctional wearables for the emerging immersive virtual world and smart systems for a sustainable future.},

The division between these regions shifted southward because of severe droughts ~1100 years ago, which allegedly drove a population replacement in central Mexico by Aridoamerican peoples. In this study, we present shotgun genome-wide data from 12 individuals and 27 mitochondrial genomes from eight pre-Hispanic archaeological sites across Mexico, including two at the shifting border of Aridoamerica and Mesoamerica. We find population continuity that spans the climate change episode and a broad preservation of the genetic structure across present-day Mexico for the past 2300 years. Lastly, we identify a contribution to pre-Hispanic populations of northern and central Mexico from two ancient unsampled “ghost” populations.},

To investigate the origins and impact of such plasticity, we performed single-cell analyses on normal, inflamed, premalignant, and malignant tissues in autochthonous models of pancreatic cancer. We reproducibly identified heterogeneous cell states that are primed for diverse, late-emerging neoplastic fates and linked these to chromatin remodeling at cell-cell communication loci. Using an inference approach, we revealed signaling gene modules and tissue-level cross-talk, including a neoplasia-driving feedback loop between discrete epithelial and immune cell populations that was functionally validated in mice. Our results uncover a neoplasia-specific tissue-remodeling program that may be exploited for pancreatic cancer interception.},

Part of the stellar material falls toward the black hole, forming an accretion disk that in some cases launches a relativistic jet. We performed optical polarimetry observations of a TDE, AT 2020mot. We find a peak linear polarization degree of 25 ± 4\%, consistent with highly polarized synchrotron radiation, as is typically observed from relativistic jets. However, our radio observations, taken up to 8 months after the optical peak, do not detect the corresponding radio emission expected from a relativistic jet. We suggest that the linearly polarized optical emission instead arises from shocks that occur during accretion disk formation, as the stream of stellar material collides with itself.},

We report a strategy of preventing convective heat loss at the gills during excursions into deep, cold water by the tropical scalloped hammerhead shark ( Sphryna lewini ). Adult scalloped hammerhead sharks dive rapidly and repeatedly from warm (~26°C) surface waters to depths exceeding 800 meters with temperatures as low as 5°C. Biologgers attached to adult sharks show that warm muscle temperatures were maintained throughout the deepest portion of each dive. Substantive cooling only occurred during the latter stages of the ascent phase and, once initiated, was rapid. Heat transfer coefficient modeling indicated that convective heat transfer was suspended, probably by suppressing gill function during deep dives. This previously unobserved strategy has broad similarities to marine mammal “breath hold” diving.},

A combination of operando electron microscopy and vibrational spectroscopy revealed that thin TiO x overlayers formed on nickel/titanium dioxide catalysts during 400°C reduction were completely removed under carbon dioxide hydrogenation conditions. Conversely, after 600°C reduction, exposure to carbon dioxide hydrogenation reaction conditions led to only partial reexposure of nickel, forming interfacial sites in contact with TiO x and favoring carbon–carbon coupling by providing a carbon species reservoir. Our findings challenge the conventional understanding of SMSIs and call for more-detailed operando investigations of nanocatalysts at the single-particle level to revisit static models of structure-activity relationships.},

We demonstrate that a multislice ptychography method based on four-dimensional scanning TEM (4D-STEM) data can overcome these limitations. Images obtained from a ~40-nanometer-thick MFI zeolite exhibited a lateral resolution of ~0.85 angstrom that enabled the identification of individual framework oxygen (O) atoms and the precise determination of the orientations of adsorbed molecules. Furthermore, a depth resolution of ~6.6 nanometers allowed probing of the three-dimensional distribution of O vacancies, as well as the phase boundaries in intergrown MFI and MEL zeolites. The 4D-STEM ptychography can be generally applied to other materials with similar high electron-beam sensitivity.},

Limitation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) or activation of hunger-promoting neurons induced a hunger state that extended life span despite increased feeding. Alteration of the neuronal histone acetylome was associated with BCAA limitation, and preventing these alterations abrogated the effect of BCAA limitation to increase feeding and extend life span. Hunger acutely increased feeding through usage of the histone variant H3.3, whereas prolonged hunger seemed to decrease a hunger set point, resulting in beneficial consequences for aging. Demonstration of the sufficiency of hunger to extend life span reveals that motivational states alone can be deterministic drivers of aging.},

We test these hypotheses in brontotheres, which are among the first radiations of mammals that consistently evolved multitonne sizes. Body-mass evolution in brontotheres mainly occurred during speciation and had no preferential direction. Long-term directional change stemmed from the higher survival of larger lineages in less-saturated herbivore guilds.

We report observations of the repeating FRB 20190520B spanning 17 months, which show that the FRB’s Faraday rotation is highly variable and twice changes sign. The FRB also depolarizes below radio frequencies of about 1 to 3 gigahertz. We interpret these properties as being due to changes in the parallel component of the magnetic field integrated along the line of sight, including reversing direction of the field. This could result from propagation through a turbulent magnetized screen of plasma, located 10 –5 to 100 parsecs from the FRB source. This is consistent with the bursts passing through the stellar wind of a binary companion of the FRB source.},

Restarting clinical trials with new participants can be expensive and time consuming, and delays to progress affect all cancer patients.

However, a corresponding abundance metric is not among the 25 “headline indicators,” on which the parties are required to report. The headline indicators, which include important metrics such as the extinction risk of species and the extent of natural ecosystems, are intended to capture the overall scope of and progress toward the goals and targets of GBF at both global and national levels (1). To meet the GBF’s objectives, abundance should be added to the list of headline indicators.},

In mice, the absence of a competitive neuronal engram allocation process in the immature hippocampus precluded the formation of sparse engrams and precise memories until the fourth postnatal week, when inhibitory circuits in the hippocampus mature. This age-dependent shift in precision of episodic-like memories involved the functional maturation of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in subfield CA1 through assembly of extracellular perineuronal nets, which is necessary and sufficient for the onset of competitive neuronal allocation, sparse engram formation, and memory precision.},

  abstract     = {Many animals engage in cannibalism to supplement their diets. Among dense populations of migratory locusts, cannibalism is prevalent. We show that under crowded conditions, locusts produce an anticannibalistic pheromone called phenylacetonitrile. Both the degree of cannibalism and the production of phenylacetonitrile are density dependent and covary. We identified the olfactory receptor that detects phenylacetonitrile and used genome editing to make this receptor nonfunctional, thereby abolishing the negative behavioral response. We also inactivated the gene underlying phenylacetonitrile production and show that locusts that lack this compound lose its protection and are more frequently exposed to intraspecific predation. Thus, we reveal an anticannibalistic feature built on a specifically produced odor. The system is very likely to be of major importance in locust population ecology, and our results might therefore provide opportunities in locust management.},

Mitochondrial genomes feature deviations from the standard genetic code, including the reassignment of two arginine codons to stop codons. The protein required for translation termination at these noncanonical stop codons to release the newly synthesized polypeptides is not currently known. In this study, we used gene editing and ribosomal profiling in combination with cryo–electron microscopy to establish that mitochondrial release factor 1 (mtRF1) detects noncanonical stop codons in human mitochondria by a previously unknown mechanism of codon recognition. We discovered that binding of mtRF1 to the decoding center of the ribosome stabilizes a highly unusual conformation in the messenger RNA in which the ribosomal RNA participates in specific recognition of the noncanonical stop codons.},

We studied a model nanomagnetic array in which such constraints visibly affect the behavior of the magnetic moments. In this system, magnetic excitations connect into thermally active one-dimensional strings whose motion can be imaged in real time. At high temperatures, our data showed the merging, breaking, and reconnecting of strings, resulting in the system transitioning between topologically distinct configurations. Below a crossover temperature, the string motion is dominated by simple changes in length and shape. In this low-temperature regime, the system is energetically stable because of its inability to explore all possible topological configurations. This kinetic crossover suggests a generalizable conception of topologically broken ergodicity and limited equilibration.},

We show that sitosterol, a common sterol of plants, is the most abundant sterol in gutless marine annelids. Using multiomics, metabolite imaging, heterologous gene expression, and enzyme assays, we show that these animals synthesize sitosterol de novo using a noncanonical C-24 sterol methyltransferase (C 24 -SMT). This enzyme is essential for sitosterol synthesis in plants, but not known from most bilaterian animals. Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that C 24 -SMTs are present in representatives of at least five animal phyla, indicating that the synthesis of sterols common to plants is more widespread in animals than currently known.},

  abstract     = {Over the vast open ocean, vital nutrients for phytoplankton growth in the sunlit surface layer are largely provided through physical transport from deep waters, but some nutrients are also provided through atmospheric deposition of desert dust. The extent and magnitude of dust-mediated effects on surface ocean ecosystems have been difficult to estimate globally. In this work, we use global satellite ocean color products to demonstrate widespread responses to atmospheric dust deposition across a diverse continuum of phytoplankton nutritional conditions. The observed responses vary regionally, with some areas exhibiting substantial changes in phytoplankton biomass, whereas in other areas, the response reflects a change in physiological status or health. Climate-driven changes in atmospheric aerosols will alter the relative importance of this nutrient source.},

  abstract     = {Whereas the transport of matter by wheeled vehicles or legged robots can be guaranteed in engineered landscapes such as roads or rails, locomotion prediction in complex environments such as collapsed buildings or crop fields remains challenging. Inspired by the principles of information transmission, which allow signals to be reliably transmitted over “noisy” channels, we developed a “matter-transport” framework that demonstrates that noninertial locomotion can be provably generated over noisy rugose landscapes (heterogeneities on the scale of locomotor dimensions). Experiments confirm that sufficient spatial redundancy in the form of serially connected legged robots leads to reliable transport on such terrain without requiring sensing and control. Further analogies from communication theory coupled with advances in gaits (coding) and sensor-based feedback control (error detection and correction) can lead to agile locomotion in complex terradynamic regimes.},

Garnet crystallization could explain these observations if garnet removes substantial amounts of Fe 2+ , but not Fe 3+ , from magma, yet this model for continental crust generation has never been tested experimentally. Analysis of garnets and melts in laboratory experiments show that the compatibilities of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ in garnet are of similar magnitudes. Our results indicate that fractional crystallization of garnet-bearing cumulates will remove 22\% of total Fe from primary arc basalts but negligibly alter the Fe 3+ /∑Fe ratio and f O 2 of the melt. Garnet crystallization is unlikely to be responsible for the relatively oxidized nature of basaltic arc magmas or the Fe-depletion trend observed in continental crust.},

Here we report a team-science randomized controlled experiment with 26,911 students at 22 diverse institutions. Results showed that the social-belonging intervention, administered online before college (in under 30 minutes), increased the rate at which students completed the first year as full-time students, especially among students in groups that had historically progressed at lower rates. The college context also mattered: The intervention was effective only when students’ groups were afforded opportunities to belong. This study develops methods for understanding how student identities and contexts interact with interventions. It also shows that a low-cost, scalable intervention generalizes its effects to 749 4-year institutions in the United States.},

We observe the gas surrounding a massive galaxy at redshift 2.3 and detect emission lines from neutral hydrogen, helium, and ionized carbon that extend 100 kiloparsecs from the galaxy. The kinematics of this circumgalactic gas is consistent with an inspiraling stream. The carbon abundance indicates that the gas had already been enriched with elements heavier than helium, previously ejected from a galaxy.

Over the past 15 years, genome-wide association studies have established the polygenic basis of these common conditions and revealed widespread sharing of genetic effects, indicative of a shared immunopathology. Despite ongoing challenges in determining the precise genes and molecular consequences of these risk variants, functional experiments and integration with multimodal genomic data are providing valuable insights into key immune cells and pathways driving these diseases, with potential therapeutic implications. Moreover, genetic studies of ancient populations are shedding light on the contribution of pathogen-driven selection pressures to the increased prevalence of autoimmune disease. This Review summarizes the current understanding of autoimmune disease genetics, including shared effects, mechanisms, and evolutionary origins.},

  abstract     = {Although all multicellular organisms have germ line–encoded innate receptors to sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns, vertebrates also evolved adaptive immunity based on somatically generated antigen receptors on B and T cells. Because randomly generated antigen receptors may also react with self-antigens, tolerance checkpoints operate to limit but not completely prevent autoimmunity. These two systems are intricately linked, with innate immunity playing an instrumental role in the induction of adaptive antiviral immunity. In this work, we review how inborn errors of innate immunity can instigate B cell autoimmunity. Increased nucleic acid sensing, often resulting from defects in metabolizing pathways or retroelement control, can break B cell tolerance and converge into TLR7-, cGAS-STING–, or MAVS-dominant signaling pathways. The resulting syndromes span a spectrum that ranges from chilblain and systemic lupus to severe interferonopathies.},

Here, we review recent advances in the investigation of peripheral T cell tolerance, focusing on new insights into mechanisms of tolerance to the gut microbiota, including tolerogenic antigen-presenting cell types and immunomodulatory lymphocytes, and their layered ontogeny that underlies developmental windows for establishing intestinal tolerance. While emphasizing the intestine as a model tissue for studying peripheral T cell tolerance, we highlight overlapping and distinct pathways that underlie tolerance to self-antigens versus commensal antigens within a broader framework for immune tolerance.},

Using the reference-free alignment across 241 mammalian genomes produced by the Zoonomia Consortium, we charted evolutionary trajectories for 0.92 million human candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and 15.6 million human transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). We identified 439,461 cCREs and 2,024,062 TFBSs under evolutionary constraint. Genes near constrained elements perform fundamental cellular processes, whereas genes near primate-specific elements are involved in environmental interaction, including odor perception and immune response. About 20\% of TFBSs are transposable element–derived and exhibit intricate patterns of gains and losses during primate evolution whereas sequence variants associated with complex traits are enriched in constrained TFBSs. Our annotations illuminate the regulatory functions of the human genome.},

Balto shares just part of his diverse ancestry with the eponymous Siberian husky breed. Balto’s genotype predicts a combination of coat features atypical for modern sled dog breeds, and a slightly smaller stature. He had enhanced starch digestion compared with Greenland sled dogs and a compendium of derived homozygous coding variants at constrained positions in genes connected to bone and skin development. We propose that Balto’s population of origin, which was less inbred and genetically healthier than that of modern breeds, was adapted to the extreme environment of 1920s Alaska.},

In this study, we surveyed genetic variation across single genomes of 240 mammals that compose the Zoonomia alignment to evaluate how historical effective population size ( N e ) affects heterozygosity and deleterious genetic load and how these factors may contribute to extinction risk. We find that species with smaller historical N e carry a proportionally larger burden of deleterious alleles owing to long-term accumulation and fixation of genetic load and have a higher risk of extinction. This suggests that historical demography can inform contemporary resilience. Models that included genomic data were predictive of species’ conservation status, suggesting that, in the absence of adequate census or ecological data, genomic information may provide an initial risk assessment.},

By aligning genomes for 240 species, we identify bases that, when mutated, are likely to affect fitness and alter disease risk. At least 332 million bases (~10.7\%) in the human genome are unusually conserved across species (evolutionarily constrained) relative to neutrally evolving repeats, and 4552 ultraconserved elements are nearly perfectly conserved. Of 101 million significantly constrained single bases, 80\% are outside protein-coding exons and half have no functional annotations in the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) resource. Changes in genes and regulatory elements are associated with exceptional mammalian traits, such as hibernation, that could inform therapeutic development.

We present TOGA (Tool to infer Orthologs from Genome Alignments), a method that integrates structural gene annotation and orthology inference. TOGA implements a different paradigm to infer orthologous loci, improves ortholog detection and annotation of conserved genes compared with state-of-the-art methods, and handles even highly fragmented assemblies. TOGA scales to hundreds of genomes, which we demonstrate by applying it to 488 placental mammal and 501 bird assemblies, creating the largest comparative gene resources so far. Additionally, TOGA detects gene losses, enables selection screens, and automatically provides a superior measure of mammalian genome quality. TOGA is a powerful and scalable method to annotate and compare genes in the genomic era.},

Evolutionary constraint is a powerful predictor of function, agnostic to cell type or disease mechanism. Single-base phyloP scores from 240 mammals identified 3.3\% of the human genome as significantly constrained and likely functional. We compared phyloP scores to genome annotation, association studies, copy-number variation, clinical genetics findings, and cancer data. Constrained positions are enriched for variants that explain common disease heritability more than other functional annotations. Our results improve variant annotation but also highlight that the regulatory landscape of the human genome still needs to be further explored and linked to disease.},

  abstract     = {Conserved genomic sequences disrupted in humans may underlie uniquely human phenotypic traits. We identified and characterized 10,032 human-specific conserved deletions (hCONDELs). These short (average 2.56 base pairs) deletions are enriched for human brain functions across genetic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic datasets. Using massively parallel reporter assays in six cell types, we discovered 800 hCONDELs conferring significant differences in regulatory activity, half of which enhance rather than disrupt regulatory function. We highlight several hCONDELs with putative human-specific effects on brain development, including HDAC5 , CPEB4 , and PPP2CA . Reverting an hCONDEL to the ancestral sequence alters the expression of LOXL2 and developmental genes involved in myelination and synaptic function. Our data provide a rich resource to investigate the evolutionary mechanisms driving new traits in humans and other species.},

We found that although mammals resemble one another in total TE content and diversity, they show substantial differences with regard to recent TE accumulation. This includes multiple recent expansion and quiescence events across the mammalian tree. Young TEs, particularly long interspersed elements, drive increases in genome size, whereas DNA transposons are associated with smaller genomes. Mammals tend to accumulate only a few types of TEs at any given time, with one TE type dominating. We also found association between dietary habit and the presence of DNA transposon invasions. These detailed annotations will serve as a benchmark for future comparative TE analyses among placental mammals.},

Identifying associations between enhancers and phenotypes is challenging because enhancer activity can be tissue-dependent and functionally conserved despite low sequence conservation. We developed the Tissue-Aware Conservation Inference Toolkit (TACIT) to associate candidate enhancers with species’ phenotypes using predictions from machine learning models trained on specific tissues. Applying TACIT to associate motor cortex and parvalbumin-positive interneuron enhancers with neurological phenotypes revealed dozens of enhancer–phenotype associations, including brain size–associated enhancers that interact with genes implicated in microcephaly or macrocephaly. TACIT provides a foundation for identifying enhancers associated with the evolution of any convergently evolved phenotype in any large group of species with aligned genomes.},

Differential gene expression between humans and chimpanzees at these loci suggests rewiring of regulatory interactions between HARs and neurodevelopmental genes.

We compared neutral genome-wide phylogenomic signals using concatenation and coalescent-based approaches, interrogated phylogenetic variation across chromosomes, and analyzed extensive catalogs of structural variants. Interordinal relationships exhibit relatively low rates of phylogenomic conflict across diverse datasets and analytical methods. Conversely, X-chromosome versus autosome conflicts characterize multiple independent clades that radiated during the Cenozoic.

JWST spectroscopy of the galaxy, at rest-frame optical wavelengths, detects strong nebular emission lines that are attributable to oxygen and hydrogen. The measured redshift is z = 9.51 ± 0.01, corresponding to 510 million years after the Big Bang. The galaxy has a radius of 16.2 − 7.2 + 4.6 parsecs, which is substantially more compact than galaxies with equivalent luminosity at z ~ 6 to 8, leading to a high star formation rate surface density.},

We show that Csx28, of type VI-B2 systems, is a transmembrane protein that assists to slow cellular metabolism upon viral infection, increasing antiviral defense. High-resolution cryo–electron microscopy reveals that Csx28 forms an octameric pore-like structure. These Csx28 pores localize to the inner membrane in vivo. Csx28’s antiviral activity in vivo requires sequence-specific cleavage of viral messenger RNAs by Cas13b, which subsequently results in membrane depolarization, slowed metabolism, and inhibition of sustained viral infection. Our work suggests a mechanism by which Csx28 acts as a downstream, Cas13b-dependent effector protein that uses membrane perturbation as an antiviral defense strategy.},

Combining ultrasound imaging, theoretical analysis, and simulations, we developed and validated a mechanistic model that explains how the kinematics of individual active filaments determines their emergent collective topological dynamics. The model reveals that resonantly alternating helical waves enable both tangle formation and ultrafast untangling. By identifying generic dynamical principles of topological self-transformations, our results can provide guidance for designing classes of topologically tunable active materials.},

Broadly conserved receptors embedded in the spore membrane detect nutrients, but how spores transduce these signals remains unclear. Here, we found that these receptors form oligomeric membrane channels. Mutations predicted to widen the channel initiated germination in the absence of nutrients, whereas those that narrow it prevented ion release and germination in response to nutrients. Expressing receptors with widened channels during vegetative growth caused loss of membrane potential and cell death, whereas the addition of germinants to cells expressing wild-type receptors triggered membrane depolarization. Therefore, germinant receptors act as nutrient-gated ion channels such that ion release initiates exit from dormancy.},

We find that RAD51 uses its strand exchange activity to circumvent the replicative helicase, which remains bound to the stalled fork. RAD51 is not required for fork reversal if the helicase is unloaded. Thus, we propose that RAD51 creates a parental DNA duplex behind the helicase that is used as a substrate by the DNA translocases for branch migration to create a reversed fork structure.

We rewired this endogenous toggle to engineer an autonomous genetic clock that generates sustained oscillations between the nucleolar and mitochondrial aging processes in individual cells. These oscillations increased cellular life span through the delay of the commitment to aging that resulted from either the loss of chromatin silencing or the depletion of heme. Our results establish a connection between gene network architecture and cellular longevity that could lead to rationally designed gene circuits that slow aging.},

Approved therapies circumvent endogenous SMN regulation and require repeated dosing or may wane. We describe genome editing of SMN2 , an insufficient copy of SMN1 harboring a C6&gt;T mutation, to permanently restore SMN protein levels and rescue SMA phenotypes. We used nucleases or base editors to modify five SMN2 regulatory regions. Base editing converted SMN2 T6&gt;C, restoring SMN protein levels to wild type. Adeno-associated virus serotype 9–mediated base editor delivery in Δ7SMA mice yielded 87\% average T6&gt;C conversion, improved motor function, and extended average life span, which was enhanced by one-time base editor and nusinersen coadministration (111 versus 17 days untreated). These findings demonstrate the potential of a one-time base editing treatment for SMA.},

Cyclin-dependent kinase 13 ( CDK13 ) is mutated in melanoma, and patient-mutated CDK13 accelerates zebrafish melanoma. CDK13 mutation causes aberrant RNA stabilization. CDK13 is required for ZC3H14 phosphorylation, which is necessary and sufficient to promote nuclear RNA degradation. Mutant CDK13 fails to activate nuclear RNA surveillance, causing aberrant protein-coding transcripts to be stabilized and translated. Forced aberrant RNA expression accelerates melanoma in zebrafish. We found recurrent mutations in genes encoding nuclear RNA surveillance components in many malignancies, establishing nuclear RNA surveillance as a tumor-suppressive pathway. Activating nuclear RNA surveillance is crucial to avoid accumulation of aberrant RNAs and their ensuing consequences in development and disease.},

  abstract     = {Cells respond to mitochondrial poisons with rapid activation of the adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK), causing acute metabolic changes through phosphorylation and prolonged adaptation of metabolism through transcriptional effects. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a major effector of AMPK that increases expression of lysosome genes in response to energetic stress, but how AMPK activates TFEB remains unresolved. We demonstrate that AMPK directly phosphorylates five conserved serine residues in folliculin-interacting protein 1 (FNIP1), suppressing the function of the folliculin (FLCN)–FNIP1 complex. FNIP1 phosphorylation is required for AMPK to induce nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFEB-dependent increases of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) messenger RNAs. Thus, mitochondrial damage triggers AMPK-FNIP1–dependent nuclear translocation of TFEB, inducing sequential waves of lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis.},

We examine the fitness consequences of female preference for rare male color patterns in a natural population of Trinidadian guppies, using a pedigree that spans 10 generations. We demonstrate (i) a rare male reproductive advantage, (ii) that females that mate with rare males gain an indirect fitness advantage through the mating success of their sons, and (iii) the fitness benefit that females accrue through their “sexy sons” evaporates for their grandsons as their phenotype becomes common. Counter to prevailing theory, we show that female preference can be maintained through indirect selection.},

  abstract     = {Non–long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, or long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), are an abundant class of eukaryotic transposons that insert into genomes by target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT). During TPRT, a target DNA sequence is nicked and primes reverse transcription of the retrotransposon RNA. Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the Bombyx mori R2 non-LTR retrotransposon initiating TPRT at its ribosomal DNA target. The target DNA sequence is unwound at the insertion site and recognized by an upstream motif. An extension of the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain recognizes the retrotransposon RNA and guides the 3′ end into the RT active site to template reverse transcription. We used Cas9 to retarget R2 in vitro to non-native sequences, suggesting future use as a reprogrammable RNA-based gene-insertion tool.},

This conservation strategy should be especially effective in highly threatened regions that are poorly protected by public lands, such as the Brazilian Cerrado. Brazil’s Native Vegetation Protection Law has included set-aside areas within private properties, but their relevance to conservation has not been evaluated. We assess whether private lands are contributing to biodiversity in the Cerrado, a global biodiversity conservation priority and major region for food production, where land use conflicts are often at odds with conservation objectives. We determined that private protected areas accommodate up to 14.5\% of threatened vertebrate species ranges, which increases to 25\% when considering the distribution of remaining native habitat. Moreover, the spatial spread of private protected areas benefits a large number of species. Ecological restoration of private protected lands would improve the benefits of this protection system, especially in the Southeastern Cerrado, where a large economic hub meets a threat hotspot.},

Electron microscopy later confirmed the doctrine and allowed the identification of synaptic connections. In this work, we used volume electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions to characterize the nerve net of a ctenophore, a marine invertebrate that belongs to one of the earliest-branching animal lineages. We found that neurons in the subepithelial nerve net have a continuous plasma membrane that forms a syncytium. Our findings suggest fundamental differences of nerve net architectures between ctenophores and cnidarians or bilaterians and offer an alternative perspective on neural network organization and neurotransmission.},

We investigated the genetic diversity and evolution of these clones by analyzing 78 DFT1 and 41 DFT2 genomes relative to a newly assembled, chromosome-level reference. Time-resolved phylogenetic trees reveal that DFT1 first emerged in 1986 (1982 to 1989) and DFT2 in 2011 (2009 to 2012). Subclone analysis documents transmission of heterogeneous cell populations. DFT2 has faster mutation rates than DFT1 across all variant classes, including substitutions, indels, rearrangements, transposable element insertions, and copy number alterations, and we identify a hypermutated DFT1 lineage with defective DNA mismatch repair. Several loci show plausible evidence of positive selection in DFT1 or DFT2, including loss of chromosome Y and inactivation of MGA , but none are common to both cancers. This study reveals the parallel long-term evolution of two transmissible cancers inhabiting a common niche in Tasmanian devils.},

We show an alternative means of light guidance, in which light’s orbital angular momentum creates a centrifugal barrier for itself, thereby enabling low-loss transmission of light in a conventionally forbidden regime wherein the mode mixing can be naturally curtailed. This enables kilometer-length-scale transmission of a record ~50 low-loss modes with cross-talk as low as −45 decibels/kilometer and mode areas of ~800 square micrometers over a 130-nanometer telecommunications spectral window. This distinctive light-guidance regime promises to substantially increase the information content per photon for quantum or classical networks.},

Although the validity of this principle is routinely validated for microscopic systems, it is still unclear why we do not observe macroscopic objects to be in superpositions of states that can be distinguished by some classical property. Here we demonstrate the preparation of a mechanical resonator in Schrödinger cat states of motion, where the ∼10 17 constituent atoms are in a superposition of two opposite-phase oscillations. We control the size and phase of the superpositions and investigate their decoherence dynamics. Our results offer the possibility of exploring the boundary between the quantum and classical worlds and may find applications in continuous-variable quantum information processing and metrology with mechanical resonators.},

We describe a “top-down” reinforcement learning–based design approach that solves this problem using Monte Carlo tree search to sample protein conformers in the context of an overall architecture and specified functional constraints. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of the designed disk-shaped nanopores and ultracompact icosahedra are very close to the computational models. The icosohedra enable very-high-density display of immunogens and signaling molecules, which potentiates vaccine response and angiogenesis induction.

To understand how marine mammals satisfy their daily sleep requirements while at sea, we monitored electroencephalographic activity in wild northern elephant seals ( Mirounga angustirostris ) diving in Monterey Bay, California. Brain-wave patterns showed that seals took short (less than 20 minutes) naps while diving (maximum depth 377 meters; 104 sleeping dives). Linking these patterns to accelerometry and the time-depth profiles of 334 free-ranging seals (514,406 sleeping dives) revealed a North Pacific sleepscape in which seals averaged only 2 hours of sleep per day for 7 months, rivaling the record for the least sleep among all mammals, which is currently held by the African elephant (about 2 hours per day).},

  abstract     = {Living hominoids are distinguished by upright torsos and versatile locomotion. It is hypothesized that these features evolved for feeding on fruit from terminal branches in forests. To investigate the evolutionary context of hominoid adaptive origins, we analyzed multiple paleoenvironmental proxies in conjunction with hominoid fossils from the Moroto II site in Uganda. The data indicate seasonally dry woodlands with the earliest evidence of abundant C 4 grasses in Africa based on a confirmed age of 21 million years ago (Ma). We demonstrate that the leaf-eating hominoid Morotopithecus consumed water-stressed vegetation, and postcrania from the site indicate ape-like locomotor adaptations. These findings suggest that the origin of hominoid locomotor versatility is associated with foraging on leaves in heterogeneous, open woodlands rather than forests.},

To study the origins and functional consequences of PZMs, we generated a multitissue atlas of PZMs spanning 54 tissue and cell types from 948 donors. Nearly half the variation in mutation burden among tissue samples can be explained by measured technical and biological effects, and 9\% can be attributed to donor-specific effects. Through phylogenetic reconstruction of PZMs, we found that their type and predicted functional impact vary during prenatal development, across tissues, and through the germ cell life cycle. Thus, methods for interpreting effects across the body and the life span are needed to fully understand the consequences of genetic variants.},

However, the functional properties of colonist-induced T cells are not well defined, limiting our ability to understand anticommensal immunity and harness it therapeutically. We addressed both challenges by engineering the skin bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis to express tumor antigens anchored to secreted or cell-surface proteins. Upon colonization, engineered S. epidermidis elicits tumor-specific T cells that circulate, infiltrate local and metastatic lesions, and exert cytotoxic activity. Thus, the immune response to a skin colonist can promote cellular immunity at a distal site and can be redirected against a target of therapeutic interest by expressing a target-derived antigen in a commensal.},

We confirmed the detection of this planet with direct imaging using the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics instrument. The planet, HIP 99770 b, orbits 17 astronomical units from its host star, receiving an amount of light similar to that reaching Jupiter. Its dynamical mass is 13.9 to 16.1 Jupiter masses. The planet-to-star mass ratio [(7 to 8) × 10 −3 ] is similar to that of other directly imaged planets.

We report a uniform composite hydrogel that displays substantial mechanical nonreciprocity, owing to direction-dependent buckling of embedded nanofillers. This material exhibits an elastic modulus more than 60 times higher when sheared in one direction compared with the opposite direction. Consequently, it can transform symmetric vibrations into asymmetric ones that are applicable for mass transport and energy harvest. Furthermore, it exhibits an asymmetric deformation when subjected to local interactions, which can induce directional motion of various objects, including macroscopic objects and even small living creatures. This material could promote the development of nonreciprocal systems for practical applications such as energy conversion and biological manipulation.},

However, there is no consensus on whether flash droughts have become the new normal because slow droughts may also increase. In this study, we show that drought intensification rates have sped up over subseasonal time scales and that there has been a transition toward more flash droughts over 74\% of the global regions identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Extreme Events during the past 64 years. The transition is associated with amplified anomalies of evapotranspiration and precipitation deficit caused by anthropogenic climate change. In the future, the transition is projected to expand to most land areas, with larger increases under higher-emission scenarios. These findings underscore the urgency for adapting to faster-onset droughts in a warmer future.},

Short-term immobility-related conditions are a major risk factor for the development of VTE. Paradoxically, long-term immobilized free-ranging hibernating brown bears and paralyzed spinal cord injury (SCI) patients are protected from VTE. We aimed to identify mechanisms of immobility-associated VTE protection in a cross-species approach. Mass spectrometry–based proteomics revealed an antithrombotic signature in platelets of hibernating brown bears with heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) as the most substantially reduced protein. HSP47 down-regulation or ablation attenuated immune cell activation and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, contributing to thromboprotection in bears, SCI patients, and mice. This cross-species conserved platelet signature may give rise to antithrombotic therapeutics and prognostic markers beyond immobility-associated VTE.},

C 4 grasses are thought to have become ecologically dominant in Africa only after 10 million years ago (Ma). However, paleobotanical records older than 10 Ma are sparse, limiting assessment of the timing and nature of C 4 biomass expansion. This study uses a multiproxy design to document vegetation structure from nine Early Miocene mammal site complexes across eastern Africa. Results demonstrate that between ~21 and 16 Ma, C 4 grasses were locally abundant, contributing to heterogeneous habitats ranging from forests to wooded grasslands. These data push back the oldest evidence of C 4 grass–dominated habitats in Africa—and globally—by more than 10 million years, calling for revised paleoecological interpretations of mammalian evolution.},

  abstract     = {Assisted reproductive technology (ART) refers to processing gametes in vitro and usually involves in vitro fertilization. Originally developed for the treatment of infertility, culture of human embryos in vitro also provides an opportunity to screen embryos for inherited genetic disorders of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Progress in identifying causative genetic variants has massively increased the scope of preimplantation genetic testing in preventing genetic disorders. However, because ART procedures are not without risk of adverse maternal and child outcomes, careful consideration of the balance of risks and benefits is warranted. Further research on early human development will help to minimize risks while maximizing the benefits of ART.},

Infertility, the failure of reproduction, has become a major issue for human reproductive health and affects up to one in seven couples worldwide. Here, we review various aspects of human infertility, including etiology, mechanisms, and treatments, with a particular emphasis on genetics. We focus on gamete production and gamete quality, which is the core of successful reproduction. We also discuss future research opportunities and challenges to further expand our understanding of human infertility and improve patient care by providing precision diagnosis and personalized treatments.},

Nearly 250 million women worldwide who want to delay or avoid pregnancy do so ineffectively or not at all, and the principal mechanism of male contraception, condoms, has not changed in 100 years. As a result, about half of the pregnancies that occur globally each year are unintended. Increasing contraceptive options and uptake will curtail abortions, empower women and men, promote healthy families, and moderate population growth that overtaxes the environment. This Review addresses the history of contraception, shortcomings in contraceptive methods, promising approaches for male and female contraception, and simultaneous protection against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.},

  abstract     = {Healthy pregnancies are fundamental to healthy populations, but very few therapies to improve pregnancy outcomes are available. Fundamental concepts—for example, placentation or the mechanisms that control the onset of labor—remain understudied and incompletely understood. A key issue is that research efforts must capture the complexity of the tripartite maternal-placental-fetal system, the dynamics of which change throughout gestation. Studying pregnancy disorders is complicated by the difficulty of creating maternal-placental-fetal interfaces in vitro and the uncertain relevance of animal models to human pregnancy. However, newer approaches include trophoblast organoids to model the developing placenta and integrated data-science approaches to study longer-term outcomes. These approaches provide insights into the physiology of healthy pregnancy, which is the first step to identifying therapeutic targets in pregnancy disorders.},

Searching for receptors to sense beneficial omega-3 FAs of fish oil enabled the identification of GPR120, which is involved in a spectrum of metabolic diseases. Here, we report six cryo–electron microscopy structures of GPR120 in complex with FA hormones or TUG891 and G i or G iq trimers. Aromatic residues inside the GPR120 ligand pocket were responsible for recognizing different double-bond positions of these FAs and connect ligand recognition to distinct effector coupling. We also investigated synthetic ligand selectivity and the structural basis of missense single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We reveal how GPR120 differentiates rigid double bonds and flexible single bonds. The knowledge gleaned here may facilitate rational drug design targeting to GPR120.},

  abstract     = {Despite the vast diversity of the antibody repertoire, infected individuals often mount antibody responses to precisely the same epitopes within antigens. The immunological mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain unknown. By mapping 376 immunodominant “public epitopes” at high resolution and characterizing several of their cognate antibodies, we concluded that germline-encoded sequences in antibodies drive recurrent recognition. Systematic analysis of antibody-antigen structures uncovered 18 human and 21 partially overlapping mouse germline-encoded amino acid–binding (GRAB) motifs within heavy and light V gene segments that in case studies proved critical for public epitope recognition. GRAB motifs represent a fundamental component of the immune system’s architecture that promotes recognition of pathogens and leads to species-specific public antibody responses that can exert selective pressure on pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Contemporary studies have completely changed the view of brain immunity from envisioning the brain as isolated and inaccessible to peripheral immune cells to an organ in close physical and functional communication with the immune system for its maintenance, function, and repair. Circulating immune cells reside in special niches in the brain’s borders, the choroid plexus, meninges, and perivascular spaces, from which they patrol and sense the brain in a remote manner. These niches, together with the meningeal lymphatic system and skull microchannels, provide multiple routes of interaction between the brain and the immune system, in addition to the blood vasculature. In this Review, we describe current ideas about brain immunity and their implications for brain aging, diseases, and immune-based therapeutic approaches.},

Examples range from detecting DNA damage by chemotherapeutics, to identifying drug-specific PTM signatures of kinase inhibitors, to demonstrating that rituximab kills CD20-positive B cells by overactivating B cell receptor signaling. DecryptM profiling of 31 cancer drugs in 13 cell lines demonstrates the broad applicability of the approach.

This process not only ensures the template-induced grain growth in titanium-rich PZT layers but also facilitates desired composition through interlayer diffusion of zirconium and titanium. We successfully prepared textured PZT ceramics with outstanding properties, including Curie temperatures of 360°C, piezoelectric coefficients d 33 of 760 picocoulombs per newton and g 33 of 100 millivolt meters per newton, and electromechanical couplings k 33 of 0.85.

In this work, we present a simple solution to this long-standing challenge: Switching the potential waveform from classical direct current to rapid alternating polarity renders various functional groups compatible and enables the reaction on sustainable carbon-based electrodes (amorphous carbon). This breakthrough enabled access to valuable molecules that range from useful unnatural amino acids to promising polymer building blocks from readily available carboxylic acids, including biomass-derived acids. Preliminary mechanistic studies implicate the role of waveform in modulating the local pH around the electrodes and the crucial role of acetone as an unconventional reaction solvent for Kolbe reaction.},

In this work, we present the detection of Feshbach resonances in a benchmark system for strongly interacting and highly anisotropic collisions: molecular hydrogen ions colliding with noble gas atoms. The collisions are launched by cold Penning ionization, which exclusively populates Feshbach resonances that span both short- and long-range parts of the interaction potential. We resolved all final molecular channels in a tomographic manner using ion-electron coincidence detection. We demonstrate the nonstatistical nature of the final-state distribution. By performing quantum scattering calculations on ab initio potential energy surfaces, we show that the isolation of the Feshbach resonance pathways reveals their distinctive fingerprints in the collision outcome.},

We used density functional theory calculations to elucidate the conditions that lead to cluster formation and show how adatom formation energies enable efficient screening of the conditions required for adsorbate-induced cluster formation. We studied a combination of eight face-centered cubic transition metals and 18 common surface intermediates and identified systems relevant to catalytic reactions, such as carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation and ammonia (NH 3 ) oxidation. We used kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to elucidate the CO-induced cluster formation process on a copper surface. Scanning tunneling microscopy of CO on a nickel (111) surface that contains steps and dislocations points to the structure sensitivity of this phenomenon. Metal-metal bond breaking that leads to the evolution of catalyst structures under realistic reaction conditions occurs much more broadly than previously thought.},

However, current semicrystalline PHAs face three long-standing challenges to broad commercial implementation and application: lack of melt processability, mechanical brittleness, and unrealized recyclability, the last of which is essential for achieving a circular plastics economy. Here we report a synthetic PHA platform that addresses the origin of thermal instability by eliminating α-hydrogens in the PHA repeat units and thus precluding facile cis-elimination during thermal degradation. This simple α,α-disubstitution in PHAs enhances the thermal stability so substantially that the PHAs become melt-processable. Synergistically, this structural modification also endows the PHAs with the mechanical toughness, intrinsic crystallinity, and closed-loop chemical recyclability.},

These devices exploit the fact that holes in a silicon membrane have a considerably larger refractive index than the surrounding material and efficiently vacuum-guide light with a wavelength of ~50 nanometers. This allows the transmission phase at the nanoscale to be controlled by the hole diameter. We fabricated an EUV metalens with a 10-millimeter focal length that supports numerical apertures of up to 0.05 and used it to focus ultrashort EUV light bursts generated by high-harmonic generation down to a 0.7-micrometer waist. Our approach introduces the vast light-shaping possibilities provided by dielectric metasurfaces to a spectral regime that lacks materials for transmissive optics.},

Males are chimeras of haploid cells from two divergent lineages: R and W. R cells are overrepresented in the males’ somatic tissues, whereas W cells are overrepresented in their sperm. Chimerism occurs when parental nuclei bypass syngamy and divide separately within the same egg. When syngamy takes place, the diploid offspring either develops into a queen when the oocyte is fertilized by an R sperm or into a worker when fertilized by a W sperm.

By using time series single-cell RNA sequencing to profile brassinosteroid-responsive gene expression specific to different cell types and developmental stages of the Arabidopsis root, we identified the elongating cortex as a site where brassinosteroids trigger a shift from proliferation to elongation associated with increased expression of cell wall–related genes. Our analysis revealed HOMEOBOX FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 7 ( HAT7 ) and GT-2-LIKE 1 ( GTL1 ) as brassinosteroid-responsive transcription factors that regulate cortex cell elongation. These results establish the cortex as a site of brassinosteroid-mediated growth and unveil a brassinosteroid signaling network regulating the transition from proliferation to elongation, which illuminates aspects of spatiotemporal hormone responses.},

  abstract     = {It is known that interactions between nociceptors and dendritic cells (DCs) can modulate immune responses in barrier tissues. However, our understanding of the underlying communication frameworks remains rudimentary. Here, we show that nociceptors control DCs in three molecularly distinct ways. First, nociceptors release the calcitonin gene–related peptide that imparts a distinct transcriptional profile on steady-state DCs characterized by expression of pro–interleukin-1β and other genes implicated in DC sentinel functions. Second, nociceptor activation induces contact-dependent calcium fluxes and membrane depolarization in DCs and enhances their production of proinflammatory cytokines when stimulated. Finally, nociceptor-derived chemokine CCL2 contributes to the orchestration of DC-dependent local inflammation and the induction of adaptive responses against skin-acquired antigens. Thus, the combined actions of nociceptor-derived chemokines, neuropeptides, and electrical activity fine-tune DC responses in barrier tissues.},

This mechanistic scenario is inapplicable to the synthesis of ketones from the 1,1-disubstituted alkenes. Current approaches based on semi -pinacol rearrangement of Pd II intermediates are limited to the ring expansion of highly strained methylene cyclobutane derivatives. Herein, we report a solution to this synthetic challenge by designing a Pd II /Pd IV catalytic cycle incorporating a 1,2-alkyl/Pd IV dyotropic rearrangement as a key step. This reaction, compatible with a broad range of functional groups, is applicable to both linear olefins and methylene cycloalkanes, including macrocycles. Regioselectivity favors the migration of the more substituted carbon, and a strong directing effect of the β-carboxyl group was also observed.},

We present a machine learning algorithm named CLEAN (contrastive learning–enabled enzyme annotation) to assign EC numbers to enzymes with better accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity compared with the state-of-the-art tool BLASTp. The contrastive learning framework empowers CLEAN to confidently (i) annotate understudied enzymes, (ii) correct mislabeled enzymes, and (iii) identify promiscuous enzymes with two or more EC numbers—functions that we demonstrate by systematic in silico and in vitro experiments. We anticipate that this tool will be widely used for predicting the functions of uncharacterized enzymes, thereby advancing many fields, such as genomics, synthetic biology, and biocatalysis.},

The identity of the metabotropic receptor mediating slow neuromodulatory effects of glycine is unknown. We identified an orphan G protein–coupled receptor, GPR158, as a metabotropic glycine receptor (mGlyR). Glycine and a related modulator, taurine, directly bind to a Cache domain of GPR158, and this event inhibits the activity of the intracellular signaling complex regulator of G protein signaling 7–G protein β5 (RGS7-Gβ5), which is associated with the receptor. Glycine signals through mGlyR to inhibit production of the second messenger adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate. We further show that glycine, but not taurine, acts through mGlyR to regulate neuronal excitability in cortical neurons. These results identify a major neuromodulatory system involved in mediating metabotropic effects of glycine, with implications for understanding cognition and affective states.},

Regressions of skull length and tooth size for a range of theropods and extant varanid lizards confirm that complete coverage of theropod dinosaur teeth with extraoral tissues (gingiva and labial scales) is both plausible and consistent with patterns observed in living ziphodont amniotes. Analyses of dental histology from crocodylians and theropod dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus rex , further indicate that the most likely condition was complete coverage of the marginal dentition with extraoral tissue when the mouth was closed. This changes our perceptions about the appearance and oral configuration of these iconic predators and has broad implications for our interpretations of other terrestrial animals with large teeth.},

We systematically examined common genetic variation across 1060 traits in a large population cohort (UK Biobank, N = 361,194 samples analyzed) for evidence of dominance effects. We then developed a computationally efficient method to rapidly assess the aggregate contribution of dominance deviations to heritability. Lastly, observing that dominance associations are inherently less correlated between sites at a genomic locus than their additive counterparts, we explored whether they may be leveraged to identify causal variants more confidently.},

  abstract     = {Aggregates of the protein tau are proposed to drive pathogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases. Tau can be targeted by using passively transferred antibodies (Abs), but the mechanisms of Ab protection are incompletely understood. In this work, we used a variety of cell and animal model systems and showed that the cytosolic Ab receptor and E3 ligase TRIM21 (T21) could play a role in Ab protection against tau pathology. Tau-Ab complexes were internalized to the cytosol of neurons, which enabled T21 engagement and protection against seeded aggregation. Ab-mediated protection against tau pathology was lost in mice that lacked T21. Thus, the cytosolic compartment provides a site of immunotherapeutic protection, which may help in the design of Ab-based therapies in neurodegenerative disease.},

  abstract     = {The Australian continent contributes substantially to the year-to-year variability of the global terrestrial carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) sink. However, the scarcity of in situ observations in remote areas prevents the deciphering of processes that force the CO 2 flux variability. In this study, by examining atmospheric CO 2 measurements from satellites in the period 2009–2018, we find recurrent end-of-dry-season CO 2 pulses over the Australian continent. These pulses largely control the year-to-year variability of Australia’s CO 2 balance. They cause two to three times larger seasonal variations compared with previous top-down inversions and bottom-up estimates. The pulses occur shortly after the onset of rainfall and are driven by enhanced soil respiration preceding photosynthetic uptake in Australia’s semiarid regions. The suggested continental-scale relevance of soil-rewetting processes has substantial implications for our understanding and modeling of global climate–carbon cycle feedbacks.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating pressurized fluidic circuits into textiles can enable muscular support, thermoregulation, and haptic feedback in a convenient wearable form factor. However, conventional rigid pumps, with their associated noise and vibration, are unsuitable for most wearables. We report fluidic pumps in the form of stretchable fibers. This allows pressure sources to be integrated directly into textiles, enabling untethered wearable fluidics. Our pumps consist of continuous helical electrodes embedded within the walls of thin elastomer tubing and generate pressure silently through charge-injection electrohydrodynamics. Each meter of fiber generates 100 kilopascals of pressure, and flow rates approaching 55 milliliters per minute are possible, which is equivalent to a power density of 15 watts per kilogram. The benefits in design freedom are considerable, which we illustrate with demonstrations of wearable haptics, mechanically active fabrics, and thermoregulatory textiles.},

Simulations have predicted that steady streams of cold gas penetrate the dark matter halos of galaxies and provide the raw material necessary to sustain star formation. We report a filamentary stream of gas that extends for 100 kiloparsecs and connects to the massive radio galaxy 4C 41.17. We detected the stream using submillimeter observations of the 3 P 1 to 3 P 0 emission from the [C i ] line of atomic carbon, a tracer of neutral atomic or molecular hydrogen gas. The galaxy contains a central gas reservoir that is fueling a vigorous starburst. Our results show that the raw material for star formation can be present in cosmic streams outside galaxies.},

  abstract     = {The horse is central to many Indigenous cultures across the American Southwest and the Great Plains. However, when and how horses were first integrated into Indigenous lifeways remain contentious, with extant models derived largely from colonial records. We conducted an interdisciplinary study of an assemblage of historic archaeological horse remains, integrating genomic, isotopic, radiocarbon, and paleopathological evidence. Archaeological and modern North American horses show strong Iberian genetic affinities, with later influx from British sources, but no Viking proximity. Horses rapidly spread from the south into the northern Rockies and central plains by the first half of the 17th century CE, likely through Indigenous exchange networks. They were deeply integrated into Indigenous societies before the arrival of 18th-century European observers, as reflected in herd management, ceremonial practices, and culture.},

  abstract     = {The use of alkaline salt lands for crop production is hindered by a scarcity of knowledge and breeding efforts for plant alkaline tolerance. Through genome association analysis of sorghum, a naturally high-alkaline–tolerant crop, we detected a major locus, Alkaline Tolerance 1 ( AT1 ), specifically related to alkaline-salinity sensitivity. An at1 allele with a carboxyl-terminal truncation increased sensitivity, whereas knockout of AT1 increased tolerance to alkalinity in sorghum, millet, rice, and maize. AT1 encodes an atypical G protein γ subunit that affects the phosphorylation of aquaporins to modulate the distribution of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) . These processes appear to protect plants against oxidative stress by alkali. Designing knockouts of AT1 homologs or selecting its natural nonfunctional alleles could improve crop productivity in sodic lands.},

We further identified the enzymes needed to make QS-7, a saponin with excellent therapeutic properties and low toxicity that is present in low abundance in Q. saponaria bark extract.

However, silicone-based components are integral to numerous advanced technologies and everyday consumer products. We developed a silicone 3D printing technique that produces precise, accurate, strong, and functional structures made from several commercially available silicone formulations. To achieve this level of performance, we developed a support material made from a silicone oil emulsion. This material exhibits negligible interfacial tension against silicone-based inks, eliminating the disruptive forces that often drive printed silicone features to deform and break apart. The versatility of this approach enables the use of established silicone formulations in fabricating complex structures and features as small as 8 micrometers in diameter.},

We demonstrate a direct synthetic route for scalable and atom-economic synthesis of MXenes, including compounds that have not been synthesized from MAX phases, by the reactions of metals and metal halides with graphite, methane, or nitrogen. The direct synthesis enables chemical vapor deposition growth of MXene carpets and complex spherulite-like morphologies that form through buckling and release of MXene carpet to expose fresh surface for further reaction.

We show that light versus dark seasonal pelage in white-tailed jackrabbits ( Lepus townsendii ) tracks snow cover and is primarily determined by genetic variation at endothelin receptor type B ( EDNRB ), corin serine peptidase ( CORIN ), and agouti signaling protein ( ASIP ). Winter color variation was associated with deeply divergent alleles at these genes, reflecting selection on both ancestral and introgressed variation. Forecasted reductions in snow cover are likely to induce widespread camouflage mismatch. However, simulated populations with variation for darker winter pelage are predicted to adapt rapidly, providing a trait-based genetic framework to facilitate evolutionary rescue. These discoveries demonstrate how the genetic basis of climate change adaptation can inform conservation.},

We tested to what extent the proximate mechanisms of emotional contagion are evolutionarily conserved by assessing the role of oxytocin, known to regulate empathic behaviors in mammals, in social fear contagion in zebrafish. Using oxytocin and oxytocin receptor mutants, we show that oxytocin is both necessary and sufficient for observer zebrafish to imitate the distressed behavior of conspecific demonstrators. The brain regions associated with emotional contagion in zebrafish are homologous to those involved in the same process in rodents (e.g., striatum, lateral septum), receiving direct projections from oxytocinergic neurons located in the pre-optic area. Together, our results support an evolutionary conserved role for oxytocin as a key regulator of basic empathic behaviors across vertebrates.},

We report a rational microlattice design that allows transformation of 2D films into programmable 3D curved mesosurfaces through mechanically guided assembly. Analytical modeling and a machine learning–based computational approach serve as the basis for shape programming and determine the heterogeneous 2D microlattice patterns required for target 3D curved surfaces. About 30 geometries are presented, including both regular and biological mesosurfaces.

This film can be grown on a variety of substrates with a cost-effective chemical solution deposition. We observed a standard ferroelectric hysteresis loop down to a thickness of ~1 nanometer. The thin films with thicknesses that range from 1 to 4.56 nanometers possess a relatively large remanent polarization from 17 to 50 microcoulombs per square centimeter. We verified the structure with first-principles calculations, which also pointed to the material being a lone pair–driven ferroelectric material.

In this study, we visualized the real-space charge landscape within a Kondo lattice with atomic resolution using a scanning tunneling microscope. We discovered nanometer-scale puddles of metallic conduction electrons centered around uranium-site substitutions in the heavy-fermion compound uranium ruthenium silicide (URu 2 Si 2 ) and around samarium-site defects in the topological Kondo insulator samarium hexaboride (SmB 6 ). These defects disturbed the Kondo screening cloud, leaving behind a fingerprint of the metallic parent state. Our results suggest that the three-dimensional quantum oscillations measured in SmB 6 arise from Kondo-lattice defects, although we cannot exclude other explanations. Our imaging technique could enable the development of atomic-scale charge sensors using heavy-fermion probes.},

Here, we report on the structures of cauliflower Pol V in the free and elongation conformations. A conserved tyrosine residue of NRPE2 stacks with a double-stranded DNA branch of the transcription bubble to potentially attenuate elongation by inducing transcription stalling. The nontemplate DNA strand is captured by NRPE2 to enhance backtracking, thereby increasing 3′-5′ cleavage, which likely underpins Pol V’s high fidelity. The structures also illuminate the mechanism of Pol V transcription stalling and enhanced backtracking, which may be important for Pol V’s retention on chromatin to serve its function in tethering downstream factors for RNA-directed DNA methylation.},

Choices about which problems scientists prioritize and which solutions policymakers select are infused with public values (1). Capturing these values can be as challenging as doing the science itself, so any process that makes decision-making more systematic and transparent, as storylistening is supposed to do, is welcome. However, as Craig and Dillon acknowledge, stories often do not tell the truth. In addition, stories do not always reflect universal values. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using the storylistening approach in policy advisory systems.},

Effective advisory systems that incorporate the natural, physical, and life sciences use mechanisms carefully calibrated to identify, synthesize, authenticate, challenge, and review such evidence. We advocate extending these mechanisms to the humanities and, in the case of storylistening, to the creation and use of narrative evidence.},

We present the physical, mathematical, and engineering foundations of this concept, with particular emphases on the roles of classical and quantum geometry and deep neural networks. Furthermore, we discuss the new opportunities that this emerging scheme can enable and the challenges associated with future developments.},

Here, we developed a workflow to profile posttranslational modifications involved in neoantigen formation. Using mass spectrometry, we identified a panel of cysteine residues differentially modified by carboxyethylation that required 3-hydroxypropionic acid to generate neoantigens in patients with AS. The lysosomal degradation of integrin αIIb [ITGA2B (CD41)] carboxyethylated at Cys96 (ITGA2B-ceC96) generated carboxyethylated peptides that were presented by HLA-DRB1*04 to stimulate CD4 + T cell responses and induce autoantibody production. Immunization of HLA-DR4 transgenic mice with the ITGA2B-ceC96 peptide promoted colitis and vertebral bone erosion. Thus, metabolite-induced cysteine carboxyethylation can give rise to pathogenic neoantigens that lead to autoreactive CD4 + T cell responses and autoantibody production in autoimmune diseases.},

The mechanisms bacteria use to colonize the gut therefore present valuable targets for clinical intervention. We now report that bacteria use phase separation to enhance fitness in the mammalian gut. We establish that the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the broadly and highly conserved transcription termination factor Rho is necessary and sufficient for phase separation in vivo and in vitro in the human commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron . Phase separation increases transcription termination by Rho in an IDR-dependent manner. Moreover, the IDR is critical for gene regulation in the gut. Our findings expose phase separation as vital for host-commensal bacteria interactions and relevant for novel clinical applications.},

TDP-43 mislocalization results in cryptic splicing and polyadenylation of pre–messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) encoding stathmin-2 (also known as SCG10), a protein that is required for axonal regeneration. We found that TDP-43 binding to a GU-rich region sterically blocked recognition of the cryptic 3′ splice site in STMN2 pre-mRNA. Targeting dCasRx or antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) suppressed cryptic splicing, which restored axonal regeneration and stathmin-2–dependent lysosome trafficking in TDP-43–deficient human motor neurons. In mice that were gene-edited to contain human STMN2 cryptic splice-polyadenylation sequences, ASO injection into cerebral spinal fluid successfully corrected Stmn2 pre-mRNA misprocessing and restored stathmin-2 expression levels independently of TDP-43 binding.},

  abstract     = {The initial evolution of warning signals in unprofitable prey, termed aposematism, is often seen as a paradox because any new conspicuous mutant would be easier to detect than its cryptic conspecifics and not readily recognized by naïve predators as defended. One possibility is that permanent aposematism first evolved through species using hidden warning signals, which are only exposed to would-be predators on encounter. Here, we present a large-scale analysis of evolutionary transitions in amphibian antipredation coloration and demonstrate that the evolutionary transition from camouflage to aposematism is rarely direct but tends to involve an intermediary stage, namely cryptic species that facultatively reveal conspicuous coloration. Accounting for this intermediate step can resolve the paradox and thereby advance our understanding of the evolution of aposematism.},

We report a structural editing protocol for layered carbides (MAX phases) and their 2D derivatives (MXenes). Gap-opening and species-intercalating stages were respectively mediated by chemical scissors and intercalants, which created a large family of MAX phases with unconventional elements and structures, as well as MXenes with versatile terminals. The removal of terminals in MXenes with metal scissors and then the stitching of 2D carbide nanosheets with atom intercalation leads to the reconstruction of MAX phases and a family of metal-intercalated 2D carbides, both of which may drive advances in fields ranging from energy to printed electronics.},

This results in an order-of-magnitude acceleration of high-resolution structure prediction, which enables large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins.

Cryo–electron microscopy structures showed that BIRC6 forms a megadalton crescent shape that arcs around a spacious cavity containing receptor sites for client proteins. Multivalent binding of SMAC obstructs client binding, impeding ubiquitination of both autophagy and apoptotic substrates. On the basis of these data, we discuss how the BIRC6/SMAC complex can act as a stress-induced hub to regulate apoptosis and autophagy drivers.},

  abstract     = {Certain inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family members are sentinel proteins that prevent untimely cell death by inhibiting caspases. Antagonists, including second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC), regulate IAPs and drive cell death. Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 6 (BIRC6), a giant IAP with dual E2 and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, regulates programmed cell death through unknown mechanisms. We show that BIRC6 directly restricts executioner caspase-3 and -7 and ubiquitinates caspase-3, -7, and -9, working exclusively with noncanonical E1, UBA6. Notably, we show that SMAC suppresses both mechanisms. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of BIRC6 alone and in complex with SMAC reveal that BIRC6 is an antiparallel dimer juxtaposing the substrate-binding module against the catalytic domain. Furthermore, we discover that SMAC multisite binding to BIRC6 results in a subnanomolar affinity interaction, enabling SMAC to competitively displace caspases, thus antagonizing BIRC6 anticaspase function.},

  abstract     = {Tight regulation of apoptosis is essential for metazoan development and prevents diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Caspase activation is central to apoptosis, and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are the principal actors that restrain caspase activity and are therefore attractive therapeutic targets. IAPs, in turn, are regulated by mitochondria-derived proapoptotic factors such as SMAC and HTRA2. Through a series of cryo–electron microscopy structures of full-length human baculoviral IAP repeat–containing protein 6 (BIRC6) bound to SMAC, caspases, and HTRA2, we provide a molecular understanding for BIRC6-mediated caspase inhibition and its release by SMAC. The architecture of BIRC6, together with near-irreversible binding of SMAC, elucidates how the IAP inhibitor SMAC can effectively control a processive ubiquitin ligase to respond to apoptotic stimuli.},

We characterized neuron types, hubs, feedforward and feedback pathways, as well as cross-hemisphere and brain-nerve cord interactions. We found pervasive multisensory and interhemispheric integration, highly recurrent architecture, abundant feedback from descending neurons, and multiple novel circuit motifs. The brain’s most recurrent circuits comprised the input and output neurons of the learning center. Some structural features, including multilayer shortcuts and nested recurrent loops, resembled state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. The identified brain architecture provides a basis for future experimental and theoretical studies of neural circuits.},

  abstract     = {Islands have long been recognized as distinctive evolutionary arenas leading to morphologically divergent species, such as dwarfs and giants. We assessed how body size evolution in island mammals may have exacerbated their vulnerability, as well as how human arrival has contributed to their past and ongoing extinctions, by integrating data on 1231 extant and 350 extinct species from islands and paleo islands worldwide spanning the past 23 million years. We found that the likelihood of extinction and of endangerment are highest in the most extreme island dwarfs and giants. Extinction risk of insular mammals was compounded by the arrival of modern humans, which accelerated extinction rates more than 10-fold, resulting in an almost complete demise of these iconic marvels of island evolution.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsic optoelectronic properties of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) remain largely unexplored because of luminescence quenching effects that are due to the metallic substrate on which the ribbons are grown. We probed excitonic emission from GNRs synthesized on a metal surface with atomic-scale spatial resolution. A scanning tunneling microscope (STM)–based method to transfer the GNRs to a partially insulating surface was used to prevent luminescence quenching of the ribbons. STM-induced fluorescence spectra reveal emission from localized dark excitons that are associated with the topological end states of the GNRs. A low-frequency vibronic emission comb is observed and attributed to longitudinal acoustic modes that are confined to a finite box. Our study provides a path to investigate the interplay between excitons, vibrons, and topology in graphene nanostructures.},

By characterizing chromatin accessibility and gene expression in developing wing tissues, we compared the regulatory architecture of convergence between a pair of mimetic butterfly species. Although a handful of color pattern genes are known to be involved in their convergence, our data suggest that different mutational paths underlie the integration of these genes into wing pattern development. This is supported by a large fraction of accessible chromatin being exclusive to each species, including the de novo lineage-specific evolution of a modular optix enhancer. These findings may be explained by a high level of developmental drift and evolutionary contingency that occurs during the independent evolution of mimicry.},

Electrocatalysis represents a more sustainable alternative, in particular through the use of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in place of a chemical oxidant. In this work, we describe strategies for HER-coupled enantioselective aryl carbon-hydrogen bond (C–H) activation reactions using cobalt in place of a precious metal catalyst for the asymmetric oxidation. Thus, highly enantioselective carbon-hydrogen and nitrogen-hydrogen (C–H and N–H) annulations of carboxylic amides were achieved, which gave access to point and axially chiral compounds. Furthermore, the cobalt-mediated electrocatalysis enabled the preparation of various phosphorus (P)–stereogenic compounds by selective desymmetrization through dehydrogenative C–H activation reactions.},

At energies below the ~100-centimeter −1 well depth of the interaction potential, we observed backward glories originating from peculiar U-turn trajectories. At energies below 0.2 centimeter −1 , we observed a breakdown of the Langevin capture model, which we interpreted in terms of a suppressed mutual polarization during the collision, effectively switching off the molecular dipole moments. Scattering calculations based on an ab initio NO-ND 3 potential energy surface revealed the crucial role of near-degenerate rotational levels with opposite parity in low-energy dipolar collisions.},

Yet if this condition is not met, it is possible to attain negative temperatures for which higher-order energy states are thermodynamically favored. Although negative temperatures have been reported in spin and Bose-Hubbard settings as well as in quantum fluids, the observation of thermodynamic processes in this regime has thus far remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate isentropic expansion-compression and Joule expansion for negative optical temperatures, enabled by purely nonlinear photon-photon interactions in a thermodynamic microcanonical photonic system. Our photonic approach provides a platform for exploring new all-optical thermal engines and could have ramifications in other bosonic systems beyond optics, such as cold atoms and optomechanics.},

Their “waggle dance” communicates the direction, distance, and quality of a resource to nestmates by encoding celestial cues, retinal optic flow, and relative food value into motion and sound within the nest. We show that correct waggle dancing requires social learning. Bees without the opportunity to follow any dances before they first danced produced significantly more disordered dances with larger waggle angle divergence errors and encoded distance incorrectly. The former deficit improved with experience, but distance encoding was set for life. The first dances of bees that could follow other dancers showed neither impairment. Social learning, therefore, shapes honey bee signaling, as it does communication in human infants, birds, and multiple other vertebrate species.},

Such precision has previously required attaching disproportionately large beads to the protein, but MINFLUX requires the detection of only about 20 photons from an approximately 1-nanometer-sized fluorophore. Therefore, we were able to study the stepping of the motor protein kinesin-1 on microtubules at up to physiological adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) concentrations. We uncovered rotations of the stalk and the heads of load-free kinesin during stepping and showed that ATP is taken up with a single head bound to the microtubule and that ATP hydrolysis occurs when both heads are bound. Our results show that MINFLUX quantifies (sub)millisecond conformational changes of proteins with minimal disturbance.},

Analysis of 33 enzymes from human carbohydrate metabolism identified 830 protein-metabolite interactions, including known regulators, substrates, and products as well as previously unreported interactions. We functionally validated a subset of interactions, including the isoform-specific inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase by long-chain acyl–coenzyme A. Cell treatment with fatty acids caused a loss of pyruvate-lactate interconversion dependent on lactate dehydrogenase isoform expression. These protein-metabolite interactions may contribute to the dynamic, tissue-specific metabolic flexibility that enables growth and survival in an ever-changing nutrient environment.},

We present a large-scale replicated and controlled set of whole-lake experiments in fish conservation (20 lakes monitored over 6 years with more than 150,000 fish sampled) to examine the outcomes of ecosystem-based habitat enhancement (coarse woody habitat addition and shallow littoral zone creation) versus a widespread, species-focused alternative that has long dominated fisheries management practice (i.e., fish stocking). Adding coarse woody habitats alone did not, on average, enhance fish abundance, but creating shallow water habitat consistently did, especially for juvenile fish. Species-focused fish stocking completely failed. We provide strong evidence questioning the performance of species-focused conservation actions in aquatic ecosystems and instead recommend ecosystem-based management of key habitats.},

The chemical stability of the peptide-based tag allows the use of palladium-mediated reactions to efficiently synthesize peptide-encoded libraries (PELs) with broad chemical diversity and high purity. We demonstrate the successful de novo discovery of small-molecule protein ligands from PELs by affinity selection against carbonic anhydrase IX and the oncogenic protein targets BRD4(1) and MDM2. Collectively, this work establishes abiotic peptides as carriers of information for the encoding of small-molecule synthesis, leveraged herein for the discovery of protein ligands.},

Efforts to retool the plant immune system have been limited to modifying natural components and can be nullified by the emergence of new pathogen strains. Made-to-order synthetic plant immune receptors provide an opportunity to tailor resistance to pathogen genotypes present in the field. In this work, we show that plant nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs) can be used as scaffolds for nanobody (single-domain antibody fragment) fusions that bind fluorescent proteins (FPs). These fusions trigger immune responses in the presence of the corresponding FP and confer resistance against plant viruses expressing FPs. Because nanobodies can be raised against most molecules, immune receptor–nanobody fusions have the potential to generate resistance against plant pathogens and pests delivering effectors inside host cells.},

How their supposedly air-driven sound source can produce biosonar clicks at depths of &gt;1000 meters, while also producing rich vocal repertoires to mediate complex social communication, remains unknown. We show that odontocetes possess a sound production system based on air driven through nasal passages that is functionally analogous to laryngeal and syringeal sound production. Tissue vibration in different registers produces distinct echolocation and communication signals across all major odontocete clades, and thus provides a physiological basis for classifying their vocal repertoires. The vocal fry register is used by species from porpoises to sperm whales for generating powerful, highly air-efficient echolocation clicks.},

Our theory is valid in the low-density regime, and it makes different predictions about situations in which lanes may form that are not parallel with the direction of flow. We report on experiments with human crowds that verify two notable consequences of this phenomenon: tilting lanes under broken chiral symmetry and lane nucleation along elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic curves in the presence of sources or sinks.},

We used a satellite-based atmospheric inversion system to monitor fire emissions in boreal forests. Wildfires are rapidly expanding into boreal forests with emerging warmer and drier fire seasons. Boreal fires, typically accounting for 10\% of global fire carbon dioxide emissions, contributed 23\% (0.48 billion metric tons of carbon) in 2021, by far the highest fraction since 2000. 2021 was an abnormal year because North American and Eurasian boreal forests synchronously experienced their greatest water deficit.

We found that the usual single absorption peak in the Fermi-liquid regime splits into two peaks upon entering the critical regime. We interpret this spectrum as a single nuclear transition, modulated by nearby electronic valence fluctuations whose long time scales are further enhanced by the formation of charged polarons. These critical charge fluctuations may prove to be a distinct signature of strange metals.},

  abstract     = {Mutations in the 3′ to 5′ RNA exonuclease USB1 cause hematopoietic failure in poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN). Although USB1 is known to regulate U6 small nuclear RNA maturation, the molecular mechanism underlying PN remains undetermined, as pre-mRNA splicing is unaffected in patients. We generated human embryonic stem cells harboring the PN-associated mutation c.531_delA in USB1 and show that this mutation impairs human hematopoiesis. Dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) levels in USB1 mutants during blood development contribute to hematopoietic failure, because of a failure to remove 3′-end adenylated tails added by PAPD5/7. Modulation of miRNA 3′-end adenylation through genetic or chemical inhibition of PAPD5/7 rescues hematopoiesis in USB1 mutants. This work shows that USB1 acts as a miRNA deadenylase and suggests PAPD5/7 inhibition as a potential therapy for PN.},

  abstract     = {We elucidate grapevine evolution and domestication histories with 3525 cultivated and wild accessions worldwide. In the Pleistocene, harsh climate drove the separation of wild grape ecotypes caused by continuous habitat fragmentation. Then, domestication occurred concurrently about 11,000 years ago in Western Asia and the Caucasus to yield table and wine grapevines. The Western Asia domesticates dispersed into Europe with early farmers, introgressed with ancient wild western ecotypes, and subsequently diversified along human migration trails into muscat and unique western wine grape ancestries by the late Neolithic. Analyses of domestication traits also reveal new insights into selection for berry palatability, hermaphroditism, muscat flavor, and berry skin color. These data demonstrate the role of the grapevines in the early inception of agriculture across Eurasia.},

Their toxic properties make them carcinogenic, endocrine disruptive, and immunotoxic (3).

Most EW animal species—already compromised by their small number of founders—are maintained at population sizes far below the thresholds necessary to ensure demographic security. Most EW plant species depend on live propagation by a small number of botanic gardens, with a minority secured at seed bank institutions.

We investigated the macromolecular organic matter in Ryugu samples and found that it contains aromatic and aliphatic carbon, ketone, and carboxyl functional groups. The spectroscopic features of the organic matter are consistent with those in chemically primitive carbonaceous chondrite meteorites that experienced parent-body aqueous alteration (reactions with liquid water). The morphology of the organic carbon includes nanoglobules and diffuse carbon associated with phyllosilicate and carbonate minerals. Deuterium and/or nitrogen-15 enrichments indicate that the organic matter formed in a cold molecular cloud or the presolar nebula. The diversity of the organic matter indicates variable levels of aqueous alteration on Ryugu’s parent body.},

  abstract     = {The Hayabusa2 spacecraft collected samples from the surface of the carbonaceous near-Earth asteroid (162173) Ryugu and brought them to Earth. The samples were expected to contain organic molecules, which record processes that occurred in the early Solar System. We analyzed organic molecules extracted from the Ryugu surface samples. We identified a variety of molecules containing the atoms CHNOS, formed by methylation, hydration, hydroxylation, and sulfurization reactions. Amino acids, aliphatic amines, carboxylic acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds were detected, which had properties consistent with an abiotic origin. These compounds likely arose from an aqueous reaction on Ryugu’s parent body and are similar to the organics in Ivuna-type meteorites. These molecules can survive on the surfaces of asteroids and be transported throughout the Solar System.},

The earliest-stage antler initiators were mesenchymal cells that express the paired related homeobox 1 gene ( PRRX1 + mesenchymal cells). We also identified a population of “antler blastema progenitor cells” (ABPCs) that developed from the PRRX1 + mesenchymal cells and directed the antler regeneration process. Cross-species comparisons identified ABPCs in several mammalian blastema. In vivo and in vitro ABPCs displayed strong self-renewal ability and could generate osteochondral lineage cells. Last, we observed a spatially well-structured pattern of cellular and gene expression in antler growth center during the peak growth stage, revealing the cellular mechanisms involved in rapid antler elongation.},

We present a multidecadal record of phytoplankton photophysiology between 1996 and 2022 from historical in situ datasets collected by Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) floats and ship-based platforms. We find a significant multidecadal trend in irradiance-normalized nonphotochemical quenching due to increasing iron stress, with concomitant declines in regional net primary production. The observed trend of increasing iron stress results from changing Southern Ocean mixed-layer physics as well as complex biological and chemical feedback that is indicative of important ongoing changes to the Southern Ocean carbon cycle.},

We previously found that a strain of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (strain Lp WJL ) buffers the adverse effects of chronic undernutrition on the growth of juvenile germ-free mice. Here, we report that Lp WJL sustains the postnatal growth of malnourished conventional animals and supports both insulin-like growth factor–1 (IGF-1) and insulin production and activity. We have identified cell walls isolated from Lp WJL , as well as muramyl dipeptide and mifamurtide, as sufficient cues to stimulate animal growth despite undernutrition. Further, we found that NOD2 is necessary in intestinal epithelial cells for Lp WJL -mediated IGF-1 production and for postnatal growth promotion in malnourished conventional animals. These findings indicate that, coupled with renutrition, bacteria cell walls or purified NOD2 ligands have the potential to alleviate stunting.},

We found that the ejaculation experience selectively activated estrogen receptor 2 ( Esr2 )–expressing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)—BNST Esr2 —and led to persistent decreases in firing threshold for days, during which time the mice displayed sexual satiety. Inhibition of hyperexcited BNST Esr2 elicited fast mating recovery in satiated mice of both sexes. In males, such hyperexcitability reduced mating motivation and was partially mediated by larger HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) currents. Thus, BNST Esr2 not only encode a specific mating action but also represent a persistent state of sexual satiety, and alterations in a neuronal ion channel contribute to sexual experience–dependent long-term changes to mating drive.},

PyroCb have been tracked for years, yet their apparent rarity and episodic nature lead to highly uncertain climate impacts. In situ measurements of pyroCb smoke reveal its distinctive and exceptionally stable aerosol properties and define the long-term influence of pyroCb activity on the stratospheric aerosol budget. Analysis of 13 years of airborne observations shows that pyroCb are responsible for 10 to 25\% of the black carbon and organic aerosols in the “present-day” lower stratosphere, with similar impacts in both the North and South Hemispheres. These results suggest that, should pyroCb increase in frequency and/or magnitude in future climates, they could generate dominant trends in stratospheric aerosol.},

We present the first large-scale phylogenetic comparative analysis examining developmental strategies underlying the evolution of body size, focusing on non-avialan theropod dinosaurs. We reconstruct ancestral states of growth rate and body mass in a taxonomically rich dataset, finding that contrary to expectations, changes in the rate and duration of growth played nearly equal roles in the evolution of the vast body size disparity present in non-avialan theropods—and perhaps that of amniotes in general.},

We present a distinctive approach that uses a highly ionic reaction environment to increase the polymer reactivity and lower the energy of ionic transition states. Combining endothermic cleavage of the polymer C–C bonds with exothermic alkylation reactions of the cracking products enables full conversion of polyethylene and polypropylene to liquid isoalkanes (C 6 to C 10 ) at temperatures below 100°C. Both reactions are catalyzed by a Lewis acidic species that is generated in a chloroaluminate ionic liquid. The alkylate product forms a separate phase and is easily separated from the reactant catalyst mixture. The process can convert unprocessed postconsumer items to high-quality liquid alkanes with high yields.},

The difference between static solid-state electronics and dynamic biological matter makes seamless integration of the two challenging. To address this incompatibility, we developed a method to dynamically create soft substrate-free conducting materials within the biological environment. We demonstrate in vivo electrode formation in zebrafish and leech models, using endogenous metabolites to trigger enzymatic polymerization of organic precursors within an injectable gel, thereby forming conducting polymer gels with long-range conductivity. This approach can be used to target specific biological substructures and is suitable for nerve stimulation, paving the way for fully integrated, in vivo–fabricated electronics within the nervous system.},

Chemical communication through volatile pheromones is common among insects; however, it remains unknown if and how such chemical communication occurs in tsetse flies. We identified methyl palmitoleate (MPO), methyl oleate, and methyl palmitate as compounds that are produced by the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans and elicit strong behavioral responses. MPO evoked a behavioral response in male—but not virgin female— G. morsitans . G. morsitans males mounted females of another species, Glossina fuscipes , when they were treated with MPO. We further identified a subpopulation of olfactory neurons in G. morsitans that increase their firing rate in response to MPO and showed that infecting flies with African trypanosomes alters the flies’ chemical profile and mating behavior. The identification of volatile attractants in tsetse flies may be useful for reducing disease spread.},

However, the extracellular matrix (ECM), which comprises at least a third of tissue structures, remains relatively underexplored in immunology. Similarly, matrix biologists often overlook regulation of complex structural matrices by the immune system. We are only beginning to understand the scale at which ECM structures determine immune cell localization and function. Additionally, we need to better understand how immune cells dictate ECM complexity. This review aims to highlight the potential for biological discovery at the interface of immunology and matrix biology.},

Here, we show that human CD1c + CD5 + DCs are reduced in melanoma-affected lymph nodes, with CD5 expression on DCs correlating with patient survival. Activating CD5 on DCs enhanced T cell priming and improved survival after ICB therapy. CD5 + DC numbers increased during ICB therapy, and low interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations promoted their de novo differentiation. Mechanistically, CD5 expression by DCs was required to generate optimally protective CD5 hi T helper and CD8 + T cells; further, deletion of CD5 from T cells dampened tumor elimination in response to ICB therapy in vivo. Thus, CD5 + DCs are an essential component of optimal ICB therapy.},

  abstract     = {Methylation of histone H3 lysine-79 (H3K79) is an epigenetic mark for gene regulation in development, cellular differentiation, and disease progression. However, how this histone mark is translated into downstream effects remains poorly understood owing to a lack of knowledge about its readers. We developed a nucleosome-based photoaffinity probe to capture proteins that recognize H3K79 dimethylation (H3K79me2) in a nucleosomal context. In combination with a quantitative proteomics approach, this probe identified menin as a H3K79me2 reader. A cryo–electron microscopy structure of menin bound to an H3K79me2 nucleosome revealed that menin engages with the nucleosome using its fingers and palm domains and recognizes the methylation mark through a π-cation interaction. In cells, menin is selectively associated with H3K79me2 on chromatin, particularly in gene bodies.},

  abstract     = {Plate motion on shallow subduction megathrusts is accommodated by a spectrum of tectonic slip modes. However, the frictional properties and conditions that sustain these diverse slip behaviors remain enigmatic. Frictional healing is one such property, which describes the degree of fault restrengthening between earthquakes. We show that the frictional healing rate of materials entrained along the megathrust at the northern Hikurangi margin, which hosts well-characterized recurring shallow slow slip events (SSEs), is nearly zero (&lt;0.0001 per decade). These low healing rates provide a mechanism for the low stress drops (&lt;50 kilopascals) and short recurrence times (1 to 2 years) characteristic of shallow SSEs at Hikurangi and other subduction margins. We suggest that near-zero frictional healing rates, associated with weak phyllosilicates that are common in subduction zones, may promote frequent, small-stress-drop, slow ruptures near the trench.},

Recently, lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction has proven to be a promising route for electrochemical ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions. In this work, we report a continuous-flow electrolyzer equipped with 25–square centimeter–effective area gas diffusion electrodes wherein nitrogen reduction is coupled with hydrogen oxidation. We show that the classical catalyst platinum is not stable for hydrogen oxidation in the organic electrolyte, but a platinum-gold alloy lowers the anode potential and avoids the decremental decomposition of the organic electrolyte. At optimal operating conditions, we achieve, at 1 bar, a faradaic efficiency for ammonia production of up to 61 ± 1\% and an energy efficiency of 13 ± 1\% at a current density of −6 milliamperes per square centimeter.},

Activation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) is essential for psychedelic-induced cortical plasticity, but it is currently unclear why some 5-HT2AR agonists promote neuroplasticity, whereas others do not. We used molecular and genetic tools to demonstrate that intracellular 5-HT2ARs mediate the plasticity-promoting properties of psychedelics; these results explain why serotonin does not engage similar plasticity mechanisms. This work emphasizes the role of location bias in 5-HT2AR signaling, identifies intracellular 5-HT2ARs as a therapeutic target, and raises the intriguing possibility that serotonin might not be the endogenous ligand for intracellular 5-HT2ARs in the cortex.},

We report the discovery of a reflector overlying the eye pigments in larval decapod crustaceans and show how it is tuned to render the organisms inconspicuous against the background. The ultracompact reflector is constructed from a photonic glass of crystalline isoxanthopterin nanospheres. The nanospheres’ size and ordering are modulated to tune the reflectance from deep blue to yellow, enabling concealment in different habitats. The reflector may also function to enhance the acuity or sensitivity of the minute eyes by acting as an optical screen between photoreceptors. This multifunctional reflector offers inspiration for constructing tunable artificial photonic materials from biocompatible organic molecules.},

  abstract     = {Inserting an ultrathin low-conductivity interlayer between the absorber and transport layer has emerged as an important strategy for reducing surface recombination in the best perovskite solar cells. However, a challenge with this approach is a trade-off between the open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) and the fill factor (FF). Here, we overcame this challenge by introducing a thick (about 100 nanometers) insulator layer with random nanoscale openings. We performed drift-diffusion simulations for cells with this porous insulator contact (PIC) and realized it using a solution process by controlling the growth mode of alumina nanoplates. Leveraging a PIC with an approximately 25\% reduced contact area, we achieved an efficiency of up to 25.5\% (certified steady-state efficiency 24.7\%) in p-i-n devices. The product of V oc × FF was 87.9\% of the Shockley-Queisser limit. The surface recombination velocity at the p-type contact was reduced from 64.2 to 9.2 centimeters per second. The bulk recombination lifetime was increased from 1.2 to 6.0 microseconds because of improvements in the perovskite crystallinity. The improved wettability of the perovskite precursor solution allowed us to demonstrate a 23.3\% efficient 1-square-centimeter p-i-n cell. We demonstrate here its broad applicability for different p-type contacts and perovskite compositions.},

Using a massively parallel assay for m 6 A (MPm 6 A), we discover that m 6 A specificity is globally regulated by suppressors that prevent m 6 A deposition in unmethylated transcriptome regions. We identify exon junction complexes (EJCs) as m 6 A suppressors that protect exon junction–proximal RNA within coding sequences from methylation and regulate mRNA stability through m 6 A suppression. EJC suppression of m 6 A underlies multiple global characteristics of mRNA m 6 A specificity, with the local range of EJC protection sufficient to suppress m 6 A deposition in average-length internal exons but not in long internal and terminal exons. EJC-suppressed methylation sites colocalize with EJC-suppressed splice sites, which suggests that exon architecture broadly determines local mRNA accessibility to regulatory complexes.},

In this work, we investigated such behavior by using scanning tunneling potentiometry to probe the nanometer-scale flow of electron fluids in graphene as they pass through channels defined by smooth and tunable in-plane p-n junction barriers. We observed that as the sample temperature and channel widths are increased, the electron fluid flow undergoes a Knudsen-to-Gurzhi transition from the ballistic to the viscous regime characterized by a channel conductance that exceeds the ballistic limit, as well as suppressed charge accumulation against the barriers. Our results are well modeled by finite element simulations of two-dimensional viscous current flow, and they illustrate how Fermi liquid flow evolves with carrier density, channel width, and temperature.},

This approach to monitoring also serves to assess the effectiveness of mitigation and includes communities with minimal individual testing. However, Levy et al. say little about the ethical or legal considerations that must be considered when expanding wastewater surveillance to new targets or communities. Although wastewater monitoring itself is not new, recent pandemic-stimulated growth in monitoring infrastructure and personnel, technological innovations, and proposals for wider application have made the need for ethical review and oversight urgent. Given that interest in and applications of wastewater surveillance continue to grow, the scientific community and government officials have an obligation to use the technology ethically and legally, ensuring that personal data remains private and vulnerable groups are protected (2, 3).},

We explored whether mitochondria influence the species-specific timing of cortical neuron maturation. By comparing human and mouse cortical neuronal maturation at high temporal and cell resolution, we found a slower mitochondria development in human cortical neurons compared with that in the mouse, together with lower mitochondria metabolic activity, particularly that of oxidative phosphorylation. Stimulation of mitochondria metabolism in human neurons resulted in accelerated development in vitro and in vivo, leading to maturation of cells weeks ahead of time, whereas its inhibition in mouse neurons led to decreased rates of maturation. Mitochondria are thus important regulators of the pace of neuronal development underlying human-specific brain neoteny.},

In this Review, we discuss modern approaches to epigenetic and gene regulation landscapes and the associated ideas of entropy and attractor states, illustrating how their definitions are both more precise and relevant to understanding cancer etiology and the plasticity of cancerous states. We address the interplay between different types of regulatory landscapes and how their changes underlie cancer progression. We also consider the roles of cellular aging and intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli in modulating cellular states and how landscape alterations can be quantitatively mapped onto phenotypic outcomes and thereby used in therapy development.},

We identified with in silico compound screening and functional analysis a derivative of a natural product from Streptomyces , called trifluoromethyl-tubercidin (TFMT), that inhibits MTr1 through interaction at its S -adenosyl- l -methionine binding pocket to restrict influenza virus replication. Mechanistically, TFMT impairs the association of host cap RNAs with the viral polymerase basic protein 2 subunit in human lung explants and in vivo in mice. TFMT acts synergistically with approved anti-influenza drugs.},

These fluids represent a key communication pathway between Earth’s interior and hydrothermal pools. We use zircon chemistry, experiments, and modeling to infer the character of lithospheric fluids approaching 4 billion years. We constrain oxygen fugacity, chlorine content, and temperature, which allow us to model the solubility and transport of metals that are hypothesized to be crucial for the origin of life. We show that these fluids were more oxidized than the terrestrial mantle during this time and that they were interacting with near-surface aqueous systems, possibly subaerial hydrothermal pools, amplifying redox gradients in a location attractive for prebiotic molecular synthesis or sustained microbial activity.},

Here, we report that a speciation locus in monkeyflowers ( Mimulus ), YELLOW UPPER ( YUP ), contains an inverted repeat region that produces small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in a phased pattern. Although the inverted repeat is derived from a partial duplication of a protein-coding gene that is not involved in flower pigmentation, one of the siRNAs targets and represses a master regulator of floral carotenoid pigmentation. YUP emerged with two protein-coding genes that control other aspects of flower coloration as a “superlocus” in a subclade of Mimulus and has contributed to subsequent phenotypic diversification and pollinator-mediated speciation in the descendant species.},

Teleosts are the largest and most diversified group of extant vertebrates, but relationships among their three oldest extant lineages remain unresolved. On the basis of seven high-quality new genome assemblies in Elopomorpha (tarpons, eels), we revisited the topology of the deepest branches of the teleost phylogeny using independent gene sequence and chromosomal rearrangement phylogenomic approaches. These analyses converged to a single scenario that unambiguously places the Elopomorpha and Osteoglossomorpha (arapaima, elephantnose fish) in a monophyletic sister group to all other teleosts, i.e., the Clupeocephala lineage (zebrafish, medaka). This finding resolves more than 50 years of controversy on the evolutionary relationships of these lineages and highlights the power of combining different levels of genome-wide information to solve complex phylogenies.},

We report an exceptionally preserved Early Triassic fossil assemblage, the Guiyang Biota, from the Daye Formation near Guiyang, South China. High-precision uranium-lead dating shows that the age of the Guiyang Biota is 250.83 +0.07/–0.06 million years ago. This is only 1.08 ± 0.08 million years after the severe Permian-Triassic mass extinction, and this assemblage therefore represents the oldest known Mesozoic lagerstätte found so far. The Guiyang Biota comprises at least 12 classes and 19 orders, including diverse fish fauna and malacostracans, revealing a trophically complex marine ecosystem. Therefore, this assemblage demonstrates the rapid rise of modern-type marine ecosystems after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction.},

  abstract     = {The oldest Oldowan tool sites, from around 2.6 million years ago, have previously been confined to Ethiopia’s Afar Triangle. We describe sites at Nyayanga, Kenya, dated to 3.032 to 2.581 million years ago and expand this distribution by over 1300 kilometers. Furthermore, we found two hippopotamid butchery sites associated with mosaic vegetation and a C 4 grazer–dominated fauna. Tool flaking proficiency was comparable with that of younger Oldowan assemblages, but pounding activities were more common. Tool use-wear and bone damage indicate plant and animal tissue processing. Paranthropus sp. teeth, the first from southwestern Kenya, possessed carbon isotopic values indicative of a diet rich in C 4 foods. We argue that the earliest Oldowan was more widespread than previously known, used to process diverse foods including megafauna, and associated with Paranthropus from its onset.},

  abstract     = {Negative refraction provides a platform to manipulate mid-infrared and terahertz radiation for molecular sensing and thermal emission applications. However, its implementation based on metamaterials and plasmonic media presents challenges with optical losses, limited spatial confinement, and lack of active tunability in this spectral range. We demonstrate gate-tunable negative refraction at mid-infrared frequencies using hybrid topological polaritons in van der Waals heterostructures. Specifically, we visualize wide-angle negatively refracted polaritons in α-MoO 3 films partially decorated with graphene, undergoing reversible planar nanoscale focusing. Our atomically thick heterostructures weaken scattering losses at the interface while enabling an actively tunable transition of normal to negative refraction through electrical gating. We propose polaritonic negative refraction as a promising platform for infrared applications such as electrically tunable super-resolution imaging, nanoscale thermal manipulation, enhanced molecular sensing, and on-chip optical circuitry.},

The polaritons—hybrids of infrared photons and lattice vibrations—form collimated rays that display negative refraction when passing through a planar interface between the two hyperbolic van der Waals materials: molybdenum oxide (MoO 3 ) and isotopically pure hexagonal boron nitride (h 11 BN). At a special frequency ω 0 , these rays can circulate along closed diamond-shaped trajectories. We have shown that polariton eigenmodes display regions of both positive and negative dispersion interrupted by multiple gaps that result from polaritonic-level repulsion and strong coupling.},

Plants offer advantages for addressing this problem because their cells do not migrate or rearrange during morphogenesis, which simplifies analysis. We synthesize results from experimental analysis and computational modeling to show how mechanical interactions between cellulose fibers translate through wall, cell, and tissue levels to generate complex plant tissue shapes. Genes can modify mechanical properties and stresses at each level, though the values and pattern of stresses differ from one level to the next. The dynamic cellulose network provides elastic resistance to deformation while allowing growth through fiber sliding, which enables morphogenesis while maintaining mechanical strength.},

Lithium oxide formation involves a four-electron reaction that is more difficult to achieve than the one- and two-electron reaction processes that result in lithium superoxide (LiO 2 ) and lithium peroxide (Li 2 O 2 ), respectively. By using a composite polymer electrolyte based on Li 10 GeP 2 S 12 nanoparticles embedded in a modified polyethylene oxide polymer matrix, we found that Li 2 O is the main product in a room temperature solid-state lithium-air battery. The battery is rechargeable for 1000 cycles with a low polarization gap and can operate at high rates. The four-electron reaction is enabled by a mixed ion–electron-conducting discharge product and its interface with air.},

  abstract     = {Photoredox catalysis enables distinctive and broadly applicable chemical reactions, but controlling their selectivity has proven to be difficult. The pursuit of enantioselectivity is a particularly daunting challenge, arguably because of the high energy of the activated radical (ion) intermediates, and previous approaches have invariably required pairing of the photoredox catalytic cycle with an additional activation mode for asymmetric induction. A potential solution for photoredox reactions proceeding via radical ions would be catalytic pairing with enantiopure counterions. However, although attempts toward this approach have been described, high selectivity has not yet been accomplished. Here we report a potentially general solution to radical cation–based asymmetric photoredox catalysis. We describe organic salts, featuring confined imidodiphosphorimidate counteranions that catalyze highly enantioselective [2+2]-cross cycloadditions of styrenes.},

  abstract     = {Soft materials tend to be highly permeable to gases, making it difficult to create stretchable hermetic seals. With the integration of spacers, we demonstrate the use of liquid metals, which show both metallic and fluidic properties, as stretchable hermetic seals. Such soft seals are used in both a stretchable battery and a stretchable heat transfer system that involve volatile fluids, including water and organic fluids. The capacity retention of the battery was ~72.5\% after 500 cycles, and the sealed heat transfer system showed an increased thermal conductivity of approximately 309 watts per meter-kelvin while strained and heated. Furthermore, with the incorporation of a signal transmission window, we demonstrated wireless communication through such seals. This work provides a route to create stretchable yet hermetic packaging design solutions for soft devices.},

We combined data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project with an algorithm that assigns circadian phases to 914 donors, by integrating temporal information from multiple tissues in each individual, to identify messenger RNA (mRNA) rhythms in 46 tissues. Clock transcripts showed conserved timing relationships and tight synchrony across the body. mRNA rhythms varied in breadth, covering global and tissue-specific functions, including metabolic pathways and systemic responses. The clock structure was conserved across sexes and age groups. However, overall gene expression rhythms were highly sex-dimorphic and more sustained in females. Rhythmic programs generally dampened with age across the body.},

  abstract     = {Amorphous ices govern a range of cosmological processes and are potentially key materials for explaining the anomalies of liquid water. A substantial density gap between low-density and high-density amorphous ice with liquid water in the middle is a cornerstone of our current understanding of water. However, we show that ball milling “ordinary” ice I h at low temperature gives a structurally distinct medium-density amorphous ice (MDA) within this density gap. These results raise the possibility that MDA is the true glassy state of liquid water or alternatively a heavily sheared crystalline state. Notably, the compression of MDA at low temperature leads to a sharp increase of its recrystallization enthalpy, highlighting that H 2 O can be a high-energy geophysical material.},

  abstract     = {Attention improves perception by enhancing the neural encoding of sensory information. A long-standing hypothesis is that cortical feedback projections carry top-down signals to influence sensory coding. However, this hypothesis has never been tested to establish causal links. We used viral tools to label feedback connections from cortical area V4 targeting early visual cortex (area V1). While monkeys performed a visual–spatial attention task, inactivating feedback axonal terminals in V1 without altering local intracortical and feedforward inputs reduced the response gain of single cells and impaired the accuracy of neural populations for encoding external stimuli. These effects are primarily manifested in the superficial layers of V1 and propagate to downstream area V4. Attention enhances sensory coding across visual cortex by specifically altering the strength of corticocortical feedback in a layer-dependent manner.},

Meteorology plays a vital role in wildfire behaviors, and the links between wildfires and climate have been widely studied. However, it is not fully clear how fire-weather feedback affects short-term wildfire variability, which undermines our ability to mitigate fire disasters. Here, we show the primacy of synoptic-scale feedback in driving extreme fires in Mediterranean and monsoon climate regimes in the West Coast of the United States and Southeastern Asia. We found that radiative effects of smoke aerosols can modify near-surface wind, air dryness, and rainfall and thus worsen air pollution by enhancing fire emissions and weakening dispersion. The intricate interactions among wildfires, smoke, and weather form a positive feedback loop that substantially increases air pollution exposure.},

Carbon emissions from this degradation total up to 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year −1 ), which is equivalent to, if not greater than, the emissions from Amazon deforestation (0.06 to 0.21 Pg C year −1 ). Amazon forest degradation can reduce dry-season evapotranspiration by up to 34\% and cause as much biodiversity loss as deforestation in human-modified landscapes, generating uneven socioeconomic burdens, mainly to forest dwellers. Projections indicate that degradation will remain a dominant source of carbon emissions independent of deforestation rates. Policies to tackle degradation should be integrated with efforts to curb deforestation and complemented with innovative measures addressing the disturbances that degrade the Amazon forest.},

We characterized protease activity in lymph nodes and found that antigens were rapidly degraded in the subcapsular sinus, paracortex, and interfollicular regions, whereas low protease activity and antigen degradation rates were detected in the vicinity of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Correlated with these findings, immunization regimens designed to target antigen to FDCs led to germinal centers dominantly targeting intact antigen, whereas traditional immunizations led to much weaker responses that equally targeted the intact immunogen and antigen breakdown products. Thus, spatially compartmentalized antigen proteolysis affects humoral immunity and can be exploited.},

A common garden study of genotypes of the dominant sedge Schoenoplectus americanus , “resurrected” from time-stratified seed banks, revealed that heritable variation and evolution explained key ecosystem attributes such as the allocation and distribution of belowground biomass. Incorporating heritable trait variation and evolution into an ecosystem model altered predictions of carbon accumulation and soil surface accretion (a determinant of marsh resilience to sea level rise), demonstrating the importance of accounting for evolutionary processes when forecasting ecosystem dynamics.},

Although single-emitter radiation can be tailored by the photonic environment, the introduction of multiple emitters extends this picture. A fundamental challenge, however, is that the radiative dipole-dipole coupling rapidly decays with spatial separation, typically within a fraction of the optical wavelength. We realize distant dipole-dipole radiative coupling with pairs of solid-state optical quantum emitters embedded in a nanophotonic waveguide. We dynamically probe the collective response and identify both super- and subradiant emission as well as means to control the dynamics by proper excitation techniques. Our work constitutes a foundational step toward multiemitter applications for scalable quantum-information processing.},

We discovered that the temperature dependence of weathering expressed as an activation energy increases from laboratory to watershed as transport, clay precipitation, disaggregation, and fracturing increasingly couple to dissolution. A simple upscaling to the global system indicates that the temperature dependence decreases to ~22 kilojoules per mole because (i) the lack of runoff limits weathering and retains base metal cations on half the land surface and (ii) other landscapes are regolith-shielded and show little weathering response to temperature. By comparing weathering from laboratory to globe, we reconcile some aspects of kinetic and thermodynamic controls on CO 2 drawdown by natural or enhanced weathering.},

How primate ipRGCs sense light is unclear, as they are rare and challenging to target for electrophysiological recording. We developed a method of acute identification within the live, ex vivo retina. Using it, we found that ipRGCs of the macaque monkey are highly specialized to encode irradiance (the overall intensity of illumination) by blurring spatial, temporal, and chromatic features of the visual scene. We describe mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, and population scales that support irradiance encoding across orders-of-magnitude changes in light intensity.

We determined the isotope composition of the moderately volatile element zinc in 18 bulk meteorites and identified nucleosynthetic zinc isotope anomalies. Using a mass-balance model, we find that carbonaceous bodies, which likely formed beyond the orbit of Jupiter, delivered about half of Earth’s zinc inventory.

  abstract     = {When tiles decorated to lower their symmetry are joined together, they can form aperiodic and labyrinthine patterns. Such Truchet tilings offer an efficient mechanism of visual data storage related to that used in barcodes and QR codes. We show that the crystalline metal–organic framework [OZn 4 ][1,3-benzenedicarboxylate] 3 (TRUMOF-1) is an atomic-scale realization of a complex three-dimensional Truchet tiling. Its crystal structure consists of a periodically arranged assembly of identical zinc-containing clusters connected uniformly in a well-defined but disordered fashion to give a topologically aperiodic microporous network. We suggest that this unusual structure emerges as a consequence of geometric frustration in the chemical building units from which it is assembled.},

  abstract     = {The molecular mode of action of biguanides, including the drug metformin, which is widely used in the treatment of diabetes, is incompletely characterized. Here, we define the inhibitory drug-target interaction(s) of a model biguanide with mammalian respiratory complex I by combining cryo–electron microscopy and enzyme kinetics. We interpret these data to explain the selectivity of biguanide binding to different enzyme states. The primary inhibitory site is in an amphipathic region of the quinone-binding channel, and an additional binding site is in a pocket on the intermembrane-space side of the enzyme. An independent local chaotropic interaction, not previously described for any drug, displaces a portion of a key helix in the membrane domain. Our data provide a structural basis for biguanide action and enable the rational design of medicinal biguanides.},

However, by focusing on forests alone, the law is potentially putting other ecosystems at greater risk, as well as overlooking the reliance of forests on adjacent regions.

Livestock farming poses a risk to more than 17,900 species listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species (4). Because the environmental threats posed by animal agriculture can translate into a range of business risks for animal protein suppliers, environmentally responsible businesses are safer investments than those that cause harm (5). Therefore, businesses within the animal agriculture industry should measure and disclose their environmental impacts, and financial institutions should protect themselves from losses by investing in businesses that are good environmental stewards.},

  abstract     = {Multicellular life requires altruistic cooperation between cells. The adaptive immune system is a notable exception, wherein germinal center B cells compete vigorously for limiting positive selection signals. Studying primary human lymphomas and developing new mouse models, we found that mutations affecting BTG1 disrupt a critical immune gatekeeper mechanism that strictly limits B cell fitness during antibody affinity maturation. This mechanism converted germinal center B cells into supercompetitors that rapidly outstrip their normal counterparts. This effect was conferred by a small shift in MYC protein induction kinetics but resulted in aggressive invasive lymphomas, which in humans are linked to dire clinical outcomes. Our findings reveal a delicate evolutionary trade-off between natural selection of B cells to provide immunity and potentially dangerous features that recall the more competitive nature of unicellular organisms.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of a star is influenced by its internal rotation dynamics through transport and mixing mechanisms, which are poorly understood. Magnetic fields can play a role in transporting angular momentum and chemical elements, but the origin of magnetism in radiative stellar layers is unclear. Using global numerical simulations, we identify a subcritical transition from laminar flow to turbulence caused by the generation of a magnetic dynamo. Our results have many properties of the theoretically proposed Tayler-Spruit dynamo mechanism, which strongly enhances transport of angular momentum in radiative zones. The dynamo generates deep toroidal fields that are screened by the stellar outer layers. This mechanism could produce strong magnetic fields inside radiative stars without an observable field on their surface.},

However, by introducing the engineered noise to the precise solution of Jones matrix elements, we break the fundamental limit of polarization multiplexing capacity of metasurfaces that roots from the dimension constraints of the Jones matrix. We experimentally demonstrate up to 11 independent holographic images using a single metasurface illuminated by visible light with different polarizations. To the best of our knowledge, it is the highest capacity reported for polarization multiplexing. Combining the position multiplexing scheme, the metasurface can generate 36 distinct images, forming a holographic keyboard pattern. This discovery implies a new paradigm for high-capacity optical display, information encryption, and data storage.},

We also developed a redox-active radical polymer, poly(oxoammonium salt), that can effectively p-dope the hole-transporting material by hole injection and that also mitigates lithium ion diffusion. Power conversion efficiencies of 23.5\% for 1-square-centimeter mixed–cation-anion PSCs and 21.4\% for 17.1-square-centimeter minimodules were achieved.

We report a new, highly stable pure silica zeolite called ZEO-3, which has a multidimensional, interconnected system of extra-large pores open through windows made by 16 and 14 silicate tetrahedra, the least dense polymorph of silica known so far. This zeolite was formed by an unprecedented one-dimensional to three-dimensional (1D-to-3D) topotactic condensation of a chain silicate. With a specific surface area of more than 1000 square meters per gram, ZEO-3 showed a high performance for volatile organic compound abatement and recovery compared with other zeolites and metal-organic frameworks.},

Here, we present a superconducting quantum simulator in which qubits are connected through an extensible photonic-bandgap metamaterial, thus realizing a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with tunable hopping range and on-site interaction. Using individual site control and readout, we characterize the statistics of measurement outcomes from many-body quench dynamics, which enables in situ Hamiltonian learning. Further, the outcome statistics reveal the effect of increased hopping range, showing the predicted crossover from integrability to ergodicity. Our work enables the study of emergent randomness from chaotic many-body evolution and, more broadly, expands the accessible Hamiltonians for quantum simulation using superconducting circuits.},

We show that the Lotus japonicus Nod factor receptors NFR1 and NFR5 constitute the core receptor complex initiating the cortical root nodule organogenesis program as well as the epidermal program controlling infection. We find that organogenesis signaling is mediated by the intracellular kinase domains whereas infection requires functional ectodomains. Finally, we identify evolutionarily distant barley receptors that activate root nodule organogenesis, which could enable engineering of biological nitrogen-fixation into cereals.},

Here, we show that some phenotype – environment mismatch errors can be explained by asymmetrical costs of different types of errors in wild red squirrels. Mothers that mistakenly increased reproductive effort when signals of an upcoming food pulse were absent were more likely to correctly increase effort when a food pulse did occur. However, mothers that failed to increase effort when cues of an upcoming food pulse were present suffered lifetime fitness costs that could only be offset through food supplementation. In fluctuating environments, such phenotype – environment mismatches may therefore reflect a bias to overestimate environmental cues and avoid making the costliest error, ultimately enhancing lifetime fitness.},

The number of visible stars decreased by an amount that can be explained by an increase in sky brightness of 7 to 10\% per year in the human visible band. This increase is faster than emissions changes indicated by satellite observations. We ascribe this difference to spectral changes in light emission and to the average angle of light emissions.},

We report a concise total synthesis of the manzamine alkaloid lissodendoric acid A, which hinges on the development of a regioselective, diastereoselective, and stereospecific trapping of a fleeting cyclic allene intermediate. This key step swiftly assembles the azadecalin framework of the natural product, allows for a succinct synthetic endgame, and enables a 12-step total synthesis (longest linear sequence; 0.8\% overall yield).

Using an extreme phenotype design, a combined rare-variant burden and ontologic analysis identified two sarcoma-specific pathways involved in mitotic and telomere functions. Variants in centrosome genes are linked to malignant peripheral nerve sheath and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, whereas heritable defects in the shelterin complex link susceptibility to sarcoma, melanoma, and thyroid cancers.

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)–mediated neuroinflammation is involved in the progression of tau-mediated neurodegeneration, and emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota regulates neuroinflammation in an APOE genotype–dependent manner. However, evidence of a causal link between the microbiota and tau-mediated neurodegeneration is lacking. In this study, we characterized a genetically engineered mouse model of tauopathy expressing human ApoE isoforms reared under germ-free conditions or after perturbation of their gut microbiota with antibiotics. Both of these manipulations reduced gliosis, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration in a sex- and ApoE isoform–dependent manner. The findings reveal mechanistic and translationally relevant interrelationships between the microbiota, neuroinflammation, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration.},

We report an evolutionary interspecies communication pathway involving a central Ixodes scapularis tick receptor termed Dome1, which acquired a mammalian cytokine receptor motif exhibiting high affinity for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Host-derived IFN-γ facilitates Dome1-mediated activation of the Ixodes JAK–STAT pathway. This accelerates tick blood meal acquisition and development while upregulating antimicrobial components. The Dome1–JAK–STAT pathway, which exists in most Ixodid tick genomes, regulates the regeneration and proliferation of gut cells—including stem cells—and dictates metamorphosis through the Hedgehog and Notch–Delta networks, ultimately affecting Ixodes vectorial competence. We highlight the evolutionary dependence of I. scapularis on mammalian hosts through cross-species signaling mechanisms that dually influence arthropod immunity and development.},

Their projections were also consistent with, and at least as skillful as, those of independent academic and government models. Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp also correctly rejected the prospect of a coming ice age, accurately predicted when human-caused global warming would first be detected, and reasonably estimated the “carbon budget” for holding warming below 2°C.

Most DA mutations are in muscle- and joint-related genes, and the anatomical defects originate cell-autonomously within the musculoskeletal system. However, gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO2, a principal mechanosensor in somatosensation, cause DA subtype 5 (DA5) through unknown mechanisms. We show that expression of a gain-of-function PIEZO2 mutation in proprioceptive sensory neurons that mainly innervate muscle spindles and tendons is sufficient to induce DA5-like phenotypes in mice. Overactive PIEZO2 causes anatomical defects through increased activity within the peripheral nervous system during postnatal development. Furthermore, botulinum toxin (Botox) and a dietary fatty acid that modulates PIEZO2 activity reduce DA5-like deficits. This reveals a role for somatosensory neurons: Excessive mechanosensation within these neurons disrupts musculoskeletal development.},

We applied CADENZ to endoxylanases and used activity-based protein profiling to recover thousands of structurally diverse enzymes. Functional designs exhibit high active-site preorganization and more stable and compact packing outside the active site. Implementing these lessons into CADENZ led to a 10-fold improved hit rate and more than 10,000 recovered enzymes. This design-test-learn loop can be applied, in principle, to any modular protein family, yielding huge diversity and general lessons on protein design principles.},

Quantum dynamics calculations revealed that strong constructive interference in the perpendicular configuration plays an important role in the stereodynamical effects observed.},

Here, we generated a chromosome-level genome assembly of the long-tailed hermit and screened for genes that have been specifically inactivated in the ancestral hummingbird lineage. We discovered that FBP2 (fructose-bisphosphatase 2), which encodes a gluconeogenic muscle enzyme, was lost during a time period when hovering flight evolved. We show that FBP2 knockdown in an avian muscle cell line up-regulates glycolysis and enhances mitochondrial respiration, coincident with an increased mitochondria number. Furthermore, genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and organization have up-regulated expression in hummingbird flight muscle. Together, these results suggest that FBP2 loss was likely a key step in the evolution of metabolic muscle adaptations required for true hovering flight.},

However, current editing approaches are directed primarily toward relatively small cohorts of patients with specific mutations. Here, we describe a cardioprotective strategy potentially applicable to a broad range of patients with heart disease. We used base editing to ablate the oxidative activation sites of CaMKIIδ, a primary driver of cardiac disease. We show in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells that editing the CaMKIIδ gene to eliminate oxidation-sensitive methionine residues confers protection from ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. Moreover, CaMKIIδ editing in mice at the time of IR enables the heart to recover function from otherwise severe damage. CaMKIIδ gene editing may thus represent a permanent and advanced strategy for heart disease therapy.},

  abstract     = {A myriad of studies and strategies have already been devoted to improving the stability of perovskite films; however, the role of the different perovskite crystal facets in stability is still unknown. Here, we reveal the underlying mechanisms of facet-dependent degradation of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) films. We show that the (100) facet is substantially more vulnerable to moisture-induced degradation than the (111) facet. With combined experimental and theoretical studies, the degradation mechanisms are revealed; a strong water adhesion following an elongated lead-iodine (Pb-I) bond distance is observed, which leads to a δ-phase transition on the (100) facet. Through engineering, a higher surface fraction of the (111) facet can be achieved, and the (111)-dominated crystalline FAPbI 3 films show exceptional stability against moisture. Our findings elucidate unknown facet-dependent degradation mechanisms and kinetics.},

  abstract     = {Mechanically strong and ductile load–carrying materials are needed in all sectors, from transportation to lightweight design to safe infrastructure. Yet, a grand challenge is to unify both features in one material. We show that a plain medium-manganese steel can be processed to have a tensile strength &gt;2.2 gigapascals at a uniform elongation &gt;20\%. This requires a combination of multiple transversal forging, cryogenic treatment, and tempering steps. A hierarchical microstructure that consists of laminated and twofold topologically aligned martensite with finely dispersed retained austenite simultaneously activates multiple micromechanisms to strengthen and ductilize the material. The dislocation slip in the well-organized martensite and the gradual deformation-stimulated phase transformation synergistically produce the high ductility. Our nanostructure design strategy produces 2 gigapascal–strength and yet ductile steels that have attractive composition and the potential to be produced at large industrial scales.},

Recent advances have enabled the confinement of water and ions to two dimensions, unveiling transport properties inaccessible at larger scales and triggering hopes of reproducing the ionic machinery of biological systems. Here we report experiments demonstrating the emergence of memory in the transport of aqueous electrolytes across (sub)nanoscale channels. We unveil two types of nanofluidic memristors depending on channel material and confinement, with memory ranging from minutes to hours. We explain how large time scales could emerge from interfacial processes such as ionic self-assembly or surface adsorption. Such behavior allowed us to implement Hebbian learning with nanofluidic systems. This result lays the foundation for biomimetic computations on aqueous electrolytic chips.},

In this study, neuromorphic functions were successfully accomplished with a polyelectrolyte-confined fluidic memristor (PFM), in which confined polyelectrolyte–ion interactions contributed to hysteretic ion transport, resulting in ion memory effects. Various electric pulse patterns were emulated by PFM with ultralow energy consumption. The fluidic property of PFM enabled the mimicking of chemical-regulated electric pulses. More importantly, chemical-electric signal transduction was implemented with a single PFM. With its structural similarity to ion channels, PFM is versatile and easily interfaces with biological systems, paving a way to building neuromorphic devices with advanced functions by introducing rich chemical designs.},

Consequently, enforcement of the Clean Water Act has reverted to 1986 agency guidance (6). Although scientific understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological connectivity of waters (7) and the ability to leverage geospatial data to guide jurisdictional determinations (8, 9) have grown substantially since 1986, the Clean Water Act enforcement and rulemaking have yet to catch up.},

  abstract     = {Maize ( Zea mays ) is a major staple crop in Africa, where its yield and the livelihood of millions are compromised by the parasitic witchweed Striga . Germination of Striga is induced by strigolactones exuded from maize roots into the rhizosphere. In a maize germplasm collection, we identified two strigolactones, zealactol and zealactonoic acid, which stimulate less Striga germination than the major maize strigolactone, zealactone. We then showed that a single cytochrome P450, ZmCYP706C37, catalyzes a series of oxidative steps in the maize-strigolactone biosynthetic pathway. Reduction in activity of this enzyme and two others involved in the pathway, ZmMAX1b and ZmCLAMT1, can change strigolactone composition and reduce Striga germination and infection. These results offer prospects for breeding Striga -resistant maize.},

  abstract     = {Porosity defects are currently a major factor that hinders the widespread adoption of laser-based metal additive manufacturing technologies. One common porosity occurs when an unstable vapor depression zone (keyhole) forms because of excess laser energy input. With simultaneous high-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging and thermal imaging, coupled with multiphysics simulations, we discovered two types of keyhole oscillation in laser powder bed fusion of Ti-6Al-4V. Amplifying this understanding with machine learning, we developed an approach for detecting the stochastic keyhole porosity generation events with submillisecond temporal resolution and near-perfect prediction rate. The highly accurate data labeling enabled by operando x-ray imaging allowed us to demonstrate a facile and practical way to adopt our approach in commercial systems.},

We show the existence of a fourth meningeal layer that compartmentalizes the subarachnoid space in the mouse and human brain, designated the subarachnoid lymphatic-like membrane (SLYM). SLYM is morpho- and immunophenotypically similar to the mesothelial membrane lining of peripheral organs and body cavities, and it encases blood vessels and harbors immune cells. Functionally, the close apposition of SLYM with the endothelial lining of the meningeal venous sinus permits direct exchange of small solutes between cerebrospinal fluid and venous blood, thus representing the mouse equivalent of the arachnoid granulations. The functional characterization of SLYM provides fundamental insights into brain immune barriers and fluid transport.},

This corresponds to 90 ± 26 to 154 ± 44 millimeters sea level equivalent and will cause 49 ± 9 to 83 ± 7\% of glaciers to disappear. Mass loss is linearly related to temperature increase and thus reductions in temperature increase reduce mass loss. Based on climate pledges from the Conference of the Parties (COP26), global mean temperature is projected to increase by +2.7°C, which would lead to a sea level contribution of 115 ± 40 millimeters and cause widespread deglaciation in most mid-latitude regions by 2100.},

Here, we demonstrated that immotile LRO cilia are mechanosensors for shear force using a methodological pipeline that combines optical tweezers, light sheet microscopy, and deep learning to permit in vivo analyses in zebrafish. Mechanical manipulation of immotile LRO cilia activated intraciliary calcium transients that required the cation channel Polycystin-2. Furthermore, mechanical force applied to LRO cilia was sufficient to rescue and reverse cardiac situs in zebrafish that lack motile cilia. Thus, LRO cilia are mechanosensitive cellular levers that convert biomechanical forces into calcium signals to instruct left-right asymmetry.},

However, the flow-sensing mechanism has long remained elusive. In this work, we show that immotile cilia at the node undergo asymmetric deformation along the dorsoventral axis in response to the flow. Application of mechanical stimuli to immotile cilia by optical tweezers induced calcium ion transients and degradation of Dand5 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the targeted cells. The Pkd2 channel protein was preferentially localized to the dorsal side of immotile cilia, and calcium ion transients were preferentially induced by mechanical stimuli directed toward the ventral side. Our results uncover the biophysical mechanism by which immotile cilia at the node sense the direction of fluid flow.},

We find that YTT scientists are generally of high caliber in research but, as a group, fall below the top category in pre-return productivity. We further find that YTT scientists are associated with a post-return publication gain across journal-quality tiers. However, this gain mainly takes place in last-authored publications and for high-caliber (albeit not top-caliber) recruits and can be explained by YTT scientists’ access to greater funding and larger research teams. This paper has policy implications for the mobility of scientific talent, especially as early-career scientists face growing challenges in accessing research funding in the United States and European Union},

In diseases of aging, modifiable factors can be compounded over the life span. We report that diet-induced obesity earlier in life triggers persistent reprogramming of the innate immune system, lasting long after normalization of metabolic abnormalities. Stearic acid, acting through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), is sufficient to remodel chromatin landscapes and selectively enhance accessibility at binding sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1). Myeloid cells show less oxidative phosphorylation and shift to glycolysis, ultimately leading to proinflammatory cytokine transcription, aggravation of pathological retinal angiogenesis, and neuronal degeneration associated with loss of visual function. Thus, a past history of obesity reprograms mononuclear phagocytes and predisposes to neuroinflammation.},

Wave diffraction explains the fundamental need for area or diameter of a lens or aperture to achieve some resolution or number of pixels in microscopes and cameras. This work demonstrates that if we know what the optics is to do, even before design, we can also deduce the minimum required thickness. This limit comes from diffraction combined with a concept called overlapping nonlocality C that can be deduced rigorously from just the mathematical description of what the device is to do. C expresses how much the input regions for different output regions overlap. This limit applies broadly to optics, from cameras to metasurfaces, and to wave systems generally.},
