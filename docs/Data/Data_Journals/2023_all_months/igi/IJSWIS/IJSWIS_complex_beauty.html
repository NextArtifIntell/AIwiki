  abstract     = {Abstract In this study, a novel top-K ranking recommendation method called collaborative social metric learning (CSML) is proposed, which implements a trust network that provides both user-item and user-user interactions in simple structure. Most existing recommender systems adopting trust networks focus on item ratings, but this does not always guarantee optimal top-K ranking prediction. Conventional direct ranking systems in trust networks are based on sub-optimal correlation approaches that do not consider item-item relations. The proposed CSML algorithm utilizes the metric learning method to directly predict the top-K items in a trust network. A new triplet loss is further proposed, called socio-centric loss, which represents user-user interactions to fully exploit the information contained in a trust network, as an addition to the two commonly used triplet losses in metric learning for recommender systems, which consider user-item and item-item relations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CSML outperformed existing recommender systems for real-world trust network data.},

According to the distribution rule of PRNU in the high and low frequency band of the image, the high and low frequency information of the part is also processed differently, which ensures the quality of the output image to a large extent. Experiments on the datasets show that the proposed method can preserve the biometric characteristics of the device while maintaining the anonymity of the device.

Recently, aligning temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) that contain time information has aroused increasingly more interest, as the time dimension is widely used in real-life applications. The matching between TKGs requires seed entity pairs, which are lacking in practice. Hence, it is of great significance to study TKG alignment under scarce supervision. In this work, the authors formally formulate the problem of TKG alignment with limited labeled data and propose to solve it under the active learning framework. As the core of active learning is to devise query strategies to select the most informative instances to label, the authors propose to make full use of time information and put forward novel time-aware strategies to meet the requirement of weakly supervised temporal entity alignment. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that it is important to study TKG alignment with scarce supervision, and the proposed time-aware strategy is effective.},

By leveling shared computing resources on the cloud, CG technology allows those without expensive hardware to enjoy AAA games using a low-end device. However, the bandwidth requirement for streaming game video is high, which can cause backbone network congestion for large-scale deployment and expensive bandwidth bills. To address this challenge, the authors proposed an innovative edge-assisted computing architecture that collaboratively uses AI-powered foveated rendering (FR) and super-resolution (SR). Using FR, the cloud server can stream gaming video in lower resolution, significantly reducing the transmitted data volume. The edge server will then upscale the video using a game-specific SR model, recovering the quality of the video, especially for the areas players pay the most attention. The authors built a prototype system called FRSR and did thorough, objective comparative experiments to demonstrate that this architecture can reduce bandwidth usage by 39.47% compared with classic CG implementation for similar perceived quality.},

Firstly, they optimize the part of SM2 signature algorithm process with inverse operation and effectively reduce the time complexity by reducing the inverse operation in the whole process, and the experimental results show that the improved SM2 algorithm improves the signature and verification efficiency by about 5.7%. Secondly, by adding SM2 algorithm template and interface to the BCCSP module of fabric platform to realize the shift value of SM2 algorithm and compare the performance with the native fabric system, the network startup time is reduced by about 29%.

Aiming at solving this problem, a long text processing method named HBert based on Bert and hierarchical attention neural network is proposed. Firstly, the long text is divided into multiple sentences whose vectors are obtained through the word encoder composed of Bert and the word attention layer. And the article vector is obtained through the sentence encoder that is composed of transformer and sentence attention. Then the article vector is used to complete the subsequent tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed HBert method achieves good results in text classification and QA tasks. The F1 value is 95.7% in longer text classification tasks and 75.2% in QA tasks, which are better than the state-of-the-art model longformer.},

However, the deep semantics hidden between entities in knowledge graph cannot be well expressed. Moreover, considering many predicates express fuzzy relationships, the existing reasoning methods cannot effectively deal with these fuzzy semantics and interpret the corresponding reasoning process. To counter the above problems, in this article, a new interpretable reasoning schema is proposed by introducing fuzzy theory. The presented method focuses on analyzing the fuzzy semantic between related entities in a knowledge graph. By annotating the fuzzy semantic features of adjacency predicates, a novel semantic reasoning model is designed to realize the fuzzy semantic extension over knowledge graph. The evaluation, based on both visualization and query experiments, shows that this proposal has advantages over the initial knowledge graph and can discover more valid semantic information.},

Smart City experts perform an important role for evaluation and formulation of an efficient waste management scheme which can be easily integrated with the overall development plan for the complete city. In this work, we have offered an automated classification model for urban waste into multiple categories using Convolutional Neural Networks. We have represented the model which is being implemented using Fine Tuning of Pretrained Neural Network Model with new datasets for litter classification. With the help of this model, software, and hardware both can be developed using low-cost resources and can be deployed at a large scale as it is the issue associated with healthy living provisions across cities.

In addition, previous studies did not correctly handle the situation where emotion clauses and cause clauses are the same clauses. To overcome these issues, the authors first use a multitask learning model that is based on graph from the perspective of sorting, which can simultaneously extract emotion clauses, cause clauses and emotion-cause pairs via an end-to-end strategy. Then the authors propose to convert text into graph structured data, and process this scenario through a unique graph convolutional neural network.

This paper explores how digitalization is driving the transformation of traditional sports tourism through the utilization of the DRAT model to reconstruct the value of both consumers and businesses. The analysis shows that the digitalization of sports tourism has deconstructed the traditional industry using innovative technologies such as technological virtualization and data platform construction. The effective development and utilization of highly developed information technology in modern society are essential for ensuring the smooth and healthy growth of the sports tourism industry. The traditional sports tourism industry has been digitally deconstructed, leading to the formation of new production, management, and business models. The status of consumers continues to improve during this process, and companies are seeking to collaborate with consumers to create new value positioning.},

Fake news created on social media can lead to uncertainty amongst individuals and psychiatric illness. We may detect that news obtained based on machine learning techniques is either true or false. This study proposes a machine learning technique to detect fake news by carrying out filtration on social media data, classifying the preprocessed data using a machine learning algorithm, evaluating the developed system, and evaluating the results.},

However, traditional knowledge graph convolutional networks impose significant computational burdens during training, demanding substantial resources and increasing the cost of recommendations. To address this issue, this article proposes a lightweight knowledge graph convolutional network for collaborative filtering (LKGCF). LKGCF eliminates the feature transformation and nonlinear activation components, by focusing on essential elements such as neighborhood aggregation and layer combination. LKGCF captures the user&#39;s long-distance personalized interests on the knowledge graph by sampling from neighborhood information and constructing a weighted sum of item embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is easy to train and implement due to its coherence and simplicity. Furthermore, notable improvements in recommendation performance are observed compared to strong baselines.},

However, since patent data exists the ununiform distribution of technology points information, long length of term, and long sentences, technology point extraction faces the dilemmas of poor readability and logic confusion. To mitigate these problems, the article proposes a method to generate patent technology points called IGPTP—a two-stage strategy, which fuses the advantage of extractive and generative ways. IGPTP utilizes the RoBERTa+CNN model to obtain the key sentences of text and takes the output as input of UNILM (unified pre-trained language model). Simultaneously, it takes a multi-strategies integration technique to enhance the quality of patent technology points by combining the copy mechanism and external knowledge guidance model. Substantial experimental results manifest that IGPTP outperforms the current mainstream models, which can generate more coherent and richer text.},

However, they may not effectively capture the subjectivity and complex relationships often present in the humanities. To address this issue, a dynamic visualization of subject matter knowledge graph was developed using a collective intelligence approach that integrates the individual intelligence of learners and considers cognitive diversity to construct and evolve the knowledge graph. The approach resulted in the construction of 722 knowledge associations and the evolution of 584 triples. A survey assessed the effectiveness and user-friendliness, revealing that this approach is effective, easy to use, and can improve subject matter knowledge ontology. In conclusion, combining individual and collective intelligence is a promising approach for building effective knowledge graphs in subject areas with subjectivity and complexity.},

In order to realize low-latency and high-speed information exchange in 5G communication networks, a method based on the allocation of network computing resource in view of edge computing model is proposed. The method first considers three computing modes: local device computing, local mobile edge computing (MEC) server computing, and adjacent MEC server computing. Then, a multi-scenario edge computing model is further constructed for optimizing energy consumption and delay. At the same time, the encoding-decoding mode is used to optimize PSO algorithm and combined with the improvement of fitness function, which can effectively support the communication network to achieve reasonable allocation of resources, ensuring efficiency of information exchange in the network. In the end, the results show that when the number of users is 500, the method can complete the task assignment within 44s.},

Also, inspired by input-to-state practical stability (ISpS), the authors construct a dynamical signal in order to counteract the impact of unmodeled dynamics and dynamic disturbances. The bounded inequality expression has been applied to tackle the unknown input of dead zone. Based on this, consensus control protocol suitable for nonlinear constraints has been constructed by using the recursive backstepping technique and adaptive neural network method. Theoretical analysis indicates not only the uniform boundary of all signals in the closed-loop under the neuro-based consensus controller, but uniform ultimate convergence of consensus tracking errors.

To cope with the low-resource relation extraction scenario, the relation extraction results are complemented by using prompt learning with a big model paradigm.

Additionally, the VoV-DFEM structure, based on the concept of one-shot aggregation, enhances feature aggregation from different scales and frequencies in the backbone network. To validate its performance, experiments were conducted using publicly available datasets on a computer with dedicated GPUs. As a result, compared to YOLOv7-tiny, YOLO-FLNet achieved a 0.3% mAP@0.5 improvement, reduced parameter size by 52.9%, and increased inference speed by 30.2%.

To demonstrate the viability of the approach, simulation experiments are carried out on the NUC dataset using the recognition technique based on a convolutional neural network that is proposed. The fundamental network architecture of a convolutional neural network is optimized using the L2 regularization technique. The experimental findings demonstrate that the NUC dataset now has better recognition accuracy. In terms of recognition accuracy, the suggested method satisfies the predetermined requirements.},

POI recommendation is an important service provided by LBSN; it can help users quickly find POI of interest, and also help POI providers more comprehensively understand user preferences and improve service quality. This paper proposes a POI recommendation algorithm that is based on attention mechanism. The sequence characteristics and short-term preferences of historical data are captured through the attention mechanism module and long short-term memory network (LSTM), and the POI location prediction is carried out in combination with the user embedding characteristics, and a better prediction accuracy is obtained. These results simulated show that the proposed method can realize the reliable analysis of complex data sets, and its precision index remains above 0.1 and recall index remains above 0.08, and it can also alleviate the cold start problem and better meet the personalized needs of users.},

Due to this reason, a multi-objective facility allocation problem is introduced in this research with cooperative-based multi-level backup coverage considering distance-based facility attractiveness. The facility of the coverage is further described as two different layers of the coverage process, where demand can be covered as full, partial, and no coverage by their respective facilities.

To address this issue, a lightweight nighttime vehicle detection method (MC-YOLO) integrating MobileNetV2 and YOLOV3 is proposed. Firstly, in the preprocessing stage, image enhancement is performed on nighttime images to facilitate model feature extraction. Then, the lightweight network MobileNetV2 is used to extract feature by replacing the backbone network DarkNet53 in YOLOv3, thus accelerating the speed of target detection. Finally, after the convolution operation of the backbone network, a convolution block attention module is added to enhance the important feature information and suppress the secondary features, thereby improving the detection precision. The experimental results on the BDD100K dataset show that the proposed MC-YOLO model has a precision of up to 92.75%, which is superior to several other advanced comparative models.},

Existing methods often struggle to effectively extract detailed features and address the issue of imbalanced positive and negative samples. To tackle these challenges, an aerial image target detection method (dense RFB-FE-CGAM) based on dense RFB-FE and channel-global attention mechanism (CGAM) was proposed. First, the authors design a shallow feature enhancement module using dense RFB feature multiplexing and expand convolution within an SSD network, improving detailed feature extraction. Second, they introduce CGAM, a global attention module, to enhance semantic feature extraction in backbone networks. Finally, they incorporate a focal loss function for joint training, addressing sample imbalance. In experiments, the method achieved an mAP of 0.755 on the DOTA dataset and recall/AP values of 0.889/0.906 on HRSC2016, confirming the effectiveness of dense RFB-FE-CGAM for aerial image target detection.},

Given a textual query, video highlight detection (HD) and temporal grounding (TG) aim to predict frame-wise saliency scores from a video while concurrently locating all relevant spans. Despite recent progress in DETR-based works, these methods crudely fuse different inputs in the encoder, which limits effective cross-modal interaction. To solve this challenge, the authors design QD-Net (query-guided refinement and dynamic spans network) tailored for HD&amp;TG. Specifically, they propose a query-guided refinement module to decouple the feature encoding from the interaction process. Furthermore, they present a dynamic span decoder that leverages learnable 2D spans as decoder queries, which accelerates training convergence for TG. On QVHighlights dataset, the proposed QD-Net achieves 61.87 HD-HIT@1 and 61.88 TG-mAP@0.5, yielding a significant improvement of +1.88 and +8.05, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art method.},

It adopts a directed acyclic graph ledger, enabling parallel transaction processing, and employs dynamic transaction confirmation consensus for simplicity. The protocol&#39;s sharding process and node score mechanism can deter malicious behavior. Experiments show that compared with mainstream sharding protocols, the protocol performs better when affected by cross-shard transactions. Moreover, its throughput has shown improvement compared to high-performance protocols without cross-shard transactions. This solution suits systems requiring high throughput and reliability, maintaining a stable performance advantage even as cross-shard transactions increase to the usual maximum ratio.},

  abstract     = {Abstract This paper proposes a hierarchical framework for industrial Internet device authentication and trusted access as well as a mechanism for industrial security state perception, and designs a cross-domain authentication scheme for devices on this basis. The scheme obtains hardware device platform configuration register (PCR) values and platform integrity measure through periodic perception, completes device identity identification and integrity measure verification when device accessing and data transmission requesting, ensures secure and trustworthy access and interoperation of devices, and designs a cross-domain authentication model for trustworthy access of devices and related security protocols. Through the security analysis, this scheme has good anti-attack abilities, and it can effectively protect against common replay attacks, impersonation attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Several problems arise due to the differences between dentistry and general medicine. The storage of dental data in information silos, the incompatibility of data between different dental clinics or institutions from other medical areas are the most significant ones. The authors propose a decentralized architecture that combines FHIR archetypes, shape expressions, and personal online datastores (PODs) to tackle those issues as follows: FHIR archetypes are used to express the data, shape expressions are used to handle data structure and data access requests, and PODs are used to store information in a decentralized and safe manner that let the owner of the information stored to handle data access. The system allows the patient to store dental information from heterogeneous data sources transparently and respecting the patient&#39;s right to autonomy and consent. In this paper, the authors develop this architecture proposal and discuss its relevance and feasibility in the area of dental health.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Aiming at the problems of missing local context features, single word vector representation, and low entity recognition accuracy, a method for e-medical recording with named entity recognition, which is based on BERT and model fusion, is proposed. First, with the model of BERT for pre-training, the preceding and following contextual information is fused for the enhancement of word semantic representation and alleviation of the problem of polysemy; second, the network of bi-directional long-short term memory is for obtaining the sequence feature matrix, generation of optimal sequence in global sense achieved through the conditional random field model; finally, data enhancement is used to alleviate the class imbalance and improve the model ability in generalization. Results of the experiments find model proposal measured by F1 on CCKS21 data set reaches 0.8548, which is 0.51% and 0.08% higher than models with ID-CNNs-CRF and multi-task RNN. This demonstrates the excellent performance of the method proposed in this paper in improving named entity recognition.},

  abstract     = {Abstract There are many problems with remote sensing images, such as large data scales, complex illumination conditions, occlusion, and dense targets. The existing semantic segmentation methods for remote sensing images are not accurate enough for small and irregular target segmentation results, and the edge extraction results are poor. The authors propose a remote sensing image segmentation method based on a DCNN and multiscale feature fusion. Firstly, an end-to-end remote sensing image segmentation model using complete residual connection and multiscale feature fusion was designed based on a deep convolutional encoder–decoder network. Secondly, weighted high-level features were obtained using an attention mechanism, which better preserved the edges, texture, and other information of remote sensing images. The experimental results on ISPRS Potsdam and Urban Drone datasets show that compared with the comparison methods, this method has better segmentation effect on small and irregular objects and achieves the best segmentation performance while ensuring the computation speed.},

The focus of this article is to determine sentiments and stances of Twitter users about vaccination. A tweet dataset on COVID-19 vaccination is compiled and jointly annotated with sentiment and stance. This deep learning approach employs BERT, which is a model based on pre-trained transformers. The generative deep learning model, ChatGPT, is also used for stance and sentiment analysis on the dataset. ChatGPT achieves the best performance for stance detection, while BERT is the best performer for sentiment analysis. This study is the first one to observe stance and sentiment detection performance of ChatGPT on health-related tweets. This article also includes a full-fledged system proposal based on automatic sentiment and stance analysis. COVID-19 pandemic is an impactful global public health phenomenon, and hence, joint extraction of sentiments and stances from health-related tweets can profoundly contribute to health-related decision-making processes.},
