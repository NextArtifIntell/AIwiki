Our target is to maximise the expected exponential utility of discounted dividend payments, given that the dividend rates are bounded by some constant. The utility function destroys the linearity and the time-homogeneity of the problem considered. The value function depends not only on the surplus, but also on time. Numerical considerations suggest that the optimal strategy, if it exists, is of a barrier type with a nonlinear barrier. In the related article of Grandits et al. ( Scand. Actuarial J. 2 , 2007), it has been observed that standard numerical methods break down in certain parameter cases, and no closed-form solution has been found. For these reasons, we offer a new method allowing one to estimate the distance from an arbitrary smooth-enough function to the value function. Applying this method, we investigate the goodness of the most obvious suboptimal strategies—payout on the maximal rate, and constant barrier strategies—by measuring the distance from their performance functions to the value function.},

We assume that, for each layer, the weights of an MLP are initialized with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from either a light-tailed (finite-variance) or a heavy-tailed distribution in the domain of attraction of a symmetric $\alpha$ -stable distribution, where $\alpha\in(0,2]$ may depend on the layer. For the bias terms of the layer, we assume i.i.d. initializations with a symmetric $\alpha$ -stable distribution having the same $\alpha$ parameter as that layer. Non-stable heavy-tailed weight distributions are important since they have been empirically seen to emerge in trained deep neural nets such as the ResNet and VGG series, and proven to naturally arise via stochastic gradient descent. The introduction of heavy-tailed weights broadens the class of priors in Bayesian neural networks. In this work we extend a recent result of Favaro, Fortini, and Peluchetti (2020) to show that the vector of pre-activation values at all nodes of a given hidden layer converges in the limit, under a suitable scaling, to a vector of i.i.d. random variables with symmetric $\alpha$ -stable distributions, $\alpha\in(0,2]$ .},

Motivated by cosmic research, we examine the Minkowski functional of the excursion set for an isotropic central limit random field, whose k -point correlation functions ( k th-order cumulants) have the same structure as that assumed in cosmic research. Using 3- and 4-point correlation functions, we derive the asymptotic expansions of the Euler characteristic density, which is the building block of the Minkowski functional. The resulting formula reveals the types of non-Gaussianity that cannot be captured by the Minkowski functionals. As an example, we consider an isotropic chi-squared random field and confirm that the asymptotic expansion accurately approximates the true Euler characteristic density.},

We prove that the corresponding multilevel Monte Carlo estimator has optimal computational complexity (i.e. of order $\varepsilon^{-2}$ if the mean squared error is at most $\varepsilon^2$ ) and provide its central limit theorem (CLT). Using the CLT we construct confidence intervals for barrier option prices and various risk measures based on drawdown under the tempered stable (CGMY) model calibrated/estimated on real-world data. We provide non-asymptotic and asymptotic comparisons of our algorithm with existing approximations, leading to rule-of-thumb principles guiding users to the best method for a given set of parameters.

  abstract     = {A system of interacting multi-class finite-state jump processes is analyzed. The model under consideration consists of a block-structured network with dynamically changing multi-color nodes. The interactions are local and described through local empirical measures. Two levels of heterogeneity are considered: between and within the blocks where the nodes are labeled into two types. The central nodes are those connected only to nodes from the same block, whereas the peripheral nodes are connected to both nodes from the same block and nodes from other blocks. Limits of such systems as the number of nodes tends to infinity are investigated. In particular, under specific regularity conditions, propagation of chaos and the law of large numbers are established in a multi-population setting. Moreover, it is shown that, as the number of nodes goes to infinity, the behavior of the system can be represented by the solution of a McKean–Vlasov system. Then, we prove large deviations principles for the vectors of empirical measures and the empirical processes, which extends the classical results of Dawson and Gärtner ( Stochastics 20 , 1987) and Léonard ( Ann.

In this model, the expected number of vertices of the graph is n , and the expected degree of a vertex is $a\log n$ for some fixed $a&gt;1$ . Each vertex is added with probability p to a set $A_0$ of initially infected vertices. Vertices subsequently become infected if they have at least $ \theta a \log n $ infected neighbours. Here $p, \theta \in [0,1]$ are taken to be fixed constants. We show that if $\theta (1+p)/2$ , even if one adversarially infects every vertex inside a ball of radius $O(\sqrt{\log n} )$ , with high probability the infection will spread to only o ( n ) vertices beyond those that were initially infected. In addition we give some bounds on the $(a, p, \theta)$ regions ensuring the emergence of large local outbreaks or the existence of islands of vertices that never become infected. We also give a complete picture of the (surprisingly complex) behaviour of the analogous 1-dimensional bootstrap percolation model on the circle. Finally we raise a number of problems, and in particular make a conjecture on an ‘almost no percolation or almost full percolation’ dichotomy which may be of independent interest.},

In this paper we study the discrete censored $\delta$ -shock model, $\delta \ge 1$ , for which the system fails whenever no shock occurs within a $\delta$ -length time period from the last shock, by supposing that the interarrival times between consecutive shocks are described by a first-order Markov chain (as well as under the binomial shock process, i.e., when the interarrival times between successive shocks have a geometric distribution). Using the Markov chain embedding technique introduced by Chadjiconstantinidis et al. ( Adv. Appl. Prob. 32 , 2000), we study the joint and marginal distributions of the system’s lifetime, the number of shocks, and the number of periods in which no shocks occur, up to the failure of the system. The joint and marginal probability generating functions of these random variables are obtained, and several recursions and exact formulae are given for the evaluation of their probability mass functions and moments. It is shown that the system’s lifetime follows a Markov geometric distribution of order $\delta$ (a geometric distribution of order $\delta$ under the binomial setup) and also that it follows a matrix-geometric distribution. Some reliability properties are also given under the binomial shock process, by showing that a shift of the system’s lifetime random variable follows a compound geometric distribution. Finally, we introduce a new mixed discrete censored $\delta$ -shock model, for which the system fails when no shock occurs within a $\delta$ -length time period from the last shock, or the magnitude of the shock is larger than a given critical threshold $\gamma &gt;0$ . Similarly, for this mixed model, we study the joint and marginal distributions of the system’s lifetime, the number of shocks, and the number of periods in which no shocks occur, up to the failure of the system, under the binomial shock process.},

We focus on two kinds of risk measures, referred to as the tail moment (TM) and the tail central moment (TCM), which are defined as the conditional moment and conditional central moment of some individual risk in the event of system crisis. The first-order TM and the second-order TCM coincide with the popular risk measures called the marginal expected shortfall and the tail variance, respectively. We derive asymptotic expressions for the TM and TCM with any positive integer orders, when the individual risks are pairwise asymptotically independent and have distributions from certain classes that contain both light-tailed and heavy-tailed distributions. The formulas obtained possess concise forms unrelated to dependence structures, and hence enable us to estimate the TM and TCM efficiently. To demonstrate the wide application of our results, we revisit some issues related to premium principles and optimal capital allocation from the asymptotic point of view. We also give a numerical study on the relative errors of the asymptotic results obtained, under some specific scenarios when there are two individual risks in the system. The corresponding asymptotic properties of the degenerate univariate versions of the TM and TCM are discussed separately in an appendix at the end of the paper.},

However, this unrealistic assumption leads to a risk of inaccurately evaluating system reliability, because it overlooks the statistical dependence of lifetimes due to common stresses. In this study, for k -out-of- n : F systems with component and redundancy lifetimes linked by the Archimedean copula, we show that (i) allocating more homogeneous redundancies to the less reliable components tends to produce a redundant system with stochastically larger lifetime, (ii) the reliability of the redundant system can be uniformly maximized through balancing the allocation of homogeneous redundancies in the context of homogeneous components, and (iii) allocating a more reliable matched redundancy to a less reliable component produces a more reliable system. These novel results on k -out-of- n : F systems in which component and redundancy lifetimes are statistically dependent are more applicable to the complicated engineering systems that arise in real practice. Some numerical examples are also presented to illustrate these findings.},

In the classic model, it is assumed that all nodes have the same weight. We study voting protocols for heterogeneous weights with respect to fairness. A voting protocol is ; if the influence on the eventual outcome of a given participant is linear in its weight. Previous work used sampling with replacement to construct a fair voting scheme. However, it was shown that using greedy sampling, i.e., sampling with replacement until a given number of distinct elements is chosen, turns out to be more robust and performant.; In this paper, we study fairness of voting protocols with greedy sampling and propose a voting scheme that is asymptotically fair for a broad class of weight distributions. We complement our theoretical findings with numerical results and present several open questions and conjectures.},

A common scenario is that the infection times of individuals are unknown, but individuals, on displaying symptoms, are identified as infectious and removed from the population. We study the distribution of the number of infectives given only the times of removals in a Markovian susceptible–infectious–removed (SIR) epidemic. Primary interest is in the initial stages of the epidemic process, where a branching (birth–death) process approximation is applicable. We show that the number of individuals alive in a time-inhomogeneous birth–death process at time ; , given only death times up to and including time ; , is a mixture of negative binomial distributions, with the number of mixing components depending on the total number of deaths, and the mixing weights depending upon the inter-arrival times of the deaths. We further consider the extension to the case where some deaths are unobserved. We also discuss the application of the results to control measures and statistical inference.},

Our set-up covers many sparse geometric random graph models from the literature, including geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs), hyperbolic random graphs, continuum scale-free percolation, and weight-dependent random connection models.; We prove that the limiting degree distribution is mixed Poisson and the typical degree sequence is uniformly integrable, and we obtain convergence results on various measures of clustering in our graphs as a consequence of local convergence.

Using a similar argument as that in [; ], we show that this optimal prediction problem is equivalent to solving an optimal prediction problem in a finite-horizon setting. Surprisingly (unlike the infinite-horizon problem), an optimal stopping time is based on a curve that is killed at the moment the mean of the exponential time is reached. That is, an optimal stopping time is the first time the process crosses above a non-negative, continuous, and non-increasing curve depending on time. This curve and the value function are characterised as a solution of a system of nonlinear integral equations which can be understood as a generalisation of the free boundary equations (see e.g. [; , Chapter IV.14.1]) in the presence of jumps.

  abstract     = {The problem of optimally scaling the proposal distribution in a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is critical to the quality of the generated samples. Much work has gone into obtaining such results for various Metropolis–Hastings (MH) algorithms. Recently, acceptance probabilities other than MH are being employed in problems with intractable target distributions. There are few resources available on tuning the Gaussian proposal distributions for this situation. We obtain optimal scaling results for a general class of acceptance functions, which includes Barker’s and lazy MH. In particular, optimal values for Barker’s algorithm are derived and found to be significantly different from that obtained for the MH algorithm. Our theoretical conclusions are supported by numerical simulations indicating that when the optimal proposal variance is unknown, tuning to the optimal acceptance probability remains an effective strategy.},

Under a certain technical assumption, applying the theory of Crump–Mode–Jagers branching processes, we derive formulas for the limiting distributions of the proportion of vertices with a given degree and weight, and proportion of edges with endpoint having a certain weight. As an application of this theorem, we rigorously prove observations of Bianconi related to the evolving Cayley tree (; , paper no. 036116, 2002). We also study the process in depth when the technical condition can fail in the particular case when the fitness function is affine, a model we call ‘generalised preferential attachment with fitness’. We show that this model can exhibit condensation, where a positive proportion of edges accumulates around vertices with maximal weight, or, more drastically, can have a degenerate limiting degree distribution, where the entire proportion of edges accumulates around these vertices. Finally, we prove stochastic convergence for the degree distribution under a different assumption of a strong law of large numbers for the partition function associated with the process.},

Such stochastic processes are abundant in applications, in particular in biology. More precisely, for CTMCs of bounded jumps, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of calculable parameters for explosivity, recurrence versus transience, positive recurrence versus null recurrence, certain absorption, and implosivity. Simple sufficient conditions for exponential ergodicity of stationary distributions and quasi-stationary distributions as well as existence and nonexistence of moments of hitting times are also obtained. Similar simple sufficient conditions for the aforementioned dynamics together with their opposite dynamics are established for CTMCs with unbounded forward jumps. Finally, we apply our results to stochastic reaction networks, an extended class of branching processes, a general bursty single-cell stochastic gene expression model, and population processes, none of which are birth–death processes. The approach is based on a mixture of Lyapunov–Foster-type results, the classical semimartingale approach, and estimates of stationary measures.},

In this paper we consider models where, even if interaction among agents is present, absence of synchronization may happen because of the choice of an individual nonlinear reinforcement.

We characterize the salient properties of matryoshkan matrices that allow us to compute these moments in closed form at a specific time without computing the entire path of the process. This simplifies the computation of the polynomial process moments significantly. Through our method, we derive explicit expressions for both transient and steady-state moments of this class of Markov processes. We demonstrate the applicability of this method through explicit examples such as shot noise processes, growth–collapse processes, ephemerally self-exciting processes, and affine stochastic differential equations from the finance literature. We also show that we can derive explicit expressions for the self-exciting Hawkes process, for which finding closed-form moment expressions has been an open problem since their introduction in 1971. In general, our techniques can be used for any Markov process for which the infinitesimal generator of an arbitrary polynomial is itself a polynomial of equal or lower order.},

  abstract     = {This article examines large-time behaviour of finite-state mean-field interacting particle systems. Our first main result is a sharp estimate (in the exponential scale) of the time required for convergence of the empirical measure process of the ; -particle system to its invariant measure; we show that when time is of the order ; for a suitable constant ; , the process has mixed well and it is close to its invariant measure. We then obtain large-; asymptotics of the second-largest eigenvalue of the generator associated with the empirical measure process when it is reversible with respect to its invariant measure. We show that its absolute value scales as ; . The main tools used in establishing our results are the large deviation properties of the empirical measure process from its large-; limit. As an application of the study of large-time behaviour, we also show convergence of the empirical measure of the system of particles to a global minimum of a certain ‘entropy’ function when particles are added over time in a controlled fashion. The controlled addition of particles is analogous to the cooling schedule associated with the search for a global minimum of a function using the simulated annealing algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new matrix-infinite-product-form (MIP-form) solution for the stationary distribution in upper block-Hessenberg Markov chains (UBH-MCs). The existing MIP-form solution (Masuyama, ; , 2019, pp. 173–200) requires a certain parameter set that satisfies both a Foster–Lyapunov drift condition and a convergence condition. In contrast, the new MIP-form solution requires no such parameter sets and no other conditions. The new MIP-form solution also has ‘quasi-algorithmic constructibility’, which is a newly introduced feature of being constructed by iterating infinitely many times a recursive procedure of finite complexity per iteration. This feature is not found in the other existing solutions for the stationary distribution in general UBH-MCs.},
