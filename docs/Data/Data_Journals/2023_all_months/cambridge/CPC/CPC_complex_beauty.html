We show that derandomizing part of the non-backtracking random matrix simplifies the spectrum considerably, and then, we use Tao and Vu’s replacement principle and the Bauer-Fike theorem to show that the partly derandomized spectrum is, in fact, very close to the original spectrum.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a formula for translating any upper bound on the percolation threshold of a lattice $G$ into a lower bound on the exponential growth rate of lattice animals $a(G)$ and vice versa. We exploit this in both directions. We obtain the rigorous lower bound ${\dot{p}_c}({\mathbb{Z}}^3)\gt 0.2522$ for 3-dimensional site percolation. We also improve on the best known asymptotic bounds on $a({\mathbb{Z}}^d)$ as $d\to \infty$ . Our formula remains valid if instead of lattice animals we enumerate certain subspecies called interfaces. Enumerating interfaces leads to functional duality formulas that are tightly connected to percolation and are not valid for lattice animals, as well as to strict inequalities for the percolation threshold. Incidentally, we prove that the rate of the exponential decay of the cluster size distribution of Bernoulli percolation is a continuous function of $p\in (0,1)$ .},

  abstract     = {A graph is called $k$ -critical if its chromatic number is $k$ but every proper subgraph has chromatic number less than $k$ . An old and important problem in graph theory asks to determine the maximum number of edges in an $n$ -vertex $k$ -critical graph. This is widely open for every integer $k\geq 4$ . Using a structural characterisation of Greenwell and Lovász and an extremal result of Simonovits, Stiebitz proved in 1987 that for $k\geq 4$ and sufficiently large $n$ , this maximum number is less than the number of edges in the $n$ -vertex balanced complete $(k-2)$ -partite graph. In this paper, we obtain the first improvement in the above result in the past 35 years. Our proofs combine arguments from extremal graph theory as well as some structural analysis. A key lemma we use indicates a partial structure in dense $k$ -critical graphs, which may be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study a variation of the random $k$ -SAT problem, called polarised random $k$ -SAT, which contains both the classical random $k$ -SAT model and the random version of monotone $k$ -SAT another well-known NP-complete version of SAT. In this model there is a polarisation parameter $p$ , and in half of the clauses each variable occurs negated with probability $p$ and pure otherwise, while in the other half the probabilities are interchanged. For $p=1/2$ we get the classical random $k$ -SAT model, and at the other extreme we have the fully polarised model where $p=0$ , or 1. Here there are only two types of clauses: clauses where all $k$ variables occur pure, and clauses where all $k$ variables occur negated. That is, for $p=0$ , and $p=1$ , we get an instance of random monotone $k$ -SAT. We show that the threshold of satisfiability does not decrease as $p$ moves away from $\frac{1}{2}$ and thus that the satisfiability threshold for polarised random $k$ -SAT with $p\neq \frac{1}{2}$ is an upper bound on the threshold for random $k$ -SAT. Hence the satisfiability threshold for random monotone $k$ -SAT is at least as large as for random $k$ -SAT, and we conjecture that asymptotically, for a fixed $k$ , the two thresholds coincide.},

This is called the Ramsey upper density of ; and was introduced by Erdős and Galvin in a restricted setting, and by DeBiasio and McKenney in general. Recently [4], the Ramsey upper density of the infinite path was determined. Here, we find the value of this density for all locally finite graphs ; up to a factor of 2, answering a question of DeBiasio and McKenney. We also find the exact density for a wide class of bipartite graphs, including all locally finite forests. Our approach relates this problem to the solution of an optimisation problem for continuous functions. We show that, under certain conditions, the density depends only on the chromatic number of ; , the number of components of ; and the expansion ratio ; of the independent sets of ; .},

It is natural to ask how much can be gained by running ; multiple random walks independently and in parallel. Although the cover time of multiple walks has been investigated for many natural networks, the problem of finding a general characterisation of multiple cover times for ; start vertices (posed by Alon, Avin, Koucký, Kozma, Lotker and Tuttle in 2008) remains an open problem. First, we improve and tighten various bounds on the ; cover time when ; random walks start from vertices sampled from the stationary distribution. For example, we prove an unconditional lower bound of ; on the stationary cover time, holding for any ; -vertex graph ; and any ; . Secondly, we establish the ; cover times of multiple walks on several fundamental networks up to constant factors. Thirdly, we present a framework characterising ; cover times in terms of ; cover times and a novel, relaxed notion of mixing time for multiple walks called the ; . Roughly speaking, the partial mixing time only requires a specific portion of all random walks to be mixed. Using these new concepts, we can establish (or recover) the ; cover times for many networks including expanders, preferential attachment graphs, grids, binary trees and hypercubes.},

This result enables us to prove annealed convergence in various examples of critical random graphs, including critical Galton-Watson trees and the Erdős-Rényi random graph in the critical window.

  abstract     = {We study approximations for the Lévy area of Brownian motion which are based on the Fourier series expansion and a polynomial expansion of the associated Brownian bridge. Comparing the asymptotic convergence rates of the Lévy area approximations, we see that the approximation resulting from the polynomial expansion of the Brownian bridge is more accurate than the Kloeden–Platen–Wright approximation, whilst still only using independent normal random vectors. We then link the asymptotic convergence rates of these approximations to the limiting fluctuations for the corresponding series expansions of the Brownian bridge. Moreover, and of interest in its own right, the analysis we use to identify the fluctuation processes for the Karhunen–Loève and Fourier series expansions of the Brownian bridge is extended to give a stand-alone derivation of the values of the Riemann zeta function at even positive integers.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of finding pairwise vertex-disjoint triangles in the randomly perturbed graph model, which is the union of any ; -vertex graph ; satisfying a given minimum degree condition and the binomial random graph ; . We prove that asymptotically almost surely ; contains at least ; pairwise vertex-disjoint triangles, provided ; , where ; is a large enough constant. This is a perturbed version of an old result of Dirac.; Our result is asymptotically optimal and answers a question of Han, Morris, and Treglown [RSA, 2021, no. 3, 480–516] in a strong form. We also prove a stability version of our result, which in the case of pairwise vertex-disjoint triangles extends a result of Han, Morris, and Treglown [RSA, 2021, no. 3, 480–516]. Together with a result of Balogh, Treglown, and Wagner [CPC, 2019, no. 2, 159–176], this fully resolves the existence of triangle factors in randomly perturbed graphs.; We believe that the methods introduced in this paper are useful for a variety of related problems: we discuss possible generalisations to clique factors, cycle factors, and ; -universality.},
