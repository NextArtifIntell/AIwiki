When α = 2 α=2 , the equation is associated with the classical Matukuma equation − Δ u = u p ( x ) 1 + | x | 2 , u &gt; 0 i n R n . −Δu=up(x)1+|x|2,u&amp;gt;0inRn. We investigate qualitative properties of two kinds of positive solutions . One is the finite total mass solution, and the other is the finite energy solution. We investigate the qualitative properties of these solutions, including existence, radial symmetry , integrability and asymptotic behavior at infinity. Here we use the method of moving planes in integral forms introduced by Chen-Li-Ou to prove the radial symmetry, and develop a new comparing principle in integral forms to estimate the asymptotic rates. In addition, we consider the relation between finite total mass solutions and finite energy solutions, and in this process the Pohozaev identity in integral forms plays a key role.},

We discover optimal growth estimates of the elastic displacement when n = 1 , 2 n=1,2 , whose growth rates coincide with those for the free wave model, whereas when n = 3 n=3 the optimal decay rate is related to the Gaussian kernel. Furthermore, the large-time optimal leading term is firstly introduced by the combination of diffusion-waves, the heat kernel and singular components. We also illustrate a second-order profile of solution by diffusion-waves as a by-product. These results imply that the thermoelastic system has the wave-structure for large t in the one- and two-dimensional cases only.},

We give one detailed spectrum analysis on a linearized operator and the decay law in time of the solution semigroup for the linearized fractional compressible isentropic generalized Navier-Stokes equations around a constant state by the Fourier analysis technique, which is shown that the order of the fractional derivatives plays a key role in the analysis so that the spectrum structure involved here is more complex than that of the classical compressible Navier-Stokes system. Based on this and the elaborate energy method, the global-in-time existence and one optimal decay rate in time of the smooth solution are obtained under the assumption that the initial data are given in a small neighborhood of a constant state.},

As Liu, Peng and Wang pointed out in [20] , the smooth solutions of Cauchy problem for this system globally exist and converge to the shifted nonlinear diffusion waves. It is worth noting that due to the difficulty in constructing a group of correction functions to eliminate the gaps between the original solutions and the diffusion waves at infinity, they got their results under the stiff conditions m ± = 0 m±=0 and ϕ ± = a b ρ ± ϕ±=abρ± . However, by a deep observation, we realize that these two conditions can be removed. In this paper, by making full use of the results obtained in [20] , and with the help of a group of new correction functions, we get some more general results.},

In previous studies, the dissipative estimates for the electric field E appear to be singular and the orders of singularities for div E and ∇ × E ∇×E are different, hence a div-curl decomposition should be considered in our case, and this makes it unclear the preservation of the anti-symmetric structure of the system and the global-in-time L 2 L2 –estimate of the smooth solutions. To overcome these difficulties, we find a strictly convex entropy of the system that is valid for the case of non-constant equilibrium to obtain the global L 2 L2 –estimate and use some induction arguments to close the estimates. It is worth mentioning that in our proof, very careful and accurate estimates of solutions are needed and we show that the electric field E is actually non-singular, which is vital and necessary for our proof.},

The existence, uniqueness, regularity and asymptotic behavior of the solution are investigated. Moreover, we discuss how the friction coefficient affects the well-posedness of the solution. Due to the validity of the Korn&#39;s inequality, all constants in each a priori estimate are independent of the friction coefficient. Thus our method is also valid for the total-slip and no-slip cases. The main novelty is that the total flux of the velocity can be relatively large (proportional to the slip length ) when the friction coefficient of the Navier-slip boundary condition is small, which is essentially different from the 3D case.},

Based on the resulting asymptotic behavior , the asymptotic approximation of the SP equation is characterized with the soliton term confirmed by N ( I ) N(I) -soliton on discrete spectrum with residual error up to O ( t − 1 ) O(t−1) . Combining with previous results presented by Yang and Fan, that is the long time asymptotic expansion of the solution q ( x , t ) q(x,t) in solitonic region ξ = y t ∈ ( − ∞ , 0 ) ξ=yt∈(−∞,0) , our results show that the soliton resolution conjecture of the SP equation is fully solved in all space-time solitonic regions.

To consider the effects of heterogeneous habits on the evolution of the disease prevalence, an age-structured foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) model with nonlocal diffusion is proposed to describe the long distance movements of cattle. The next generation operator G is derived through establishing an extensively renewal equation and then the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 is the spectral radius of G . Moreover, the value of R 0 R0 serves as a threshold which distinguishes between the disappearance and an outbreak of FMD. The outbreak of FMD is the presentation of the endemic steady state by using the Krasnoselskii fixed point theorem . Finally, numerical simulations shed light on how the magnitudes of nonlocal diffusions affect the evolution of FMD spread.},

We first apply Kato&#39;s variable norm technique to show the well-posedness of the system without nonlinear terms and based on which, the well-posedness of the whole nonlinear system is proved by the fixed-point theory. The exponential stability of the nonlinear time-delay coupled PDEs&#39; system is further proved by the energy estimates together with multiplier techniques under certain conditions.

The authors concluded from numerical simulations that there is no evidence of dissipation cutoff for the electron MHD. In this paper we show the existence of determining wavenumber for the electron MHD, and establish a regularity condition only on the low modes of the solution. Our results suggest that the conclusion of the physics paper on the dissipation cutoff for the electron MHD is debatable.},

The approach for the similar problem on R 3 R3 becomes invalid due to the fewer decay rates. In this paper, we will give a positive answer to this problem. Namely, we shall focus on the Cauchy problem for the incompressible Oldroyd-B equations with only velocity dissipation on R 2 R2 and derive the small data global well-posedness under Sobolev setting. We also give the time decay estimate for the solutions. To achieve this goal, we explore the dissipative structure of system and develop the fractional time-weighted energy framework. Moreover, some delicate commutator and bilinear estimates are proposed to deal with the wildest nonlinear terms .},

This work investigates the small noise asymptotic of two-time-scale stochastic CBF equations in two and three dimensional bounded domains . More precisely, we establish a Wentzell-Freidlin type large deviation principle for stochastic partial differential equations that have slow and fast time-scales. The slow component is the stochastic CBF equations in two or three dimensions perturbed by a small multiplicative Gaussian noise, while the fast component is a stochastic reaction-diffusion equation with damping. The results are obtained by using a variational method (based on weak convergence approach) developed by Budhiraja and Dupuis, Khasminkii&#39;s time discretization approach and stopping time arguments. In particular, the findings from this study are also applicable to two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations.},

This is a free-boundary problem that models solidification and melting processes. We prove the local exact controllability to (smooth) trajectories. To this purpose, we first reformulate the problem as the local null controllability of a coupled PDE-ODE system with distributed controls. Then, a new Carleman inequality for the adjoint of the linearized PDE-ODE system, coupled on the boundary through nonlocal in space and memory terms, is presented. This leads to the null controllability of an appropriate linear system. Finally, the result is obtained via local inversion, by using Lyusternik-Graves&#39; Theorem. As a byproduct of our approach, we find that some parabolic equations which contains memory terms located on the boundary are null-controllable.},

We first prove the strong convergence of the solutions of a control equation with respect to the weak topology of controls, and then show the convergence in distribution of the solutions of the stochastic equation when the noise intensity approaches zero. We finally establish the large deviations of the stochastic equation by the weak convergence method. The main difficulty of the paper is caused by the non-compactness of Sobolev embeddings on unbounded domains, and the idea of uniform tail-ends estimates is employed to circumvent the obstacle in order to obtain the tightness of distribution laws of the stochastic equation and the precompactness of the control equation.},

Then we use Hilbert expansion method and generalized collision invariants (GCIs) hypothesis to construct the solutions of the SOK equations . Finally, we verify that the equilibrium related to the solution of the SOH equations is the limit of solutions of the SOK equations as ϵ → 0 ϵ→0 .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide a rigorous description of the birth of canard limit cycles in slow-fast systems in R 3 through the folded saddle-node of type II and the singular Hopf bifurcation . In particular, we prove – in the analytic case only – that for all 0 &lt; ϵ ≪ 1 there is a family of periodic orbits, born in the (singular) Hopf bifurcation and extending to O ( 1 ) cycles that follow the strong canard of the folded saddle-node. Our results can be seen as an extension of the canard explosion in R 2 , but in contrast to the planar case, the family of periodic orbits in R 3 is not explosive. For this reason, we have chosen to call the phenomena in R 3 , the “dud canard”. The main difficulty of the proof lies in connecting the Hopf cycles with the canard cycles, since these are described in different scalings. As in R 2 , we use blowup to overcome this, but we also have to compensate for the lack of uniformity near the Hopf bifurcation, due to its singular nature; it is a zero-Hopf bifurcation in the limit ϵ = 0 . In the present paper, we do so by imposing analyticity of the vector-field. This allows us to prove existence of an invariant slow manifold , that is not normally hyperbolic.},

In view of that, we construct the appropriate functional setting in order to pose the Cauchy problem. Then we obtain optimal polynomial large time decay rates and subsequently the first term in the asymptotic expansion of the solutions in L 2 ( R N − k × ( 0 , ∞ ) k ) L2(RN−k×(0,∞)k) . Particularly, we extend and improve the results obtained by Vázquez and Zuazua (J. Funct. Anal. 2000), which correspond to the case k = 0 k=0 , to any k ≥ 0 k≥0 . We emphasize that the higher the value of k the better time decay rates are.

Applying the classical energy method in homogenization theory, we study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions to these systems, without any restriction on the magnitude of the data, as the size of the perforations goes to zero and show that the effective equations remain unmodified in the limit. The main novelty of the present work lies in the obtainment of the required uniform bounds, which are achieved (in the case of the prescribed flux problem) by a contradiction argument based on Bernoulli&#39;s law for solutions of the stationary Euler equations .},

The rigorous derivation is divided into two articles. In this paper, we establish the solution theory of the degenerate parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel problem and its non-local version, which will be used in the second paper for the discussion of the mean-field limit. A parabolic regularized system is introduced to bridge the stochastic particle model and the degenerate Keller-Segel system. We derive the existence of the solution to this regularized system by constructing approximate solutions , giving uniform estimates and taking the limits, where a crucial step is to obtain the L ∞ L∞ Bernstein type estimate for the gradient of the approximate solution. Based on this, we obtain the well-posedness of the corresponding non-local equation through perturbation method . Finally, the weak solution of the degenerate Keller-Segel system is obtained by using a nonlinear version of Aubin-Lions lemma.},

First, we prove the existence of bounded mild solutions for SFEEs with infinite delay. Then, according to the relationship between the solution and (drift and diffusion) coefficients, we obtain such Poisson stable solutions. Because the solutions of the delay equations are not Markov, we employ the solution maps in some phase space as a viable alternative for studying further asymptotic properties , and we also discuss Poisson stable solution maps and their asymptotic stability .},

Some ideas developed in the former works do not appear to work due to the difficulty caused by diffusion, advection and protection zone. By applying the comparison principle for parabolic equations [32] and persistence theory [26] , [37] , we obtain almost complete long-time dynamics, which describes the optimal protection zone. If the predator functional response is Holling-type I, the uniqueness of the positive steady state has been derived, which improves the method proposed by López-Gómez and Pardo [20] and developed by Nie et al.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the global wellposedness of the Euler-Poisson-alignment (EPA) system. This system arises from collective dynamics, and features two types of nonlocal interactions: the repulsive electric force and the alignment force. It is known that the repulsive electric force generates oscillatory solutions, which is difficult to be controlled by the nonlocal alignment force using conventional comparison principles. We construct invariant regions such that the solution trajectories cannot exit, and therefore obtain global wellposedness for subcritical initial data that lie in the invariant regions. Supercritical regions of initial data are also derived which leads to finite-time singularity formations. To handle the oscillation and the nonlocality, we introduce a new way to construct invariant regions piece by piece in the phase plane of a reformulation of the EPA system. Our result is extended to the case when the alignment force is weakly singular. The singularity leads to the loss of a priori bounds crucial in our analysis. With the help of improved estimates on the nonlocal quantities, we design non-trivial invariant regions that guarantee global wellposedness of the EPA system with weakly singular alignment interactions.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by P.L. Lions&#39; seminal course on Mean Field Games (MFG) and the associated Master equation at Collège de France [19] , we investigate in the case of absence of control mean-field backward doubly stochastic differential equations (BDSDEs), i.e., BDSDEs whose driving coefficients also depend on the joint law of the solution process. This BDSDE can be interpreted as randomly perturbed recursive cost functional which we associate with a forward mean-field SDE. Defining the value function V = V ( t , x , μ ) V=V(t,x,μ) through this BDSDE, we prove that V = V ( t , x , μ ) V=V(t,x,μ) is the unique classical solution of a backward stochastic PDE over [ 0 , T ] × R d × P 2 ( R d ) [0,T]×Rd×P2(Rd) . This backward SPDE extends in the non-control case the Master equation studied in earlier works by different authors. The associated MFG can be interpreted as a forward dynamics endowed with a randomly perturbed recursive cost functional, the solution of the MFG system ( u ( t , x ) , m ( t ) ) (u(t,x),m(t)) remains also in this extended case related with V = V ( t , x , μ ) V=V(t,x,μ) by the relation u ( t , x ) = V ( t , x , m ( t ) ) u(t,x)=V(t,x,m(t)) . Our main objective is to characterise the random field V as classical solution of the backward SPDE. For this we study the regularity of V over [ 0 , T ] × R d × P 2 ( R d ) [0,T]×Rd×P2(Rd) . However, unlike the pioneering paper on BDSDEs by Pardoux-Peng [25] where V does not depend on the measure, here we have only an L 2 L2 -regularity of V with respect to its variables. Other difficulties to overcome and subtle technical proofs are related with the study of the L 2 L2 -regularity and, hence, that of the solution of the underlying mean-field BDSDE. It adds that our BDSDE needs weaker assumptions on the coefficients than in [25] . Finally, let us point out that for our approach we extend the classical mean-field Itô formula to smooth functions of solutions of mean-field BDSDEs. This formula contains earlier (mean-field) Itô formulas as special cases.},

Higher order estimates are also given: We find the H 1 H1 norm of the temperature fluctuation grows sub-exponentially as t → + ∞ t→+∞ . Meanwhile, for any m ≥ 1 m≥1 , we deduce that the H m Hm -temporal growth of the solution is slower than a double exponential function.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the spreading speed and periodic traveling waves for a time-periodic epidemic model in discrete media. There were some known results on spatial dynamics for autonomous discrete epidemic models. However, only little results had been done for the same issue of time-periodic epidemic models in discrete media. The main difficulties arise from the lack of comparison principle and compactness of solution operators for such systems. To overcome these difficulties, we first characterize the spreading speed of the system which can be used to estimate how fast the disease spreads. Then, based on constructing two different pairs of explicit subsolutions and supersolutions , we establish the existence of supercritical and critical periodic traveling waves by using the asymptotic fixed point theorem together with the properties of Kuratowski-measure of non-compactness for solution maps to a related linear equation . We further derive the non-existence of periodic traveling waves when the wave speed is smaller than the spreading speed. To the best of our knowledge, this might be the first time to consider the spatial dynamics of time-periodic epidemic models in discrete media.},

(2022) [2] studied the effects of diffusion rates on the dynamics of a time-periodic Lotka-Volterra competition-diffusion system with identical interspecific competition abilities. In this paper, we consider the case of different interspecific competition coefficients. The obtained results can be divided into two groups. The first part focuses on the interplay between the diffusion intensities and the interspecific competition coefficients on the dynamics in the weak competition case. We provide some sufficient conditions on coexistence and competitive exclusion. The second part considers the dynamics for fixed diffusion coefficients and varying competition coefficients. We not only provide a complete classification on the dynamics when one of the interspecific competition coefficients is small, but also show the multiple coexistence periodic patterns by applying the bifurcation method.},

First, we establish a high-order regularity estimate for the solution of variable coefficient Wentzell problem and a spectral theorem for the operator derived from this problem. And then, after a series of specialized analysis and investigation on the special structure and basic properties of some auxiliary systems , the lower-order term and the resolvent of the operator associated to the variable coefficient Wentzell system by virtue of the Riemannian geometry method and other ideas, we prove eventually that the energies of the system decay with the rate 1 / t 1/t . As can be seen, even for the constant coefficient case, the decay rate 1 / t 1/t obtained in this paper is essentially better than the decay rate t − 4 / 5 t−4/5 given in the previous work.},

We carry out a complete spectral analysis of the system operator associated with the abstract spectral problem in Hilbert space . Within this framework it is shown that the eigenvectors have the property of forming a Riesz (i.e. an unconditional) basis, which makes it possible to directly deduce the exponential stability of the corresponding C 0 C0 -semigroup using spectral information for the system operator alone. A physically interesting conclusion is that the particular choice of vertex conditions ensures the exponential stability even when the elasticity acting on the slopes of the edges is absent.},

These are the challenges for bifurcation analysis. In comparison to the 2-dimensional case, the kernel of the linearized operator is no longer one-dimensional for our 3-dimensional multilayered tumor model. In particular, some monotonicity properties enjoyed in Friedman and Hu (2008) [6] and Zhao and Hu (2020) [26] are no longer valid here, which adds complexity to the kernel of the linearized operator. The novelty of this paper is to explore periodicity and symmetry in order to develop an effective method for the bifurcation in this case.

By the normal form theorem , we prove that under some assumptions, the original mapping is changed into its linear part via an analytic convergent transformation, so that invariants curves are obtained. In the iterative process, by solving the modified homological equations, we ensure that the transformed mapping is still reversible. As an application, we investigate the invariant curves of a class of nonlinear resonant oscillators, with the Birkhoff constants of the corresponding Poincaré mapping all zeros or not.},

  abstract     = {This work is concerned with nonlinear feedback control design for the problem of fluid mixing via advection. The overall dynamics is governed by the transport and Stokes equations in an open bounded and connected domain Ω ⊂ R d Ω⊂Rd , with d = 2 d=2 or d = 3 d=3 . The feedback laws are constructed based on the ideas of instantaneous control as well as a direct approximation of the optimality system derived from an optimal open-loop control problem. It can be shown that under appropriate numerical discretization schemes, two approaches generate the same sub-optimal feedback law. On the other hand, different discretization schemes may result in feedback laws of different regularity, which determine different mixing results. The Sobolev norm of the dual space ( H 1 ( Ω ) ) ′ (H1(Ω))′ of H 1 ( Ω ) H1(Ω) is used as the mix-norm to quantify mixing based on the known property of weak convergence. The major challenge is encountered in the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the closed-loop systems due to the absence of diffusion in the transport equation together with its nonlinear coupling with the flow equations. To address these issues, we first establish the decay properties of the velocity, which in turn help obtain the estimates on scalar mixing and its long-time behavior. Finally, mixed continuous Galerkin (CG) and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are employed to discretize the closed-loop system. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate our ideas and compare the effectiveness of different feedback laws.},

Moreover, we show that these k -boundary spikes are separated from each other at a distance of O ( log ⁡ ( β ε γ ) γ ) O(log⁡(βεγ)γ) as β ε γ → ∞ βεγ→∞ or O ( ( β ε ) 1 2 ) O((βε)12) as β ε γ → 0 βεγ→0 , respectively. The latter case proposes a new concentration feature of the activator-inhibitor type reaction-diffusion system which is barely observed in Gierer-Meinhardt system. The mechanism behind the scene is driven by two competing forces: a short range gravitational force with mass positioned at a local maximum point of the curvature and a long range repelling force between spikes whose major part comes from the Green&#39;s function of screened Poisson operator on the half space.}}},

When the tangential component of the magnetic field is imposed the zero Neumann boundary condition , we can establish the uniform energy estimates of the solutions to the initial boundary value problem in the conormal Sobolev spaces even if the velocity field satisfies the no-slip boundary condition. Then the vanishing dissipation limit of solutions to the initial boundary value problem can be achieved in L ∞ L∞ sense based on some compactness arguments.

The key point is to establish the a priori estimate for the corresponding linearized problem via the careful analysis for the associated boundary layers. Furthermore, the well-posedness theory for the Navier-Stokes system is also proved even when the L 2 L2 -norm of the external force is large. These results prove the uniqueness of solutions for the steady Navier-Stokes system even when the flux is large and the flow is not symmetric. In particular, if the vertical velocity is suitably small where the smallness is independent of the flux, then Poiseuille flow is the unique solution of the steady Navier-Stokes system in the periodic strip.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present some unexpected answers to two problems with longstanding interest. More specifically, we show that a bounded primitive function of an asymptotically almost periodic function from R R to a Banach space X is remotely almost periodic if and only if c 0 ⊄ X c0⊄X . This gives a natural analogy of the classical Bohl-Bohr-Amerio-Kadets theorem for asymptotically almost periodic functions . Based on this result, we succeed in extending the classical Loomis theorem in [13] to asymptotically almost periodic case without any ergodic conditions, and apply our Loomis type theorems to abstract Cauchy problems. Moreover, we give an example of inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation with asymptotically almost periodic coefficient, whose solution is not asymptotically almost periodic but remotely almost periodic. This demonstrates that remotely almost periodic functions is the natural class for solutions to some partial differential equations , which is similar to a remarkable phenomenon revealed by Shen and Yi (1998) [20] using dynamical system approach.},

The main purpose here is to elucidate the effect of the angular velocity in the structure of the steady flows. We show the well-posedness of all kinds of types of radially symmetric spiral flows including radial subsonic/supersonic/transonic flows, and further give a specific classification of the flow patterns under the assumption of various boundary conditions at the inner and the outer circle. Additionally, different from the purely radial case, the uniqueness of radial subsonic flow can not be obtained due to the nonlocal effect caused by the angular velocity, consequently we prove the uniqueness of the radial subsonic solution in the case without the semiconductor effect or with a small current assumption. Moreover, some new patterns of spiral flows with or without shock are observed, such as a smooth transonic flow and a supersonic-supersonic shock flow for a large relaxation time parameter.},

Moreover, we prove that for any 2D flow with a non vanishing smooth b inducing a unique incommensurable rotation vector ξ , the fine expansion holds in R 2 if, and only if, ξ 1 / ξ 2 is a Diophantine number. The case where ξ is commensurable is also investigated. Finally, several examples illustrate the different results, including the case of a vanishing b which blows up the asymptotic expansion in some direction.

To explore multiple effects of spatial structure, seasonality and human behavior change on cholera transmission, we establish a reaction-advection-diffusion model with a general boundary condition at the downstream end of the river. We derive the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 and discuss its asymptotic behaviors . We further show that R 0 R0 is a strictly decreasing function of the bacterial loss c , which reveals that the bacterial loss at the downstream end of the river due to water flux reduces the risk of cholera transmission. Then we derive a threshold-type result in terms of R 0 R0 . More precisely, (i) if R 0 &lt; 1 R0&amp;lt;1 , the disease-free periodic solution is globally attractive; (ii) if R 0 &gt; 1 R0&amp;gt;1 , the disease is uniformly persistent; (iii) if R 0 = 1 R0=1 , the disease-free steady state is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of the advection term, in which the proof is quite challenging due to the introduction of human behavior change, involving some subtle inequalities and estimates. Numerically, an application is demonstrated by investigating the cholera outbreak in Somalia from 1995 to 2016.},

They are obtained by studying some Abelian integrals, via degenerate Andronov-Hopf bifurcations or by using the Bendixson-Dulac criterion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the probability of existence of limit cycles for a non-trivial family of planar systems is obtained analytically.

We consider the asymptotic behavior of positive steady-states as equal two cross-diffusion coefficients tend to infinity (so-called the full cross-diffusion limit). The first result shows that, at the full cross-diffusion limit, the set of positive steady-state solutions can be classified into two types: the small coexistence or the complete segregation . The small coexistence can be characterized by the set of positive solutions of a nonlinear elliptic equation , while the complete segregation can be characterized by the set of nodal solutions of another nonlinear elliptic equation. The second result concerns the global bifurcation structure of the 1d model with large cross-diffusion terms to show that the branch of small coexistence bifurcates from the trivial solution and many branches of complete segregation bifurcate from solutions on the branch of small coexistence. Finally, in order to verify the theoretical results, we chase some bifurcation branches numerically via the continuation software pde2path .},

However, the conventional method is not sufficient for the application to the hyperbolic partial differential equation with time-dependent coefficients to obtain the Lipschitz stability, and further innovations are needed.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a diffusion-advection Lotka-Volterra competition model with stage structure in a spatially heterogeneous environment. The existence and local asymptotic stability of spatially non-homogeneous semi-trivial steady-state solutions and spatially non-homogeneous positive steady-state solutions are obtained by the implicit function theorem and spectral analysis. We show that three scenarios can occur: if random diffusion rates of two species are sufficiently large, both species go extinct; if random diffusion rates of two species are relatively small, two competing species coexist; if one species has a large random diffusion rate and the other has a small random diffusion rate, the species with a large random diffusion rate are driven to extinction. An interesting finding is that a large delay does not lead to Hopf bifurcation at the spatially non-homogeneous steady-state solution, but makes this steady-state solution approach zero. We numerically demonstrate the effects of spatial heterogeneity on spatiotemporal dynamics.},

The system is influenced by several competing forces, in particular a source term acting on the wave equation which is allowed to have a supercritical exponent. Our results build upon those obtained by Becklin and Rammaha [8] . With some restrictions on the parameters in the system and with careful analysis involving the Nehari manifold we obtain global existence of potential well solutions and establish either exponential or algebraic decay rates of energy, dependent upon the behavior of the damping terms. The main novelty in this work lies in our stabilization estimate, which notably does not generate lower-order terms. Consequently, the proof of the main result is shorter and more concise.},

According to Saha&#39;s ionization equation, the equations of state for the basic thermodynamic variables of an ionized gas depend also on the degree of ionization, which leads to the loss of concavity of the physical entropy in some small bounded domain . Such a property of the ionized gas together with the unboundedness of the domain under our consideration makes it hard to derive the desired dissipative estimates on the first-order spatial derivative of both the bulk velocity and the absolute temperature, thus making the problem more challenging. In this paper, for a class of constant non-vacuum equilibrium states with positive temperature, we succeed in deducing the desired uniform-in-time bounds on the above mentioned dissipative estimates on both the bulk velocity and the absolute temperature. Based on such an estimate, we can then establish the global existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem of one-dimensional viscous and heat-conducting ionized gas with positive constant or density-dependent viscosity and show that such a class of constant non-vacuum equilibrium states is time asymptotically nonlinear stable.},

There are two major contributions in this work which are new to the literature. First, under a mild condition on the medium parameters, we prove the existence of an acoustic-elastic transmission eigenvalue. Second, we establish a geometric rigidity result of the transmission eigenfunctions by showing that they tend to localize on the boundary of the underlying domain. Moreover, we also consider interesting implications of the obtained results to the effective construction of metamaterials by using bubbly elastic structures and to the inverse problem associated with the fluid-structure interaction.},

We find that if sufficiently many directions in the phase space are stochastically forced, the system is exponentially attractive toward its unique invariant measure with a convergent rate that is uniform with respect to the mass. Then, in the small mass limit, we prove the convergence of the first marginal of the invariant measures in a suitable Wasserstein distance toward the unique invariant measure of a stochastic reaction–diffusion equation. Together with the uniform geometric ergodicity , we obtain the validity of the small mass limit for the solutions on the infinite time horizon [ 0 , ∞ ) [0,∞) .

Our theoretical results characterize the effects of acid resistance and mutual competition of healthy cells and tumor cells on tumor progression in the long term, i.e., whether the healthy cells and tumor cells coexist or the tumor cells prevail after tumor invasion. A key feature of this model is the density-limited tumor diffusion term for tumor cells, which might give rise to the degeneracy of the parabolic equation . To overcome this difficulty, we combine the construction of suitable Lyapunov functionals and upper/lower solutions. This paper continues and improves the work begun in [15] .},

Our approach relies upon rough paths theory and stopping times analysis in a suitable scale of interpolation spaces . The core step is to derive the adequate algebraic and analytical properties of a sequence of stopping times, which allows us to establish the required compact tempered absorbing set. The existence of a pullback attractor for the generated random dynamical system is straightforward.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with stochastic differential equations (SDEs for short) with irregular coefficients. By utilising a functional analytic approximation approach, we establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to a class of SDEs with critically irregular drift coefficients in a new critical Lebesgue space, where the element may be only weakly integrable in time. To be more precise, let b : [ 0 , T ] × R d → R d b:[0,T]×Rd→Rd be Borel measurable, where T &gt; 0 T&amp;gt;0 is arbitrarily fixed and d ⩾ 1 d⩾1 . We consider the following SDE X t = x + ∫ 0 t b ( s , X s ) d s + W t , t ∈ [ 0 , T ] , x ∈ R d , Xt=x+∫0tb(s,Xs)ds+Wt,t∈[0,T],x∈Rd, where { W t } t ∈ [ 0 , T ] {Wt}t∈[0,T] is a d -dimensional standard Wiener process . For p , q ∈ [ 1 , + ∞ ) p,q∈[1,+∞) , we denote by C [ q ] ( [ 0 , T ] ; L p ( R d ) ) C[q]([0,T];Lp(Rd)) the space of all Borel measurable functions f such that t 1 q f ( t ) ∈ C ( [ 0 , T ] ; L p ( R d ) ) t1qf(t)∈C([0,T];Lp(Rd)) . If b = b 1 + b 2 b=b1+b2 such that | b 1 ( T − ⋅ ) | ∈ C [ q ] ( [ 0 , T ] ; L p ( R d ) ) |b1(T−⋅)|∈C[q]([0,T];Lp(Rd)) with 2 / q + d / p = 1 2/q+d/p=1 and ‖ b 1 ( T − ⋅ ) ‖ C [ q ] ( [ 0 , T ] ; L p ( R d ) ) ‖b1(T−⋅)‖C[q]([0,T];Lp(Rd)) is sufficiently small, and that b 2 b2 is bounded and Borel measurable, then we show that there exists a weak solution to the above equation, and if in addition lim t ↓ 0 ⁡ ‖ t 1 q b ( T − t ) ‖ L p ( R d ) = 0 limt↓0⁡‖t1qb(T−t)‖Lp(Rd)=0 , the pathwise uniqueness holds. Furthermore, we obtain the strong Feller property of the semi-group and the existence of density associated with the above SDE. Besides, we extend the classical results concerning partial differential equations (PDEs) of parabolic type with L q ( 0 , T ; L p ( R d ) ) Lq(0,T;Lp(Rd)) coefficients to the case of parabolic PDEs with L [ q ] ∞ ( 0 , T ; L p ( R d ) ) L[q]∞(0,T;Lp(Rd)) coefficients, and derive the Lipschitz regularity for solutions of second order parabolic PDEs (see Theorem 3.1 ). Our results extend Krylov-Röckner and Krylov&#39;s profound results of SDEs with singular time dependent drift coefficients [20] , [23] to the critical case of SDEs with critically irregular drift coefficients in a new critical Lebesgue space.},

Different from the initial and boundary value problem , the existence of time periodic solution is proved under no any smallness assumptions on chemotactic coefficient. Subsequently, we investigate the reason of pattern formation. It is generally known that there is no pattern formation for the homogeneous boundary value problem. Therefore, the pattern formation is partly caused by non-homogeneous boundary conditions, but chemotaxis is also an indispensable condition. In fact, it is proved that the density of bacteria will tend to be evenly distributed when the chemotactic intensity tends to 0. At last, the idea of finding time periodic pattern is also applied to prove the steady-state pattern formation of chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes model.},

Interestingly, when there is no coexistence of strains, it is possible for the “weak” strain to be dominant for some intermediate range of diffusion rates, in strong contrast to small and large diffusion cases where the “weak” strain always goes extinct.},

In particular, both the optimal decay rates of the mass functions and the decay estimates of the velocity towards its asymptotic profile as time goes to infinity are studied.

In the case of zero sound speed ⁎ P ′ ( ρ ⁎ ) = 0 P′(ρ⁎)=0 , it is found that the linearized system admits the purely parabolic structure, which enables us to establish the global-in-time existence and Gevrey analyticity of strong solutions in hybrid Besov spaces of L p Lp -type. Precisely, if the full viscosity coefficient and capillary coefficient satisfy ν ¯ 2 ≥ 4 κ ¯ ν¯2≥4κ¯ , then the acoustic waves are not available in compressible fluids. Consequently, the prior L 2 L2 boundedness on the low frequencies of density and velocity could be improved to the general L p Lp version with 1 ≤ p &lt; d 1≤p&amp;lt;d . The proof mainly relies on new nonlinear Besov (-Gevrey) estimates for product and composition of functions.},

In this model, the mass conservation equation for the pedestrian density authorizes non-classical shocks at the location of the so-called turning curve. We consider linear (more precisely, affine) cost functions, whose slopes α ⩾ 0 α⩾0 correspond to different crowd behaviours. We prove for the first time an existence result in the framework of entropy solutions, for general data. Differently from the partial existence results available in the literature, our existence result allows for the possible presence of non-classical shocks. The proofs are based on a sharply formulated many-particle approximation scheme, with careful treatment of interactions of particles with the turning curve. First, we rigorously establish the well-posedness of this many-particle scheme. Then we develop a local compactness argument that permits to circumvent the lack of available BV bounds in a vicinity of the turning curve, while proving consistency of the approximation scheme with the entropy formulation. Finally, we illustrate numerically that the model is able to reproduce typical behaviours in case of evacuation. Special attention is devoted to the impact of the parameter α on the evacuation time.},

  abstract     = {We consider a general second order matrix operator in a multi-dimensional domain subject to a classical boundary condition. We perturbed it by a first order differential operator arbitrarily depending on a small multi-dimensional parameter and we study the existence of a limiting (homogenized) operator in the sense of the norm resolvent convergence. The first part of our main results states that the norm resolvent convergence is equivalent to the convergence of the coefficients in the perturbing operator in certain space of multipliers. The second part of our results says that the convergence in the mentioned spaces of multipliers is equivalent to the convergence of certain local mean values over small pieces of the considered domains. These results are supported by series of examples. We also provide a series of ways of generating new non-periodically oscillating perturbations for which our results are applicable.},

  abstract     = {The influence of media coverage on disease transmission has attracted more and more attention, but the impact mechanism of media coverage with asymptomatic infection needs to be studied urgently. Therefore, a S I s I a S − M SIsIaS−M model with two delays and asymptomatic infection is considered. The two kinds of delays are respectively caused by the lag time of media reports about the number of patients and the lag time of audience feedback after media coverage. By using the geometric approach based on the third compound matrix, the existence of a threshold for the average duration of media coverage ensures that the endemic equilibrium in delay-free differential system is globally asymptotically stable . In the delay system the uniqueness, positivity and boundedness of solutions are investigated, and the system is persistent when R 0 &gt; 1 R0&amp;gt;1 . Through stability analysis, we find that the disease can be eliminated when the proportion of symptomatic patients in total patients is above a threshold. By choosing the sum of two delays as a bifurcation parameter, we analyze the stability switches of the endemic equilibrium, and discuss the onset and termination of Hopf bifurcations of periodic solutions. The properties of local Hopf bifurcation are also obtained. Furthermore, the global Hopf bifurcations are unbounded and a sufficient condition for the system to have multiple periodic solutions is obtained. Three parameters related to media coverage are found in numerical simulations to have thresholds that guarantee the stability of the endemic equilibrium. In numerical simulations, if media coverage is highly responsive to the number of patients or it has a strong influence on individual behavioural changes, this can lead to periodic oscillations. Conversely, although this makes the disease stable, the number of patients who reach steady state is higher. This is the same result as for the dissipation rate of media coverage, and again there is a threshold that makes the endemic equilibrium stable.},

The limit behaviors of flows on surfaces are captured by the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem using the ω -limit sets. This paper demonstrates that the positive and negative long-time behaviors are not independent. In fact, we show the dependence between the ω -limit sets and the α -limit sets of points of flows on surfaces, which partially generalizes the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem. Applying the dependency result to solve what kinds of the ω -limit sets appear in the area-preserving (or, more generally, non-wandering) flows on compact surfaces, we show that the ω -limit set of any non-closed orbit of such a flow on a compact surface is either a subset of singular points or a locally dense Q-set. Moreover, we show the wildness of surgeries to add totally disconnected singular points and the tameness of those to add finitely many singular points for flows on surfaces.},

Although explicit counterexamples to both existence and uniqueness are known since [6] , the problem of whether one can still find sticky particle solutions for a large set of data and of how one can select them was up to our knowledge still completely open. In this paper we prove that for a comeager set of initial data in the weak topology the pressureless Euler system admits a unique sticky particle solution given by a free flow where trajectories are disjoint straight lines. Indeed, such an existence and uniqueness result holds for a broader class of solutions decreasing their kinetic energy, which we call dissipative solutions, and which turns out to be the compact weak closure of the classical sticky particle solutions. Therefore any scheme for which the energy is l.s.c. and is dissipated will converge, for a comeager set of data, to our solution, i.e. the free flow.},

More precisely, the generator g ( t , y , z ) g(t,y,z) can have more general growth and continuity in the first unknown variable y in the local solution; while in the global solution, the generator g ( t , y , z ) g(t,y,z) can have a skew sub-quadratic but in addition “strictly and diagonally” quadratic growth in the second unknown variable z , or the terminal value can be unbounded but the generator g ( t , y , z ) g(t,y,z) is “diagonally dependent” on the variable z (i.e., the i -th component g i gi of the generator g only depends on the i -th row z i zi of z for each i = 1 , ⋯ , n i=1,⋯,n ). Three new results are established on the local and global solutions when the terminal value is bounded and the generator g is subject to some general assumptions. When the terminal value is unbounded but is of exponential moments of arbitrary order, an existence and uniqueness result is given under the assumptions that the generator g ( t , y , z ) g(t,y,z) is Lipschitz continuous in y , and varies with z in a “diagonal”, “component-wisely convex or concave”, and “quadratically growing” way, which seems to be the first general solvability of system of quadratic BSDEs with unbounded terminal values.

Secondly, we show that there exists a unique recurrent solution (in particular, periodic, almost periodic, almost automorphic, etc.) to the original equation in a neighborhood of the stationary solution of the averaged equation when the time scale is small. Finally, we establish the global averaging principle in weak sense, i.e. we show that the attractor of original system tends to that of the averaged equation in probability measure space as ε goes to zero.},

The Ambrosetti-Prodi type result is proved in the absence of the so-called anticoercivity condition. Furthermore, with s as a parameter, under some conditions on the function h , it has been shown that for any M &gt; 1 M&amp;gt;1 there exists s M ∈ R sM∈R such that the equation x ″ + f ( x ) x ′ + h ( t , x ) = s x″+f(x)x′+h(t,x)=s has two positive T -periodic solutions u 1 ( ⋅ ; s ) u1(⋅;s) and u 2 ( ⋅ ; s ) u2(⋅;s) satisfying min ⁡ { u 1 ( t ; s ) : t ∈ [ 0 , T ] } &gt; M min⁡{u1(t;s):t∈[0,T]}&amp;gt;M and min ⁡ { u 2 ( t ; s ) : t ∈ [ 0 , T ] } &lt; 1 / M min⁡{u2(t;s):t∈[0,T]}&amp;lt;1/M for every s &lt; s M s&amp;lt;sM .

Under the condition that the global Lipschitz constant of nonlinear term f is less than the absolute value of the top Lyapunov exponent for the linear flow Φ with f being monotone or anti-monotone, and the time delay is not very big, we show that the infinite-dimensional stochastic flow possesses a unique globally attracting random equilibrium in the state space of continuous functions , which produces the globally stable stationary solution.

  abstract     = {The main aim of this article is to establish an effective criterion for a positive parametric topological entropy to differential equations with multivalued nonautonomous impulses on tori. The crucial tool for this goal consists in developing an appropriate Ivanov-like inequality for the lower estimate of a new kind of entropy by means of the logarithm of asymptotic Nielsen numbers for the compositions of a one-parameter family of multivalued admissible maps. This inequality is then applied to impulsive differential equations on tori via the associated Poincaré translation operators along their trajectories. The obtained results generalize in a significant way those in our recent papers, especially in the one with the same title (whence the indication by II), into a multivalued setting. Another nontrivial generalization can be regarded with respect to their simple reduction into a “nonparametric” case.},

We show that the effective permittivity and permeability generated by such cluster is explicitly characterized by the corresponding electric and magnetic polarization tensors of the fixed shape. The error of the approximation of the scattered fields corresponding to the cluster and the effective medium is inversely proportional to the dilution parameter c r : = δ a cr:=δa , where a is the maximum diameter of the nanoparticles and δ is the minimum distance between them. The constant of the proportionality is given in terms of a-priori bounds on the cluster of nanoparticles (i.e. upper and lower bounds on their permittivity and permeability parameters, upper bound on the dilution parameter c r cr , the used incident frequency and the domain Ω). A key point of the analysis is to show that the Foldy-Lax field appearing in the meso-scale approximation, derived in [17] , is a discrete form of a (continuous) system of Lippmann-Schwinger equations with a related effective permittivity and permeability contrasts. To derive this, we prove that the Lippmann-Schwinger operator, for the Maxwell system, is invertible in the Hölder spaces. As a by-product, this shows a Hölder regularity property of the electromagnetic fields up to the boundary of the inhomogeneity.},

Our approach makes use of geometric tangential methods, which consist of importing “fine regularity estimates” from a limiting profile, i.e., the Recession operator, associated with the original second-order one via compactness and stability procedures. As a result, we pay special attention to the borderline scenario, i.e., f ∈ BMO p ⊋ L ∞ f∈BMOp⊋L∞ . In such a setting, we prove that solutions enjoy BMO p BMOp type estimates for their second derivatives. Finally, as another application of our findings, we obtain Hessian estimates to obstacle-type problems under oblique boundary conditions and no convexity assumptions, which may have their own mathematical interest. A density result for a suitable class of viscosity solutions will also be addressed.}}},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the rotation theory for a random dynamical system φ on the m -dimensional torus T m ( m ≥ 1 ) Tm(m≥1) . Here φ is generated by random composition of a collection of continuous maps φ ω φω , ω ∈ Ω ω∈Ω , each of which is homotopic to the identity. Let Φ ω Φω be the fundamental lift of φ ω , ω ∈ Ω φω,ω∈Ω , and assume that the periodic maps Φ ω − i d , ω ∈ Ω Φω−id,ω∈Ω , are uniformly bounded on R m Rm . Firstly, the notions of rotation set, pointwise rotation set and measure rotation set for φ are introduced and investigated. It is shown that the rotation set is a random compact and connected set. Secondly, the notion of rotational entropy, which connects the topological entropy and the rotation theory, of φ is introduced. It is shown that the rotational entropy is zero, however, it can be positive, even infinite without the above assumption.},

The threshold dynamics are determined by the mortality rate of the specialist predators and the predation rate of the generalist predators, respectively. We demonstrate that, no matter how large advection and diffusion rates are, the specialist predators can successfully invade as long as the mortality rate is sufficiently small, while the generalist predators can take-over the prey if the predation rate is relatively large. Finally, we explore the impacts of diffusion and advection on the asymptotic profiles of positive steady states. Our results imply that large advection rates and small diffusion rates will lead to the concentration of the species at the downstream or the upstream. Moreover, if the diffusion rates are large, then the densities of the species will be less spatial heterogeneous.},

Unlike the original Schrödinger-Lohe system, where the interaction strength was assumed to be uniform, in the cases under our consideration the total mass of each quantum oscillator is allowed to vary in time. A striking consequence of this property is that these extended models yield configurations exhibiting phase, but not space, synchronization. The results are mainly based on the analysis of the ODE systems arising from the correlations, control over the well known Cucker-Smale dynamics, and the dynamics satisfied by the quantum order parameter.},

In the deterministic case, there are examples of non-uniqueness in our framework. Strong (or pathwise) uniqueness is restored by means of a suitable additive Wiener noise. The proof of uniqueness relies on the study of related systems of infinite dimensional forward-backward SDEs (FBSDEs). This is a different approach with respect to the well-known method based on the Itô formula and the associated Kolmogorov equation (the so-called Zvonkin transformation or Itô-Tanaka trick). We deal with approximating FBSDEs in which the linear part generates a group of bounded linear operators in H ; such approximations depend on the type of SPDEs we are considering.

Furthermore, we consider the dependence of the spreading speed on the dispersal rate and reaction term and prove that taking the temporal average or spatial average can decrease the spreading speed. Finally, we employ the viscosity vanishing method to establish the existence of time-space periodic traveling fronts with the critical speed in every direction under the partially temporally homogeneous case and partially nearly flat case, which solves partially the open problem raised by Rawal, Shen, and Zhang ( Discrete Contin.

  abstract     = {We introduce the concept of stochastic measure-valued solutions to the complete Euler system describing the motion of a compressible inviscid fluid subject to stochastic forcing, where the nonlinear terms are described by defect measures. These solutions are weak in the probabilistic sense (probability space is not a given ‘priori’, but part of the solution) and analytical sense (derivatives only exist in the sense distributions). In particular, we show that existence and weak-strong principle (i.e. a weak measure-valued solution coincides with a strong solution provided the later exists) hold true provided they satisfy some form of energy balance. Finally, we show the existence of Markov selection to the associated martingale problem.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate systematically the supercritical conditions on the pressure π associated to a Navier-Stokes solution v (in three-dimensions), which ensure a reduction in the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set at a first potential blow-up time. As a consequence, we show that if the pressure π satisfies the endpoint scale invariant conditions π ∈ L t r , ∞ L x s , ∞ with 2 r + 3 s = 2 and r ∈ ( 1 , ∞ ) , π∈Ltr,∞Lxs,∞with2r+3s=2andr∈(1,∞), then the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set at a first potential blow-up time is arbitrarily small. This hinges on two ingredients: (i) the proof of a higher integrability result for the Navier-Stokes equations with certain supercritical assumptions on π and (ii) the establishment of a convenient ε -regularity criterion involving space-time integrals of | ∇ v | 2 | v | q − 2 with q ∈ ( 2 , 3 ) . |∇v|2|v|q−2withq∈(2,3).

The threshold values are introduced as the principal eigenvalues of the periodic problems with pulses and defined by the spectral radius of a time- T map. We have obtained two critical advection curves depending on pulses that determine the stability of the periodic steady states and have computed these numerically. The dynamics of two competitors in open advective environments such as competition exclusion, co-extinction, coexistence and bistability have been classified. By applying different impulsive effects, simulation analysis shows interesting scenarios, and reveals that a tradeoff between two different impulsive interventions and movements can be found in order to improve sustainable ecological development and economic benefits.},

In this paper, we extend his result into the case with the general homogeneous nonlinearity by the technique due to the Fourier series expansion introduced by Masaki and the second author [26] . To adapt the argument in the aforementioned paper, we develop a factorization identity for the propagator and require a little stronger decay condition for the Fourier coefficients arising from the harmonic potential.

We also preclude concentrations of limit measures on acyclic saddle or trap chains. This illustrates that limit measures are concentrated on Liapunov stable compact invariant sets . Applications are made to the Morse–Smale systems, the Axiom A systems including structural stability systems and separated star systems, the gradient or gradient-like systems, those systems possessing the Poincaré–Bendixson property with a finite number of limit sets to obtain that limit measures live on Liapunov stable critical elements, Liapunov stable basic sets, Liapunov stable equilibria and Liapunov stable limit sets including equilibria, limit cycles and saddle or trap cycles, respectively. Four nontrivial examples admitting a unique limit measure are provided, two of which possess infinite equivalent classes and their supports are Liapunov stable periodic orbits, one is supported on saddle-nodes.},

The system is a toy model for biological pattern formation. Traveling wave solutions correspond to heteroclinic orbits of a fast-slow system. Under some conditions, the reduced problem (with ϵ = 0 ϵ=0 ) has a heteroclinic orbit with jump discontinuity , while the layer problem (i.e., the fast subsystem obtained as another limit of ϵ → 0 ϵ→0 ) has an orbit filling the gap. We thus construct a singular orbit by piecing together these two orbits. The traveling wave solution is obtained in the neighborhood of the singular orbit. However, unlike the classical FitzHugh-Nagumo equations, the singular orbit contains a fold point where the normal hyperbolicity breaks down and the standard Fenichel theory is not applicable. To circumvent this difficulty we employ the directional blowup method for geometric desingularization around the fold point.},

This class of optimization problems is strongly utilized in engineering, biology and finance. In this paper, a stochastic gradient method is proposed for the numerical resolution of a nonconvex stochastic optimization problem on a Hilbert space . We show that, under suitable assumptions, strong or weak accumulation points of the iterates produced by the method converge almost surely to stationary points of the original optimization problem. Measurability and convergence rates of a stationarity measure are handled, filling a gap for applications to nonconvex infinite dimensional stochastic optimization problems. The method is demonstrated on an optimal control problem constrained by a class of elliptic semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs) under uncertainty.},

We consider a scenario where there are two control means available and they are applied in a state-dependent impulsive way, meaning that when the population of the harmful species is lower than a preset threshold, no control measure will be implemented; while when it reaches the threshold, the two control means will be used either in alternating order or random order. We formulate a general mathematical model for this scenario to evaluate the effect of such a control strategy by exploring the dynamics of this model. We define a one-dimensional map (Poincaré map) and by using the properties of this map, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence and global stability of an order-k periodic solution. By using the analogue of Poincaré criterion and bifurcation theory, we also establish sufficient conditions for a transcritical bifurcation near the predator-free periodic solution. Finally, we apply the results for the general model to two particular cases from two distinct fields: (I) integrated pest control and (II) tumour control with a comprehensive therapy. For (I), theoretical and numerical results show that the outbreak period of the pest is longer when two pesticides are applied randomly than when the alternating strategy is used. For (II), we find that the treatment frequency of drug rotation strategy is lower than that of no drug change strategy, and that the higher the control intensity, the lower the treatment frequency.},

Equilibria solve a system of PDEs where an Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is combined with a Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation for the mass distribution. Due to the interplay between the strength of the attractive term and the behavior of the diffusive part, we will obtain three different regimes for the existence and non existence of classical solutions to the MFG system. By means of a Pohozaev-type identity, we prove nonexistence of regular solutions to the MFG system without potential in the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev-supercritical regime. On the other hand, using a fixed point argument, we show existence of classical solutions in the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev-subcritical regime at least for masses smaller than a given threshold value. In the mass-subcritical regime we show that actually this threshold can be taken to be +∞.},

As an application of the Hölder theory, we use these solutions when forming an approximation sequence in the proof of existence of solutions of SQG in another class of non-decaying function spaces, the uniformly local Sobolev spaces H u l s ( R 2 ) Huls(R2) for s ≥ 3 s≥3 . Using methods similar to those for the surface quasi-geostrophic equation, we also obtain short-time existence for the three-dimensional Euler equations in uniformly local Sobolev spaces.},

By the method of Fourier transform , we first derive the decay estimates for the fundamental solutions with time-delay. Then, we obtain the threshold results with optimal convergence rates for the original solution to the constant equilibrium . Namely, when 0 &lt; p d &lt; 1 0&amp;lt;pd&amp;lt;1 , the solution u ( t , x ) u(t,x) globally converges to the equilibrium 0 in the time-exponential form; when p d = 1 pd=1 , the solution u ( t , x ) u(t,x) globally converges to 0 in the time-algebraical form; when 1 &lt; p d ≤ e 1&amp;lt;pd≤e , the solution u ( t , x ) u(t,x) globally converges to u + u+ in the time-exponential form; and when e &lt; p d &lt; e 2 e&amp;lt;pd&amp;lt;e2 , it locally converges to u + u+ in the time-exponential form. This indicates that when the death rate is bigger than the birth rate, the blowflies will disappear in future. While, when the birth rate is bigger than the death rate in a certain range, then the blowflies population will reach an equilibrium after long time. The lower-higher frequency analysis plays a crucial role in the proof.},

We also identify further spectral properties of the Friedrichs extension and (when the operator is positive) the von Neumann–Krein extension. Motivated by some recent scalar Aronszajn–Donoghue type results, we find that real numbers can only be eigenvalues for two extensions of Sturm–Liouville operator when the boundary conditions are restricted to corresponding to affine lines in the space from which the perturbation parameter is taken. Furthermore, we determine much of the spectral representation of those Sturm–Liouville operators that can be reached by perturbation theory.},

  abstract     = {We consider certain constant-coefficient differential operators on R d Rd that have positive-definite symbols. Each such operator Λ with symbol P defines a semigroup of operators e − t Λ e−tΛ , t &gt; 0 t&amp;gt;0 , admitting a continuous convolution kernel H P t HPt for which the large-time behavior of H P t ( 0 ) HPt(0) cannot be deduced by basic scaling arguments. The simplest example has symbol P ( ξ ) = ( η + ζ 2 ) 2 + η 4 P(ξ)=(η+ζ2)2+η4 , ξ = ( η , ζ ) ∈ R 2 ξ=(η,ζ)∈R2 . We devise a method that allows us to determine the large-time behavior of H P t ( 0 ) HPt(0) for several classes of examples of this type and we show that these large-time asymptotics are preserved by perturbations of Λ by certain higher-order differential operators. For the P just given, it turns out that H P t ( 0 ) ∼ c P t − 5 / 8 HPt(0)∼cPt−5/8 when t tends to infinity. We show how such results are relevant to understand the iterated convolution powers of certain finitely-supported complex functions on Z d Zd . We also discuss how these techniques provide precise small-time asymptotics for H P t ( 0 ) HPt(0) in some cases when the operator Λ is not hypoelliptic. The simplest such example Λ has symbol P ( ξ ) = η 2 + ( η − ξ 2 ) 4 P(ξ)=η2+(η−ξ2)4 and we show that H P t ( 0 ) ∼ c P t − 1 / 2 HPt(0)∼cPt−1/2 as t tends to 0 in this case. Our work represents a first basic step towards a good understanding of the semigroups associated with these differential operators. Obtaining meaningful off-diagonal upper bounds for the convolution kernels of these semigroups remains an interesting challenge.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of the reaction-diffusion-advection population models with linear boundary condition has been widely studied. This paper is devoted to the dynamics of a reaction-diffusion-advection population model with nonlinear boundary condition. Firstly, the stability of the trivial steady state is investigated by studying the corresponding eigenvalue problem . Secondly, the existence and stability of nontrivial steady states are proved by applying the Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation Theorem, the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method and perturbation method , in which bifurcation from simple eigenvalue and that from degenerate simple eigenvalue are both possible. The general results are applied to a parabolic equation with monostable nonlinear boundary condition, and to a parabolic equation with sublinear growth and superlinear boundary condition. Our theoretical results show that the nonlinear boundary condition can lead to the occurrence of various steady state bifurcations. Meanwhile, compared with the linear boundary condition, the nonlinear boundary condition can induce the multiplicity and growing-up property of positive steady-state solutions for the model with logistic interior growth. Finally, the numerical results show that the advection can change the bifurcation direction of some bifurcation, and affect the density distribution of the species.},

We show that for appropriate Tikhonov regularization parameters the value of the objective function in a generated trajectory converges fast to the global minimum of the objective function and a trajectory generated by the dynamical system converges weakly to a minimizer of the objective function. We also obtain the fast convergence of the velocities towards zero and some integral estimates. Nevertheless, our main goal is to extend and improve some recent results obtained in [6] and [12] concerning the strong convergence of the generated trajectories to an element of minimal norm from the argmin set of the objective function g .

This problem consists in the study of the dynamics of an infinitesimal mass particle attracted by N primaries of identical masses describing elliptic relative equilibria of the N -body problem on M κ 2 Mκ2 , i.e., a solution where the primaries are rotating uniformly with constant angular velocity ω on a fixed parallel of S 2 S2 or H 2 H2 and placed at the vertices of a regular polygon . In a rotating frame, this problem yields a two degrees of freedom Hamiltonian system. The goal of this paper is to describe analytically some dynamics features for κ = ± 1 κ=±1 . Precisely, we study the relative location of equilibria, obtaining, in particular, that the poles of S 2 S2 and vertex of H 2 H2 represent equilibrium points for any value of the parameters. Thus, analysis of the nonlinear stability of these equilibria is carried out, as well as two types of bifurcations are detected: Hamiltonian-Hopf and N -bifurcation. Additionally, we prove the existence of a family of Hill&#39;s orbits and a family of periodic orbits when the primaries are located near the poles of S 2 S2 or the vertex of H 2 H2 . Finally we prove the existence of KAM 2-tori related to these periodic orbits.},

By using the Littlewood-Paley theory, we establish the well-posedness for the martingale problem associated with L t Lt under the sharp balance condition α + β ⩾ 1 α+β⩾1 , where β is the Hölder index of b with respect to x . Moreover, we also study a class of stochastic differential equations driven by Markov processes with generators of the form L t Lt . We prove the pathwise uniqueness of strong solutions for such equations when the coefficients are in certain Besov spaces .},

By means of a weaker conserved L 2 L2 -norm, we show some wave-breaking criteria for the equation, which improve some blow-up results on the classical Fornberg-Whitham equation. Moreover, our conclusions suggest that the wave breaking for the equation may occur even with small slope of the initial value . To analyze the interaction between nonlinear and nonlocal dispersion terms, we provide two different approaches. The first one is based on a subtle analysis on evolution of the solution u and its gradient u x ux .

The main novelty is that the noise is assumed to be highly degenerate in the Fourier space. The proof is carried out by using a criterion for the LDP developed in [17] in a discrete-time setting and extended in [26] to the continuous-time. One of the main conditions of that criterion is the uniform Feller property for the Feynman–Kac semigroup, which we verify by using Malliavin calculus.},

The latter results provide a systematic way of producing examples of singular velocity fields, which cannot be treated by the regularity theory of DiPerna-Lions [28] , Ambrosio [2] or Crippa-De Lellis [23] . Our approach is based on a priori estimates at the level of flows generated by a sequence of mollified vector fields, converging to the original vector field, and which are uniform with respect to the mollification parameter. In addition, we use a compactness criterion based on Malliavin calculus from [24] as well as a supremum estimate in time of moments of the derivative of the flow of SDE solutions.},

The main outcome of the paper is that, under the assumption that the vorticity vectors in the two layers are constant, non-vanishing and parallel to each other, we prove that bounded solutions to the three-dimensional equations are essentially two-dimensional. More precisely, the free surface, the interface, the pressure and the velocity field present no variations in the direction orthogonal to the direction of motion. In addition, one of the horizontal components of the velocity field is constant throughout the flow and the vorticity also points in the direction orthogonal to the wave propagation direction. The rigid lid case is analyzed from the perspective of relaxed assumptions concerning the vorticity vectors. We also consider the viscous water wave problem case with normal and tangential stress conditions at the free surface and find that under similar conditions on the vorticity vectors, the conclusion about the two-dimensionality remains in place. Along the way, we also provide an explicit solution for the time-dependent three-dimensional inviscid water wave problem with an interface.},

Even on the plane, non-smooth vector fields can be chaotic, a feature impossible for the smooth or continuous case . We propose a new approach to better understand chaos for non-smooth vector fields by using the notion of entropy of a system. We construct a metric space of all possible trajectories of a non-smooth vector field, where we define a flow inherited by the vector field and then define the topological entropy in this scenario. As a consequence, we are able to obtain some general results and give some examples of planar non-smooth vector fields with positive (finite and infinite) entropy.},

  abstract     = {In this article we study Chen&#39;s flow of curves from theoretical and numerical perspectives. We investigate two settings: that of closed immersed ω -circles, and immersed lines satisfying a cocompactness condition. In each of the settings our goal is to find geometric conditions that allow us to understand the global behaviour of the flow: for the cocompact case, the condition is straightforward and the argument is largely standard. For the closed case however, the argument is quite complex. The flow shrinks every initial curve to a point if it does not become singular beforehand, and we must identify a condition to ensure this behaviour as well as identify the point in order to perform the requisite rescaling. We are able to successfully conduct a full analysis of the rescaling under a curvature condition. The analysis resembles the case of the mean curvature flow more than other fourth-order curvature flow such as the elastic flow or the curve diffusion flow, despite the lack of maximum and comparison principles. Our work is informed by a numerical study of the flow, and we include a section that explains the algorithms used.},

Symmetry groups of regular polygons describe their solution patterns.

  abstract     = {We study a pursuit-evasion diffusive predator-prey model which combines prey-taxis in predators with evasive defense strategy of prey being capable to move in the opposite direction to the gradient of a chemical signal secreted by the predators (indirect predator taxis). The kinetic part of the model extends the Rosenzweig MacArthur predator-prey model by assuming an intraspecific competition among predators, as in the classical Bazykin model. The prey-taxis takes into account density-dependent velocity suppression of predators while chasing the prey. The assumptions enable us to prove the existence of global-in-time classical solutions for space dimension n ≤ 3 n≤3 which are not expected to exist for the Rosenzweig MacArthur model according to numerical simulations which depict a finite time blow-up of solutions for n = 2 n=2 .},

  abstract     = {The existence, uniqueness, and number of limit cycles in Liénard dynamics have been intensely studied since the 1940s because they relate to Hilbert&#39;s 16th problem. Limit cycles sharply distinguish the nature of adjacent orbits. Moreover, they are essential for understanding dynamical systems . In contrast, the importance of unbounded separatrices is less well recognized even though they play an identical role. Therefore, this study focuses on the Liénard dynamical system and investigates whether all orbits, including unbounded separatrices, exist globally in time. The blow-up times of solutions that cannot be extended up to negative or positive infinity are also discussed. The result allows classification of all solutions by the time for which they exist. For example, for the van der Pol oscillator known to have the sole limit cycle, all solutions that pass through any point in the region bounded by that limit cycle and the two solutions that correspond to the unbounded separatrices continue to exist for all time, whereas the other solutions have positive or negative blow-up times. This fact cannot be judged solely from the shapes of the orbits obtained by simulation. Phase plane analysis is applied to prove the main theorem. Furthermore, several examples and their plane figures are provided to facilitate the understanding of the proof.},

  abstract     = {Untill 1980 one of the main subjects of study in the theory of nonlinear water waves were the Stokes and solitary waves (regular waves). To that time small amplitude regular waves were constructed and the existence of large amplitude water waves of the same type was proved by using branches of water waves starting from a trivial (horizontal) wave and ending at extreme waves. Then in papers Chen &amp; Saffman [7] and Saffman [32] numerical evidence was presented for existence of other type of waves as a result of bifurcations from a branch of ir-rotational Stokes waves on flow of infinite depth. It was demonstrated that the Stokes branch has infinitely many bifurcation points when it approaches the extreme wave and periodic waves with several crests of different height on the period bifurcate from the main branch. The only theoretical works dealing with this phenomenon are Buffoni, Dancer &amp; Toland [4] , [5] where it was proved the existence of sub-harmonic bifurcations bifurcating from the Stokes branch for the ir-rotational flow of infinite depth approaching the extreme wave. The aim of this paper is to develop new tools and give rigorous proof of existence of subharmonic bifurcations in the case of rotational flows of finite depth. The whole paper is devoted to the proof of this result formulated in Theorem 5.4 .},

Here the control function is the inward normal speed along the boundary ∂ Ω ( t ) ∂Ω(t) . We prove the existence of optimal solutions, within a class of sets with finite perimeter.

For the constant and uniform coupling strength, the inertial Kuramoto model can exhibit the slow relaxation dynamics toward phase-locked state under suitable conditions on system parameters and initial data . To model the time-evolution of mutual coupling strengths, we employ two types of coupling functions, namely “ Hebbian coupling ” and “ anti-Hebbian coupling ”. With these modeling spirit, the resulting coupled dynamics for the phase and mutual coupling strength becomes the coupled second-order and first-order systems of ordinary differential equations . For the proposed coupled system, we provide several sufficient frameworks for phase and frequency synchronization in terms of system parameters and initial data for Hebbian and anti-Hebbian coupling functions.},

The model consists of strongly coupled parabolic equations for the population densities in a bounded domain with no-flux boundary conditions, and it describes the dynamics of the segregation of the population species. The diffusion matrix is neither symmetric nor positive semidefinite . A new logarithmic entropy allows for an improved condition on the coefficients of heavily nonsymmetric diffusion matrices, without imposing the detailed-balance condition that is often assumed in the literature. Furthermore, the large-time convergence of the solutions to the constant steady state is proved by using the relative entropy associated to the logarithmic entropy.},

Some of our results are rigorous and quite general. On the other hand, complete and concrete understanding requires the investigation of the WKB geometry of specific examples. For such detailed computations we use a particular example that has been investigated numerically more than 20 years ago by Bronski and Miller and rely heavily on their numerical computations . Mostly employing the exact WKB method, we provide the complete rigorous uniform semiclassical analysis of the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition for the location of the eigenvalues across unions of analytic arcs as well as the associated norming constants. For the reflection coefficient as well as the eigenvalues near 0 in the spectral plane, we employ instead an older theory that has been developed in great detail by Olver. Our analysis is motivated by the need to understand the semiclassical behavior of the focusing cubic NLS equation with initial data A exp ⁡ { i S / ϵ } Aexp⁡{iS/ϵ} , in view of the well-known fact discovered by Zakharov and Shabat that the spectral analysis of the Dirac operator enables the solution of the NLS equation via inverse scattering theory.},

This is a key step to study general Leray problem for flows in a general infinitely long nozzle. The crucial point is that the estimate is uniform with respect to both the flux of flows and friction coefficient which appeared in Navier boundary conditions. With the aid of special structure of Navier-Stokes system and the refined estimate for some quantities such as radial velocity, the uniqueness and existence of steady solutions of Navier-Stokes system can be obtained even when the external forces are large as long as the fluxes are large. The delicate partition of the two dimensional plane for parameters, friction coefficient and Fourier variable associated with the axial coordinate, plays a key role to achieve these estimates.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive analysis of Sobolev-type inequalities for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator in the Gauss space is offered. A unified approach is proposed, providing one with criteria for their validity in the class of rearrangement-invariant function norms. Optimal target and domain norms in the relevant inequalities are characterized via a reduction principle to one-dimensional inequalities for a Calderón type integral operator patterned on the Gaussian isoperimetric function. Consequently, the best possible norms in a variety of specific families of spaces, including Lebesgue, Lorentz, Lorentz-Zygmund, Orlicz and Marcinkiewicz spaces, are detected. The reduction principle hinges on a preliminary discussion of the existence and uniqueness of generalized solutions to equations, in the Gauss space, for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator, with a just integrable right-hand side. A decisive role is also played by a pointwise estimate, in rearrangement form, for these solutions.},

When all the coefficients of viscosity, heat conductivity and magnetic diffusivity are constants, first, we show that for general initial data and any time T &gt; 0 T&amp;gt;0 , the local strong solution in the sense of Sobolev norms will never blow-up provided that the density is bounded from above and the temperature belongs to space L ∞ ( 0 , T ; L 2 ) ∩ L 2 ( 0 , T ; L ∞ ) L∞(0,T;L2)∩L2(0,T;L∞) . Second, based on the above blow-up criterion and the delicate analysis of the nonlinear strong coupling equations, we establish the global existence of strong solutions when the initial mass of the fluid and the initial energy of the magnetic field (i.e., ‖ ρ 0 ‖ L 1 ‖ρ0‖L1 and ‖ H 0 ‖ L 2 ‖H0‖L2 ) are suitably small, where the refined Zlotnik inequality and the decoupling of the full compressible MHD equations play an essential role in proving the uniform upper bound of the density and the higher-order a priori uniform in time estimates, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the initial velocity and temperature can be large. Moreover, we obtain exponential decay under the H 1 H1 -norm of ( u , θ , H ) (u,θ,H) and L 2 L2 -norm of ( ρ u ˙ , ρ θ ˙ , H t ) (ρu˙,ρθ˙,Ht) , where the long-time behaviors of the higher-order derivative of velocity are given and it is different from the known results.},

Two results with p &gt; m + 2 p&amp;gt;m+2 and m ⩾ 0 m⩾0 are established. One of which is that any gradient blowup solution follows a global ODE type behavior, with domination of normal derivatives over the tangential derivatives. The other is about time-increasing solutions. Zhang and Hu (2010) [50] obtained the precise gradient blowup rate in one-dimensional case, but the higher dimensional case was left as an open problem.

Compatibility hypotheses with the modeling are made on the coefficients of the system to obtain meaningful solutions.

  abstract     = {The present paper is concerned with a space-time homogenization problem for nonlinear diffusion equations with periodically oscillating (in space and time) coefficients. Main results consist of a homogenization theorem (i.e., convergence of solutions as the period of oscillation goes to zero) as well as a characterization of homogenized equations . In particular, homogenized matrices are described in terms of solutions to cell-problems, which have different forms depending on the log-ratio of the spatial and temporal periods of the coefficients. At a critical ratio, the cell problem turns out to be a parabolic equation in microscopic variables (as in linear diffusion) and also involves the limit of solutions, which is a function of macroscopic variables. The latter feature stems from the nonlinearity of the equation, and moreover, some strong interplay between microscopic and macroscopic structures can explicitly be seen for the nonlinear diffusion. As for the other ratios, the cell problems are always elliptic (in micro-variable only) and do not involve any macroscopic variables, and hence, micro- and macrostructures are weakly interacting each other. Proofs of the main results are based on the two-scale convergence theory (for space-time homogenization). Furthermore, finer asymptotics of gradients, diffusion fluxes and time-derivatives with certain corrector terms are provided, and a qualitative analysis on homogenized matrices is also performed.},

  abstract     = {We prove the local well-posedness results, i.e. existence, uniqueness, and stability, of the solutions to a class of nonlocal fully nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), where there is an external time parameter t on top of the temporal and spatial variables ( s , y ) (s,y) and thus the problem could be considered as a flow of equations. The nonlocality comes from the dependence on the unknown function and its first- and second-order derivatives evaluated at not only the local point ( t , s , y ) (t,s,y) but also at the diagonal line of the time domain ( s , s , y ) (s,s,y) . Such equations arise from time-inconsistent problems in game theory or behavioral economics, where the observations and preferences are (reference-)time-dependent. We first study the linearized version of the nonlocal PDEs with an innovative construction of appropriate norms and Banach spaces and contraction mappings over which. With fixed-point arguments, we obtain the solvability of nonlocal linear PDEs and establish a Schauder-type prior estimate for the solutions. Then, by the linearization method , we establish the well-posedness under the fully nonlinear case . Moreover, we reveal that the solution of a nonlocal fully nonlinear parabolic PDE is an adapted solution to a flow of second-order forward-backward stochastic differential equations .},

  abstract     = {The mathematical analysis on the behavior of the entropy for viscous, compressible, and heat conducting magnetohydrodynamic flows near the vacuum region is a challenging problem as the governing equation for entropy is highly degenerate and singular in the vacuum region. In our previous work [38] , we investigate the global existence of strong solutions to the three-dimensional (3D) compressible heat-conducting magnetohydrodynamic equations with vacuum at infinity. However, it is unknown whether the entropy remains its boundedness or not? Thus, the main novelty of this paper is to give a positive response to this problem. In fact, we show that the uniform boundedness of the entropy and the L 2 L2 regularities of the velocity and temperature can be propagated provided that the initial density decays suitably slow at infinity. Modified De Giorgi type iteration techniques and useful singularly weighted estimates are developed to deduce the lower and upper bounds on the entropy.},

Firstly, we state the local well-posedness for the Cauchy problem of the system in the framework of Sobolev-Besov spaces. Then, we establish the precise blow-up mechanism for the strong solutions by means of the transport equation theory. As is well-known, the H 1 H1 -norm conservation law of the velocity component is crucial to study blow-up phenomena of the single Camassa-Holm type equation. However, it is no longer available for our nonlinear coupled system. To overcome this difficulty, we derive some suitable conservation laws by sufficiently exploiting the fine structure of the system. Based on which, we finally construct several new blow-up strong solutions with certain initial profiles in finite time .},

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the Pontryagin type maximum principle and the dynamic programming principle for control systems governed by stochastic evolution equations in infinite dimensional space , with the control variables entering into both the drift and the diffusion terms. To do so, we first prove the dynamic programming principle for those systems without employing the martingale solutions. Then we establish the desired relationships in both cases that value function associated is smooth or nonsmooth. For the nonsmooth case, in particular, by employing the relaxed transposition solution, we discover the connection between the superdifferentials and subdifferentials of value function and the first-order and second-order adjoint equations.},

  abstract     = {As a commutative version of the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model , Dirac-harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces were introduced fifteen years ago. They are critical points of an unbounded conformally invariant functional involving two fields, a map from a Riemann surface into a Riemannian manifold and a section of a Dirac bundle which is the usual spinor bundle twisted with the pull-back of the tangent bundle of the target by the map. As solutions to a coupled nonlinear elliptic system, the existence and regularity theory of Dirac-harmonic maps has already received much attention, while the general uniqueness theory has not been established yet. For uncoupled Dirac-harmonic maps, the map components are harmonic maps . Since the uniqueness theory of harmonic maps from a compact surface with boundary is known, it is sufficient to consider the uniqueness of the spinor components, which are solutions to the corresponding boundary value problems for a nonlinear Dirac equation . In particular, when the map components belong to W 1 , p W1,p with p &gt; 2 p&amp;gt;2 , the spinor components are uniquely determined by boundary values and map components. For coupled Dirac-harmonic maps, the map components are not harmonic maps. So the uniqueness problem is more difficult to solve. In this paper, we study the uniqueness problem on a compact surface with boundary. More precisely, we prove the energy convexity for weakly Dirac-harmonic maps from the unit disk with small energy. This yields the first uniqueness result about Dirac-harmonic maps from a surface conformal to the unit disk with small energy and arbitrary boundary values.},

In a smooth bounded domain Ω, the global boundedness of smooth solutions to this system depends on | Ω | |Ω| , which implies that the methods on bounded domain are not feasible for the Cauchy problem. Recently, the second author of this paper and Zheng [13] proved boundedness of classical Keller-Segel system with logistic term in R d Rd by a nice coupled structure. However, such a nice coupled structure disappears to this system. Using the coupled structure and damping effects, involving with special time weighted local-in-space energy-type functional and Littlewood-Paley decomposition, we prove the global-in-time existence and boundedness of classical solutions to this system in R d Rd for α &gt; d 2 α&amp;gt;d2 , which gives new approaches on dealing with some complex equations by the idea of localization.},

Wβ,γ(h)(x):=∫0∞[∫Bt(x)h(y)dytN−βγ]1γ−1dtt. Firstly, we prove the optimal integrability and boundedness of solutions ( u , v ) ∈ L p + γ − 1 ( R N ) × L q + γ − 1 ( R N ) (u,v)∈Lp+γ−1(RN)×Lq+γ−1(RN) for system (1.1) , by constructing a nonlinear, contracting operator and applying the regularity lifting lemma of C. Ma, W. Chen and C. Li (2011) [21] . Moreover, we exploit the general regularity lifting theorem to derive the Lipschitz continuity of u and v when R 1 ≡ R 2 ≡ 1 R1≡R2≡1 in R N RN . These extend the above important results of C. Ma, W. Chen and C. Li to γ &gt; 2 γ&amp;gt;2 . We also prove that u and v vanish at infinity . As the corollaries of the above results, we obtain the optimal integrability, boundedness and the property of vanishing at infinity of integrable solutions for the corresponding γ -Laplace and k -Hessian systems. Secondly, we use the method of moving planes in integral forms to prove the symmetry and monotonicity of solutions ( u , v ) ∈ L p + γ − 1 ( R N ) × L q + γ − 1 ( R N ) (u,v)∈Lp+γ−1(RN)×Lq+γ−1(RN) for system (1.1) when R 1 ≡ R 2 ≡ 1 R1≡R2≡1 in R N RN , which extends the useful result of W. Chen and C. Li (2011) [5] to γ &gt; 2 γ&amp;gt;2 . In comparison with the above two papers, Minkowski&#39;s inequality is crucial in our proofs.

We show that the transition amplitudes between final (respectively initial) states converge towards explicit quantities involving the outgoing (respectively incoming) wave operators of the nonlinear Schrödinger–Klein–Gordon (S-KG) equation. Thus, we rigorously link the scattering theory of the Yukawa model to that of the Schrödinger–Klein–Gordon equation. Moreover, we prove that the asymptotic vacuum states of the Yukawa model have a phase space concentration property around classical radiationless solutions. Under further assumptions, we show that the S-KG energy admits a unique minimizer modulo symmetries and we identify exactly the semiclassical measure of Yukawa ground states . Some additional consequences of asymptotic completeness are also discussed, and some further open questions are raised.},

By considering a minimization problem related to the virial identity, we prove the existence of the ground state . In our approach we use the linear profile decomposition to recover compactness, which is distinguished with the mostly used mountain pass theorem. By doing a variational estimate below the ground state, we give the dichotomy of global boundedness and blow-up for solutions with energy below the ground state. As a consequence of the dichotomy, we show the strong instability of the standing wave. In the last part, the non-existence of scattering state will be proved based on the latest result of Murphy-Nakanishi.},

We first explore the model without delays and diffusions, and find that it can undergo a saddle-node bifurcation when the intensity of Allee effect is at the tipping point. Then for the scenario of stability of the coexistence steady state without delays, we obtain the crossing curves on the delays plane. The model can undergo Hopf bifurcation when delays pass through these crossing curves from a stable region to an unstable one. We further calculate the normal form of Hopf bifurcation and hence obtain the direction of Hopf bifurcation and the stability of the bifurcation periodic solutions. It is shown that the model can possess multiple stability switches and a stable spatially heterogeneous periodic solution with mode-4 as delays vary.},

  abstract     = {We consider a one-parameter family of beam equations with Hamiltonian non-linearity in one space dimension under periodic boundary conditions. In a unified functional framework we study the long time evolution of initial data in two categories of differentiability : (i) a subspace of Sobolev regularity, (ii) a subspace of infinitely many differentiable functions which is strictly contained in the Sobolev space but which strictly contains the Gevrey one. In both cases we prove exponential type times of stability. The result holds for almost all mass parameters and it is obtained by combining normal form techniques with a suitable Diophantine condition weaker than the one proposed by Bourgain. This is the first result of this kind in Sobolev regularity for a degenerate equation, where only one parameter is used to tune the linear frequencies of oscillations.},

  abstract     = {We establish sharp-in-time kernel and dispersive estimates for the Schrödinger equation on non-compact Riemannian symmetric spaces of any rank. Due to the particular geometry at infinity and the Kunze-Stein phenomenon, these properties are more pronounced in large time and enable us to prove the global-in-time Strichartz inequality for a larger family of admissible couples than in the Euclidean case . Consequently, we obtain the global well-posedness for the corresponding semilinear equation with lower regularity data and some scattering properties for small powers which are known to fail in the Euclidean setting. The crucial kernel estimates are achieved by combining the stationary phase method based on a subtle barycentric decomposition, a subordination formula of the Schrödinger group to the wave propagator and an improved Hadamard parametrix.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to a bistable system for calcium buffering. We first prove two kinds of stability of diverging traveling fronts of the degenerate system (All buffers do not diffuse): the local C 0 C0 -norm stability and the asymptotic stability . In particular, as for asymptotic stability, we prove a Liouville-type result by the sliding method, and then use the truncation technique to study the long-time behavior of diverging wave like solution. These stabilities imply that, under suitable conditions on the initial data , the solution locally uniformly approaches to the high equilibrium state ( 1 , b 2 ) (1,b2) . Then, by examining the behavior of solutions with one-parameter family of initial data, we show that the parameter-dependent solutions can be divided into three categories: convergence to the basal equilibrium state ( 0 , b 0 ) (0,b0) for small parameter values, convergence to the high equilibrium state ( 1 , b 2 ) (1,b2) for large parameter values, whereas neither of these behaviors occurs for intermediate parameter values. We refer to such phenomenon as threshold phenomenon. These intermediate parameter values are called threshold values, and the corresponding solutions are called threshold solutions. At the end of the paper, we present some important properties of the threshold solution and provide some numerical simulations.},

We argue that the nonlinearity and self-regulatory inhibition appear in the synergistic effect of tick cooperation and the crowding within groups, and an appropriate nonlinearity can be the sub-linear Gamma-Ricker function. We also noticed that the diapaused development leads to multiple time lags in a structured tick population dynamics model, leading to a scalar delay differential equation with two time lags appearing in the sub-linear Gamma-Ricker nonlinearity. This model has always one and only one positive equilibrium. Here we develop sharp conditions for this model to exhibit persistence and global convergence behaviors .},

  abstract     = {In this paper we introduce the notion of fractal codimension of a nilpotent contact point p , for λ = λ 0 λ=λ0 , in smooth planar slow–fast systems X ϵ , λ Xϵ,λ when the contact order n λ 0 ( p ) nλ0(p) of p is even, the singularity order s λ 0 ( p ) sλ0(p) of p is odd and p has finite slow divergence, i.e., s λ 0 ( p ) ≤ 2 ( n λ 0 ( p ) − 1 ) sλ0(p)≤2(nλ0(p)−1) . The fractal codimension of p is a generalization of the “traditional” codimension of a slow-fast Hopf point of Liénard type, introduced in (Dumortier and Roussarie (2009) [7] ), and it is intrinsically defined, i.e., it can be directly computed without the need to first bring the system into its normal form. The intrinsic nature of the notion of fractal codimension stems from the Minkowski dimension of fractal sequences of points, defined near p using the so-called entry-exit relation, and slow divergence integral. We apply our method to a slow-fast Hopf point and read its degeneracy (i.e., the first nonzero Lyapunov quantity) as well as the number of limit cycles near such a Hopf point directly from its fractal codimension. We demonstrate our results numerically on some interesting examples by using a simple formula for computation of the fractal codimension.},

At first, under suitable conditions on K 1 , K 2 K1,K2 and the certain range of the exponents p , q p,q , we construct an unbounded sequence of non-radial positive vector solutions, whose energy can be made arbitrarily large. Moreover, we prove a type of non-degeneracy result by use of various Pohozaev identities, which is of great interest independently. The indefinite linear operator and strongly coupled nonlinearities make the Hamiltonian-type systems in stark contrast both to the systems of Gradient type and to the single critical elliptic equations in the study of the prescribed curvature problems. It is worth noting that, in higher-dimensional cases ( N ≥ 5 ) (N≥5) , there have been no results on the existence of infinitely many bubbling solutions to critical elliptic systems, either of Hamiltonian or Gradient type.}}},

First, we prove global existence of classical solutions to our problem with generic positive motility function under a certain smallness assumption at infinity, which however permits the motility function to be arbitrarily large within a finite region. Then uniform-in-time boundedness of classical solutions is established whenever the motility function has strictly positive lower and upper bounds in any dimension N ≥ 1 N≥1 , or decays at a certain slow rate at infinity for N ≥ 2 N≥2 . Our results remove the crucial non-increasing requirement on the motility function in some recent work [10] , [13] , [16] and hence allow for both chemo-attractive and chemo-repulsive effect, or their co-existence in applications. The key ingredient of our proof lies in an important improvement of the comparison method developed in [10] , [16] , [18] .},

Despite the difficulty caused by delay and bistable nonlinearity, we give a rather complete description on the dynamics including global stability, semi-stability, bistability and Hopf bifurcation . For the case where the stable trivial equilibrium coexists with a stable positive equilibrium, we obtain two delay-dependent intervals as subsets of basins of attraction of two stable equilibria . These subsets are sharp in some sense. Using delay as the bifurcation parameter, we analytically show that the number of local Hopf bifurcation values is finite and these local Hopf bifurcation values are neatly paired. A Nicholson&#39;s blowflies equation with Allee effect is used to illustrate our general results. Through this example, we show that delay can induce stability switches, symmetric transitions among multitype bistability and robust phase-transitions for long transients.},

  abstract     = {Building on the work of Crouseilles and Faou on the 2D case, we construct C ∞ C∞ quasi-periodic solutions to the incompressible Euler equations with periodic boundary conditions in dimension 3 and in any even dimension. These solutions are genuinely high-dimensional, which is particularly interesting because there are extremely few examples of high-dimensional initial data for which global solutions are known to exist. These quasi-periodic solutions can be engineered so that they are dense on tori of arbitrary dimension embedded in the space of solenoidal vector fields. Furthermore, in the two-dimensional case we show that quasi-periodic solutions are dense in the phase space of the Euler equations. More precisely, for any integer N ⩾ 1 N⩾1 we prove that any L q Lq initial stream function can be approximated in L q Lq (strongly when 1 ⩽ q &lt; ∞ 1⩽q&amp;lt;∞ and weak-⁎ when q = ∞ q=∞ ) by smooth initial data whose solutions are dense on N -dimensional tori.},

We proved global bounded solutions to the system in high dimensions ( n ≤ 5 n≤5 ) without the convexity of the domain. Moreover, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functionals, it is proved that the solution convergences to the semi-trivial steady state in L ∞ ( Ω ) L∞(Ω) under strong competition ( a 1 , a 2 ≥ 1 a1,a2≥1 , where a 1 , a 2 a1,a2 represent the intensity of competition between different species) if the growth coefficients of two species are appropriately large. Compared to previous work, our result removes the requirement for the convexity of the domain and proves global bounded solutions in high dimensions ( n ≤ 5 n≤5 ). Moreover, we studied the asymptotic behavior of solutions in the case of strong competition which is obscure in the existing literature. Furthermore, the linear stability analysis is performed to find the possible patterning regimes, outside the stability parameters regime, for both semi-trivial and coexistence steady states, our numerical simulations show that non-constant steady states and spatially inhomogeneous temporal periodic patterns are all possible.},

The problem is challenging due to the existence of single spreading speed or multiple spreading speeds (fastest and slowest spreading speeds). We first study under what condition single spreading speed exists and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for linear and nonlinear selections of the spreading speed as well as the minimal wave speed of traveling wavefronts . In the case of multiple spreading speeds, the determinacy of each speed is further investigated based on the connection of wavefronts to the boundary equilibria. We apply our results to five time-periodic models: a delayed diffusive equation, a stream population model with a benthic zone, a nonlocal dispersal Lotka-Volterra model, and two cooperative systems.},

Random Liouville type equation is also derived for invariant measures associated with non-autonomous random differential equations. Based on such abstract results, we prove the existence of (periodic) invariant measures for non-autonomous stochastic reaction-diffusion equation on unbounded domains, which are supported on the pullback attractors. And we further show every limit of a sequence of (periodic) invariant measures must be the (periodic) invariant measure of the corresponding limiting equation when the noise intensity varies in finite interval.

When the initial deformation tensor is a perturbation of the identity matrix and the initial density is near a positive constant, we establish the uniform estimates of solutions to the compressible viscoelastic flows in the conormal Sobolev spaces . It is well-known that for the corresponding inviscid limit of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with the no-slip boundary condition, one does not expect the uniform energy estimates of solutions due to the appearance of strong boundary layers. However, when the deformation tensor effect is taken into account, our results show that the deformation tensor plays an important role in the vanishing viscosity process and can surprisingly prevent the formation of strong boundary layers. As a result we are able to justify the inviscid limit of solutions for the compressible viscous flows under the no-slip boundary condition governed by the viscoelastic equations, based on the uniform conormal regularity estimates achieved in this paper.},

[20] . Supposing the number of vertices in the tree T T grows exponentially, the explicit formula for the topological entropy of the q -MST is presented in Theorem 1.1 . Next, we consider the coupled q -MST, namely, every boundary of T T satisfies the q -multiple constraint and is characterized by subshift of finite type. The comparison of topological entropy for the coupled and non-coupled q -MSTs is provided in Theorem 1.4 . Furthermore, the explicit formula of some coupled q -MSTs are also obtained herein. Finally, the entropy formula for the general q -MSTs, known as X Ω ( S ) XΩ(S) , is described in Theorem 1.6 .},

If R 0 &lt; 1 R0&amp;lt;1 , the disease-free equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable ; if R 0 &gt; 1 R0&amp;gt;1 , the endemic equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable.

First, we present some dynamical properties for linear almost periodic reaction-diffusion systems. By using evolution semigroup approach, we show that R 0 − 1 R0−1 has the same sign as the exponential growth bound of an associated linear system. Then, we also apply the developed theory to an almost periodic reaction-diffusion model of vector-borne disease to obtain a threshold type for the uniform persistence and global extinction of the disease. Finally, we illustrate the above results by numerical simulations and show the relationship between the diffusion rate and R 0 R0 .

We study its controllability around the ground state when the linearized system is not controllable and wonder whether the quadratic term can help to recover the directions lost at the first order. More precisely, in this paper, we formulate assumptions under which the quadratic term induces a drift which prevents the small-time local controllability (STLC) of the system in appropriate spaces. For finite-dimensional systems, quadratic terms induce coercive drifts in the dynamic, quantified by integer negative Sobolev norms, along explicit Lie brackets which prevent STLC. In the context of the bilinear Schrödinger equation, the first drift, quantified by the H − 1 H−1 -norm of the control, was already observed in [8] and used to deny STLC with controls small in L ∞ L∞ . In this article, we improve this result by denying STLC with controls small in W − 1 , ∞ W−1,∞ . Furthermore, for any positive integer n , we formulate assumptions under which one may observe a quadratic drift quantified by the H − n H−n -norm of the control and we use it to deny STLC in suitable spaces.},

After that, we prove criteria for uniform trichotomy of discrete variational systems. Next, for p , q ∈ [ 1 , ∞ ] p,q∈[1,∞] we introduce the notion of uniform admissibility of a ( ℓ p , ℓ q ) (ℓp,ℓq) pair and we obtain complete characterizations for uniform exponential trichotomy. Throughout our study, via illustrative examples, we show that the working hypotheses are minimal and cannot be removed.

We first give the representations of two Green&#39;s matrices in the Fourier space: one is a 7 × 7 7×7 matrix for the compressible part and the other is a 6 × 6 6×6 matrix for the incompressible part. Then by using high-medium-low frequency analysis together with real analysis and Fourier analysis we get the pointwise estimates for each entry in these Green&#39;s matrices. Finally, we deal with the nonlinear problem and obtain the pointwise space-time description of the solution. It shows that the fluid density ρ , momentum m and the symmetric tensor of constrains T T obey the generalized Huygens&#39; principle as the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. As a byproduct, we extend L 2 L2 -estimate in [47] to L p Lp -estimate with p &gt; 1 p&amp;gt;1 . Moreover, the decay of T T is faster than those of ( ρ , m ) (ρ,m) , which also refine the result in [47] .},

Firstly, we show the existence of Turing, Hopf, Turing-Turing, and Turing-Hopf bifurcations, and obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for Turing instability. Secondly, we extend the formulae for coefficients in the normal form of Turing-Hopf bifurcation in Jiang et al. (2020) [1] , and provide new formulae applicable to the general reaction-diffusion system with memory-based self-diffusion and cross-diffusion. These formulae are also applicable to the case that the memory delay is absent. From the bifurcation analysis, we finally find that the model can exhibit various complex spatiotemporal patterns, including a pair of stable spatially inhomogeneous periodic solutions with two spatial frequencies and heteroclinic orbits connecting non-constant steady states to a spatially inhomogeneous periodic solution. These results show that large memory-based diffusion coefficient can eliminate spatial patterns driven by Fickian diffusion, and memory delay mainly affects spatiotemporal patterns arising from Hopf and Turing-Hopf bifurcations.},

Several properties of solutions are analyzed. Emphasis is placed on to what extent the surface in our setting qualitatively evolves similar as for the usual mean curvature flow. To this end, we show that the surface area is strictly decreasing but gives an example of a surface that exists for infinite times nevertheless. Moreover, mean convexity is conserved whereas convexity is not. Finally, we construct an embedded hypersurface that develops a self-intersection in the course of time. Additionally, a formal explanation of how our equations can be interpreted as a gradient flow is included.},

For the quasimonotone nondecreasing case, by using the extended maximum principle and the method of upper and lower solutions, we obtain certain monotonicity of maximal and minimal solutions and the global attractivity of steady states. For the mixed quasimonotone case, by using the technique of introducing appropriate relaxation variables, we obtained some sufficient conditions which ensure the convergence of time-dependent solutions to a steady-state solution. For the non-quasimonotone case, by introducing some appropriate relaxation variables and employing the results for mixed quasimonotone case, we obtain some sufficient conditions which ensure the convergence of time-dependent solutions to a steady-state solution.

The equations describing the motion of such fluids are characterized by a non-linear constitutive law relating the state of stress to the rate of deformation. We show the local-in-time existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to two important models: the Power Law model and the Bingham model. While our result for the first model holds over a periodic domain Ω = R 3 Ω=R3 , the result obtained on the second model is limited to the one-dimensional case. This is because Bingham&#39;s constitutive law is discontinuous due to phase transition that may appear during the time when flows change nature, particularly from liquid motion to rigid motion and vice-versa. This property reduces the probability of showing smooth solutions to such a system in higher dimension space.},

They are symmetric waves whose profiles are monotone between each crest and trough. Moreover, we show a connection between the concavity and convexity of wave profile and the monotonicity of the vertical velocity component v along the free surface. As an important application, we make up the missing major aspect on the behavior of v as mentioned in [4, Sect 4.4] for small amplitude waves .

The coupling between these two different components occurs at the interface with certain transmission conditions . For the system on rectangular domain, by frequency domain analysis, the explicit polynomial decay rate of the solutions to the system is obtained, which only depends on the degree of degeneration of the diffusion coefficient of the heat equation near the interface line. Specifically, a clear relationship between the decay rate and the degeneration parameter of the diffusion coefficient is identified. Moreover, the explicit decay rate of the solutions to such a system on one-dimensional domain is also further estimated. Especially, these two obtained decay rates are consistent with the optimal ones for the systems on rectangular domain and one-dimensional domain with constant-diffusion coefficient, obtained by Batty et al. [7] and Zhang and Zuazua [23] , respectively. From this view, the obtained decay rates can all be considered as sharp ones for such kind of degenerate systems.},

Using the weighted norm, we define the weighted Hölder space C s k , 2 + α Csk,2+α and establish Schauder theory for C s k , 2 + α Csk,2+α regularity.},

It is based on a generalization of the concept of symmetry of a distribution of vector fields, inspired in the extension of Lie point symmetries to C ∞ C∞ -symmetries for ODEs developed in the recent years. The new structures, named C ∞ C∞ -structures, play a fundamental role in the integrability of the distribution: the knowledge of a C ∞ C∞ -structure for a corank k involutive distribution allows to find its integral manifolds by solving k successive completely integrable Pfaffian equations . These results have important consequences for the integrability of differential equations. In particular, we derive a new procedure to integrate an m th-order ordinary differential equation by splitting the problem into m completely integrable Pfaffian equations. This step-by-step integration procedure is applied to fully integrate several equations that cannot be solved by standard procedures.},

This shows that the distribution of the process is uniquely determined by its moments. We also obtain an explicit formula for the moment generating function . In the second part of the paper, we prove that the distribution of this process coincides with the distribution of a process of the form T ( | W ( t ) | ) T(|W(t)|) where T ( t ) T(t) is the classical telegraph process, and | W ( t ) | |W(t)| is a random time whose distribution is related to a nonlocal in-time version of the wave equation. To this end, we construct the probability density function via subordination from the distribution of the classic telegraph process.

The model is characterized by a discontinuous reaction term which can be seen as an instance of spatially distributed non-ideal relay hysteresis. In general, uniqueness of solutions for such models is conditional on certain transversality conditions . For the model studied here, we give an explicit description of the precipitation boundary which gives rise to two scenarios for non-uniqueness, which we term “spontaneous precipitation” and “entanglement”. Spontaneous precipitation can be easily dismissed by an additional, physically reasonable criterion in the concept of weak solution. The second scenario is one where the precipitation boundaries of two distinct solutions cannot be ordered in any neighborhood of some point on their common precipitation boundary. We show that for a finite, possibly short interval of time, solutions are unique. Beyond this point, unique continuation is subject to a spatial or temporal transversality condition. The temporal transversality condition takes the same form that would be expected for a simple multicomponent semilinear ODE with discontinuous reaction terms.},

  abstract     = {Spatial memory is significant in modeling animal movement. For a diffusive consumer-resource model, a memory-based diffusion of consumer can result in richer and more realistic dynamics. In fact, memory-based diffusion is related to the resource distributions in past times because the memory decays over time. We originally propose a consumer-resource model with distributed memory, and then investigate the influence of the weak memory kernel on the stability of the positive constant steady state. When the memory-based diffusion coefficient is negative, the mean delay does not affect the stability of the positive constant steady state; however, when the memory-based diffusion coefficient is positive, the mean delay can lead to the spatially inhomogeneous periodic oscillation patterns. The direction and stability of Turing bifurcation induced by the memory-based diffusion coefficient are calculated by using the methods of Crandall and Rabinowitz, and the direction and stability of Hopf bifurcation induced by the mean delay are determined by the normal form theory.},

The corner singularity is the key difficulty in establishing the local well-posedness of the problem. Moreover, the boundary conditions on both edges of the corner angle are of Neumann-type and fail to satisfy the linear stability condition, which makes it more difficult to establish a priori estimates on the boundary terms in the analysis. In this paper, extension methods will be updated to deal with the corner singularity, and, based on a key observation that the boundary operators are co-normal, new techniques will be developed to control the boundary terms.},

The aim is to work with minimal or no regularity conditions on the boundary of the domains, where the usual arguments based on maximum principles do not apply. A key result is an application of Kato&#39;s inequality to prove a comparison theorem for eigenfunctions that only requires interior regularity and avoids the use of the Hopf boundary maximum principle. We demonstrate the theory on an abstract degenerate logistic equation by proving the existence, uniqueness and stability of non-trivial positive solutions . Examples of operators include the Dirichlet Laplacian on arbitrary bounded domains , a simplified construction of the Robin Laplacian on arbitrary domains with boundary of finite measure and general elliptic operators in divergence form .},

Perturbations of this kind oscillate in the far field and are not integrable. The key is to construct a suitable ansatz carrying the same oscillation as that of the initial data , but due to the degeneration of contact discontinuity, the construction is more subtle. A novel method for constructing robust ansatzes is presented. It allows the same weight function to be used on different variables and wave patterns while maintaining control over the errors. As a result, it is possible to apply this construction to contact discontinuities and composite waves. Lastly, we demonstrate that the Cauchy problem admits a unique global-in-time solution and the composite wave remains stable under space-periodic perturbations through the energy method.},

  abstract     = {A central challenge in physics is to describe non-equilibrium systems driven by randomness, such as a randomly growing interface, or fluids subject to random fluctuations that account e.g. for local stresses and heat fluxes in the fluid which are not related to the velocity and temperature gradients. For deterministic systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, normal form and center manifold theory have shown a prodigious efficiency to often completely characterize how the onset of linear instability translates into the emergence of nonlinear patterns, associated with genuine physical regimes. However, in presence of random fluctuations, the underlying reduction principle to the center manifold is seriously challenged due to large excursions caused by the noise, and the approach needs to be revisited. In this study, we present an alternative framework to cope with these difficulties exploiting the approximation theory of stochastic invariant manifolds , on one hand, and energy estimates measuring the defect of parameterization of the high-modes, on the other. To operate for fluid problems subject to stochastic stirring forces, these error estimates are derived under assumptions regarding dissipation effects brought by the high-modes in order to suitably counterbalance the loss of regularity due to the nonlinear terms . As a result, the approach enables us to predict, from reduced equations of the stochastic fluid problem, the occurrence in large probability of a stochastic analogue to the pitchfork bifurcation, as long as the noise&#39;s intensity and the eigenvalue&#39;s magnitude of the mildly unstable mode scale accordingly. In the case of SPDEs forced by a multiplicative noise in the orthogonal subspace of e.g. its mildly unstable mode, our parameterization formulas show that the noise gets transmitted to this mode via non-Markovian coefficients, and that the reduced equation is only stochastically driven by the latter. These coefficients depend explicitly on the noise path&#39;s history, and their memory content is self-consistently determined by the intensity of the random force and its interaction through the SPDE&#39;s nonlinear terms. Applications to a stochastic Rayleigh-Bénard problem are detailed, for which conditions for a stochastic pitchfork bifurcation (in large probability) to occur, are clarified.},

  abstract     = {For decades, the network-organized reaction-diffusion models have been widely used to study ecological and epidemiological phenomena in discrete space. However, the high dimensionality of these nonlinear systems places a long-standing restriction to develop the normal forms of various bifurcations. In this paper, we take an important step to present a rigorous procedure for calculating the normal form associated with the Hopf bifurcation of the general network-organized reaction-diffusion systems, which is similar to but can be much more intricate than the corresponding procedure for the extensively explored PDE systems. To show the potential applications of our obtained theoretical results, we conduct the detailed Hopf bifurcation analysis for a multi-patch predator-prey system defined on any undirected connected underlying network and on the particular non-periodic one-dimensional lattice network. Remarkably, we reveal that the structure of the underlying network imposes a significant effect on the occurrence of the spatially nonhomogeneous Hopf bifurcations.},

Such systems arise in the modeling of population dynamics under the effect of a shifting environment, such as climate change. We show on the one hand the existence of waves connecting the trivial state to the unique constant positive co-existence state for any value of the forced speed.

This scattering result was used in Zhao [38] as an assumption to obtain the scattering for cubic NLS on R 2 × T 2 R2×T2 in H 1 H1 space. Moreover, the 1D analogue is proved in Yang-Zhao [35] . Though the scheme is also tightly based on Dodson [11] , the 2D case is more complicated which causes some new difficulties. One obstacle is the failure of ‘ l 2 l2 -estimate’ for the cubic resonances in 2D (we also discuss it in this paper, which may have its own interests). To fix this problem, we establish weaker estimates and exploit the symmetries of the resonant system to modify the proof of [35] . At last, we make a few remarks on the research line of ‘long time dynamics for NLS on waveguides’.},

Compared to it, the problem is posed in a cylindrical domain with ninety-degree contact angles, which brings additional difficulties when we deal with the linearization of the system. By a reflection argument, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to the model problems for the linear systems, which are then shown to be well-posed in a cylindrical (annular) domain via a localization procedure. Finally, we prove that the full nonlinear system admits a unique strong solution locally with the aid of the contraction mapping principle.},

Then, according to these properties and the stability criteria of symmetric periodic solutions of the time-periodic Newtonian equation, we analytically prove the linear stability/instability of the symmetric ( m , p ) (m,p) -periodic solutions which emanated from nonconstant periodic solutions of the corresponding autonomous equation when the eccentricity is small, which indicates that the former stability criteria can be extended to the generalized Sitnikov problem with N ≥ 3 N≥3 .},

In particular, we address the questions of disease&#39;s persistence-extinction, existence of epidemic waves, and spreading speeds. When the basic reproduction number is less than or equal to one, we show that the disease-free equilibrium solution is globally stable, hence there is no epidemic wave in this case. However, if it is bigger than one, we show that the disease will eventually persist. Furthermore, there is a minimum wave speed ⁎ c u ⁎ cu⁎ , which decreases as a function of time-delay u , such that the system has an epidemic traveling wave solution with speed c for every c greater than ⁎ c u ⁎ cu⁎ and that there is no such traveling wave solution of speed less than ⁎ c u ⁎ cu⁎ . Moreover the minimum wave speed ⁎ c u ⁎ cu⁎ converges to 0 as the time-delay approaches infinity. We also study the disease spreading speeds interval and show that in the absence of time-delay, there is a single disease spreading speed and this coincides with the minimal wave speed.

However, due to the difficulty caused by the diffusion-advection type operators as well as the heterogeneous environments, the approaches developed in the previous papers cannot be directly applied to the general case here. With some new techniques, we characterize the linear stability of the two semi-trivial steady states and establish the non-existence of co-existence steady states in several scenarios. Based on these preparations and the theory of monotone dynamical systems , we establish the main results. Our results indicate that both competitive exclusion and coexistence may occur. Specially, we show a new way for coexistence of two species.},

The time evolution is given by gradient dynamics for a free energy functional. Our primary example is a model for the demixing of polymers, the corresponding energy is the one of Flory, Huggins and de Gennes. Due to the non-locality in the equations, the dynamics considered here is qualitatively different from the one found in the formally related Cahn-Hilliard equations. Our angle of attack is from the theory of optimal mass transport, that is, we consider the evolution equations for the two components as two gradient flows in the Wasserstein distance with one joint energy functional that has the volume constraint built in. The main difference to our previous work [6] is the nonlinearity of the energy density in the gradient part, which becomes singular at the interface between pure and mixed phases, and thus requires a more sophisticated analysis.},

We answer a version of the 16th Hilbert problem for such systems, providing an upper bound for the maximum number of limit cycles in the function of m and n . We also are devoted to giving a lower bound via perturbing piecewise linear Hamiltonian systems having at the origin a global center. For this, a complete classification of the center conditions is established. In pursuit of a better lower bound, we require that this global center is nonlinear induced by the piecewise linearity, instead of the normal linear differential center considered in most of the existing articles. This renders that the traveling time of the unperturbed periodic orbits in each smooth zone is not calculable explicitly. Thus it is difficult to use the known Melnikov functions and averaged functions to study the bifurcating limit cycles. To overcome this difficulty, we develop an arbitrary order Melnikov-like function, which does not depend on the traveling time, for general d -dimensional piecewise smooth integrable systems allowing nonlinear switching boundaries. Finally, employing the new Melnikov-like function to the considered perturbation problem, we obtain a lower bound and an upper bound for the maximum number of limit cycles bifurcating from the unperturbed periodic orbits up to any order.},

Although there is no any monotonicity restriction on the nonlinearity f , we can show that the mountain-pass value equals to the least energy level. Our results extend the ones in, e.g. Yang-Rădulescu-Zhou (2022) [44] and Du-Gao-Yang (2022) [15] , to the lower dimension.},

Our result gives a positive answer to the conjecture proposed in [12] for the case H ∈ ( 1 3 , 1 2 ) H∈(13,12) , and reveals for the first time that numerical schemes constructed by a second-order Taylor expansion converge for the case H ∈ ( 1 4 , 1 3 ] H∈(14,13] .},

In the infinite-dimensional setting, however, such analysis is generally restricted to norm-contracting systems. We develop a generalization of geodesic contraction rates to Banach spaces using a smoothly-weighted semi-inner product structure on tangent spaces . We show that negative contraction rates in bijectively weighted spaces imply asymptotic norm-contraction, and apply recent results on asymptotic contractions in Banach spaces to establish the existence of fixed points. We show that contraction in surjectively weighted spaces verifies non-equilibrium asymptotic properties , such as convergence to finite- and infinite-dimensional subspaces, submanifolds , limit cycles, and phase-locking phenomena. We use contraction rates in weighted Sobolev spaces to establish existence and continuous data dependence in nonlinear PDEs , and pose a method for constructing weak solutions using vanishing one-sided Lipschitz approximations. We discuss applications to control and order reduction of PDEs.},

  abstract     = {For unipolar hydrodynamic model of semiconductor device represented by Euler-Poisson equations, when the doping profile is supersonic, and the boundary data are in subsonic region and supersonic region separately, the system possesses the shock transonic steady-states and the smooth transonic steady-states. In this paper we study the nonlinear structural stability and the linear dynamic instability of these steady transonic solutions. For any relaxation time : 0 &lt; τ ≤ + ∞ 0&amp;lt;τ≤+∞ , by means of elaborate singularity analysis, we first investigate the structural stability of the C 1 C1 -smooth transonic steady-states, once the perturbations of the initial data and the doping profiles are small enough. We note that, when the C 1 C1 -smooth transonic steady-states pass through the sonic line, they produce singularities for the system, and cause some essential difficulty in the proof of structural stability. Moreover, when the relaxation time is large enough τ ≫ 1 τ≫1 , under the condition that the electric field is positive at the shock location, we prove that the transonic shock steady-states are structurally stable with respect to small perturbations of the supersonic doping profile. Furthermore, we show the linearly dynamic instability for these transonic shock steady-states provided that the electric field is suitable negative. The proofs for the structural stability results are based on singularity analysis, a monotonicity argument on the shock position and the downstream density, and the stability analysis of supersonic and subsonic solutions. The linear dynamic instability of the steady transonic shock for Euler-Poisson equations can be transformed to the ill-posedness of a free boundary problem for the Klein-Gordon equation. By using a nontrivial transformation and the shooting method, we prove that the linearized problem has a transonic shock solution with exponential growths . These results enrich and develop the existing studies.},

A weighted inner product has been introduced to study stability and Hopf bifurcation at the spatially nonhomogeneous steady-state. Our results imply that the infinitesimal generator associated with the linearized system have two pairs of purely imaginary eigenvalues, and time delay can make the spatially nonconstant positive steady state unstable for a reaction-diffusion-advection model.

These give rise to higher order linear parabolic equations for which we derive similar representation formulae for their solutions. Solutions exist for all time under natural conditions on the initial curve and converge exponentially fast in the smooth topology to multiply-covered circles. We consider both closed, embedded convex curves and closed, convex curves of higher rotation number . We give some corresponding remarks where relevant on open convex curves. We also consider corresponding ‘globally constrained’ flows which preserve the length or enclosed area of the evolving curve and a higher order approach to the Yau problem of evolving one convex planar curve to another. In an Appendix, we give some related second order results, including a version of the Yau problem for star-shaped curves.},

  abstract     = {The classical solution of the 3-D radiative hydrodynamics model is studied in H k Hk -norm under two different conditions, with and without heat conductivity. We have proved the following results in both cases. First, when the H k Hk norm of the initial perturbation around a constant state is sufficiently small and the integer k ≥ 2 k≥2 , a unique classical solution to such Cauchy problem is shown to exist. Second, if we further assume that the L 1 L1 norm of the initial perturbation is small too, the i-order ( 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 2 0≤i≤k−2 ) derivatives of the solutions have the decay rate of ( 1 + t ) − 3 4 − i 2 (1+t)−34−i2 in H 2 H2 norm. Third, from the results above we can see that for radiative hydrodynamics, the radiation can do the same job as that the heat conduction does, which means if the thermal conductivity coefficient turns to 0, because of the effect of radiation, the solvability of the system and decay rate of the solutions stay the same.},

We further show that the solution has the additional regularities if the initial data has higher regularities. This result implies that global solutions decay as the limit t → ∞ t→∞ in the same norm of the space of the initial data.

  abstract     = {We propose a new type of diffuse interface model describing the evolution of a tumor mass under the effects of a chemical substance (e.g., a nutrient or a drug). The process is described by utilizing the variables φ , an order parameter representing the local proportion of tumor cells, and σ , representing the concentration of the chemical. The order parameter φ is assumed to satisfy a suitable form of the Cahn–Hilliard equation with mass source and logarithmic potential of Flory–Huggins type (or generalizations of it). The chemical concentration σ satisfies a reaction-diffusion equation where the cross-diffusion term has the same expression as in the celebrated Keller–Segel model. In this respect, the model we propose represents a new coupling between the Cahn–Hilliard equation and a subsystem of the Keller–Segel model. We believe that, compared to other models, this choice is more effective in capturing the chemotactic effects that may occur in tumor growth dynamics (chemically induced tumor evolution and consumption of nutrient/drug by tumor cells). Note that, in order to prevent finite time blowup of σ , we assume a chemical source term of logistic type. Our main mathematical result is devoted to proving existence of weak solutions in a rather general setting that covers both the two- and three- dimensional cases. Under more restrictive assumptions on coefficient and data, and in some cases on the spatial dimension, we prove various regularity results. Finally, in a proper class of smooth solutions we show uniqueness and continuous dependence on the initial data in a number of significant cases.},

In this paper, we consider the complex dynamics and bifurcations in Holling-Tanner model with generalist predator and prey refuge. It is shown that the model admits a nilpotent cusp or focus of codimension 3, a nilpotent elliptic singularity of codimension at least 4, and a weak focus with order at least 3 for different parameter values. As the parameters vary, the model can undergo three types degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations of codimension 3 (cusp, focus and elliptic cases), and degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension 3. The system can exhibit complex dynamics, such as multiple coexistent periodic orbits and homoclinic loops. Moreover, our results indicate that the constant prey refuge prevents prey extinction and causes global coexistence. A preeminent finding is that refuge can induce a stable, large-amplitude limit cycle enclosing one or three positive steady states. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate and complement our theoretical results.},

The model takes into account the diffusion process of the spin accumulation in the magnetization dynamics of ferromagnetic multilayers. We prove that in the limit of long times, the system reduces to simpler equations in which the LLG equation is coupled to a nonlinear and nonlocal steady-state equation, referred to as SLLG. As a by-product, the existence of global weak solutions to the SLLG equation is obtained. Moreover, we prove weak-strong uniqueness of solutions of SLLG, i.e., all weak solutions coincide with the (unique) strong solution as long as the latter exists in time.

Such a property of the ionized gas makes it impossible to deduce the dissipative estimates on the first-order spatial derivative of the bulk velocity and the absolute temperature from the basic energy estimates obtained through the normalized entropy and, as a consequence, makes the construction of its global large solutions and the study of their large time behavior more difficult. By making full use of the intrinsic structure of equations, the existence of global large smooth solutions to two types of initial boundary value problems of one-dimensional, compressible Navier-Stokes system for a viscous and heat-conducting ionized gas is established in [22] for a class of density and/or temperature dependent transport coefficients, but since the estimates obtained there depend on the time variable, the problem on their large time behavior remains unsolved and the main purpose of this paper is to give the precise description of the large time behavior of the global solutions constructed in [22] . The key ingredient in our analysis is to deduce the uniform-in-time positive lower and upper bounds on the specific volume and the absolute temperature.},

We find the aggregation phenomenon of endemic equilibrium and classify possible dynamics for the model, including the asymptotic profiles and monotonicity of basic reproduction ratio R 0 R0 with respect to the diffusion and advection rates of infected hosts and vectors. More importantly, we obtain some crucial and interesting phenomena by classifying the level set of R 0 R0 . Specifically, there exist unique critical surfaces to separate the dynamics, namely, the disease-free equilibrium is stable on one side of the surface and unstable on the other side. The resulting aggregation phenomenon shows that the infected individuals will aggregate in the downstream end if their advection rates are sufficiently large relative to dispersal.

  abstract     = {In this work we present the homogenization of a reaction-diffusion model that includes an evolving microstructure. Such type of problems model, for example, mineral dissolution and precipitation in a porous medium. In the initial state, the microscopic geometry is a periodically perforated domain, each perforation being a spherical solid grains. A small parameter ϵ is characterizing both the distance between two neighboring grains, and the radii of the grains. For each grain, the radius depends on the unknown (the solute concentration) at its surface. Therefore, the radii of the grains change in time and are model unknowns, so the model involves free boundaries at the micro scale. In a first step, we transform the evolving micro domain to a fixed, periodically domain. Using the Rothe-method, we prove the existence of a weak solution and obtain a priori estimates that are uniform with respect to ϵ . Finally, letting ϵ → 0 ϵ→0 , we derive a macroscopic model, the solution of which approximates the micro-scale solution. For this, we use the method of two-scale convergence, and obtain strong compactness results enabling to pass to the limit in the nonlinear terms .},

We have a distributed control called Leader, and two boundary controls called Followers, each of them has to act over the equation to influence the behavior of the state in a particular way, by reaching or approaching to many targets at once. To be more precise, the Leader wants to drive the solution to a prescribed target at a final time , and the followers have to minimize some given cost functionals, adapting themselves to what the Leader wants. The main difficulty here is that, since the Followers are in the boundary, the problem turns to be equivalent to prove a partial null controllability result for a system of nonlinear fourth-order equations with boundary coupling terms.},

As a consequence, nonlinear stability is obtained when the least energy solution is unique, which actually holds for a large class of domains and exponents.

The value functions for the games introduced approximate solutions to the stated PDE when the parameter that controls the size of the possible steps goes to zero. Existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions to the Dirichlet problem is established. The asymptotic mean value property, the associated games and the geometry underlying the Dirichlet problem, all reflect the family of dilation and the Lie group underlying operators of Kolmogorov type, and this makes our setting different from the context of standard parabolic dilations and Euclidean translations applicable in the context of the heat operator and the normalized parabolic infinity Laplace operator .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the nonlinear stability of solitons and multi-solitons for the following Hirota equation i u t + u x x + 2 | u | 2 u + i α ( u x x x + 6 | u | 2 u x ) = 0 , ( t , x ) ∈ R 2 , α ∈ R . iut+uxx+2|u|2u+iα(uxxx+6|u|2ux)=0,(t,x)∈R2,α∈R. Firstly, by employing the variational approach with suitable conservation laws, we establish the orbital stability of the Hasimoto solitons in Sobolev space H 1 ( R ) H1(R) . Secondly, by choosing a suitable Lyapunov functional and investigating the spectrum of second variation operator around the solitons, we derive that the Hasimoto solitons are also orbitally stable in H m ( R ) Hm(R) with m ∈ N m∈N for any α ∈ R α∈R . Finally, pure N -solitons of the Hirota equation are shown to be dynamically stable in H N ( R ) HN(R) . By constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional, it is found that the multi-solitons are non-isolated constrained minimizers satisfying a 2 N order elliptic equation , and the dynamical stability issue is reduced to study of the spectrum of explicit linearized systems . Our approach in the spectral analysis consists in an invariant for the multi-solitons and new operator identities motivated by recursion operators of the Hirota equation. As a direct consequence, we recover a new proof of the stability of N -solitons for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation [24] .},

This problem consists in the recovery of the potential on a subinterval ( 0 , a ) (0,a) , a ≤ 1 a≤1 , from eigenvalues corresponding to the boundary value problems with different boundary conditions. We obtain a sufficient condition for the unique specification of the radial Schrödinger operator by a set of eigenvalues and a part of the potential function on ( a , 1 ) (a,1) in terms of the cosine system closedness. The Borg-type and the Hochstadt-Lieberman type results are obtained as corollaries of our main result. Furthermore, under an additional hypothetical condition, we show that our condition is not only sufficient but also necessary for the uniqueness of the inverse problem solution. The main tool of our proof technique is the singular transformation operator representation for the solution of the radial Schrödinger equation .},

Secondly, we study optimal decay rate for global solution of the CNS equations with potential force. The tricky problem comes from the equilibrium state that will depend on spatial variable rather than constant. Based on energy estimate, spectral analysis, and high-low frequency decomposition, we establish the upper and lower bounds of decay rates for the solution itself and its spatial derivatives. These decay rates are really optimal since the upper bounds of decay rates coincide with the lower ones.},
