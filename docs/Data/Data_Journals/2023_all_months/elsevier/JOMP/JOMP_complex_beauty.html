  abstract     = {This paper demonstrates how averaging over individual learning and forgetting curves gives rise to transformed averaged curves. In an earlier paper (Murre and Chessa, 2011), we already showed that averaging over exponential functions tends to give a power function. The present paper expands on the analyses with exponential functions. Also, it is shown that averaging over power functions tends to give a log power function. Moreover, a general proof is given how averaging over logarithmic functions retains that shape in a specific manner. The analyses assume that the learning rate has a specific statistical distribution, such as a beta, gamma, uniform, or half-normal distribution. Shifting these distributions to the right, so that there are no low learning rates (censoring), is analyzed as well and some general results are given. Finally, geometric averaging is analyzed, and its limits are discussed in remedying averaging artefacts.},

Together with additional (and intuitively meaningful) super-additivity property, the regret criterion resolves the Allais’ paradox including the cases were the paradox disappears, and the choices agree with the expected utility. This super-additivity property is also employed for establishing consistency between regret and stochastic dominance for dependent lotteries. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the regret criterion can be used in Savage’s omelet, a classical decision problem in which the lottery outcomes are not fully resolved.

  abstract     = {In many decision tasks, we have a set of alternative choices and are faced with the problem of how to use our latent beliefs and preferences about each alternative to make a single choice. Cognitive and decision models typically presume that beliefs and preferences are distilled to a scalar latent strength for each alternative, but it is also critical to model how people use these latent strengths to choose a single alternative. Most models follow one of two traditions to establish this link. Modern psychophysics and memory researchers make use of signal detection theory, assuming that latent strengths are perturbed by noise, and the highest resulting signal is selected. By contrast, many modern decision theoretic modeling and machine learning approaches use the softmax function (which is based on Luce’s choice axiom; Luce, 1959) to give some weight to non-maximal-strength alternatives. Despite the prominence of these two theories of choice, current approaches rarely address the connection between them, and the choice of one or the other appears more motivated by the tradition in the relevant literature than by theoretical or empirical reasons to prefer one theory to the other. The goal of the current work is to revisit this topic by elucidating which of these two models provides a better characterization of latent processes in m m -alternative decision tasks, with a particular focus on memory tasks. In a set of visual memory experiments, we show that, within the same experimental design, the softmax parameter β β varies across m m -alternatives, whereas the parameter d ′ d′ of the signal-detection model is stable. Together, our findings indicate that replacing softmax with signal-detection link models would yield more generalizable predictions across changes in task structure. More ambitiously, the invariance of signal detection model parameters across different tasks suggests that the parametric assumptions of these models may be more than just a mathematical convenience , but reflect something real about human decision-making.},

Since the choice processes are often found to be affected by the context or the choice set, the proposed MAGL method is able to model and predict the context-dependent choice behavior of consumers. The predictions of the MAGL method are useful to marketing/product managers in designing new products. The output of the MAGL method can be analyzed to determine which combination of attribute values is outperforming in a specific competitive market condition. A decision support system can be designed and developed for marketing/product managers where they can experiment by introducing, redesigning, or removing products and simulate the market share of various products for a similar consumer population.},

Following these developments and drawing upon the so-called extended polytomous knowledge structure, this paper presents two concepts: weak polytomous structure and extended surmise system.

  abstract     = {Although knowledge is extremely high-dimensional, human episodic memory performance appears extremely low-dimensional, focused largely on stimulus-features that distinguish list items from one another. A cognitively plausible way this tension could be addressed is if selective attention selects a small number of features from each item. I consider an ongoing debate about whether stronger items (better encoded) interfere more than weaker items (less well encoded) with probe items during old/new episodic recognition judgements. This is called the list-strength effect, concerning whether or not effects of encoding strength are larger in lists of mixed strengths than in pure lists of a single strength. Analytic derivations with Anderson’s (1970) matched filter model show how storing only a small subset of features within high-dimensional representations, and assuming those same subsets tend to reiterate themselves item-wise at test, can support high recognition performance. In the sparse regime, the model produces a list-strength effect that is small in magnitude, resembling previous findings of so-called null list-strength effects. When the attended feature space is compact, such as for phonological features, attentional subsetting cannot be sparse. This introduces non-negligible cross-talk from other list items, producing a large-magnitude list-strength effect, similar to what is observed for the production effect (better recognition when reading aloud). This continuum-based account implies the existence of a continuous range of magnitudes of list-composition effects, including occasional inverted list-strength effects. This lays the foundation for propagating effects of task-relevant attention to sparse subsets of features through a broad range of models of memory behaviour.},

This paper presents an alternative to Kruschke’s approach, introducing the novel concept of Relative Importance Interval and considering the distribution of probability mass within parameter space. Using computer simulations, we compare these proposals to each other and to the widely-used Bayes factor-based stopping method.

The first paper entitled “Mathematical self-determination theory I: Real representation” addressed the representation of the theory in reals. This second paper is in continuation of it. The representation of the first part allows to abstract the results in more general mathematical structures , namely, affine spaces . The simpler real representation is reobtained as a special instance. We take convexity as the pivotal starting point to generalize the whole exposition and represent self-determination theory in abstract affine spaces . This includes the affine space analogs of the notions of internal locus, external locus, and impersonal locus, of regulated and graded motivation, and self-determination. We also introduce polar coordinates in Euclidean affine motivation spaces to study self-determination on radial and angular line segments. We prove the distributivity of the lattice of general self-determination in the affine space formulation. The representation in an affine space is free in the choice of primitives. However, the different representations, in reals or affine, are shown to be unique up to canonical isomorphism . The aim of this paper is to extend on the results obtained in the first paper, thereby to further lay the mathematical foundations of self-determination motivation theory.},

MSDT1 considers the real representation, MSDT2 the affine space representation. The aim of the two papers is to lay the mathematical foundations of self-determination motivation theory. Self-determination theory was proposed by Deci and Ryan, which is a popular theory of motivation. The fundamental concepts are extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, amotivation, their type of regulation, locus of causality, and especially, self-determination. First, we give a geometric description of its concepts for the regulated case (no amotivation), as the unit 1-simplex. Thereby, we derive a symmetric definition of self-determination. Second, we extend the geometric description to the regulated and unregulated case, based on a more general ternary model, in internal motivation, external motivation, and amotivation. We define gradations of amotivation (and motivation), as 1-simplexes parallel to the unit 1-simplex. The ternary representation implies the types of strong, weak, and general self-determination, as partial orders on the motivation space. Third, we study the order, lattice , and algebraic properties of self-determination. In a version of polar coordinates, strong self-determination turns out to be a complete lattice on angular line segments, weak self-determination is a complete lattice on radial line segments, and general self-determination entails a complete lattice on the entire motivation space. In addition, the modified polar coordinates are employed to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for strong, weak, and general self-determination. We propose measures for the strength of an ordinal dependency in self-determination, which are partial metrics on the motivation space.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to clarify sufficient conditions for weak orders on the existing and null alternatives to make leximax and leximin rules over the power set satisfy extensibility . Each null alternative indicates ‘choosing not to choose the corresponding existing alternative’. Extensibility requires that a preference order of any two alternatives is equivalent to that of their singleton sets. Then, the leximax (alternatively, leximin) rule ranks any two subsets by comparing the same-ranked (null) alternatives in the two transformed subsets (which include the existing alternatives in each subset and the null alternatives of other existing alternatives) from top to bottom (alternatively, bottom to top). We then introduce the following two new properties: Semi-inversion desirability requires that a preference of any two null alternatives is not identical to that of their existing alternatives. Consistent desirability requires that a preference order of ‘a null alternative and a non-paired existing alternative’ is not identical to that of their paired (null) alternatives. We show that semi-inversion desirability implies extensibility, and the combination of semi-inversion desirability and consistent desirability is weaker than a traditional property, namely self-reflecting. Furthermore, we clarify the sufficient condition to make the leximax and leximin rules equivalent.},

Given that the number of possible bundles (i.e., subsets of the given set of objects) is exponential in the number of objects, it is important for the decision-maker to be able to represent this valuation function succinctly. Identifying all structural sources of synergy in subset valuations might point to simple and concise representation of the valuation function. We characterize additive and multiplicative representations of synergies in subset valuations and subset utility, which in turn points to necessary and sufficient conditions for a succinct representation of subset valuations to exist.},

  abstract     = {In response time (RT) research, it is common to instruct participants to respond as fast and as accurately as possible, which is easily conceived as a contradiction. Participants may overcome this dilemma using a two-fold strategy, with (A) delaying their response until they feel confident that enough information has been sampled, and (B) scheduling the response right before the end of the response window to avoid omissions. The purpose of this strategy is to satisfy the contradictory requirements of the task instructions, but both (A) and (B) may yield a distorted picture of the processing times under investigation. We asked participants to discriminate random dot motion with fixed and variable deadlines for responding. With the exponentially distributed variable deadline, strategic responding is useless because it is impossible to schedule an optimal time point for the response. We present two analyses, a model-free approach that investigates the effect of an unpredictable deadline on standard RT measures, and the fit of an RT model testing for effects of the deadline on specific parameters. Compared to the fixed deadline, faster responses that were less variable across participants were observed under the variable deadline, suggesting that the new paradigm can reduce strategic responding. We demonstrate how to deal with omitted responses and conclude that variable deadlines are a promising tool to exert time pressure in RT experiments and potentially yield better estimates of the underlying processing times.},

  abstract     = {Many decision making theories assume a principle of sequentially sampling decision-relevant evidence from the stimulus environment, where sampled evidence is dynamically accumulated toward a threshold to trigger a decision in favour of the threshold-crossing option. A core prediction of sequential sampling models is that options more likely to be chosen are chosen more quickly. This result has been empirically supported hundreds of times for low-level speeded perceptual decisions — the traditional domain of sequential sampling models. More recently, sequential sampling models have been generalised and applied to higher-level preferential, or value-based, decisions — decisions for which there is no objectively correct option. Preferential options are typically composed of multiple attributes, like a phone defined by its price, camera quality, memory capacity, and so on. Here, we show that decisions for such multi-attribute preferential options with defined features violate the core prediction of sequential sampling models: options more likely to be chosen are not chosen more quickly. We find this invariance across 4 data sets spanning multi-attribute choices made in unconstrained conditions, under time pressure, and for multi-attribute options with artificial or marketplace compositions. The result remains whether the relationship between choice frequency and choice time is inspected at the lower level of component attributes or the higher level of whole options. Our finding places critical constraints on the capacity to generalise sequential sampling models from low-level perceptual decisions to high-level multi-attribute preferential choice.},

Data contradict both predictions; when a pair is remembered, constituent-order is above chance, but still fairly low. Convolution-based models are inherently symmetric and can explain associative symmetry, but cannot discriminate AB from BA. We evaluated four extensions of convolution, where order is incorporated as item features, partial permutations of features, item-position associations, or by adding item and position vectors . All approaches could discriminate order within behaviourally observed ranges, without compromising associative symmetry. Only the permutation model could disambiguate AB from BC in double-function lists, as humans can do. It is possible that each of our proposed mechanisms might apply to a different, particular task setting. However, the partial permutation model can thus far explain the broadest set of empirical benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how attentional resources are deployed in visual processing is a fundamental and highly debated topic. As an alternative to theoretical models of visual search that propose sequences of separate serial or parallel stages of processing, we suggest a queueing processing structure that entails a serial transition between parallel processing stages. We develop a continuous-time queueing model for standard visual search tasks to formalize and implement this notion. Specified as a finite-time, single-line, multiserver queueing system , the model accounts for both accuracy and response time (RT) data in visual search on a distributional level. It assumes two stages of processing. Visual stimuli first go through a massively parallel preattentive stage of feature encoding. They wait if necessary and then enter a limited-capacity attentive stage serially where multiple processing channels (“servers”) integrate features of several stimuli in parallel. A core feature of our model is the serial transition from the unlimited-capacity preattentive processing stage to the limited-capacity attentive processing stage. It enables asynchronous attentive processing of multiple stimuli in parallel and is more efficient than a simple chain of two successive, strictly parallel processing stages. The model accounts for response errors by means of two underlying mechanisms, namely, imperfect processing of the servers and, in addition, incomplete search adopted by the observer to maximize search efficiency under an accuracy constraint. For statistical inference , we develop a Monte-Carlo-based parameter estimation procedure, using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for accuracy-related parameters and minimum distance (MD) estimation for RT-related parameters. We fit the model to two large empirical data sets from two types of visual search tasks. The model captures the accuracy rates almost perfectly and the observed RT distributions quite well, indicating a high explanatory power . The number of independent parallel processing channels that explain both data sets best was five. We also perform a Monte-Carlo model uncertainty analysis and show that the model with the correct number of parallel channels is selected for more than 90\% of the simulated samples.},

Inspired by Block and Marschak (1960), Marley conceived a random utility model for the choice frequencies of the best and worst alternatives in any proposed set of alternatives (Marley and Louviere, 2005). He then asked for a characterization of the prediction range of the model. The range being a convex polytope , an affine description of this polytope would provide a solution to Marley problem. For four alternatives, we show that a minimal such description consists in 26 affine equalities and 144 affine inequalities. The result derives from the Gale transform of the set of polytope vertices: the transform being a family of 24 vectors in a one-dimensional vector space, it plainly reveals the affine structure of the polytope. As far as we know, Marley problem is still open when the number of alternatives exceeds 4.},

Fishburn(1998) offers a nice survey of the findings on random utility models at the time. A complete characterization of the MCP is a remarkable achievement of Falmagne (1978). To derive a more enlightening proof of Falmagne Theorem, Fiorini(2004) assimilates the MCP with the flow polytope of some acyclic network. However, apart from a recognition of the facets by Suck(2002), the geometric structure of the MCP was apparently not much investigated. We characterize the adjacency of vertices and the adjacency of facets. Our characterization of the edges of the MCP helps understand recent findings in economics papers such as Chang, Narita and Saito(2022) and Turansick(2022). Moreover, our results on adjacencies also hold for the flow polytope of any acyclic network. In particular, they apply not only to the MCP, but also to three polytopes which Davis-Stober, Doignon, Fiorini, Glineur and Regenwetter (2018) introduced as extended formulations of the weak order polytope, interval order polytope and semiorder polytope (the prediction ranges of other models, see for instance Fishburn and Falmagne, 1989, and Marley and Regenwetter, 2017).},

  abstract     = {State-Trace Analysis (STA) is a methodology for investigating the number of latent variables. Recently, a quantitative STA technique based on conjoint monotonic regression and double bootstrap method (STA-CMR) has been proposed. More discussion is needed on the type I error and the statistical power of this technique, as it adopts null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) to draw statistical inference . Because the results of STA are comparable with analysis of variance (ANOVA) in a three-factor experiment with linearity assumption, it is necessary to compare STA-CMR with ANOVA accordingly. This study investigated the type I error and the statistical power of STA-CMR and ANOVA in specific linear and nonlinear models using simulated data. Results demonstrated that both techniques were effective in the linear models, where ANOVA had a greater statistical power and STA-CMR had a more rigorous control of type I error. In the nonlinear models, although STA-CMR worked just as well as in the linear models, ANOVA completely lost its effectiveness. Besides, we found that the estimated type I error rate of STA-CMR was always smaller than the preset significance level in both linear and non-linear models. We suggest that the suppressed type I error rate may be caused by the bootstrap procedure, but the exact causes need further investigation. In conclusion, despite the suppressed type I error rate, STA-CMR can be a useful tool for determining the number of latent variables, particularly in non-linear models.},

Many complex and articulated 3D objects can be represented by combining generalized cones. It has been shown that generalized cones play an important role in our visual system for perceiving the shapes of these objects and recognizing them. In this study, we analyzed the geometrical properties of generalized cones and their 2D images and found that there are invariant features in the images of the generalized cones under both 2D orthographic and perspective projections that facilitate the recovery of the 3D shapes of the cones from the images. We found that the 3D translational symmetry of generalized cones can be analyzed using tools designed for 3D mirror-symmetry.},

  abstract     = {A novel and easy-to-compute measure is proposed that compares the relative contribution of each parameter of a mathematical model to the model’s mathematical flexibility or complexity, with respect to accounting for the results of some specific experiment. When the data space is a two-dimensional plot of the type used in standard state-trace analysis, then the model complexity contributed by a single parameter equals the length of the state trace (LOST) that results when that parameter is varied and all other parameters are held constant. For the normal, equal-variance, signal-detection model, the average LOST when the response-criterion parameter X C XC is varied is about four times greater than the average LOST when the sensitivity parameter d ′ d′ is varied. As a result, applying the signal-detection model to random data almost always leads to the conclusion that all the points share the same value of d ′ d′ but were generated under different values of X C XC . Parameters that have non-monotonic effects on performance, such as the attention-weight parameter that is used in popular exemplar and prototype models of categorization, tend to have large LOSTs, and therefore contribute to model flexibility more than parameters that have monotonic effects on performance. Comparing LOSTs for exemplar and prototype models also leads to some deep new insights into the structure of both models.},

The model provides aggregate estimates of the latent consensus knowledge at the group level while accounting for heterogeneity in informant competence and item difficulty. We develop a new version of cultural consensus theory for two-dimensional continuous judgments which are obtained when asking informants to locate a set of unknown sites on a geographic map. The new model is fitted using hierarchical Bayesian modeling. A simulation study shows satisfactory parameter recovery for realistic numbers of informants and items. We also assess the accuracy of the aggregate location estimates by comparing the new model against simply computing the unweighted average of the informants’ judgments. A simulation study shows that, due to weighing judgments by the inferred competence of the informants, cultural consensus theory provides more accurate location estimates than unweighted averaging. The new model also showed a higher accuracy in an empirical study in which individuals judged the location of 57 European cities on maps.},

The experiment places an additional decoy alternative within the range of existing alternatives, which should leave choice behaviour unaltered if attributes are weighted by their range. Instead, we observe a decrease in the relative proportion of targets chosen, particularly for subjects who exhibited an initial decoy effect. We also observe considerably more variation in individual behaviour than expected. We therefore consider an alternative theory in which attributes values are compared with diminishing sensitivity (via divisive normalization) and assess its performance in an additional discrete choice experiment previously used in the discrete choice literature. We find that divisive normalization captures behaviour better than range normalization and the linear additive Logit model typically used in applied settings. We therefore propose divisive normalization as both a neuro-computational explanation for context effects and a useful empirical tool for applied researchers.},

Recently published data on the problem correct rate as inferred from a response-based assessment of the mastering of the problem seem to contradict this assumption. The analysis presented in this paper, however, reveals that deviations from constancy in the observed direction are to be expected under the BLIM. They are mainly due to the inaccuracy inherent in any response-based assessment. The implications of these results for the empirical validation of the BLIM are discussed.},

We compare it with classical (Boolean) logic and highlight the role of violation of the distributive law for conjunction and disjunction. It is well known that nondistributivity is equivalent to incompatibility of logical variables — the impossibility to assign jointly the two-valued truth values to these variables. A natural question arises as to whether quantum logical nondistributivity in human logic can be tested experimentally. We show that testing the response replicability effect (RRE) in cognitive psychology is equivalent to testing nondistributivity — under the prevailing conjecture that the mental state update generated by observation is described as orthogonal projection of the mental state vector (the projective update conjecture of Wang and Busemeyer). A simple test of RRE is suggested. In contrast to the previous works in quantum-like modeling, we proceed in the state-dependent framework; in particular, distributivity , compatibility, and RRE are considered in a fixed mental state. In this framework, we improve the previous result on the impossibility to combine question order and response replicability effects by using (von Neumann–Lüders) projective measurements .},

Since information-integration categories lack verbalizable descriptions, unlike rule-based ones, we assert that an information-integration categorization decision results from an intuitive probabilistic reasoning system characterized by quantum probability theory, whereas a rule-based categorization decision results from a logical, rational probabilistic reasoning system characterized classical probability theory. In our experiment, participants learn to categorize simple, visual stimuli as members of either category S or category K during an acquisition phase, and then rate the likelihood on a scale of 0 to 5 that a stimulus belongs to one category and subsequently perform the same likelihood rating for the other category during a transfer phase. Following the principle of complementarity in quantum theory, we expect the category likelihood ratings to exhibit order effects in the information-integration task, but not in the rule-based task. In the information-integration task, we found definitive order effects in the likelihood ratings. But, in the rule-based task, we found that the order effects in the likelihood ratings are not significant.},

Prior work has shown that – combined with a Rescorla–Wagner style learning mechanism – derived attention explains phenomena such as learned predictiveness, inattention to blocked cues, and value-based salience. We introduce a Bayesian derived attention model that explains a wider array of results than previous models and gives further insight into the principle of derived attention. Our approach combines Bayesian linear regression with the assumption that the associations of any cue with various outcomes share the same prior variance, which can be thought of as the inherent importance of that cue. The new model simultaneously estimates cue–outcome associations and prior variance through approximate Bayesian learning. A significant cue will develop large associations, leading the model to estimate a high prior variance and hence develop larger associations from that cue to novel outcomes. This provides a normative, statistical explanation for derived attention. Through simulation, we show that this Bayesian derived attention model not only explains the same phenomena as previous versions, but also retrospective revaluation . It also makes a novel prediction: inattention after backward blocking . We hope that further development of the Bayesian derived attention model will shed light on the complex relationship between uncertainty and predictiveness effects on attention.},

Previous studies used the Effort Expenditure for Reward Task (EEfRT) to show devaluation of reward with physical effort. However, it is unclear if a similarly structured attentional task would produce a similar devaluation with cognitive effort. In the present work, we propose a new task called the “shell game task” (SGT) as a cognitive effort-based decision-making paradigm. Participants performed both the EEfRT and SGT in a within-subject design. Using computational models of choice behavior, we showed that effort cost induced by the variability of task demands in the SGT is similar to the effort cost from the existing EEfRT in the devaluation of a given outcome in action choice selection. This result suggests that effort cost may be a stable idiosyncratic trait across the two tasks and shows how computational approaches can be used to estimate and compare measures of effort. In addition, the results suggest that the SGT can be used as an alternative to the EEfRT with subject populations with motor deficits.},
