  abstract     = {Orthonormality is the foundation of a number of matrix decomposition methods . For example, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) implements the compression by factoring a matrix with orthonormal parts and is pervasively utilized in various fields. Orthonormality, however, inherently includes constraints that would induce redundant information, preventing SVD from deeper compression and even making it frustrated as the data fidelity is strictly required. In this paper, we theoretically prove that these redundances resulted by orthonormality can be completely eliminated in a lossless manner. An enhanced version of SVD, namely E-SVD, is accordingly established to losslessly and quickly release constraints and recover the orthonormal parts in SVD. According to our theory, advantages of E-SVD over SVD become increasingly evident with the rising requirement of data fidelity. In particular, E-SVD will reduce 25\% storage units as SVD reaches its limitation and fails to compress data. Empirical evidences from remote sensing and internet of things justify our theory by demonstrating the consistent compression superiority of E-SVD over SVD, and the additional calculation cost of E-SVD is of the same magnitude with SVD. Digital image compression experiment with typical size 375 × 500 also shows that E-SVD needs the least storage space as compared to alternative compression solutions when the rank is sufficient to maintain a good visual quality. The presented theory sheds insightful lights on the constraint solution in orthonormal matrices and E-SVD, guaranteed by which will profoundly enhance the SVD-based compression in the context of explosive growth in both data acquisition and fidelity levels.},

  abstract     = {Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is an alternative decomposition method that allows the analysis of non-stationary and non-linear signals, decomposing them into components called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). In this paper, we introduce the bidirectional combination between EMD and the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) adaptive filter and compare it to Least Mean Square (LMS), EMD-LMS and RLS methods. The hybrid algorithm relies on the determination of vertical (IMFs indexes) and horizontal (temporal indexes) weighting coefficients . We evaluated the effectiveness of the methods by filtering sets of speech signals artificially corrupted by white Gaussian noise . To find the method that provides the greatest noise reduction and the best speech quality, we took into account the Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) score. The analyzed cases showed that EMD-RLS can provide results as good as the other methods, but with a shorter learning curve than LMS and EMD-LMS, despite the higher computational cost. For a single training iteration, the methods presented PESQ scores on average equivalent to each other. However, they showed a significant difference in performance regarding noise reduction, with the best result obtained by RLS, followed by EMD-RLS, EMD-LMS and LMS.},

  abstract     = {Identifying critical nodes in a complex network or ranking the nodes based on their influence over the network has many utilities. As an example, these come in handy while choosing customers for viral marketing of a new product or identifying users whom to block for preventing the spreading of misinformation/rumor among others. With proper network modeling , a large number of real-world problems could be analyzed using such node ranking methods. Ranking the nodes based on their spreading influence in a complex network is an important research problem. Network topology-based techniques play a significant role in various applications that require knowing the central entities in a modeled system. Classical network centralities like degree , betweenness , and closeness followed by core decomposition techniques are applied successfully in ranking nodes. Each of them having certain limitations like purely local measure or computation heavy etc. Due to the inherent nature of the real-world problems/events, when they are modeled as a network, most of them transform into a weighted network. Even then a large number of literature is focused on unweighted networks due to the simplicity of computations and evaluation metrics . Many node ranking methods developed for unweighted networks may be employed to weighted networks but they will not be utilize the extra information available as connection strengths. Recently, many authors have started to extend the node ranking heuristics for the weighted networks. In this paper, we propose an edge weight degree neighborhood (EwDN) based shell decomposition technique to rank the nodes of a weighted network. It considers both node degree and edge weight with a proper balance of importance. The SIR epidemic model has been used as a benchmark for simulating the spreading process. The number of generated shells, number of core–shell nodes, and monotonicity have been computed as performance metrics during the evaluation of the methods. Also, Kendall’s rank correlation with the benchmark SIR model for various competing heuristics is compared. A performance comparison with recent relevant methods shows a better outcome with the proposed method on real-world weighted networks.},

However, data transmission after allocating resources to the application is one of the critical challenges that produces communicational delays and time overheads, specifically in the execution of large-scale applications. This paper proposes a novel 2-level inter and intra-cluster resource allocation approach to reduce communication distances by defining regional resources. The requested application is partitioned through a customized Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to achieve high-quality, independent parts with the lowest overhead and map them to adjacent or non-adjacent regions with an analytical distance metric. Using this approach, it is possible to efficiently obtain the general configuration of the final map solution by ignoring long hop-count distances and improving the convergence rate of the optimization algorithms . Many experiments on large-scale synthetic and real applications derived from CAD flow have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with the previous works. The results showed that in fixed optimization iterations, up to 15.97\% improvement in mapping solution quality has been achieved, and the resource utilization factor has reached 96.75\% value.},

However, due to its extensive use in mathematics and geometry, it soon became one of the most important mathematical equations. Despite the significance of this equation, its solution in fractional and nonlinear cases has received less attention in research. This paper presents a numerical algorithm for solving fractional nonlinear Sobolev model using Legendre polynomials and a finite difference scheme. Firstly, the finite difference plan is employed to discretize the time variable, where stability and convergence of the method are demonstrated. The stability of the method is dependent on the nonlinear part of the problem. The two-dimensional Legendre polynomials are utilized at collocation points to discretize the spatial variables. Finally, several illustrative examples are conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of modern biological experiments, an increasing body of evidence indicates a complex relationship between circRNA and diseases, which holds significant implications for disease research and treatment. However, traditional biological experiments have shown low efficiency and high costs when studying the association between circRNA and diseases. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various methods for predicting the correlation between circRNA and diseases. Nevertheless, existing methods mainly focus on feature extraction from individual nodes, leaving the feature extraction from edge information largely unexplored. In this research, we use an advanced method that performs information extraction from both edges and nodes for edge prediction. Specifically, we construct similarity networks for circRNA and diseases from multiple perspectives, including circRNA and disease feature networks obtained through matrix factorization , as well as similarity networks based on Pearson correlation and Gaussian kernel . We also leverage circRNA sequences and disease semantic information to construct similarity networks. Subsequently, we refine node feature information by extracting and optimizing features from both the nodes themselves and their neighbors. Next, we employ hypergraph convolutional networks and graph convolutional networks to learn and embed features from both dynamic and static aspects. Finally, we score the obtained comprehensive embedding features and utilize the model’s training results for prediction. Our model demonstrates excellent performance in five-fold cross-validation, achieving an AUC value of 0.9833, surpassing other advanced models. The results of the case study further validate its high precision. Consequently, our model provides more valuable foundational information for biological research, with the potential to make significant impacts in disease research and treatment.},

  abstract     = {For active flow control (AFC), several frameworks have been developed to enable dynamic interactions between deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents and computational fluids dynamics (CFD) environments. However, the highly coupled modules in the existing frameworks require massive development efforts to be applied to different flow scenarios. Moreover, these frameworks do not support applications to run flexibly on multiple nodes in high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Herein, we propose a new framework named as DRLFluent coupling an open-source DRL package with a well-developed general CFD solver, Ansys-Fluent. The distributed HPC deployment of DRLFluent is achieved by a broker architecture which enables the DRL client and CFD server written in different languages to communicate across different nodes via a pair of standardized interfaces. We have evaluated DRLFluent along with two other representative frameworks using a benchmark case in which a laminar flow around a circular cylinder ( Re =100) is controlled by two synthetic jets. The strategy discovered in DRLFluent is capable of neutralizing the small asymmetry of the shedding vortices, yielding a higher drag reduction than the other two frameworks. When the number of parallel environments exceeds 20, DRLFluent exhibits the largest speedup among the frameworks evaluated. Capable of distributing workload across multiple nodes, DRLFluent is suitable for implementing DRL for AFC of complex flow scenarios which requires hundreds of cores or more. Benefitting from a loose coupling between DRL and CFD, the standardized interfaces and the user-friendly CFD solver, DRLFluent is readily applicable to a wide range of flow scenarios without laborious low-level programming efforts.},

At variance with standard approaches to LB coding, the proposed strategy, based on the reconstruction of the post-collision distribution via Hermite projection, enforces data locality and avoids the onset of memory dependencies, which may arise during the propagation step , with no need to resort to more complex streaming strategies. The thread-safe lattice Boltzmann achieves peak performances, both in two and three dimensions and it allows to reduce significantly the memory footprint (tens of GigaBytes for order billions lattice nodes simulations) by retaining the algorithmic simplicity of standard LB computing. Our findings open attractive prospects for high-performance simulations of complex flows on GPU-based architectures.},

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of a nine-dimensional single ventricle lumped-parameter model, representing the systemic circulation. This model is formulated in terms of differential algebraic equations , often found in other areas of the life sciences. We introduce a novel computational algorithm designed to incorporate patient-specific beat-to-beat variability into model investigations, utilising the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for efficient parameter estimation. Our findings demonstrate the exceptional adaptability of the UKF to severe parameter perturbations , representing significant physiological changes. Furthermore, we provide novel insights into the continuous sensitivity of model input parameters, illustrating the robustness and efficacy of UKF. The monitoring of a patient’s physiological state, with minimal delay, becomes feasible, by incorporating patient-specific measurements and leveraging the UKF.

In the present scheme, we first discretize the domain on a uniform grid. The L1-2 technique is used to discretize the Caputo derivative of order α α with α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) α∈(0,1) in the temporal direction. A weakly singular kernel makes it more challenging to approximate the integral and reduces the accuracy of the classical numerical integration method. In order to improve the convergence rate, the composite product trapezoidal formula is employed to approximate the fractional integral. Secondly, a classical central difference technique is used for spatial discretization . Using a maximum norm, the stability and convergence analysis is carried out under suitable regularity assumptions. It is proved that the scheme achieves second-order accuracy. In addition, we extend the proposed difference scheme to solve the corresponding semilinear problem. The well-known Newton’s linearization technique is used to deal with semilinearity. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {In the wake of the novel Covid-19 disease pandemic, the global economy has been affected and health crises are widespread. The disease is still incurable, and no effective treatment exists for it. During the Covid-19 crisis, drug repurposing has proven to be an effective treatment strategy. Drug repositioning is an approach to finding effective drugs for treating new diseases by discovering new efficacy of existing drugs. Studies on drug-virus association can reveal new efficacy. The antiviral drug repositioning problem is defined here as a matrix completion problem in which antiviral drugs go down the rows, while viruses go down the columns. We propose a hybrid model called AutoMF that identifies new drug–virus association. This new hybrid model aims to develop a matrix factorization model with deep learning and use it to predict drug-virus associations for repositioning drugs. In our model, a heterogeneous drug–virus network is used, which combines drug–virus associations, drug-drug similarity matrix , and virus-virus similarity matrix . Matrix factorization can extract latent factors from the drug-virus associations. The sparse nature of the associations may prevent the latent factors from being very effective. To solve this problem, deep learning is used to learn effective latent representations from similarity matrices to incorporate with MF to enhance their latent factor priors. Our model outperforms several recent approaches in comparison to benchmarking tests performed on the DVA dataset. In our approach, we identify antiviral drugs currently being tested in clinical trials or those used currently to treat patients.},

  abstract     = {IoT edge devices have become more popular due to the rapid growth in IoT applications in recent years. Task scheduling reduces latency and application computation times, while improving quality of service. In this paper, we introduce a new version of Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (AHA) with Opposition-Based Learning (OBL), chaos mechanism, and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, called CODA. AHA is improved by using DE algorithms to determine the optimal configuration of chaotic maps and OBL for determining the optimal initial population. As a result of CODA&#39;s high ability, local optima can be avoided and exploration of a region of interest can be improved. CODA is then utilized to schedule tasks in fog computing systems. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to determine the priority of tasks. Task scheduling is primarily intended to reduce energy consumption, duration, and costs. To compare CODA&#39;s performance with that of other well-known meta-heuristics, 50 basic functions were used as benchmarks. Additionally, the proposed scheduling scheme is evaluated through different simulations. Energy consumption, makespan, and cost are better as a result of the implemented algorithm. When compared to the existing algorithms that include Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (AHA), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO), Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), Particle swarm optimization (PSO), Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO), and Differential evolution (DE), the proposed CODA shows better output in satisfying the task scheduling process. On average, the CODA-based task scheduling model outperforms other research studies in terms of makespan by 46\%, cost by 8\%, and energy consumption by 41\%.},

The dataset is based on a multi-scale Lorenz 96 chaos system. Three types of nonstationary environments (i.e., trend, heteroscedasticity, and random walk) are introduced in the dataset. In addition, the test datasets are masked with different missingness rates to evaluate the POI performance under scenarios with missing values. This study utilizes several filters to identify background noises for observation covariance initialization, and the covariance is updated along the real-time data assimilation specifically for nonstationary environments. The results show that heteroscedastic noises can be well identified while random-walk noises are very difficult to analyze. Overall, the results show that the POI implementation can lead to reduced uncertainty, but POI performance can also be significantly affected due to the limitation of ML models accuracy in the nonstationary environments. The impact from missing values is then examined and compared between stationary and nonstationary environments. Both prediction and POI updates are more accurate with smaller missingness rates as expected, and whether POI is bypassed or not at missing points does not affect the overall performance significantly. Finally, input evolution can perform well with POI under high noise level and missingness rates in stationary environments, but it always yields worse results in nonstationary environments and thus is not recommended.},

The formulated reconstruction operators can realize high-resolution and structure-preserving properties by adjusting numerical dissipation and anti-dissipation errors in a unified normalized-variable diagram. Then, this work develops a new open-source library based on the devised schemes within one of the most widely used general-purpose open-source software whose solution quality is intrinsically limited by the low accuracy of the conventional total variation diminishing schemes. The performance of the new library is first verified by some fundamental problems including pure advection and inviscid Euler equations . The numerical results of the accuracy tests show that the developed interpolation library can significantly reduce numerical errors with a minor increased computational cost compared with the conventional second-order schemes. The complex profile advection test demonstrates that the new library can offer an improved structure-preserving property that gives essentially oscillation-free solutions and preserves the structures of the passive transported scalar. Furthermore, the robustness of the new library is validated by compressible high-speed flow simulations with irregular geometries. Thus, this work presents a new library of high-resolution structure-preserving schemes for the accurate and efficient discretization of the convection term which plays an essential role in a wide range of computational fluid dynamics.

  abstract     = {UAV technology is at the forefront of current research and plays an important role in agriculture, public safety and the military. Low altitude trajectory is a technology for UAVs to fly safely in situations full of various threats, so the safety and stability of the flight path is an important challenge. Current swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms are widely used in path planning problems due to their high robustness and global search capability, but most of them do not take into account the universality of such problems and flight control in safe space, so it is particularly important to improve the ability of SI to plan paths in multiple environments. To better improve the competitiveness of SI in such problems, this paper proposes a multi-strategy particle swarm algorithm based on exponential noise to solve low altitude penetration in secure space, and the algorithm is abbreviated as MEPSO. A selective opposition (SO) strategy is introduced in the traditional particle swarm algorithm to dynamically update the position of individuals and improve the flexibility of the algorithm; then uses exponential noise and fitness-distance balance (FDB) to expand the search space and prevent the algorithm from falling into a local optimum, further enhance the optimization capability of the algorithm. Comparing MEPSO with 4 basic algorithms and 7 variants of other algorithms, the results show that the minimum and mean costs of MEPSO in simple environments are 72.5850 and 72.7472, respectively. It also shows that the minimum and mean cost in complex environments are 73.2984 and 73.3312, respectively. MEPSO has better global optimization capability than other algorithms. The safety and stability of the paths in both environments are high, which verifies that the path planning capability of MEPSO is reasonable and effective in the low altitude penetration in secure space.},

  abstract     = {Despite the availability of advanced numerical capabilities and computational power, complex multi-physical, multiscale systems continue to challenge modeling efforts due to their elusive behaviors and nontrivial couplings. High-fidelity simulations have paved the way for simulating such systems, but the associated computational costs prohibit such tools from being used in iterative routines for engineering design and optimization. While numerical strategies for accelerating complex at-scale multi-physical simulations exist, they often concede predictive accuracy and lack rigorous justification. Alternatively, methods for developing rigorous multiscale models (e.g., upscaling techniques) offer a priori modeling error guarantees, but are primarily used in academic settings due to their requirements in time and specialized expertise for handling analytically intractable derivations. In our previous work, we developed an automated upscaling engine, Symbolica , that uses symbolic computation to avoid these overheads and rapidly develop multiscale models via rigorous homogenization theory. In this work, we extend Symbolica ’s model development capabilities to accommodate multi-domain structures and demonstrate Symbolica ’s generality in model development by applying it to a real-world problem; namely, to analyze thermal runaway in Li-ion battery modules. We obtain homogenized models that capture the sharp spatiotemporal gradients associated with thermal runaway to within the guaranteed modeling error. Upon numerically validating the models, we demonstrate how Symbolica can be used to reduce the level of effort in rigorous multiscale modeling and model implementation for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {The need to address the fundamental issues associated with the computational model generation process in the context of multiphysics theories that observe conservation laws and relevant assumptions motivates the present work. Accordingly, the goal of this paper is to describe, discuss, and demonstrate the benefits and implications of using metacomputing (i.e., the utilization of computational technologies for computing or generating programs that, in turn, compute the desired results) for theory or model generation, further assisted by metacomputing for raising the semantic and syntactic dimensionality of physics models for continua. The issues associated with the model generation process are identified at the outset. Then, a top-down approach that contains three distinct metacomputing activities is described. First, a meta-theoretical description of generating continuum multiphysics models defined in terms of quantities instantiated from the field of real numbers is described, along with its computational implementation. Then, a computational framework for raising the semantic dimensionality from the reals to the hypercomplex numbers is presented for both 2D and 3D continuum multiphysics problems. The semantic dimensionality is expressed in terms of the order of the algebra used to define the tensorial quantities of interest and their associated operations, as they participate in representing physics models expressed initially as systems of partial differential equations . The utilization of hypercomplex algebras, such as those for complex numbers and quaternions, is demonstrated for representative applications of models. Subsequently, syntactic dimensionality is defined in terms of the basis of the space utilized to write equational systems. Finally, a prototype of a computational system for converting equational systems to directed graphs termed “Algebraic Solution Graphs” is described. Examples of how to utilize these technologies are also presented to convey the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge in developing accurate and robust numerical solutions to multi-physics problems is to correctly model evolving discontinuities in field quantities. These manifest themselves as interfaces between different phases in multi-phase flows, or as shock and contact discontinuities in (either single- or multi-phase) compressible flows. A plethora of bespoke discretization schemes have been developed to capture both types of discontinuities in physics-based simulations. However, when a quick response is required to rapidly emerging challenges such as the need to design novel hypersonic vehicles, the complexity of such implementations impedes a swift transition from problem formulation to computation. This is exacerbated by the need to compose multiple interacting physics, which may cause specialized schemes to break unexpectedly as governing equations need to be changed and/or added. We introduce “inverse asymptotic treatment” (IAT) as a unified framework for capturing discontinuities in fluid flows that enables building directly computable models based on standard, off-the-shelf numerics. By capturing discontinuities through modifications at the level of the governing equations, rather than via reliance on specialized discretization schemes, IAT can seemlessly handle additional physics and thus makes it easier for novice end users to quickly obtain numerical results for a variety of multi-physics scenarios. This strategy also facilitates the use of a “multi-physics” compiler that automates the conversion of the modified PDEs to numerical source code readable by popular computational frameworks like OpenFOAM . We outline IAT in the context of phase-field modeling of two-phase incompressible flows , and then demonstrate its generality by showing how localized artificial diffusivity (LAD) methods for single-phase compressible flows can be viewed as instances of IAT. Through the real-world example of a laminar hypersonic compression corner, we illustrate IAT’s ability to, within a span of just a few months, generate a directly computable model whose wall metrics predictions for sufficiently small corner angles come close to that of NASA’s state-of-the-art VULCAN-CFD solver. Finally, we propose a novel LAD approach via “reverse-engineered” PDE modifications, inspired by total variation diminishing (TVD) flux limiters, to eliminate the problem-dependent parameter tuning that plagues traditional LAD. Through canonical numerical tests, we demonstrate that this “limiter-inspired” LAD approach, when combined with second-order central differencing, can robustly and accurately model compressible flows.},

  abstract     = {We present a case study of the potential impact on hurricane storm surge due to deepening the Corpus Christi Ship Channel through Aransas Pass in the region of Corpus Christi and Port Aransas, Texas. Our investigation is based on numerical mathematical models of the circulation of coastal water due to Hurricane Harvey and a synthetic hurricane derived from Harvey. The circulation models are based on the numerical solution of the shallow water equations using finite element and finite difference techniques. The shallow water equations are solved within the framework of the widely used ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) numerical model. From the models, we ascertain maximum storm surge as well as elevation time series at critical locations in the study region. To assess the effects of a deeper channel, we compare the model outputs for current and proposed future channels. The model results indicate that the changes to maximum storm surge magnitude are small and in large portions of the study area the models indicate a reduction in surge magnitude. However, there are some local areas where the models results show an increase of up to 30 centimeters in a synthetic extreme storm scenario.},

  abstract     = {The Russian military aggression against Ukraine in February 2022 unveiled the illusory nature of our faith in the stability of the global political system. This belief was largely rooted in our short-term observations and naive expectations that political structures and social relationships were fixed points in the evolution of history. However, the reality is that we cannot assume the socio-political order we know to be the sole possible state, nor should we expect the transition to new solutions to occur smoothly. This study presents three agent-based models demonstrating how changes in socio-political structures can exhibit a discontinuous nature. These models include a social impact model with a strong leader, a model of interactions among competing social groups, and a model of structural balance dynamics. The discontinuous changes observed stem from the multistability of multiagent models , and the resulting transitions are both irreversible and exhibit hysteresis behaviour. All the transitions considered correspond to tipping points and the critical parameter values calculated through analytical approaches agree with the results of agent-based numerical simulations. The outcomes of these models exhibit qualitative agreement with historical data, particularly concerning the causes of the First World War and Adolf Hitler’s ascent to absolute power in Germany, while also complementing observed variations in connection density within echo chambers formed by conservative and liberal communities in U.S.},

  abstract     = {The Schrödinger equation with random potentials is a fundamental model for understanding the behaviour of particles in disordered systems. Disordered media are characterised by complex potentials that lead to the localisation of wavefunctions, also called Anderson localisation. These wavefunctions may have similar scales of eigenenergies which poses difficulty in their discovery. It has been a longstanding challenge due to the high computational cost and complexity of solving the Schrödinger equation. Recently, machine-learning tools have been adopted to tackle these challenges. In this paper, based upon recent advances in machine learning , we present a novel approach for discovering localised eigenstates in disordered media using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We focus on the spectral approximation of Hamiltonians in one dimension with potentials that are randomly generated according to the Bernoulli, normal, and uniform distributions. We introduce a novel feature to the loss function that exploits known physical phenomena occurring in these regions to scan across the domain and successfully discover these eigenstates, regardless of the similarity of their eigenenergies. We present various examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach and compare it with isogeometric analysis.},

  abstract     = {In the past few decades, the homotopy perturbation method (HPM) has been used intensively for finding analytical and semi-analytical solutions for linear and nonlinear differential equations . This method is well-known for its flexibility and efficiency to solve complicated physical problems. Moreover, HPM offers physical insight into the underlying dynamics of the system, as well as on the evolution of solutions. In this work, HPM is employed to obtain semi-analytic solutions for the hyperbolic particle-fragmentation equation. A recursive scheme is derived for finding the approximate solution. Mathematical formulation of the scheme is further studied by conducting a detailed convergence analysis of the method. Different physics-embedded test problems are solved using this recursive scheme and their series solutions are obtained. The proposed method is validated by comparing the approximated solutions with the exact results. For two test problems, new series solutions are presented in closed form. New analytical solutions are obtained for the particle number density c ( x , t ) c(x,t) , with breakage kernels ℱ ( x , y ) = 1 , x + y , ℱ(x,y)=1,x+y, and initial condition c ( 0 , x ) = exp ( − x ) x c(0,x)=exp(−x)x . Moreover, the analytical solutions for ℱ ( x , y ) = 1 x + y ℱ(x,y)=1x+y corresponding to initial conditions c ( 0 , x ) = exp ( − x ) c(0,x)=exp(−x) and exp ( − x ) x exp(−x)x are derived for the first time in literature. Due to the non-availability of the analytical solutions of the particle density functions, the results are verified against the finite volume scheme (Saha and Bück, 2021). It is observed that the proposed method predicts the particle density as well as significant integral moments with high accuracy by considering only a fewer number of terms in the series solution.},

The need to properly resolve spatial and temporal scales spanning multiple orders of magnitude pushes the limits of both our theoretical models as well as our computational capabilities. Rigorous upscaling techniques enable efficient computation while bounding/tracking errors and helping to make informed cost-accuracy tradeoffs. The biggest challenges arise when the applicability conditions of upscaled models break down. Here, we present a non-intrusive two-way (iterative bottom-up top-down) coupled hybrid model, applied to thermal runaway in battery packs, that combines fine-scale and upscaled equations in the same numerical simulation to achieve predictive accuracy while limiting computational costs. First, we develop two methods with different orders of accuracy to enforce continuity at the coupling boundary. Then, we derive weak (i.e., variational) formulations of the fine-scale and upscaled governing equations for finite element (FE) discretization and numerical implementation in FEniCS . We demonstrate that hybrid simulations can accurately predict the average temperature fields within error bounds determined a priori by homogenization theory. Finally, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of the hybrid algorithm against fine-scale simulations.},

A very detailed complete root classification for the quartic x 4 + a x 3 + b x 2 + c x + d x4+ax3+bx2+cx+d is proposed for which the conditions are imposed on the individual coefficients a a , b b , c c , and d d .

The upper and lower root bounds for a quartic with four real roots are also found: no root can lie farther than ( 3 / 4 ) 3 a 2 − 8 b (3/4)3a2−8b from − a / 4 −a/4 . The real roots of the quartic are localized by finding intervals containing at most two roots.

DeepONet is trained to map an incoming perturbation to the associated downstream flow field within the nonlinear flow regime. The training is performed using high-fidelity data from direct numerical simulations of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations, when the gas can be approximated as calorically perfect and when chemical non-equilibrium effects must be computed. The performance and requirements of training the DeepONet in each case are evaluated. In addition, we show that informing the training of the DeepONet with the continuity equation improves the accuracy of the results, especially in absence of sufficient training data. Success of the physics-informed DeepONet to predict missing fields depends on the observables. Specifically, prediction of a unique solution depends on the available measurements.

The existing optimization method is transformed from being aerodynamic coefficient-oriented to flow field-oriented. By rapidly obtaining the flow fields of airfoils within the optimization domain and integrating them with aerodynamic theory, preoptimized airfoils can be obtained. To achieve this, we propose a hybrid network called Swin-FlowNet, which combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer. This network establishes a mapping between parameterized airfoils and their corresponding flow fields. The Transformer component captures long-range dependencies, while the CNN component extracts features from local information to characterize the flow field. We introduce a simple integration of convolution and attention mechanisms , resulting in the Swin-Conv Transformer Block (SCTB) that enhances local attention to improve channel and spatial attention. In our model, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the Transformer block is replaced with deep convolution, reducing the number of model parameters and enhancing feature extraction capability. Experimental results demonstrate that Swin-FlowNet achieves accurate and general performance in reconstructing and predicting the flow field around small variations of airfoils. Furthermore, Swin-FlowNet outperforms CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures in terms of accuracy and efficiency trade-offs.},

We illustrate the impact of this framework on three well-known models (Schelling, Sugarscape, Axelrod) and on a COVID-19 simulation. Our work employs various Machine Learning models (e.g., Decision Tree Classifier , Logistic Regressor) to depict how the inclusion of human errors alters the overall model trajectory and may justify the integration of imperfections and heterogeneity into individual decision-making processes. Our open source framework can be integrated into existing and future models and utilized to examine the consequences of an agent making a decision without the appropriate amount of information (insufficient observation), by ignoring specific information (superficial observation), when inaccurately recording information (inaccurate perception), or due to a gap between environmental complexity and individual capacity (limited ability).},

Resolving realistic pore-scale geometries in numerical models is challenging and computationally demanding, as the scale differences between the sizes of the interstitia and the whole system can lead to prohibitive memory requirements. The present pipeline combines a level-set method with geometry-adapted sparse block grids on GPUs to efficiently simulate reaction–diffusion processes in image-based geometries. We showcase the method by applying it to fertilizer diffusion in soil, heat transfer in porous ceramics, and determining effective diffusion coefficients and tortuosity. The present approach enables solving reaction–diffusion partial differential equations in real-world geometries applicable to porous media across fields such as engineering, environmental science, and biology.},

In the paper, we build a TDOA model for targets in an airspace to obtain the position and the TDOA value pairs, and then use them for a large amount of network training. The trained network can perform real-time localization. Furthermore, the paper also deduces the rationality of the error contained in the TDOA data in the training model, which proves the improvement of network performance in this case. Finally, the coefficient of determination is introduced to measure the training effect of the network. The experimental results verify the feasibility of using neural network for localization, and it can obtain better effectiveness and robustness compared with traditional algorithms. Also, a large number of error experiments are used to verify that training data needs to be added with appropriate errors based on actual localization scenarios to improve localization performance.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is one of the most important unsupervised approaches to organizing data in many practical applications. The application of different methods to clustering one dataset generally results in different clusterings of that dataset; for that reason, there is a need for evaluating the similarities of various clustering methods . This can be accomplished with the help of external validity indices. Although many external validity measures exist in the literature, most of them suffer from some drawbacks: they apply very strong null hypotheses, which lead to the independence of the clusterings, fixed number of clusters, and fixed cluster sizes. In addition, an acceptable measure should have some properties to be a metric. If a measure does not qualify for being a metric, the interpretation will not be easy. In this study, a novel Set Matching Index (SMI) is proposed based extended derivation of Jaccard, Dice, and Cosine measures. Thus, three new indices are introduced in this paper, i.e., Set Matching Index based on Extended Jaccard similarity measure (SMI-EJ), Set Matching Index based on Extended Dice similarity measure (SMI-ED) and Set Matching Index based on Extended Cosine similarity measure (SMI-EC) as a set matching metric. All of the metric properties are proved in the present research. For the assessment of the proposed indices performance quality, they are experimented on ten real-world and Synthetic datasets , and then the obtained results are compared with those of four popular external indices (NMI, RI, ARI and Purity) and a new index (PSI). Also to verify the performance of three proposed similarity indices, the experiments develop. We apply the proposed indices to the generated clustering solutions and compare the results. We show that the proposed indices achieve desirable results based on the external validity index properties.Moreover, SMI has simple formula with moderate and appropriate results that can be easily interpreted.},

The phase value time series are obtained from the corresponding phase separation process. Phase field models, such as the conservative Allen–Cahn (CAC) and Cahn–Hilliard (CH) equations, are adopted. The fractal features are calculated by the multifractal detrend fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) model. We observe that during the phase separation evolution of the CAC and CH models, the Hurst exponent H ( 2 ) H(2) of the time series of phase values gradually increases from 0.5 of the sequence under random walk, until the evolution tends to stabilize, and H ( 2 ) H(2) also becomes stable. Additionally, we find that the curve behaviors of 2 − H ( 2 ) 2−H(2) for both phase field models are consistent with the energy dissipation curves in the phase separation process. The characteristics of H ( 2 ) H(2) show that the sequence of phase values exhibits fractal characteristics, and the persistence of self-similarity increases with the number of numerical simulation iterations. Our study can provide time series with a specified Hurst exponent for the research field of unstable series. Furthermore, our research finds that the energy dissipation system in the phase field evolution process is closely related to self-similarity.},

The lack of sufficient exploration also leads to the inability of the agent to robustly learn strategies, especially for hierarchical task control of continuous action space continuum robots, which are more difficult to explore. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, HCS-R-HER, to accelerate learning by reusing empirical data across subtasks. It uses an upper-level controller, meta-controller , to integrate the underlying targets, and a set of lower-level controllers, controllers , responsible for performing atomic operations . The Oracle perspective mechanism can skip the process of unfinished subtasks, which helps speed up the learning of the meta-controller . The CS-R-HER framework is used to improve the sparsity of the data and accelerate the learning of controllers . Our approach can solve complex tasks or hierarchical tasks more effectively, especially for continuum robot motion environments in continuous action space. Our method is the first time to apply HER to data augmentation for hierarchical tasks and to implement a framework where multiple subgoals are learned together.},

Therefore, we decided to shift our main focus away from agent-based modeling to spatial computation, which allow for a more direct empirical validation of our results. This second phase of research includes the collection and integration of large amounts of spatiotemporally structured data, which we analyze with more conventional econometric tools. To advance the field of computational diplomacy, we recommend that future search combines agent-based modeling with rigorous empirical validation through the utilization of spatial computation.},

Our main goal is to explore how the link-cut tree data structure can be used in this context. This data structure makes it possible to identify and resolve cycles quickly. This property is useful for this problem and allows us to support a simple simulated annealing algorithm. We used the PACE 2016 dataset to test the performance of the resulting algorithm. The worst approximation ratio obtained was about 1.21. The algorithm is very fast. The longest execution time was 103 seconds.

Due to the vast interior vertices search space and complex initial boundaries, mesh generation for complicated domains requires substantial manual processing and has long been considered the most challenging and time-consuming bottleneck of the entire modeling and analysis process. In this paper, we present a novel computational framework named “SRL-assisted AFM” for meshing planar geometries by combining the advancing front method with neural networks that select reference vertices and update the front boundary using “policy networks”. These deep neural networks are trained using a unique pipeline that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning to iteratively improve mesh quality. First, we generate different initial boundaries by randomly sampling points in a square domain and connecting them sequentially. These boundaries are used for obtaining input meshes and extracting training datasets in the supervised learning module. We then iteratively improve the reinforcement learning model performance with reward functions designed for special requirements, such as improving the mesh quality and controlling the number and distribution of extraordinary points. Our proposed supervised learning neural networks achieve an accuracy higher than 98\% on predicting commercial software. The final reinforcement learning neural networks automatically generate high-quality quadrilateral meshes for complex planar domains with sharp features and boundary layers.},

First, the uniqueness of the solution to the problem is proved for all three sets of initial/boundary conditions, and then numerical algorithms are established. The algorithms are based on operational matrices of the derivatives, which helps in reducing the computational cost to a great extent. This is shown with the help of CPU time for all the illustrative examples. The formulated schemes handle singularity effectively by using suitable collocation points and simplify the mentioned problems into a nonlinear system of equations, which can be solved by any iterative method. Unlike other methods, the present approach requires no linearization, discretization , or perturbation. The computed numerical results confirm that the present method provides better accuracy than the Bessel collocation method (Izadi and Srivastava, 2021) and the Bernstein operational approach (Sriwastav and Barnwal, 2023).

Simulation-based forecasts for such crises can help to guide the selection or development of mitigation policies or inform the efficient allocation of support resources. However, the time required to develop, execute and validate these models can often be intractably long, causing many of these forecasts to only become accurate after the damage has already occurred. In this paper, we present a generic simulation development approach (or SDA) to tackle this challenge. It consists of three important phases: identifying anticipatory activities required for developing application-agnostic modelling tools, identifying activities required to adapt these models to address specific (global) challenges, and automating a large subset of the aforementioned activities using existing software tool . Here, a key aspect is to ensure that our models are reliable: this involves a range of tasks for validation, ensemble forecasting, uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. To showcase the added value of a generic simulation development approach, we present and discuss two specific applications of this approach: one in the context of modelling conflict-driven migration and one in the context of modelling the spread of COVID-19.},

Although it has successfully solved several benchmark and real-life problems, it experiences the issues of slow convergence rate, premature convergence and local optima stagnation. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper introduces an improved version of the SCA named ISCA, in which four different search strategies namely, population division, modification of the original SCA search scheme, hybridization of the modified SCA with differential evolution (DE), and additional mutation phase are integrated. In the first stage, the population division is performed to pass candidate solutions through different levels of exploration and exploitation. The second stage modifies the original SCA to exploit the main features of the SCA related to exploring the elite area of the search space. In the third stage, the proposed modified SCA is hybridized with DE to maintain the diversity of the population. The fourth and last stage embeds the Cauchy mutation-based search scheme for failure candidates to prevent them from stagnation at local optima. To validate the performance of the ISCA, it has been tested on 30 standard benchmark problems including unimodal, multimodal and composite problems and its comparison is performed with the original SCA and other metaheuristic algorithms. Its performance on the scalability of optimization problems is also verified by increasing the dimensions of test problems from 30 to 1000. Various performance measures such as average and standard deviation of optimization results, statistical analysis, and convergence analysis conclude the better search efficiency of the ISCA. Furthermore, six engineering application problems are solved using ISCA to demonstrate its real-world applicability. The experimental results attest that the proposed ISCA is highly competitive with the other metaheuristics .},

To ensure the safe management of HCW, this article proposes a new model for HCW transportation that separates hazardous from non-hazardous waste along the transportation route. The proposed model is based on the multi-compartment vehicle routing problem, where each type of waste is carried in a dedicated compartment, and the objective is to minimize the total route cost. Considering the NP-hardness of the problem, an adaptive genetic algorithm is proposed based on the results of statistical pre-post testing of the population.

  abstract     = {The finite-element method (FEM) is one of the most versatile numerical techniques to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). The approximations in FEM result in numerous errors and various techniques are available to reduce the errors. Distributed Source Scheme (DSS) is a recently proposed method to reduce error around a single source of field which obeys the Poisson equation using the 3-D finite-difference method (FDM). DSS achieves this feat by introducing pseudo sources around the singular source. In this article, the proposed method is studied for single and bulk sources using 2-D FEM along with experimental validation. The numerical solution from FEM is compared with the approximate solution from integral equations over the whole computational domain for the error analysis. The error due to boundary values are isolated by considering the solution of integral equations on boundary elements in FEM. The maximum error in the numerical solution of a single source is reduced from 4.96\% to 3 . 28 × 1 0 − 4\% 3.28×10−4\% using DSS and to 0.55\% using Truncated Distributed Source Scheme (TDSS) with a truncation number of 5. The mean difference in numerical and approximate potential at the boundaries of bulk sources is reduced from 1 . 21 × 1 0 5 1.21×105 Volt to 2 . 69 × 1 0 4 2.69×104 Volt using DSS.},

Identifying extreme trends in relation to a collection of other time series, on the other hand, is frequently of significant interest, such as in public health policy, social justice, and pandemic propagation. Using concepts from large deviations theory , we propose an algorithm that can scale to large collections of time series data. This paper expands on the LAD algorithm presented in Guggilam et al. (2022). The proposed algorithm is an online anomaly detection method for identifying anomalies in a collection of multivariate time series that takes advantage of the algorithm’s ability to scale to high-dimensional data. We show how the proposed Large Deviations Anomaly Detection (LAD) algorithm can be used to identify regions with anomalous trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, biweekly growth rates, vaccinations, and fatality rates. Several of the observed anomalous trends are associated with regions that have demonstrated poor response to the COVID pandemic.},

  abstract     = {The rate of penetration (ROP) is a key performance indicator in the oil and gas drilling industry as it directly translates to cost savings and emission reductions. A prerequisite for a drilling optimization algorithm is a predictive model that provides expected ROP values in response to surface drilling parameters and formation properties. The high predictive capability of current machine-learning models comes at the cost of excessive data requirements, poor generalization, and extensive computation requirements. These practical issues hinder ROP models for field deployment. Here we address these issues through transfer learning. Simulated and real data from the Volve field were used to pre-train models. Subsequently, these models were fine-tuned with varying retraining data percentages from other Volve wells and Marcellus Shale wells. Four out of the five test cases indicate that retraining the base model would always produce a model with a lower mean absolute error than training an entirely new model or using the base model without retraining. One was on par with the traditional approach. Transfer learning STL allowed for reducing the training data requirement from a typical 70 percent down to just 10 percent. In addition, transfer learning reduced computational costs and training time. Finally, results showed that simulated data could be used without real data or in combination with real data to train a model without trading off the model’s predictive capability. On top of our previous work Pacis et al. (2022) from a single transfer learning, we explored continuous transfer learning (CTL) in Alvheim field wells. Due to the inherent uncertainty and dynamics of drilling data, it was no surprise that continuous retraining further reduced the error than a single transfer learning paradigm. Moreover, we investigated the effect of drilled formations and input combinations on model performance.},

A few underlying root causes may nevertheless initiate the development of disease within each patient. We therefore focus on identifying patient-specific root causes of disease, which we equate to the sample-specific predictivity of the exogenous error terms in a structural equation model . We generalize from the linear setting to the heteroscedastic noise model where ɛ Y = m ( X ) + ɛ σ ( X ) Y=m(X)+ɛσ(X) with non-linear functions m ( X ) m(X) and σ ( X ) σ(X) representing the conditional mean and mean absolute deviation, respectively. This model preserves identifiability but introduces non-trivial challenges that require a customized algorithm called Generalized Root Causal Inference (GRCI) to extract the error terms correctly. GRCI recovers patient-specific root causes more accurately than existing alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Rock mass fractures play an essential role in controlling the shear behavior of natural rocks. The clear understanding of the fracture&#39;s shear parameters is of great significance in maintaining underground structure stability. A novel approach combining the random forest (RF) model and two population-based optimization algorithms respectively (the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) and the whale optimization algorithm (WOA)) was proposed to predict the shear strength, peak shear displacement, and dilation angles of rock fractures. 84 direct shear data was divided into training set and test set for training and testing the proposed models. Coefficient of determination (R 2 ), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), three indexes were utilized to evaluate the model prediction accuracy. The prediction performance indicated that SCA-RF and WOA-RF models achieved high accuracy in predicting the shear strength and dilation angles of rock fractures. These two models also perform satisfactorily in predicting the peak shear displacement by optimizing the dataset division and fitness function. Comparing with Barton-Bandis and Asadollahi-Tonon empirical models, the proposed models have significant advantages in estimating the shear properties of rock fractures. It has important implications for the development of accurate and reliable models for predicting the shear behavior of natural rocks, that some data processing techniques were used based on the characteristics of the direct shear dataset.},

In this context, we investigate four methods of the posterior probability estimation, where the risk of logistic loss function is optimized: the naive approach , the weighted likelihood approach, as well as the quite recently proposed methods – the joint approach, and the LassoJoint method. The corresponding evaluations are basically performed for 13 machine learning models on some chosen – both low- and high-dimensional – datasets. Some of the mentioned machine learning model schemes have been directly borrowed from literature and some have been obtained through some modifications in the existing procedures. Our second goal is to establish the most stable and efficient approach for the posterior probability estimation. Moreover, we use the AdaSampling scheme for comparison of the considered classification methods.

Therefore, present investigation is aimed to investigate optimized radiative flow of micropolar nanofluid due to exponential stretched curved surface. Heat expression with heat generation and radiation is explored. Moreover, interesting aspects of homogenous and heterogeneous chemical reactions are also presented. For nanofluid characteristics the Buongiorno&#39;s model is incorporated. Velocity and thermal slip conditions are explored. Mathematical modeling of flow expressions are presented through curvilinear coordinates . Entropy rate is modeled employing second law of thermodynamics. Suitable relations have been employed to get the dimensionless systems. Resultant dimensionless systems are computed through ND-solve technique. Graphical analysis for sundry variables on liquid flow, entropy generation, temperature, microrotation velocity and concentration are addressed. An opposite scenario for microrotation and velocity holds against material parameter. Heat transport rate augments in presence of slip constraint. Change in radiation constant and thermophoresis variable correspond to higher temperature. Entropy generation has enhancing trend for radiation parameter. Concentration has opposite scenario for random and thermophoresis diffusion variables. Larger thermal ratio parameter enhances entropy generation.},

This difficulty makes detecting collective anomalies particularly challenging. This paper proposes a new method for detecting collective anomalies using pitch frequency information from the frequency domain and dissimilarity metric scores in a sliding window approach. The proposed method called pitchy anomaly detection (PAD) is expected to be effective in the analysis of quasi-periodic time series data . To evaluate the effectiveness of the PAD approach, it is compared to three other benchmark time series anomaly detection methods. Due to the particular interest in quasi-periodic data modalities, the comparative analysis is conducted under five different anomalous conditions on anomaly-added benchmark electrocardiography (ECG) datasets. The results show that the PAD approach yields promising classification performance results for detecting collective anomalies.},

  abstract     = {Computational modeling of soft tissue deformation is a fundamental issue for engineering assistive medical procedures. However, existing methods are not suitable for online clinical scenes as these methods are not efficient due to high computational cost and complexity. A new Weighted Skinning and Cubature Integrated (WSC-integrated) order reduction method is proposed for dynamic modeling of soft tissue deformation . The presented method includes two integrated-based schemes for construction of sub-space and estimation of internal elastic forces: a weighted skinning integrated scheme and a cubature integrated scheme. The weighted skinning integrated scheme derived from handle-based reduced order method is adopted to construct a reduced-order sub-space, in which dynamics of soft tissue are governed by low-order system equations. The cubature integrated scheme is adopted to estimate internal elastic forces of soft tissue. The proposed method relies on integration schemes both in sub-space construction and internal forces estimation instead of precomputation of soft tissue deformation snapshots, making it possible to achieve efficient computation of soft tissue deformation. Compared to a finite element method in full-space for computing soft tissue deformation, the proposed method has a relative root mean square error for strain–stress and volumetric responses is 4.27\% and 3.11\%, respectively, and for rotation-moment and volumetric responses is 2.15\% and 2.63\%, respectively. The computation time of the proposed method achieve significant improvement (ranges from 37 × × to 54 × × ) with proper choice of sample handles and elements. Simulation of left ventricle dynamics based on the proposed method takes (21.81 ms) approximately 1/43 amount of computation time of the finite element method during online stage, and difference between their results is negligible (with relative root mean square error of 2.4\%). The simulation results and comparison validated that the proposed method presents higher computational efficiency and comparable accuracy to the finite element method in full-space. The high degree of computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method makes it suitable for online clinical scenes.},

  abstract     = {Non-linear techniques are useful to analyze and understand complex systems, especially biological systems. This paper presents a novel procedure to study the dynamics of biomedical signals. The procedure uses features of a wavelet scattering transform to classify signal segments as either chaotic or non-chaotic. To this end, in the paper is also definition of a chaos measure. Classification is made using a model trained on a dataset consisting of signals generated by systems with known characteristics. Using an example PPG signal, this paper demonstrates the usefulness of the wavelet scattering transform for the analysis of biomedical signals, and shows the importance of correctly preparing the training set. Next, the trained models were used for the classification of other biomedical signals. The eye movement signal and the human joint angles data during gait were selected for the tests. The present work is an extended version of the conference paper (Szczęsna et al., 2022). The aim of this extended version is to demonstrate the generality and usefulness of the proposed method of biomedical time series analysis.},

  abstract     = {Model-based control of complex systems is a challenging task, particularly when the system model involves many uncertain elements. To achieve model predictive control of complex systems, we require a method that sequentially reduces uncertainties in the system model using observations and estimates control inputs under the model uncertainties. In this work, we propose an extended data assimilation framework, named data assimilation and control system (DACS), to integrate data assimilation and optimal control-input estimation. The DACS framework comprises a prediction step and three filtering steps and provides adaptive model predictive control algorithms. Since the DACS framework does not require additional prediction steps, the framework can even be applied to a large system in which iterative model prediction is prohibitive due to computational burden. Through numerical experiments in controlling virtual (numerically created) fusion plasma, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DACS and reveal the characteristics of the control performance related to the choice of hyper parameters and the discrepancies between the system model and the real system.},

We proposed a regression model which consists of an initial layer, a deep feature mining dense layer, and a regression layer. In the term of dataset, there are two sources of data: the raw ASCAD power traces and the data sampled from FPGA implementation of AES and PRESENT. The mainly advantages of this model and regression task processing method is that it can adapt to different cryptographic algorithms on the same hardware device. Moreover, the experimental result that the model can significantly improve the attack accuracy of SCA. In ASCAD, its prediction accuracy achieves 2.90\% and 3.63\% for two different intermediate values, and their correlation coefficient evaluation 0.873, 0.840.

  abstract     = {The incremental sheet forming (ISF) has the characteristics of high flexibility, short lead time and enhanced formability. However, it still needs to be further improved in the aspect of forming quality (e.g. geometric accuracy and surface finish). The introduction of ultrasonic energy field may improve the deformability of sheets and the performance of parts, and reduce the load during sheet metal forming. The present work aims to meticulously investigate the influence of ultrasonic vibration on the deformation mechanism of material in several periods. First, based on an improved material constitutive model which considers both the thermal activation and dislocation density evolution process, a multi-stage finite element model of UISF was established. In particular, the multi-stage finite element model of UISF is divided into two stages, the full contour forming stage and the local forming stage, in which a transient simulation with high frequency output was realized. The influence of vibration parameters on the forming force as well as the distribution of stress and strain field in the forming process was comprehensively analyzed. The results show that the ultrasonic vibration reduces the forming force obviously (53\% at amplitude of 10 µm), which is due to the dynamic impact effect and acoustic softening effect. Four distinct stages, approaching, loading, unloading and departing, are observed in a single vibration period. The dynamic impact effect of ultrasonic vibration changes the contact state between sheet and forming tool and causes the continuous propagation of dynamic oscillatory stress wave inside the material (propagate to the entire plate at 0.002 s), which leads to the significant change of stress and strain field. At the same time, the maximum stress is significantly reduced (73\% at amplitude of 10 µm). By applying ultrasonic vibration on the stress-strain field, it is found that these vibrations mainly act on the contact region between the sheet and forming tool. The high frequency vibration makes smooth stress distribution along the path as well as spread over the whole sheet area to create a uniform distribution. Benefitting from the smooth stress distribution, the vibration also promotes greater formability with good forming quality and the plastic deformation mainly occurs in the side wall deformed area. The present work provides a practical simulation approach to study the transient deformation behavior of materials under the ultrasonic field.},

In this article, I discuss the methodological innovations required to achieve these goals and the path to creating an autonomous conflict monitoring system. I also report on promising results obtained using these methods, which show that they perform well on true out-of- sample forecasts of the count of the number of fatalities per month from state-based conflict.

  abstract     = {The identification of potential offenders, who are more likely to form a new group and co-offend in a crime, plays an essential role in narrowing down law enforcement investigations and improving predictive policing. Once a crime is committed, focusing on linking it to previously reported crimes and reducing the inspections based on shreds of evidence and the behavior of offenders can also greatly help law enforcement agencies . However, classical investigative techniques are generally case-specific and rely mainly on police officers manually combining information from different sources. Therefore, automatic methods designed to support co-offender research and crime linkage would be beneficial. This paper proposes two graph-based machine learning frameworks to address these issues based on a burglary use case, the first being transductive link prediction , which seeks to predict emergent links between existing graph nodes (which represent offenders or criminal cases), and the other being inductive link prediction , where connections are found between a new case and existing nodes. Our experimental results show a prediction accuracy of 68.5\% in co-offender prediction, a 75.83\% predictive accuracy for transductive crime linkage, and up to 74.8\% accuracy in inductive crime linkage.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the convective instability of the hydromagnetic Bödewadt, Ekman, and von Kármán (BEK) rotating system under the low magnetic Reynolds number approximation . The computations for the mean flow are carried out for different magnetic parameters using MATLAB for several flows of the BEK family. The equations for the linear instability are derived and then solved through the Chebyshev-spectral method for both Type-I (Inviscid) and Type-II (viscous) modes. It is observed that the Rossby number, the Reynolds number, and the magnetic parameter characterize the stability of the hydromagnetic BEK flows. The Reynolds number is based on the dimensionless radial location at the disk while the Rossby number is the ratio of the difference between the angular speeds of fluid and disk and the angular speed of the disk. The magnetic number is the ratio of magnetic field strength and the system rotation rate. The analysis reveals a stabilizing effect of the magnetic parameter on the Type-I modes for Rossby numbers in the range [ − 1 , 1 ] [−1,1] . Further, the Type-II modes disappear upon elevating the magnetic parameter in the aforementioned range of the Rossby number. The growth rates, | α i | |αi| , also diminish upon increasing the magnetic parameter. The computations for mean flow reveal that the radial wall shear stress diminishes upon elevating the strength of the applied magnetic field . However, a reverse trend is noted for the azimuthal wall shear stress which indicates an increase in the torque on the disk with enhancing the intensity of the magnetic field.},

  abstract     = {This study has focused on developing a new method for solving the multi-objective linear fractional decentralized bi-level decision-making (MOLF-DBLDM) problem in an intuitionistic fuzzy decision environment. The main motivation behind this study is to determine a solution approach algorithm that is effective and simple to apply while taking actual decision-making circumstances into account. Real-world decision-making situations involve a bi-level of several decision-makers who use various decision-making processes such as agree, not certain, and disagree. By considering such real-world conditions here, all uncertain coefficients of objectives, constraint functions, and resources are portrayed as trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, and their crisp form is obtained through the ( α , β ) (α,β) -cut (confidence level) concept. In the suggested method, we have transformed the crisp ( α , β ) (α,β) -MOLF-DBLDM problem into a single objective linear decentralized bi-level decision-making (SOL-DBLDM) model using a modified linearized approach. Additionally, the upper level specified a tolerance region for its decision variables to regulate the lower levels in order to prevent decision lock. Then, the SOL-DBLDM problem is expressed as a single-level model using a new scalar function of membership and non-membership degree for each objective function at all decision-makers and upper level decision control variables. The key advantage of this method over others is that it produces an alternate, preferable compromise solution to the problem of imprecise hierarchical-level optimization. Finally, comparisons to the current methodology and appropriate numerical examples are used to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the suggested method.},

  abstract     = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is widely used in chemistry and medicine to research the composition of matter and the spatial structure of proteins. However, NMR signals with larger sizes and higher dimensions are slower to acquire. Therefore, Non-Uniform Sampling (NUS) methods are used to speed up the acquisition of NMR signals, and some mathematical algorithms are used to recover the original NMR signals from the NUS data. In recent years, low-rank Hankel matrix completion is proved to recover NMR data with less error. However, it requires singular value decomposition (SVD) with high computational complexity in each iteration, which is not suitable for reconstructing signals with large sizes. In this paper, we propose a Fast Tri-Factorization (FTF) method to decompose the low-rank Hankel matrix into three small-scale matrices, and it convert the original problem into a matrix nuclear norm minimization problem on the small-scale matrix to mitigate high computation cost of multiple SVDs. Furthermore, the factor matrix size remains constant for different size of the Hankel matrices. We further replace the low-rank constraint with Non-convex Factorization (NF) to avoid the time-consuming SVD in each iteration. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method can significantly speed up the NMR reconstruction compared with several existing algorithms while ensuring the reconstruction accuracy .},

In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in using digital technologies to promote more participatory forms of democracy. While there are numerous potential benefits to using digital tools to enhance democracy, significant challenges must be addressed. It is essential to ensure that digital technologies are used in an accessible, equitable, and fair manner rather than reinforcing existing power imbalances. This paper investigates how digital tools can be used to help design more democratic societies by investigating three key research areas: (1) the role of digital technologies for facilitating civic engagement in collective decision-making; (2) the use of digital tools to improve transparency and accountability in governance; and (3) the potential for digital technologies to enable the formation of more inclusive and representative democracies. We argue that more research on how digital technologies can be used to support democracy upgrade is needed. Along these lines, we lay out a research agenda for the future.},

  abstract     = {As computational power increases and systems with millions of red blood cells can be simulated, it is important to note that varying spatial distributions of cells may affect simulation outcomes . Since a single simulation may not represent the ensemble behavior, many different configurations may need to be sampled to adequately assess the entire collection of potential cell arrangements. In order to determine both the number of distributions needed and which ones to run, we must first establish methods to identify well-generated, randomly placed cell distributions and to quantify distinct cell configurations . We utilize metrics to assess (1) the presence of any underlying structure to the initial cell distribution and (2) similarity between cell configurations . We propose the use of the radial distribution function to identify long-range structure in a cell configuration and apply it to a randomly distributed and structured set of red blood cells. To quantify spatial similarity between two configurations, we make use of the Jaccard index, and characterize sets of red blood cell and sphere initializations. As an extension to our work submitted to the International Conference on Computational Science (Roychowdhury et al., 2022), we significantly increase our data set size from 72 to 1048 cells, include a similar set of studies using spheres, compare the effects of varying sphere size, and utilize the Jaccard index distribution to probe sets of extremely similar configurations. Our results show that the radial distribution function can be used as a metric to determine long-range structure in both distributions of spheres and RBCs. We determine that the ideal case of spheres within a cube versus bi-concave shaped cells within a cylinder affects the shape of the Jaccard index distributions, as well as the range of Jaccard values, showing that both the shape of particle and the domain may play a role. We also find that the distribution is able to capture very similar configurations through Jaccard index values greater than 95\% when appending several nearly identical configurations into the data set.},

  abstract     = {I present a sociophysics model to describe the dynamics of formation - fragmentation of military and economic coalitions among a set of countries. Each pair of countries is coupled by a propensity whose sign favors cooperation when positive and conflict when negative. These signs are the results of the respective histories accumulated over long periods between each couple of countries and cannot be modified by their will. However, a country is free to decide to satisfy a given propensity with a benefit or to oppose it at a cost. Nevertheless, the principle of the enemy of my enemy is my friend and the enemy of my friend is my enemy, reduces each country choice to either one of two opposite coalitions. Therefore, some sets of propensities prevent countries from maximizing their benefit by simultaneously satisfying all of their respective propensities. Such situations are found to produce local instabilities in alliance building with endless cycles of countries seeking greater aggregate benefit. These searches lead to a concomitant on going dynamic of fragmentation and recomposition of the alliances. At odds, I show that the building of a priori supranational coalitions such as NATO, the former Warsaw Pact, the EU, APEC and ASEAN, which are joined separately on an individual basis, is capable of stabilizing cooperation between the respective members of a coalition and conflict between members of the two opposing alliances. The model sheds light on the former instabilities produced in Eastern Europe by the Warsaw pact dissolution in contrast to the prevailing stability of Western Europe. Furthermore, the results hint at the possibility of an additional agenda beyond the Russian invasion of Ukraine itself. Prospects for the related geopolitical consequences are highlighted.},

  abstract     = {This study is devoted to increasing the performance of the numerical methods for solving the one-way Helmholtz equation in large-scale domains. The higher-order rational approximation of the propagation operator was taken as a basis. Computation of an appropriate approximation coefficients and grid sizes is formulated as the problem of minimizing the discrete dispersion relation error. Keeping in mind the complexity of the developed optimization problem , the differential evolution method was used to tackle it. The proposed approach does not require manual selection of the artificial parameters of the numerical scheme. The stability of the scheme is provided by an additional constraint on the optimization problem . Various configurations of the differential evolution method are studied as applied to the considered problem. The advantages of the proposed method has been demonstrated on several classical diffraction problems. Comparisons with the Padé approximation method, rational interpolation and split-step Fourier method are carried out. Theoretical considerations and numerical experiments prove that the proposed method requires much less computational resources than the existing ones. Python 3 implementation of the proposed method is freely available. This work is an extended version of the ICCS-2022 conference paper (Lytaev, 2022).},

It therefore becomes very useful to analyze transaction records to recognize transaction patterns as well as the various roles that traders play in each type of transactions, which can help better understand the operations inside the network. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning based method for the recognition of Bitcoin transaction patterns after defining Bitcoin transaction patterns and describing some of the existing patterns. The proposed method performs transaction pattern recognition following the clustering approach after completing several key tasks including community classification, transaction structure creation and feature construction. Results of the experiment using real data show that for known transaction patterns, the proposed method can achieve recall rate of at least 70\%. Compared to some existing methods, the proposed method can achieve better recognition results by depending not only on the clustering results , but also on the recognition and clustering results of embedded data, which can enhance the effectiveness and the practicality of Bitcoin transaction pattern recognition.},

We propose and validate a novel approach for learning feature representations to aid the estimation of the conditional average treatment effect or cate . Our method focuses on an intermediate layer in a neural network trained to predict the outcome from the features. In contrast to previous approaches that encourage the distribution of representations to be treatment-invariant, we leverage a genetic algorithm that optimizes over representations useful for predicting the outcome to select those less useful for predicting the treatment. This allows us to retain information within the features useful for predicting the outcome even if that information may be related to treatment assignment. We validate our method on synthetic examples and illustrate its use on a real life dataset.

Traditional methods of predicting correlation matrices utilize time series data of all the nodes of the underlying networks. Here, we use a supervised machine learning technique to predict the correlation matrix of entire systems from finite time series information of a few randomly selected nodes. The accuracy of the prediction validates that only a limited time series of a subset of the entire system is enough to make good correlation matrix predictions. Furthermore, using an unsupervised learning algorithm, we furnish insights into the success of the predictions from our model.

  abstract     = {The installed capacity of renewable energy is soaring, and Photovoltaic Power is a sizeable part of it. Photovoltaic panels are being installed on both buildings and in large Photovoltaic Power Plants (PVPPs), reaching up to 2 GW of installed capacity. We need to perform simulations of the state of PVPPs to ensure the stability of the power system and their profitability. Traditional simulations that take into consideration each panel can accurately predict the generated power but are too computationally taxing. To lower the computing cost of these simulations, a GPU-based solver that processes the dynamic model of a PVPP connected to a power system has been developed. It simulates the output of the whole photovoltaic power plant down to the photovoltaic panel level. The characteristics of the power system to be simulated were analyzed in order to parallelize the system. The two-diode model is used for the PV panels, and this model was linearized, resulting in a large sparse matrix with millions of columns that must be solved. Our proposal can simulate a model of the PVPP with both accuracy and low computational cost with no PV panel aggregation required. The system was solved using an adaptive step and helper conductances to aid convergence of the matrix. Parallel column factorization and column grouping is key to achieving a high performant simulation, which makes it feasible to simulate events such as cloud occlusion efficiently. We also studied how the wiring of PV panels affects the global power plant output when panels are shaded and/or broken. It was found that the aggregated model returns a higher generated output, which is key to predicting its output and its profitability. PVPP simulations on the GPU solver are up to 14.3 times faster than on the CPU .},

The suppliers and consumers are acted by agents and each agent has an utility function which provides for different combinations of values of contract parameters a particular utility level. The agents decide on different combinations of the values for the shared parameters during the supply chain construction process. Contracts between the parties include multiple parameters, and each is working to maximize utility, based on the specified contract parameters. The SCF problem is transposed into a cluster graph in which the nodes represent clusters over the agent’s utility function variables. Agents communicate through a message exchange mechanism which provides also constraints propagation from the underlying suppliers. The proposed model enhances the current state-of-the-art for SCF by using multiple contract parameters in the process of decentralized SCF and also provides means for dealing with complementary inputs.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, may cause changes in the heart, resulting in modifications of its biomechanical response. The medical exam information is very useful but insufficient for an early diagnosis. Then, computational models and patient-specific simulations can provide new information about heart function in normal or pathological conditions . Personalized simulations usually involve parameter estimation and geometry reconstruction from medical data, which are steps subjected to many sources of uncertainties. Therefore, it is important to know how these uncertainties influence clinical quantities computed from the simulations and which inputs are responsible for this output variability. Studies of uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation using evaluations of the cardiac model based on partial differential equations demand a substantial computational effort, being important to find cheap alternatives for conducting these analyses. The present work proposes using Polynomial Chaos Expansion surrogate modeling to accelerate uncertainty quantification, global sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation for the Holzapfel–Ogden model of cardiac tissue during the passive filling phase. The results showed which outputs are most impacted by uncertainties in constitutive parameters, while the SA identified which ones are the most influential and which are negligible. Finally, using surrogate models, we showed how parameter estimation could be accelerated and improved using the sensitivity analysis results via the input fixing strategy.},

Then, the collocation method is employed to discretize the governing equations for all domain nodes, including the nodes at the interfaces of elements for which the earlier collocation methods have to use the traction-equilibrium equations. As a result of this difference, linear and serendipity elements can be used in the proposed method to reduce the total number of freedoms and easily used for very complex geometries. Moreover, the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy compared with the earlier collocation methods. The provided numerical test cases show that the method can also avoid the degeneration of accuracy when odd-order elements are employed, which further demonstrates the advantages of the proposed method. The proposed method are also leads to better convergency in nonlinear cases and iterative matrix solver. By analyzing the coefficient matrix , we found that the proposed method is better conditioned.

  abstract     = {B-spline models are a powerful way to represent scientific data sets with a functional approximation . However, these models can suffer from spurious oscillations when the data to be approximated are not uniformly distributed. Model regularization (i.e., smoothing) has traditionally been used to minimize these oscillations; unfortunately, it is sometimes impossible to sufficiently remove unwanted artifacts without smoothing away key features of the data set. In this article, we present a method of model regularization that preserves significant features of a data set while minimizing artificial oscillations. Our method varies the strength of a smoothing parameter throughout the domain automatically, removing artifacts in poorly-constrained regions while leaving other regions unchanged. The proposed method selectively incorporates regularization terms based on first and second derivatives to maintain model accuracy while minimizing numerical artifacts. The behavior of our method is validated on a collection of two- and three-dimensional data sets produced by scientific simulations. In addition, a key tuning parameter is highlighted and the effects of this parameter are presented in detail.

The existence of a unique solution to the problem is discussed in detail. A convergence parameter ħ is introduced to control the convergence and the rate of convergence of the method. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the current method is discussed. Several mathematical and physical examples are selected from the open literature whose exact solutions are unknown to check the new scheme’s accuracy and applicability. The present method gives a convergent series solution, whereas the ADM (Singh and Kumar, 2014) fails to provide a convergent solution. The new approach resolves the issue of the existing method, which allows only capturing the solutions for the smaller domain of the solution.},

There are two basic versions of the multipoint approach that allow accurate and effective solving of engineering problems. The main advantage of the multipoint general version is its generality – the basic relations of derivatives from the unknown function depend on the domain discretization only and are independent of the type of problem being solved. This feature allows to divide the multipoint computational strategy into two stages and is advantageous from the calculation efficiency point of view. The multipoint method algorithms, applied to such engineering problems as two-scale analysis of heterogeneous materials and nonlinear analysis, are developed and briefly presented. This manuscript is an extension of the paper Multipoint Meshless FD Schemes Applied to Nonlinear and Multiscale Analysis by I. Jaworska (2022) published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science [1] .

  abstract     = {Managing the inventories of perishable items becomes a more challenging task when the demand for such items is uncertain and has intermittent, lumpy or erratic character. In this study practical problem of perishable inventory products, and control is presented and solved. This is an extended version of the research presented in [Cholodowicz E, Orlowski P (2022) Robust control of perishable inventory with uncertain lead time using neural networks and genetic algorithm. In: International Conference on Computational Science. Springer, pp 46–59]. The objective of this study is to find order quantities for the perishable inventory system, that are optimal in terms of stock level, fill rate and outdating. To find the solution, a new approach is developed. The proposed approach is a combination of an artificial neural network , control theory and hybrid optimization. The proposed controller consists of robust neural network controllers which are tuned for selected perturbation bound. Weights switching operation is performed based on the demand uncertainty estimation . The validity of the results is tested on intermittent, lumpy, smooth and erratic demand data series coming from the food industry. One of the key findings of this study is that applying the proposed Switching Robust Neural Network controller provides a significant decrease in cost function in comparison to Robust Neural Network controllers. It is found that the biggest decrease is for smooth demand and the smallest one for the lumpy demand pattern. What distinguishes our work from the current state of the art is the fact that we do not limit that demand is deterministic and constant, we propose a method which calculates the optimal order quantities to minimize costs under different patterns of demand which is uncertain.},

  abstract     = {The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has been successfully used to simulate fluid flow phenomena, which involves incorporating a force term. To the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, no study has extensively investigated the effect of the discretization of the Boltzmann transport equation on the force term. The current study focuses on closing this gap by performing a parametric discretization of the collision and force term. To ensure consistent behavior during the discretization, the moments of both the force term and equilibrium distribution function are compared for the continuous and discrete spaces. The recovered momentum equation using the Chapman-Enskog analysis has an additional term proportional to the square of the external forces. Hence, a novel parametric unified formulation of momentum forcing scheme is proposed to compensate for the additional term. The novel unified forcing scheme is able to improve and predict the error of several previously published forcing schemes. Furthermore. the unified forcing scheme is validated for single- and multi-phase problems. The natural convection in a cavity and the stationary droplet problems are used to benchmark the general proposed discretization and the unified forcing scheme for single-phase and multiphase systems, respectively. The results show that the unified proposed forcing scheme agrees with the reference results of natural convection in a cavity. For multiphase flow, the unified proposed scheme predicts a high-density ratio second after Kupershtokh et al.’s and Shan and Chen’s approaches, which in their turn do not recover the correct momentum equation. The unified proposed approach predicts a slightly larger radius. This indicates that the mean-field potential function should be improved to increase the density ratio and to predict a correct radius while retaining the correct momentum and continuity equations .},

  abstract     = {The study of quantum three-body problems has been centred on low-energy states that rely on accurate numerical approximation . Recently, isogeometric analysis (IGA) has been adopted to solve the problem as an alternative but more robust (with respect to atom mass ratios) method that outperforms the classical Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation , especially for the cases with small mass ratios. In this paper, we focus on the performance of IGA and apply the recently-developed softIGA to further reduce the spectral errors of the low-energy bound states. This is an extension to the recent work that was published as an ICCS conference paper in Deng (2022). The main idea of softIGA is to add high-order derivative-jump terms with a penalty parameter to the IGA bilinear forms. With an optimal choice of the penalty parameter, we observe eigenvalue error superconvergence. Herein, the optimal parameter coincides with the ones for the Laplace operator (zero potential) and can be heuristically computed for a general elliptic operator. We focus on linear and quadratic elements and demonstrate the outperformance of softIGA over IGA through a variety of examples including both two- and three-body problems in 1D.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the radical evolution in the mechanism of micro-scale transport has been expedited due to their applications relating to the examination of biological and chemical samples, species control separation, blood cell separation, drug delivery, etc. In this research article, a new mathematical model is set up for searching the hydro-thermal transport functioning of non-Newtonian ionized modified hybrid nano blood (MHNB) inside a charged artery with a sinusoidal wall in an electromagnetic ambience. The rheological behaviours of blood infused with tri-nanoparticles (copper, gold and alumina) are mimicked by adopting the Casson liquid scheme’s relations. The frictional and Joule heating terms are featured in the thermal transport equation. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation is employed in determining the charge spreading in the electric double layer (EDL) due to the occurrence of an electric field aligned axially. The simplified model equations are retrieved as a result of Debye-Hückel linearization (DHL) and lubrication approximations and subsequently solved in closed forms. To cover all aspects of the modelling and analysis, the hemodynamical behaviours of blood circulation are graphed in the form of line and bar graphs, and the significant contributions of governed flow factors are illustrated with physical explications. Moreover, numerical outcomes of arterial wall shear stress are tabulated to analyze the dominance of related parameters on it. Based on the graphical simulations, it is perceived that the electro-osmotic factors control the dynamism of blood in the artery. A low-pressure gradient is recorded for modified hybrid nano bloodstream as compared to pure bloodstream. The heat transfer coefficient substantially enhances for larger fractional amounts of nanoparticles suffused with blood. The key findings of the present simulation could meet the nearing challenges in future biotechnologies.},

  abstract     = {The prediction and decision-making features of the artificial neural network have been applied to several robotic related research works. Humanoid robot navigation is a challenging task for the researchers with best decision making. Simple artificial neural network (ANN) is the connection models which are poor in multistep decision making with long term planning and logical reasoning. So, in this study artificial neural network is improved in long term cognitive planning by SOAR (State Operator and Result) with powerful feature prediction through ANN (SANN) and hybridized with Fuzzy system for generation effective turning angle value, which will guide the humanoids to reach target location with better decision target seeking ability. An intelligent data fusion model is embedded between SOAR and ANN for converting the logical sequence information of SOAR to probabilistic vectors in multilayer ANNs. The obstacle distances are the input parameters to the SANN model and turning angle (TA) is the output from SANN. The obstacle distances along with the TA obtained from SANN is fed to the fuzzy system as input value and effective turning angle (ETA) is obtained to guide the humanoids towards reaching target. The proposed novel technique and ANN is used by both single and multiple humanoids in both simulation and experimental platforms. The novelty of the research focuses on the development of the new SOAR-ANN technique with better decision strategy for effective turning angle value, to obtain global optimal path by avoiding trapping in local optima and dead ends. The simulation and experimental results in terms of path length travelled and time spent to reach target are obtained from both ANN and novel SANN-Fuzzy technique. When the developed novel technique is compared with standalone ANN method during single humanoid navigation then, a significant improvement of 2–5\% and 14–15\% is observed in related to trajectory path span and trajectory time spent respectively. Similarly, during multiple humanoid navigation percentage improvement of 5–9\% and 14–18\% is obtained for humanoids in terms of navigational parameters respectively. The results clearly shows the developed technique requires less time and travels less path to reach target as compared to ANN and the percentage of error is also quite low. Statistical analysis is performed from the results of both the techniques and reflects the effectiveness of the proposed technique in comparison to ANN. Further the developed technique is compared against another existing methodologies like Fuzzy-ANN and Boundary Node Approach and, significant enhancements of 5.64\% and 9.72\% is attained in terms of track span respectively.},

Here we present implicit, yet exact representations for the notoriously dense and asymmetric system matrices of boundary element methods (BEM), exemplified on the case of nonlocal protein electrostatics. Our representations only require a small and constant number of floating-point values per surface element and, thus, yield BEM systems for protein surface meshes with hundreds of millions of elements even in strictly memory-limited environments such as hardware accelerators . We provide reference implementations for the Julia and Impala programming languages , including CUDA-accelerated matrix–vector products for our implicit systems. Additionally, we provide CUDA-accelerated BEM solvers for local and nonlocal protein electrostatics that can process real-world biomolecular systems previously inaccessible with exact BEM systems in a matter of minutes.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, it is imperative to identify the combination of profitable products (nodes) within large product networks. Data exploration for such broad-spectrum product networks require sophisticated techniques for their analysis and meaningful inferences. The most commonly used techniques are the centrality metrics due to their efficiency in computation. Centrality metrics include Degree Centrality (DC), Closeness Centrality (CC), Betweenness Centrality (BC), Eigenvector Centrality (EVC), Katz Centrality (KC), and the local clustering coefficient-dependent degree centrality (LCCDC or LD). In this research, a novel approach the global clustering coefficient-dependent degree centrality (GCCDC or GD) method has been formulated for the analysis of links of the profitable products (nodes) in a large product network. GCCDC or GD is formulated by using the global clustering coefficient method which is efficient and accurate for large product networks such as product Amazon network. Furthermore, three correlation coefficients that are Pearson’s, Spearman’s, and Kendall’s have been used for evaluation. The results have shown that GD is preferable over LD to avoid uncertainties in computation of results for real-world datasets. To prove the scalability of the novel method, a dataset from different domain (biological yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI) dataset) was also analyzed using similar metrics and shown improved results.},

In this study, the seismic performance was investigated using horizontal and vertical pseudo-static coefficients. To tackle RCC weights and forces resulting from these earth pressures, 26 constraints for structural strengths and geotechnical stability along with 12 geometric variables are associated with each design. These constraints and design variables form a constraint optimization problem with a 12-dimensional solution space. To conduct effective search and produce sustainable and economical RCC designs that are robust against earthquake hazards, a novel adaptive fuzzy-based metaheuristic algorithm is proposed. The proposed method divides the search space into sub-regions and establishes exploration, information sharing, and exploitation search capabilities based on its novel search components. Further, fuzzy inference systems are employed to address parameterization and computational cost evaluation issues. It was found that the proposed algorithm can achieve low-cost, low-weight, and low-CO2 emission RCC designs under nine seismic conditions when compared with several classical and best-performing design optimizers.},

While global centrality-based approaches are generally considered to be more accurate and reliable, the requirements of complete network information and high computational complexity are hard to meet, limiting their applications in many practical scenarios. In addition, recent studies have highlighted the effect of cyclic structures introducing redundant paths in network connectivity and exaggerating the importance of traditional centrality measures . In this work, we develop a new centrality metric , called Multi-Spanning Tree-based Degree Centrality (MSTDC), to quantify node importance with linear complexity by leveraging redundant ties. MSTDC is calculated using the aggregation of degrees of a small number of spanning trees constructed with a few randomly selected root nodes. Experiments on synthetic and empirical networks reveal that MSTDC obtains superior performance than other benchmark network centralities in identifying influential nodes from the perspective of both maintaining network connectivity and maximizing spreading capacity. In addition, we find that MSTDC is extraordinarily effective in networks with high clustering coefficients . Our study provides novel insights into the role of redundant ties in network structural and functional analyses.},

This fraction depends on the investment of research and development (R&amp;D). This paper optimizes the R&amp;D cost to minimize the defective items produced in a production line. The demand function depends on the selling price, advertisement cost, and product quality. The quality of the produce items is measured by screening time effort and investment in R&amp;D. Further, we considered all the costs of the production cycle in interval-valued form and elaborately discuss the application of interval metric in the total cost interval objective function. A necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the proposed model with the help of modified KKT conditions.

  abstract     = {Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) is the basis for the conservation of irrigation water for sustainable development in agriculture. The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM) is the standard method of ETo determination that is complex due to the involvement of many parameters. Many machine learning approaches were proposed to simplify ETo determination with limited parameters. The existing machine learning-based solutions rely on a fixed number of limited parameters for the determination of ETo. The study proposed a solution to determine the raw ETo with only temperature and optional optimization of the raw ETo according to the availability of Relative Humidity (RH), Wind Speed (WS), and sunshine duration ratio (n/N). The study proposed an ensembled Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model (Model-1) to determine ETo according to available minimal environmental parameters. The environmental conditions from the year 2001–2021 of Pakistan are used to develop a dataset with the FAO-56 PM method. The unique attribute of the proposed solutions is the flexibility in the use of environmental parameters for ETo determination according to the FAO-56 PM method. The performance of the proposed ensembled model (Model-1) is compared against the individual ANN model with all parameters (Model-2) and with the individual ANN model with only temperature (Model-3). The predictions by the proposed solution from Model-1 are also compared against the FAO-56 PM method. It is observed that the proposed Model-1 is more accurate with 91.44\% accuracy, as compared to Model-2 and Model-3. The predictions by the proposed Model-1 are more correlated with the ETo by FAO-56 PM with a Pearson correlation of 0.996 as compared to the ETo predictions by Model-2 and Model-3.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven machine learning techniques have been increasingly utilized for accelerating nonlinear dynamic system prediction. However, machine learning-based models for long lead-time forecasts remain a significant challenge due to the accumulation of uncertainty along the time dimension in online deployment. To tackle this issue, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been introduced to machine learning-based long-term forecast models to reduce the uncertainty of long lead-time forecasts of chaotic dynamic systems. Both the deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and convolutional long short term memory (ConvLSTM) are used for learning the complex nonlinear relationships between the past and future states of dynamic systems. Using an iterative Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) algorithm, the two-hybrid forecast models (DCGAN-EnKF and ConvLSTM-EnKF) are able to yield long lead-time forecasts of dynamic states. The performance of the hybrid models has been demonstrated by one-level and two-level Lorenz 96 models. Our results show that the use of EnKF in ConvLSTM and DCGAN models successfully corrects online model errors and significantly improves the real-time forecasting of dynamic systems for a long lead-time.},

Here, we examine an eco-epidemiological model, in which both populations are infected. The predator population becomes infected by consuming infected prey. Once the predator population gets infected through the infected prey, it is likely susceptible predators can be infected through intraspecific contact with the infected predator even if the infected prey dies out from the system. Mathematically, we have analyzed the stability of all possible equilibria. Moreover, threshold values of the model parameters are obtained for which the system exhibits Hopf, transcritical, and saddle node bifurcations. Numerical simulations are used to verify the accuracy of the analysis. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis is performed in MATLAB to find the sensitive model parameters with infected populations. Complex dynamics such as chaos, bistability, and oscillatory coexistence of different periods are observed in the proposed system. We numerically verify the stability of the equilibrium points.},

  abstract     = {The Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model is well suited for executing irregular applications on cluster-based systems, due to its efficient support for short, one-sided messages. Separately, the actor model has been gaining popularity as a productive asynchronous message-passing approach for distributed objects in enterprise and cloud computing platforms, typically implemented in languages such as Erlang, Scala or Rust. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no past work on using the actor model to deliver both productivity and scalability to irregular PGAS applications with large number of small messages. In this paper, we introduce a new programming system for PGAS applications, in which point-to-point remote operations can be expressed as fine-grained asynchronous actor messages. In our approach, the programmer does not need to worry about programming complexities related to message aggregation and termination detection. Our approach can be viewed as extending the classical Bulk Synchronous Parallelism model with fine-grained asynchronous communications within a phase or superstep. We believe that our approach offers a desirable point in the productivity-performance space for PGAS applications, with more scalable performance and higher productivity relative to past approaches. Specifically, for seven irregular mini-applications from the Bale Kernels and three graph kernels executed using 2048 cores in the NERSC Cori system, our approach shows geometric mean performance improvements of ≥ 20 × ≥20× relative to standard PGAS versions (UPC and OpenSHMEM) while maintaining comparable productivity to those versions. This is an extended version of the conference paper “A Productive and Scalable Actor-Based Programming System for PGAS Applications” (Paul et al., 2022) [1] from ICCS 2022.},

We aim at understanding which is the best heuristic we can apply to identify critical nodes in practice, i.e., taking into account time constrains and real-world networks. We present an in-depth analysis of several heuristics we ran on both real-world and on synthetic graphs. We define and evaluate two different strategies for each heuristic: standard and iterative . Our main findings show that an algorithm recently proposed to solve the CNDP and that can be used as heuristic for the general case provides the best results in real-world graphs, and it is also the fastest. However, there are few exceptions that are thoroughly analyzed and discussed. We show that among the heuristics we analyzed, few of them cannot be applied to very large graphs, when the iterative strategy is used, due to their time complexity. Finally, we suggest possible directions to further improve the heuristic providing the best results.},

  abstract     = {The Dynamic Hunting Leadership (DHL) algorithm is an innovative heuristic technique that draws inspiration from nature to find almost optimal solutions for various optimization problems . It consists of four variants, each highlighting distinct leadership strategies to guide the hunting process. The development of the algorithm was based on the realization that effective leadership during the hunting process can significantly improve its efficacy. The concept behind these methods is to dynamically modify the number of leaders, which can enhance the algorithm’s performance. The stability of DHL variants in exploring the unknown area of the search space and exploitation phases is compared, and the advantages of exploration or exploration ability for the different variants of DHL are discussed. Moreover, the results are compared with more than twenty well-known algorithms. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms in discovering near-optimal solutions is tested across several real-world applications, and the outcomes demonstrate that the DHL algorithm outperforms other competing algorithms. The distinctiveness of the DHL algorithm is its ability to identify the global minimum on various benchmark problems and its superior performance in enhancing the objective value for the welded beam design problem and tension–compression spring problem, surpassing the values achieved by other algorithms. The algorithms’ performance is also tested on an optimal allocation problem of distributed generation (DG) and energy storage system (ESS) for balanced electrical distribution systems. The results show that all four variants of DHL obtained the global minimum for the problem. For the optimal control strategy problem for voltage regulators in three-phase unbalanced power systems, the DHL algorithm improved the objective value by 35.7\% compared to the best results found by other algorithms. Based on the analysis and comparison of the best objective values and convergence behavior for all benchmarks and problems, the DHL method proves to be an effective and reliable optimization method.},

The fractional derivative activates the memory property of the dynamics of the susceptible and infectious population time series. A coefficient identification inverse problem is posed, which consists of reconstructing the time-varying transmission and recovery rates, which are of paramount importance in practice for both medics and politicians. The inverse problem is reduced to a minimization problem , which is solved in a least squares sense. The iterative predictor–corrector algorithm reconstructs the time-dependent parameters in a piecewise-linear fashion. The economic losses emerging from social distancing using the calibrated model are also discussed.

  abstract     = {We develop a family of mathematical models to predict patient-specific response to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. The models capture key features of tumor growth, therapeutic response, and tissue mechanics that are informed by diffusion weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. We then calibrate the models to synthetic and clinical data using Bayesian inference to give a description of the parameter uncertainties. Given the family of models and the calibration scheme, we perform three analyses. First, we test the identifiability of each model; that is, given synthetic data with the same level of noise as that seen in the clinical setting, are we able to accurately recover parameter values employed to generate the data? Second, we test the identifiability of the framework itself; that is, when data is generated by one model from the family, is that model selected as the best one during the calibration? Third, we apply our model family to predict patient-specific response on a cohort of 32 patients with triple negative breast cancer. For analysis 1, we show that we can recover the parameters used to generate synthetic data (with 5\%, 10\%, and 15\% Gaussian noise — greater than that typically seen in magnetic resonance imaging in the clinical setting) with a mean error of 5.9\% (+/−1.4\%). For analysis 2, the model used to generate the data is selected as the best model for over 50\% of the synthetic data sets, provided that the noise level in the synthetic data is less than 10\%. For analysis 3, we show that the calibrated drug efficacy rate in the diffusion and proliferation mechanically coupled, drug informed, reaction–diffusion model strongly correlates with patient response to therapy with an area under the curve score of 0.85 in a receiver operator characteristic analysis. Thus, our framework shows that, within the noise levels encountered in the clinical setting, a high level of rigor can be achieved for mathematical model parameterizations and selections, and this translates into high accuracy for predicting responders and non-responders to neoadjuvant therapy.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of quantum algorithms that may impact cryptography is one of the main reasons for the rise of quantum computing . Currently, all quantum cryptanalysis techniques are purely theoretical and none of them can be executed on quantum devices already existing or available in the near term. So, this paper investigates the capability of presently existing quantum computers to attack a toy block cipher (namely the Heys cipher) using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on gate-based quantum computers and a variant of the Quantum Annealing (QA) algorithm on analog quantum computers. Starting from a known-plaintext key recovery problem, we transform it into an instance of the MAX-SAT problem. For the QAOA approach, we propose two ways to implement it in a quantum circuit and try to solve it using publicly available IBM Q Experience quantum computers. For the QA approach, we compare two reductions into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) instance by solving their output on D-Wave quantum annealers. The results suggest that the limited number of qubits (especially for gate-based quantum computers) requires the use of exponential algorithms to achieve the transformation of our problem into a MAX-SAT instance. Furthermore, despite encouraging simulation results on QAOA, the quantum circuits are too deep to work on nowadays (too-)noisy gate-based quantum computers. Finally, even if the QA algorithm seems better than QAOA on quantum hardware, it needs more complex instance transformations that reduce its scaling abilities. Our results show that the attack is not feasible on real hardware even in very simplified settings, at least as long as there is no significant improvement of quantum processors. This is an extended version of our paper at the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS) 2022 (Phab et al., 2022) [1] with new results on the application of the QA algorithm to our problem.},

The governing equations are formulated based on a global pressure concept to account for the capillary effects. The developed equations are conservative and suitable for the control volume approach. To solve the equations, an implicit pressure-explicit saturation scheme is used. The component transport equations are decomposed to a pure convection term driven by the global pressure and a pure diffusion part affected by the capillary pressures. A high-resolution central scheme is employed to discretize the convection term of the component transport equations. The results of the proposed model are compared with several semi-analytical and numerical solutions that were previously published. It is shown that the suggested model is computationally efficient and easy to be implemented for solving convection-diffusion problems. The results illustrate reasonable accuracy in comparison with the reference solutions.

  abstract     = {Link prediction is a fundamental and key field in complex network research, and some scholars have conducted various studies in this field. However, most of the existing link prediction methods neither consider the direction of the network edge nor make full use of the information of the network node. This paper proposes a topological nearest-neighbors similarity method in a directed network to solve this problem. Firstly, this study improved the Sorensen index in directed networks, and its variants also are proposed. Secondly, the matrix form of each basic index is expressed using matrix algebra. Then, based on the idea of GLHN(Global Leicht Holme Newman) similarity index, the nearest-neighbors topology of each basic index is derived to obtain the topological nearest-neighbors similarity index. Finally, the proposed method is validated empirically using multiple real directed network datasets. Experiments verify the superiority of the proposed method by comprehensively using three evaluation metrics compared with the benchmark indices, including lower error, higher accuracy and stronger robustness.},

  abstract     = {Modeling of turbulent combustion system requires modeling the underlying chemistry and the turbulent transport. Solving both systems simultaneously is computationally prohibitive. Instead, given the difference in scales at which the two sub-systems evolve, the two sub-systems are typically (re)solved separately. Popular approaches such as the Flamelet Generated Manifolds (FGM) use a two-step strategy where the governing reaction kinetics are pre-computed and mapped to a low-dimensional manifold, characterized by a few reaction progress variables (model reduction) and the manifold is then “looked-up” during the run-time to estimate the high-dimensional system state by the turbulent transport system. While existing works have focused on these two steps independently, in this work we show that joint learning of the progress variables and the look-up model, can yield more accurate results. We build on the base formulation and implementation (Salunkhe et al., 2022) to include the dynamically generated Thermochemical State Variables (Lower Dimensional Dynamic Source Terms). We discuss the challenges in the implementation of this deep neural network architecture and experimentally demonstrate its superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Agent-based modellers frequently make use of techniques to render simulated populations more computationally tractable on actionable timescales. Many generate a relatively small number of “representative” agents, each of which is “scaled up” to represent some larger number of individuals involved in the system being studied. The degree to which this “scaling” has implications for model forecasts is an underdeveloped field of study; in particular, there has been little known research on the spatial implications of such techniques. This work presents a case study of the impact of the simulated population size, using a model of the spread of COVID-19 among districts in Zimbabwe for the underlying system being studied. The impact of the relative scale of the population is explored in conjunction with the spatial setup, and crucial model parameters are varied to highlight where scaled down populations can be safely used and where modellers should be cautious. The results imply that in particular, different geographical dynamics of the spread of disease are associated with varying population sizes, with implications for researchers seeking to use scaled populations in their research.

  abstract     = {In this study, the Kriging surrogate-assisted method is proposed to improve the computational efficiency in finite element model updating (FEMU) based scour depth detection for the first time. Unlike the conventional methods of FEMU that update the structural parameters by the frequency surrogate models, the proposed method further takes the mode shapes into account by constructing the modal assurance criterion (MAC) surrogate models. The bi-objective functions of the frequency discrepancies and MAC values are directly optimized by the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II to circumvent the specification of weighting factors as required in single-objective optimization. The preferred solution is selected from the nondominated solutions by the criterion of minimum distance from the equilibrium point. As the sensitivity analysis indicates that the transverse vibration modes are sensitive to the bridge scour, the transverse mode shapes measured on the bridge piers are adopted in scour detection. The illustrative examples show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the computational time with a competitive estimation of the scour depth vector. The parametric study further demonstrates the ability of the proposed method to yield satisfactory results even using the modal parameters of the first two modes with three measurement points.},

  abstract     = {Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) are stochastic and nonstationary bioelectric signals. Because of these properties, it is difficult to achieve high classification accuracy , especially when many considered features lead to a complex structure. We therefore propose a manifold learning framework to decrease the number of features and to classify SSVEP data by comparing lower dimensional matrices with well-known machine learning algorithms . We use the AVI-SSVEP Dataset, which includes stimuli at seven different frequencies and 15360 samples per person. The SSVEP features are extracted from relevant and distinctive frequency-domain, time-domain, and time–frequency domain properties, creating a total of 55 feature vectors. We then analyze and compare five divergent manifold learning methods with respect to their performance on nine different machine-learning algorithms. Among all considered manifold learning methods, we show that the Principal Component Analysis has the best classifier performance with an average of 22 components. Moreover, the Naive Bayes classifier with the Principal Component Analysis achieves the maximum accuracy of 50.0\%–80.95\% for a 7-class classification problem. Our research thus shows that the proposed analytical framework can significantly improve the decoding accuracy of 7-class SSVEP problems, and that it exhibits notable robustness and efficiency for small group datasets.},

The integration of multimodal data becomes challenging when there is no known correspondence between the samples and the features of different datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce AVIDA , a framework for simultaneously performing data alignment and dimension reduction. In the numerical experiments, Gromov–Wasserstein optimal transport and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding are used as the alignment and dimension reduction modules respectively. We show that by alternating dimension reduction and alignment, AVIDA aligns the representations of high-dimensional datasets without common features with four synthesized datasets and two real multimodal single-cell datasets. Compared to several existing methods, we demonstrate that AVIDA better preserves structures of individual datasets, especially distinct local structures in the joint low-dimensional representation, while achieving comparable alignment performance. Such a property is important in multimodal single-cell data analysis as some biological processes are uniquely captured by one of the datasets. In general applications, other methods can be used for the alignment and dimension reduction modules.},

Modern game theoretic tools such as the extended matrix norm method allow rapid estimation of the game values for small-scale zero-sum games by computing norms of the payoff matrix. However, as the number of strategies in the game increases, obtaining an accurate value estimation through the extended matrix norm method becomes more difficult. In this work, we propose a novel neural network architecture for large-scale zero-sum matrix games, which takes the estimations of the extended matrix norm method and payoff matrix as inputs, and provides a rapid estimation of the game value as the output. The proposed architecture is trained over various random zero-sum games of different dimensions. Results show that the developed framework can obtain accurate value predictions, with a less than 10\% absolute relative error, for games with up to 50 strategies. Also of note, after the network is trained, solution predictions can be obtained in real-time, which makes the proposed method particularly useful for real-world applications.},

Despite recent considerable progress, the literature to date has focused mostly on solutions based on linear programming. This paper introduces a new proximal/gradient method for computing the equilibrium point for a tri-level Stackelberg game played between multiple leaders and followers. This procedure guaranteed the convergence to a Stackelberg equilibrium. We also provide the analysis of the convergence and the rate of convergence to Stackelberg equilibrium point.

It is assumed that a multi-agent system is composed of several types of agents, sometimes also called species. The goal of each agent is to maximize its own payoff. Agent-species compete for space applying locally a mechanism of evolutionary selection, where the payoff is considered as fitness. As a result of the competition, more profitable species replace less profitable. While agents act locally to maximize their incomes, we study conditions of emerging of global collective behavior measured by the average total payoff of players of which they are not aware of. We show that collective behavior can emerge in a fully distributed way based on achieving a Nash equilibrium if some conditions are fulfilled. We also show the significance of the introduced “income sharing mechanism” in the self-optimization process providing a high level of global collective behavior.},

  abstract     = {The cross-correlation function appears in many fields with time-series data, and speeding up the computation is essential given that the availability of massive observational data has increased with the improvement of measurement technologies. The cross-correlation function can be calculated as a matrix–matrix product, and a significant speed-up can be expected utilizing Tensor Cores, which are matrix–matrix product acceleration units of recent NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). In this research, we target the TensorFloat-32 Tensor Core operations, which are available in the Ampere, Ada, and Hopper architectures. We develop a fast calculation method considering the characteristics of the cross-correlation function and Tensor Cores that increases arithmetic intensity and improve upon the performance of the matrix–matrix product baseline. On the A100 40GB SXM GPU, our method achieved a high performance of 54 TFLOPS in the performance measurement assuming seismic interferometry using actual data. Furthermore, with data-access latency hiding algorithms, we obtained performance of 191 TFLOPS on the H100 PCIe GPU, corresponding to a further 3.6-fold speedup from the proposed method without latency hiding on the A100 40GB SXM GPU. The accuracy of the calculation result is sufficient compared to the 64-bit floating-point calculation, indicating the applicability of Tensor Core operations using TensorFloat-32 for scientific calculations. Our proposed method is expected to make it possible to utilize a large amount of data more effectively in many fields.

Therefore, parameter tuning is typically necessary, at least to some extent.

A solution to this issue is offered by parameter control schemes that properly adjust the parameters during the algorithm run. This paper presents a new self-adaptive parameter control scheme, which is based on the storage of a few previously successful values for each population member separately. These are then subsequently used to generate new and better-fitting parameter values with the aim of maintaining an effective search throughout the algorithm run. The highly competitive results obtained on challenging benchmark functions of different dimensionality suggest its viability and robustness. This is further corroborated by the promising results obtained on the problem of automatic radial basis function network design for classification needs.},

  abstract     = {The Monte Carlo method (MCM) is one of the most accurate methods for calculating the optical characteristics of spatial targets. However, there are two limitations when using the MCM to build a dataset for a priori phenomenology. One is the multiple scattering effects. The other is photon number configurations in multiple random links (e.g., various irradiance sources, spatiotemporal spectra, complex geometries and structures). Without a reasonable photon number configuration, the dataset&#39;s granularity , image quality and computation time will not be compatible. The present work proposes a semi-analytical Monte Carlo radiative transfer model (Semi-MCM), which offers a low order of magnitude time complexity when calculating the scattering properties of the complex spatial target. First, the Semi-MCM was validated theoretically and procedurally. Subsequently, the efficiency of the Semi-MCM is evaluated. The Semi-MCM show a standard double-log-linear relationship between the time complexity and uncertainty. The correlation coefficient is greater than 0.9987. It implies that time complexity can be represented analytically by the single point estimate during calculation. On this basis, the number of photons required for each probabilistic link can be predicted and allocated adaptively to achieve coordination of the probabilistic links. Finally, the distortion from multiple scattering effects is analyzed in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The distortion caused by self-emission is non-negligible, with PSNR in the range of 20–40 dB. For the far-field illumination processes of Lambert, the PSNR is in the range of 30–40 dB, i.e., the distortion is perceptible but acceptable.

  abstract     = {In this research, the three-dimensional implementation of the Lees–Edwards boundary condition is presented and discussed for the simulation of particulate suspensions. The proposed method is based on the lattice Boltzmann and smoothed profile method for flow and particle motion simulation . This approach eliminates Galilean invariance errors when the particle crosses Lees–Edwards boundaries. Two important issues of particle crossing shear boundaries and corners of a computational domain are discussed in detail. Forces and torques evaluation for a particle that crosses boundaries need special treatment due to the division of the particle into two, four, and eight parts as it traverses one edge, and the intersection of two and three boundaries, respectively. The validation of the present method is performed by using some benchmarks. Furthermore, due to the ability of this algorithm to perform in parallel mode, a CUDA code based on the GPU platform is used to accelerate the computations. The results show that the parallel processing of this method on GPU significantly accelerates the computations.},

SSGs model real-life security scenarios as non-cooperative games between the security forces (e.g. secret service, police) and the attackers (e.g. terrorists, military groups). The paper proposes a novel coevolutionary method (CoEvoSG) for solving SSGs that develops two competing populations of player strategies, in the process inspired by biological evolution, so as to approximate the Stackelberg Equilibrium (game solution). CoEvoSG is experimentally evaluated on over 800 test instances of three types of games with various characteristics. The results and their detailed analysis presented in the paper prove the CoEvoSG ability to repetitively find optimal or close to optimal solutions with time scalability excelling the state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, CoEvoSG is capable of calculating solutions for games bigger and more complex than ever before.

The setting considers how to update existing node representations from structural graph embedding methods when some additional node attributes are given. Recently, Graph Embedding RetroFitting (GERF) Bielak et al. was proposed to this end – a method that delivers a compound node embedding that follows both the graph structure and attribute space similarity. It uses existing structural node embeddings and retrofits them according to the neighborhood defined by the node attributes space (by optimizing the invariance loss and the attribute neighbor loss). In order to refine GERF method, we aim to include the simplification of the objective function and provide an algorithm for automatic hyperparameter estimation, whereas the experimental scenario is extended by a more robust hyperparameter search for all considered methods and a link prediction problem for evaluation of node embeddings.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are nowadays an indispensable component of production lines in smart manufacturing. Managing the fleet of AGVs covers not only the delegation of operational tasks but also the monitoring of AGVs activity and health condition by applying tailored Machine Learning-based methods to detect anomalies in various signals gathered by edge IoT devices mounted on board. Detecting anomalies requires appropriate prediction of selected signals based on multiple types of sensor readings. Momentary energy consumption is one of the signals that can indicate abnormal states in AGVs. In this paper, we show that the prediction of this signal can be improved with the Federated Learning (FL) approach that involves exchanging experience gained by particular AGVs. This paper significantly extends the conference paper (Shubyn et al., 2022) with the new multi-round approach to building global prediction models and recent experiments on real data streams produced by AGVs designed by the AIUT company. The results of our experiments prove that in the AGV operational environments with distributed knowledge Federated Learning performs better than traditional centralized approaches and that frequent synchronization of experience may lead to better prediction quality.},

The framework utilizes the heteroscedastic uncertainty of the ML predictions as well as the residual-based uncertainty of the observations and integrates the two through the technique of optimal interpolation. The quantification of the respective uncertainties is directly included within the framework itself. As an application example, we test the performance of POI using a multi-scale Lorenz 96 chaos system with various added noise levels. The ML model is based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and the technique of Monte Carlo (MC) dropout is adopted for the uncertainty quantification. The computational results show that the POI implementation can lead to improved predictions of the state of the system with less uncertainty and it can also filter the added level of noises effectively when the historical data are reasonably accurate. However, if the noise level is high, using the updated POI predictions as sequential inputs for the next time step does not guarantee better performance than using the real-time observations directly. Furthermore, under very noisy conditions, the average ML predictions after the MC dropout can already reduce the noises substantially, and these predictions might even be better than the POI updates. Therefore, the POI implementation (or data assimilation in general) is not recommended with a ML-based surrogate model in a noisy environment .},

The convergence analysis of the proposed numerical technique demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed scheme. The uniqueness and existence, regularity and stability analysis of the Lane–Emden PDDE is discussed and investigated thoroughly by providing sufficient theorems. Due to the non-availability of abundant literature, the new approach is implemented and tested against existing approaches on standard and newly constructed nonlinear examples.

  abstract     = {Graph embedding aims to learn low-dimension node representations which can be applied to various downstream tasks, such as node clustering and node classification . When it comes to heterogeneous graphs, things get more challenging as the graph contains richer semantic and structural information. Most existing heterogeneous graph embedding methods usually convert the graph into several homogenous graphs, and then use the manual label information to train the model. However, Graph neural networks (GNNs) mostly require task-dependent labels to learn representations, which is even more costly for heterogeneous graphs. Furthermore, these models treat each converted homogenous graph independently while ignoring the inter-layer informative relational clues among the multi-graphs. Inspired by recent advances of Deep Graph Infomax and multi-view learning in homogeneous graph embedding, we propose an unsupervised graph neural network called CL-MNE that adopts multi-view contrastive learning and multilayer information fusion for heterogeneous graph embedding. The proposed model learns rich local and global graph information by maximizing the local-global mutual information from adjacency matrix and diffusion matrix two different views. Moreover, a variant model CL-MNE reg , which provides embedding information of all graph layers, is constructed by addingg a consensus regularization to the CL-MNE. Experiments of node clustering and classification tasks on mainstream datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two models.},

The phase inversion property concerning a single parameter, which is very rare for hyperchaotic dynamical systems , is observed in the proposed system. For integer order, the attractor projection shows that there exists a torus attractor, which is attracting all the nearby trajectories towards it. Moreover, the system is theoretically, numerically, and graphically examined from a fractional perspective. The fixed point notions are used to examine the existence of the solution of the proposed hyperchaotic system under the Caputo operator. The system is also studied numerically in fractional sense via a newly introduced numerical technique based on the Newton polynomials. We analyze that with a decrease in fractional order, the system shows a cone-type spiral behavior in which the amplitude of the oscillations decreases and the system tends towards E 0 E0 . In addition, coexisting fixed point attractors are obtained through numerical simulations at a few fractional orders.},

  abstract     = {Nodes in a complex network are not all equally important. Depending on the purpose of the network, some nodes are considered more important, or more influential , more central , than the others. Identifying these influential, or central nodes, is a crucial issue, and of great significance not only for understanding the network’s structural property, but also for its practical applications. Some commonly used measures to identify the influential nodes include Betweenness Centrality ( B C BC ), Closeness Centrality ( C C CC ), Degree Centrality ( D C DC ), Information Centrality ( I C IC ), Load Centrality ( L C LC ), Eigenvector Centrality ( E C EC ), and so on. In different contexts, various notions of distances have been used when a node’s centrality is evaluated. In Brandes and Fleischer (2005), Brandes and Fleischer used resistance distance to calculate current-flow Betweenness Centrality ( B C R BCR ) and current-flow Closeness Centrality ( C C R CCR ). The resistance distance was used because it can more comprehensively reflect the communication cost between two nodes by taking into account all possible paths between them. Inspired by the work in Brandes and Fleischer (2005), in this paper we use resistance distance to calculate a group of resistive centralities including resistive Degree Centrality ( D C R DCR ), resistive Eigenvector Centrality ( E C R ECR ), resistive Harmonic Centrality ( H C R HCR ), and resistive Eccentricity Centrality ( E C C R ECCR ). Based on the resistive centralities, we propose a new centrality ranking scheme named RCWTA , which hybridizes resistive centrality with classic centrality and weighted TOPSIS ranking method to identify influential nodes . Simulation experiments for 12 real-world networks are conducted and demonstrated to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed resistive centrality measures . The experimental results indicate that all the resistive centrality measures outperform their corresponding classical counterparts except for E C R ECR , with H C R HCR showing the best performance.},

The Nvidia deep neural network (cuDnn) library is the most effective implementation of deep learning (DL) algorithms for GPUs. One of the most common techniques for improving the efficiency of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models is weight pruning and quantisation. There are two main types of pruning: structural and non-structural. The first enables much easier acceleration on many type of accelerators, but with structural it is difficult to achieve a sparsity level and accuracy as high as that obtained with the non-structural version. Non-structural pruning with retraining can generate the weight tensors up to ∼ 90\% ∼90\% or more of sparsity in some deep CNN models . In this article, the pruning algorithm is presented which achieve high sparsity levels without drop in accuracy. In the next stage, the linear and non-linear quantisation is adapted for further reductions in time and memory footprint . Additionally, this work presents real CNN models pruned with high sparsities in which some subset of layers can have comparable or better efficiency than cuDnn by using a direct sparse method. Finally, it shows sparse CNN-based architectures with reduced precision which can be more efficient than CuDnn library.},

CDLP is a bilevel mathematical model, where a planner locates various types of defense facilities for stopping a offender from reaching a critical vertex called core in the network. Due to the NP-hardness of the CDLP, RNN is implemented to ﬁnd satisfactory solutions on four small-sized, two medium-sized and two larger-sized examples of problem. The numerical experiments show that RNN is able to produce promising results with good execution time and precision when compared with the best previous methods including tabu search (TS), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and hybridization of TS with Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (HTS) and hybridization of ICA with BFGS algorithm (HICA). The objective values of RNN show that this method stops the attacker at a further distance from the core in comparison with other methods. As well, to validate the efficiency of the proposed RNN, statistical criteria are considered and results are analyzed. For small-sized examples, the computational experiments show that the RNN can obtain solutions as the same as exact approaches but in a shorter runtime.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an efficient and economic framework to generate reduced order models (ROMs) with Petrov–Galerkin projection based on hybrid snapshot simulation to extraordinarily enhance the speedup and enlighten the representation of snapshot data in Semilinear Partial Differential Equations (Semilinear-PDEs). The total snapshot simulation is divided into multiple temporal intervals with the alternations in each interval between two types of models: the full order model (FOM) and the local ROM based on Petrov–Galerkin projection (ROM-PG). During the snapshot training process, the simulation can determine the model type on-the-fly by the switch criteria introduced in Bai and Wang (2022) and continuously update the subspace by incremental singular value decomposition (iSVD) to preserve the subspace representation. In numerical experiments, we consider two typical Semilinear-PDEs to illustrate the proposed method successfully in finite volume element discretization : Semilinear-Parabolic Equation (Semilinear-Parabolics) and Semilinear-Convection–Diffusion Equation (Semilinear-ConvDiffs). It is found that the subspace updating is directly related to the POD numbers, the parameter μ μ ( μ p μp in Semilinear-Parabolics or μ c μc in Semilinear-ConvDiffs). The tolerance of criteria also significantly affects the performance of computational acceleration. The quantitative analyses of the criteria and the brief discussion of stability about the framework are also performed to clarify the model switch and stability condition, respectively, due to no detailed discussion in the previous work (Bai and Wang 2022).},

  abstract     = {Coevolving network systems provide a framework for modeling the diffusion of social and biological contagions on networks, where network structure is allowed to coevolve with the contagion dynamics, describing phenomena such as the spread of epidemics on social networks where individuals rewire their connectivity to avoid infection. Along with direct computational simulations, coevolving network systems are often formulated in terms of systems of ordinary differential equations in their descriptive statistics. The differential equation approach reduces the computational burden of analyzing the systems, but deriving equations becomes difficult as the underlying model becomes more complicated and the desire for accuracy increases. We present a sparse model identification approach that learns the nonlinear differential equations for coevolving network systems using data from computational simulations. Using this approach, we construct a data-driven system of equations for a coevolving SIS model that reproduces system behavior in both temporal evolution and dependence of steady states on system parameters. Furthermore, we also present the development of a numerical differentiation scheme that performs better for our application than the standard ones in use.},

Dynamic cross-sectional images of ventilation and perfusion can be produced in real time with fast algorithms from measured voltage data arising from current applied on electrodes placed around the circumference of the patient’s chest. The D-bar method is a direct (non-iterative) reconstruction algorithm for EIT that uses equations of inverse scattering to independently reconstruct the conductivity at each point in the region of interest. However, this nonlinear reconstruction method has a computational complexity that makes real-time imaging a challenge. At the same time, it has the attributes that it does not require successive solutions of the forward problem, as is the case with iterative methods, and it is trivially parallelizable in the spatial variable. Here, we present a novel multithreaded implementation of the D-bar method with a front-end MATLAB /Octave program interfaced with C code that uses the pthreads library . The implementation is analyzed on several different platforms with concurrent threads ranging from 2 to 32 for spatial grids of several sizes. We demonstrate that on a CPU with many cores , very high frame rates (50 frames/s) with high resolution (6000 grid points) are achievable, and on a single AMD CPU real-time reconstructions (faster than 30 frames/s) are achieved with this implementation using 10 or more threads on a grid of 1969 points.},

In particular, we consider matrices with Kronecker sum structure, which arise from problems admitting a tensor product representation. The method is based on quadrature approximations of the integral form of the φ − φ− functions combined with a scaling and modified squaring method. Owing to the Kronecker sum representation , only actions of 1D matrix exponentials are needed at each quadrature node and assembly of the full matrix can be avoided. Additionally, we derive a priori bounds for the quadrature error, which show that, as expected by classical theory, the rate of convergence of our method is supergeometric. Guided by our analysis, we construct a fast and robust method for estimating the optimal scaling factor and number of quadrature nodes that minimizes the total cost for a prescribed error tolerance. We investigate the performance of our algorithm by solving several linear and semilinear time-dependent problems in 2D and 3D. The results show that our method is accurate and orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art.},

Using PRANDTL-REUSS equation under Hencky proportional loading condition, we develop an elastic-plastic torsion governing equation that can be applied to materials with arbitrary multilinear hardening forms. The edge-based smoothed finite element method is applied to solve the boundary value problem of the above equation. In addition, the incremental scheme is used to calculate the plastic torque. Using the Lagrange interpolation method, the Mises stress is calculated by calculating the gradient in the cell. The nodal stresses are obtained by averaging the stresses at the centroid of the cells. After each load step, the overall domain is divided into elastic and plastic zones according to the yield stresses of the material, and then different governing equations are applied in the different zones.

The classical K-shell algorithm fails to provide the promising results in practical situations because of the resolution and performance problems. Therefore, this paper proposes a new scheme named generalized degree decomposition (GDD) algorithm for the identification of important nodes. In our scheme, first, each edge is assigned with hidden weight to describe its potential contribution to the network. Then, the generalized degree of each node is calculated based on the weights of the edges connected the node and its neighbors. At last, each node is attached with a corresponding index according to its stripping stage in the network pruning process. A large number of experiments are performed in eight real networks, and the findings demonstrate that the proposed scheme optimizes the performance and resolution.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of automatic music generation in the form of chord voicings, which is an important part of melody harmonization, with the use of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), based on the rules derived from music theory and practice. The rules, whose role is to ensure the fulfillment of both the formal requirements of chord voicings and its less-formalized aesthetic requirements are encoded in the fitness function of EA. The fitness function is composed of several modules, each of which consists of smaller parts corresponding to the implemented music rules. The above modular design allows for flexible modification and extension of this function. The way the fitness function is constructed and tuned for better chord voicings quality is discussed in the context of music theory and technical EA implementation. In particular, we show how could generated voices be modeled by means of adjusting the relevance of particular fitness function components or extended by adding new components to the fitness function. The proposed algorithm is tested on two types of music: tonal and modal. Although tonal and modal chord voicings are significantly different, the achieved results (assessed by a human expert) indicate that the obtained solutions are both technically and aesthetically correct (i.e. they adhere to the theoretical rules and are nice to listen to).

In this paper, we present OCMRN (Overlapping Communities in Multi-Relational Networks), an overlapping community detection method in multi-relational directional networks. A semi-supervised method is used in the training phase of this algorithm which allows determining the importance of each layer to shape communities. The proposed method is evaluated on nine real and eight synthetic datasets and is compared with different algorithms. Well-known evaluation criteria are used to compare overlapping and non-overlapping communities resulting from various algorithms. The high accuracy of the results obtained from the proposed model suggests this algorithm can be used with high confidence for community detection of multi-relational directional networks to find overlapping communities.},

Some traditional models used to solve the influence maximization problem only consider the maximum propagation range that the seed node set can reach but ignore the cost difference between the potential candidate nodes. This is not characteristic of real-world network behavior. Thus, in response to this research gap, a multi-objective optimization model based on maximizing influence spreading while minimizing cost is proposed in this paper. On the basis of maintaining the effective characteristics of non-dominated sorting moth flame optimization, the diversity weight and mutation mechanism are integrated into the algorithm to maintain the population diversity in the exploration stage. The evolutionary rules of the original moth flame optimization are redesigned to meet the desired needs of multi-objective influence optimization.

  abstract     = {Osteocytes in vivo are subjected to fluid shear stress and respond by initiating downstream mechano-transduction. Our previous studies demonstrated that the reticulate spectrin-based membrane skeleton (Spectrin-MS) beneath the cell membrane plays an important role in the mechanical property maintenance, as well as in the mechano-transduction of osteocytes. But how does the gridding extent of the spectrin-MS affect the mechanical transmission inside the cell remains unclear. To address this issue, a 3D finite element model (FEM) of osteocytes containing Spectrin-MS of varied gridding extent (representing polymerized/normal/depolymerized state) was established. The stress-strain responses of different components of the osteocyte to 15 dyn/cm 2 fluid shear stress were obtained. Results showed that the depolymerized Spectrin-MS provided less support for the cell membrane and thus led more membrane deformation under shear stress. The depolymerization of Spectrin-MS also altered the mechanical transmission pathway inside the cell, and ultimately increased the stress transmitted to the nucleus. A compensative effect between the Spectrin-MS and cytoskeleton could be found in the mechanical transmission. These results indicate that the spectrin-MS is not only acting as a structural support, but also as a connecting linkage between the cell membrane and cytoskeleton. Future research of the mechanotransduction of osteocytes may benefit from considerations of the integration of the Spectrin-MS.},

  abstract     = {The rational choice of sampling points is crucial for supervised machine learning algorithms. Adaptive sampling ensures optimal distribution of points in the multidimensional space and provides higher approximation accuracy with respect to the random sampling. Most approaches to the adaptive sampling maximize the function evaluating the compromise between local exploitation and global exploration. However, existing accurate methods suffer from long sampling time, while fast methods are not accurate. Only a few reported methods are available as open source implementations. We introduce a fast adaptive sampling algorithm with accuracy comparable to that of the best-known adaptive sampling methods and demonstrate a comparative study of different approaches to minimization of approximation errors. The method scales linearly with number of sampling points and supports batch generation of new points. The optimization function is the integral norm of an approximation error, the Lp norm, where the norm parameter p regulates sampling, inclining it either towards local exploitation or, conversely, global exploration. The small Lp norm is achieved by reducing the function approximation error and the size of the region with large variation after adding a new sampling point. Our solution is similar to kriging in terms of the choice between local exploitation and global exploration. The difference is in error estimation which depends on the values of the function in sampling points in contrast to homoscedastic variance estimate of kriging. Fast and accurate adaptive sampling is of interest to supervised machine learning tasks such as training a model interatomic potential, quantitative analysis of spectra, self-driving chemical laboratories, and many others. The source code for the new adaptive sampling algorithm MinLpE is available on Github and is distributed under a LGPL license.},

Such data dependency vanishes when one considers the Laplacian as the sum of n independent one-dimensional kernels, so that computation and communication can be naturally overlapped with nonblocking communications.

  abstract     = {The technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been growing rapidly in recent years. To achieve highly autonomous flight capability, collision-free path generation becomes a key research topic. However, for a large-scale terrain map, an efficient path searching algorithm is always a challenging problem. Based on the Goal-bias Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (GB-RRT*) together with the aid of a bidirectional search technique, in this paper, a new constrained path planning algorithm, called Parent Revisited Goal and Parent Bias RRT* (PRGPB-RRT*), is proposed. Three major objectives are considered as the development benchmark: 1). shorter total distance, 2). smoother flight path, and 3). high computational efficiency. To meet different task requirements, a dynamic path planning method is investigated to diminish the high costs due to large-scale environments and keep track of the changing destination by finding local target points. In addition, unknown object avoidance is an essential part of flight path planning . As a consequence, the Fitting-Octree is presented to partition the point clouds into multiple cubes to represent the obstacles precisely. Moreover, the method of grouping point clouds into clusters effectively increases the efficiency of the implementation under a large number of obstacles. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified by a real-world 3D large-scale point cloud map. Experiments show that the proposed method successfully enhances the path generation efficiency as well as the trajectory smoothness. Moreover, the presented PRGPB-RRT* can be applied to different intelligent UAVs subject to flight kinematics constrain.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy stands out as one of the common neurological diseases. The neural activity of the brain is observed using electroencephalography (EEG), which allows the diagnosis of epilepsy disease. The aim of this study is to create a combined deep learning model that automatically detects epileptic seizure activity, detection of the epileptic region and classifies EEG signals by using images representing the time-frequency components of the time series EEG signal and numerical values of the raw EEG signals. In the study, 3 different public datasets, CHB-MIT, Bern-Barcelona and Bonn EEG records were used. This study presents a combined model using the time sequence of EEG signals and time-frequency-image transformations of time-dependent EEG signals. CWT and STFT methods were used to convert signals to images. Two models were created separately with the images created by CWT and STFT methods. In the Bonn dataset average accuracy rates of 99.07\%, 99.28\%, respectively, in binary classifications and 97.60\% and 98.56\%, respectively, in multiple classifications were obtained with scalogram and spectrogram images. In the Bern-Barcelona and CHB-MIT datasets, 95.46\% and 96.23\% accuracy rates were obtained, respectively. The data combinations brought together in 3 different combinations with the Bonn dataset were underwent to 8-fold cross validation and average accuracy rates of 99.21\% (± 0.56), 99.50\% (± 0.45), and 98.84\% (± 1.58) were obtained. The model we created can detect whether there is epileptic seizure activity in EEG data, detection of the epileptic region and classify EEG signals with a high success rate.},

The proposed DEOSA algorithm is applied to 18 well-known UCI datasets and compared with a wide range of algorithms. The results are statistically validated using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Friedman test. In order to test the scalability and robustness of DEOSA, it is additionally tested over seven high-dimensional Microarray datasets and 25 binary Knapsack problems .

The average number of steps it takes to get from a given vertex to another is called the hitting time. For polyhedra with some degree of symmetry, there are groups of vertices that have the same hitting time from a given starting vertex. These groups form symmetrically equivalent layers within the polyhedron. This paper explores a number of novel approaches to calculating these layers based on Euclidean distance , minimum length paths, and the number of edges of each face of the polyhedron. After the hitting times have been found, the equivalent resistance between any two vertices of the network is easily calculated. The physical relevance of this problem is discussed, a comparison with other approaches to solving it is made and some open questions are mentioned.},

In the proposed strategy, the deterministic reduced basis vectors (RBVs) are adopted to approximate the random temperature response, and the thermal conductivity of the random nonlinear heat conduction matrix in the RBVs space is decoupled from the geometric characteristic matrix (GCM). The computational efficiency of solving the reduced random nonlinear heat conduction models can be enhanced by implementing these two technologies. The large coefficient of variation and the small coefficient of variation stochastic heat conduction problems, respectively, are addressed by the two non-intrusive statistical methods, i.e., the quasi-Monte Carlo method (QMCM) based on number theory and the modified stochastic perturbation method (MSPM). These two methods necessitate deterministic analysis and are easily integrated into the model reduction method. In four numerical instances, the selection of RBVs, the influence of the nonlinear term on the random temperature response, and the accuracy and efficiency of the two non-intrusive statistical moment methods are discussed. The numerical results highlight that the model reduction strategy based on the decoupling of thermal conductivity and GCM, in conjunction with the QMCM and the MSPM, enables the analysis of stochastic nonlinear transient heat conduction problems with a large coefficient of variation and a small coefficient of variation, respectively.},

To overcome this problem, the paper proposes the Expanding Path RRT* (EP-RRT*) based on heuristic sampling in path expansion area. By combining the greedy heuristic of Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT)-Connect, EP-RRT* quickly explores the environment in order to find a feasible path, and then expands it to obtain the heuristic sampling area. It iteratively searches in the heuristic sampling area which also changes with the continuous optimization of the path, and finally obtains an optimal or suboptimal path connecting starting point and target point. Comparisons of EP-RRT* with RRT* and Informed RRT* in four simulation environments verify that EP-RRT* improves the node utilization, accelerates the convergence rate, and obtains a better path for the same number of iterations.},

The current SC models are mostly customer-centric, which ignore to a great extent the interests of CMfg service platform (CMSP) and cloud service providers (CSPs). However, all of the three roles involved are indispensable in the CMfg system, only by taking all their interests into account simultaneously can the CMfg system get stable development and extensive use. To this end, after analyzing the core interests of the tri-stakeholders, a three-objective SC (TOSC) model is proposed considering the quality of service (QoS), sustainability and cooperativity at the same time in this paper. Then, an enhanced multi-objective jellyfish search (EMOJS) is developed to solve the complex TOSC model efficiently, in which four improvement strategies are designed to enhance its search capacity, respectively are the elitist improvement by Cauchy mutation, the modification for position update, the adjustment for time control mechanism and the interspecific synergistic mechanism. Finally, 30 benchmark functions and TOSC problems with different scales are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. Experiment results suggest that the TOSC model can well balance the interests of tri-stakeholders in CMfg and the EMOJS is superior to the common-used algorithms in overall performance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an optimization control of pollution subject to the convection diffusion equations is developed and analyzed. The optimization objective function is to consider the pollution effects for minimizing the weighted derivation between simulated concentrations and allowable concentrations at observation sites and the costs of emission reductions, pollution taxes, and the cost related to layout of pipelines. The proposed optimal control problem is defined on the multiple observation and polluting points and is constrained by the convection diffusion equations. We analyze this optimization problem from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint and prove the existence of a solution of the pollution optimal control. We build the numerical optimal control approach by a second-order improved splitting upwind finite volume method to solve the convection diffusion equations and by the constrained difference evolution (DE) algorithm to compute the optimization procedure. Three numerical experiments are investigated, where the first one aims at searching the optimal disposal fluxes while minimizing concentration deviation and reduction cost, the other two are to minimize the whole economical costs that contain waste water treatment cost, pipeline layout cost and pollution taxation by finding the optimal effluent concentration of waste water. The developed optimal control is efficient and it can be applied in applications.},

Here, by intrinsic structure we mean, regarding the dynamics of the DDS under observation, the feature of resulting from the ‘cooperation’ of the dynamics of two or more smaller DDS. The intrinsic structure is described by an equation over DDS which represents a hypothesis over the phenomenon under observation. The pipeline allows solving such an equation, i.e. , validating the hypothesis over the phenomenon, as far the asymptotic behaviour and the number of states of the DDS under observation are concerned. The results are about the soundness and completeness of the pipeline and they are obtained by exploiting the algebraic setting for DDS introduced in Dennunzio et al. (2018).},

Although BA is easy to implement and efficient in solving some continuous and discrete problems, it has some shortcomings such as premature convergence and low precision. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper presents a new bat algorithm (denoted as CABA) based on a novel topology. In this algorithm, by integrating the idea of cellular automaton , a novel topology is designed first, which is used to update the velocity of each bat. This topology can help bats to use the information provided by some good neighbors, which means it can help BA to reduce the risk of falling into local optimum. Second, in order to alleviate the difficulty of parameter adjustment in local search equations, a new local search equation is presented based on the number of iterations rather than loudness. Third, the convergence analysis is given based on martingale theory. The computational complex of the proposed algorithm is also discussed. Final, three comparison experiments and two practical optimization problems are conducted to test the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

A key novel aspect of this work is the phase-field mapping method developed to track interfaces (e.g. grain boundaries) in a multi-phase system (e.g. electrode microstructure) undergoing large deformation. The elastic material response is modelled employing a polyconvex, cubic anisotropic material law which has been implemented in the multiphase-field context and validated using benchmark cases. The performance of this framework is demonstrated through representative numerical examples. The model is well-suited for the simulation of multi-crystalline samples where different phases may possess distinct elastic properties and anisotropies which is shown exemplarily for the electrode calendering process at the nano-scale. Additionally, Kelvin–Voigt visco-elasticity is included in the model which allows for simulation of large deformation in an aerogel under compressive load and, furthermore, enables treatment of fluid–structure interaction within a common configuration. Finally, a broad outlook of technical applications as well as model extensions is given.},

To explore the role of different ecological effects like fear effect, additional food and anti-predator behaviour of prey in the presence memory on an ecological system, in this paper we have proposed a two-dimensional prey–predator model and formulated mathematically using a system of two fractional order differential equations. Here the Caputo sense fractional derivative is used to construct the fractional order differential equations. The existence–uniqueness, non-negativity and boundedness of system solutions have been established. The detailed mathematical and graphical analysis for the feasibility of different equilibrium points and their analytical conditions for local asymptotic stability has been studied. The sufficient parametric conditions for the global stability of non-trivial equilibrium points are investigated. The Hopf bifurcation analysis of the system around the coexistence equilibrium point is derived in terms of system parameters. Using numerical simulations we have established that the memory effect can stabilize the system from an unstable periodic situation and makes the above-considered ecological effects more positively effective.},

It is especially true in the context of Global Software Development projects, where developers with specific skills and knowledge often need to be identified. In this sense, searching for essential members is a valuable task, as they are fundamental to the evolution of the network. This article proposes a broad solution for syntactic and semantic analysis in social networks in the Global Software Development context.

  abstract     = {The present study focuses on the control of an unsteady vortex flow regime and flow-induced forces on the tandem circular cylinder using the splitter plate-based technique at a Reynolds number ( Re ) of 100. The in-house developed flexible forcing immersed boundary lattice Boltzmann method (FFIBLBM) solver is employed for these two-dimensional numerical simulations. Three distinct tandem cylinder spacing is considered: small spacing (G/D = 2.0), medium spacing (G/D = 3.5), and large spacing (G/D = 5.0), where G is the center-to-center distance between the cylinders having diameter D. For each spacing, the effectiveness of two different configurations of splitter plates are examined: splitter plate attached to the upstream cylinder (TC-SPU) only and splitter plate attached to the downstream cylinder (TC-SPD) only. The arrangement and length of the splitter plate have a significant effect on the suppression of vortex shedding and reduction of flow-induced force on the cylinders. The result shows that the TC-SPD is beneficial for small spacing, yielding a drag reduction of 0.58\% and 0.05\% for the upstream and downstream cylinders. At the same time, both the TC-SPU and TC-SPD configurations are useful for suppressing the flow unsteadiness for medium spacing. However, the drag reduction in TC-SPD is more. In this case, the drag of the upstream and downstream cylinders is reduced by 1.4\% and 247\%, respectively. At large spacing, the TC-SPU arrangement is suitable for the suppression of vortex shedding from both cylinders. The corresponding drag reduction for the upstream and downstream cylinders is 13.7\% and 89.2\%, respectively.},

Any object that is reachable from a cluster initiator and has a local density similar to the local density of the cluster initiator is assigned the same cluster.

However, the centrality evaluation method of a single-layer network cannot guarantee the accuracy of the measurement results on a multilayer network. Most of the existing methods for node centrality in multilayer networks ignore the effect of network interlayer relationships on the importance of nodes. Thereby, the problem of missing information between layers of multilayer networks occurs in the calculation process, resulting in inaccurate assessment results or differences between nodes that are too small to determine their significance. This paper proposes a new centrality measure for multilayer networks, which measures the importance of nodes by calculating the weighted local structure entropy of nodes. The proposed method not only considers the importance of connections within node layers, but also adds the influence of the number of network layers between node layers. Through the empirical analysis of real multilayer networks of different types and sizes, such as the Hubei transportation multilayer network, Lazega-Law-Firm multilayer network, CS-Aarhus multilayer network, CKM-Physicians-Innovation multilayer network, it is proved that the proposed method is optimal and general.},

The CAMS algorithm is made publicly available in a library with bindings to C and Python. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can deliver up to two times the speedup compared with that of classical Revolve . Moreover, we discuss the utilization of the CAMS library in mature scientific computing libraries and demonstrate the ease of using it in an adjoint workflow.

  abstract     = {Traditional classification techniques usually classify data samples according to the physical organization, such as similarity, distance, and distribution, of the data features, which lack a general and explicit mechanism to represent data classes with semantic data patterns. Therefore, the incorporation of data pattern formation in classification is still a challenge problem. Meanwhile, data classification techniques can only work well when data features present high level of similarity in the feature space within each class. Such a hypothesis is not always satisfied, since, in real-world applications, we frequently encounter the following situation: On one hand, the data samples of some classes (usually representing the normal cases) present well defined patterns; on the other hand, the data features of other classes (usually representing abnormal classes) present large variance, i.e., low similarity within each class. Such a situation makes data classification a difficult task. In this paper, we present a novel solution to deal with the above mentioned problems based on the mesostructure of a complex network, built from the original data set. Specifically, we construct a core–periphery network from the training data set in such way that the normal class is represented by the core sub-network and the abnormal class is characterized by the peripheral sub-network. The testing data sample is classified to the core class if it gets a high coreness value; otherwise, it is classified to the periphery class. The proposed method is tested on an artificial data set and then applied to classify x-ray images for COVID-19 diagnosis, which presents high classification precision. In this way, we introduce a novel method to describe data pattern of the data “without pattern” through a network approach, contributing to the general solution of classification.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a parallel adaptive clustering (PAC) algorithm to automatically classify data while simultaneously choosing a suitable number of classes. Clustering is an important tool for data analysis and understanding in a broad set of areas including data reduction, pattern analysis, and classification. However, the requirement to specify the number of clusters in advance and the computational burden associated with clustering large sets of data persist as challenges in clustering. We propose a new parallel adaptive clustering (PAC) algorithm that addresses these challenges by adaptively computing the number of clusters and leveraging the power of parallel computing . The algorithm clusters disjoint subsets of the data on parallel computation threads . We develop regularized set k k -means to efficiently cluster the results from the parallel threads . A refinement step further improves the clusters. The PAC algorithm offers the capability to adaptively cluster data sets which change over time by reusing the information from previous time steps to decrease computation. We provide theoretical analysis and numerical experiments to characterize the performance of the method, validate its properties, and demonstrate the computational efficiency of the method.},

  abstract     = {The Metropolis algorithm is widely used in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in diverse areas of science and technology, especially for problems formulated in terms of lattice models. A common situation is the necessity to perform long sequential processing, e.g., when looking for equilibrium states of distinct physical systems. Hence, even marginal increases in efficiency of the algorithm individual steps can lead to significant reductions in absolute execution runtimes. Usual speedup procedures include hardware updates, parallelization (when possible) and sampling methods. Here we follow a different direction in trying to decrease the full execution times of MC approaches: algorithmic optimization. We show that the algorithms can be improved by implementing relatively few and simple changes in their organization and structure. First, we discuss some refinements for the pseudo-random number generator, addressing the broadly employed Mersenne-Twister algorithm (MT19937-64). Second, we develop a protocol to precalculate the Boltzmann factor, thereby avoiding the high cost of repeatedly calls to this exponential function (indeed, a very recurring step in the standard Metropolis method). To benchmark our proposals we choose the Ising model since it is one of the best known and more extensively studied problems in statistical physics. We consider the mentioned optimizations and different computational elements, like compilers and Hamiltonian variables ranges, testing the efficiency to obtain the system solutions. Our results suggest that the present set of improvement schemes—namely; decreasing the processing time for both, to generate a random number and to implement the one-flip Metropolis step; systematically enforcing optimization for the maximum quantity of algorithm structures accessing random numbers in a code; and considerably reducing the amount of required computations of the MC probabilistic actualization term—might constitute a relevant addition to the existing collection of expediting techniques in MC computational routines.},

  abstract     = {Designing a low-power neuromorphic circuit for the main units of the nervous system, neurons, plays a crucial role in neural engineering and neuroprosthesis . Due to the CA1 pyramidal neurons’ specific characteristics, these neurons have been a focus of research for several years. The Pinsky-Rinzel (P-R) model is a nonlinear two-compartmental model of the Hippocampal neuron that reveals various modes of firing patterns. In this paper, a low-power neuromorphic circuit for the Hippocampal P-R model is designed at 180 nm TSMC technology. Then, we analyze the recorded spiking responses from the neuroscience point of view. We also quantitatively compare the P-R model simulated in MATLAB with the proposed circuit in the Cadence simulator to show that the obtained responses are in good agreement. For the proposed circuit, the maximum energy consumption per spike is 97pJ/spike in the worst case. The effect of the device mismatch is also studied by performing a 200-point Monte Carlo simulation for different values of input currents. It is demonstrated that the proposed circuit is robust under process variation. Next, considering temporal coding, the ISI (inter-spike interval) and VP-d (Victor-Purpura distance) are extracted from the spike responses collected from the designed circuit. Finally, utilizing machine-learning algorithms, the applied input current to the circuit was accurately identified from the recorded spike trains. In this way, the spike patterns produced by the designed P-R circuit are diverse and consistent to be able to decode the input stimulus using typical machine learning classifiers. This supports the application of the proposed circuit in the hybrid neurocomputing systems and thus it can be integrated easily into large neuromorphic arrays in future works.},

  abstract     = {The box-counting (BC) algorithm is one of the most popular methods for calculating the fractal dimension (FD) of binary data. FD analysis has many important applications in the biomedical field, such as cancer detection from 2D computed axial tomography images, Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis from magnetic resonance 3D volumetric data , and consciousness states characterization based on 4D data extracted from electroencephalography (EEG) signals, among many others. Currently, these kinds of applications use data whose size and amount can be very large, with high computation times needed to calculate the BC of the whole datasets. In this study we present a very efficient parallel implementation of the BC algorithm for its execution on Graphics Processing Units (GPU). Our algorithm can process 2D, 3D and 4D data and we tested it on two platforms with different hardware configurations . The results showed speedups of up to 92.38 × (2D), 57.27 × (3D) and 75.73 × (4D) with respect to the corresponding CPU single-thread implementations of the same algorithm. Against an OpenMP multi-thread CPU implementation, our GPU algorithm achieved speedups of up to 16.12 × (2D), 6.86 × (3D) and 7.49 × (4D). We have also compared our algorithm to a previous GPU implementation of the BC algorithm in 3D, achieving a speedup of up to 4.79 × . Finally, as a practical application of our GPU BC algorithm a study comparing the FD of 4D data extracted from the EEGs of a schizophrenia patient and a healthy subject was performed. The computation time for processing 40 4D matrices was reduced from three hours (sequential CPU) to less than three minutes with our GPU algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The present computational study consists of the analysis of energy transport and entropy generation due to MHD mixed convective flow of non-Newtonian fluid filled inside the square cavity. The uniform, linear heat is provided to the fluid through the horizontal bottom and vertical side walls, while considering the top wall of the cavity as adiabatic. The governing flow equations are modeled for non-Newtonian bi-viscous fluid model by using the conservation laws. Galerkin-finite element method (FEM) is used to compute the solution of the governing problem and pressure is eliminated through penalty scheme. Furthermore, two-dimensional convective heat flow is identified by using the idea of Bejan heatlines. Numerical results are computed against wide range of pertinent flow control parameters such as bi-viscosity ( β ) (β) , Prandtl ( Pr ) (Pr) , Richardson ( Ri ) (Ri) , Reynolds ( Re ) (Re) and Grashof numbers ( Gr ) (Gr) . Results show that the fluid velocity, energy transfer rate and entropy generation are increased due to enhancement in bi-viscosity parameter ( β ) (β) . On the other side, the velocity and temperature are decreased by increasing Hartmann number ( Ha ) (Ha) , however the entropy generation increased. Hence, the minimum entropy generation is reported at β = 0.002 β=0.002 , Ha = 100 Ha=100 and Ri = 0.1 Ri=0.1 , respectively.},

  abstract     = {We describe how to use several machine learning techniques organized in a learning pipeline to segment and identify cell membrane structures from cryo electron tomograms. These tomograms are difficult to analyze with traditional segmentation tools. The learning pipeline in our approach starts from supervised learning via a special convolutional neural network trained with simulated data. It continues with semi-supervised reinforcement learning and/or a region merging technique that tries to piece together disconnected components belonging to the same membrane structure. A parametric or non-parametric fitting procedure is then used to enhance the segmentation results and quantify uncertainties in the fitting. Domain knowledge is used in generating the training data for the neural network and in guiding the fitting procedure through the use of appropriately chosen priors and constraints. We demonstrate that the approach proposed here works well for extracting membrane surfaces in two real tomogram datasets.},

  abstract     = {High-energy density metal anodes are a key solution for next-generation mobility batteries, but the difficulty of studying materials in real-life battery context leads to a methodological gap between theory and experiments, translating into poor device control. Imaging and spectroscopy are the ultimate tools for knowledge-based battery studies, but the capability of quantitatively linking the electrical device response to the material evolution, is essentially missing, at the moment. High-throughput, Deep-Learning based parameter identification for morphochemical PDE modelling, can enable this link, in principle allowing to extract the key information from hyperspectral imaging tools and to feed it into next-generation battery management systems : this work is the first step of this process. Here we have employed a CNN , trained with the solutions of an electrochemical phase formation model we recently developed, to carry out three enabling tasks: (i) automatic partitioning of the parameter space, according to the types of patterns generated by the model; (ii) assignment of experimental patterns, derived by imaging of from real electrodes to the class patterns and (iii) identification of the model parameters for experimental electrode images.},
