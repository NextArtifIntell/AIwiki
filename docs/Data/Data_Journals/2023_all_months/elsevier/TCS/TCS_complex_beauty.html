  abstract     = {Sharkey, Kiss and others developed a dynamical approach to modelling epidemic disease on a contact graph by generating systems of first-order ordinary differential equations expressing the model dynamics [1] , [2] , which are solved to yield exact and deterministic modelling results. However, they left algorithmic generation (and solving) of systems and runtime assessment of the approach as an open question. To address this, we give an open source implementation that takes both a compartmental model and a contact graph as input and then generates and solves a system of equations exactly describing the dynamics of the system. Our implementation uses a moment closure result on single-vertex cutsets in the contact graph to reduce the number of equations required. In runtime experiments, we find that the implementation of the dynamical approach is almost always slower than a comparable Monte Carlo simulation in finding the expected state of the modelling system at a specified time. To complement our runtime evaluations, we give results and bounds on the number of equations required to describe a system as a function of the size of the compartmental model and input graph. We show that a natural extension of the moment closure result on single-vertex cutsets to larger cutsets is only possible for restricted projections of the model states on the cutset. We conclude that the dynamical approach is unlikely to be suitable unless exact, deterministic (rather than simulated) results are essential.},

  abstract     = {The fault diagnosability has played an important role in the reliability of the interconnection network . In a network, the states of any two adjacent vertices can usually affect each other, and the neighbor of a faulty vertex is more likely to become faulty. These motivate our study of fault diagnosability from the perspective of some structures instead of basing on individual faulty vertices. Therefore, we introduce a novel measure of diagnosability, called structural diagnosability. Given a specific structure H , the H -structure diagnosability of a network G , denoted by t s ( G ; H ) ts(G;H) , is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint subnetworks H 1 , H 2 , … , H m H1,H2,…,Hm in G , such that, for i = 1 , 2 , … , m i=1,2,…,m , H i Hi is isomorphic to H and when all vertices in H i Hi are faulty, these vertices can be diagnosed correctly. In this paper, we will establish t s ( Q n ; H ) ts(Qn;H) for the n -dimensional hypercube Q n Qn under the PMC model and MM* model, respectively, where H ∈ { K 1 , 1 , K 1 , 2 , K 1 , 3 , C 4 } H∈{K1,1,K1,2,K1,3,C4} .},

By using this domain, and the domain of Lipschitz maps , we formulate a generalization of the Euler operator , which exhibits second-order convergence. We prove computability of the operator within the framework of effectively given domains. The operator only requires the vector field of the differential equation to be Lipschitz continuous, in contrast to the related operators in the literature which require the vector field to be at least continuously differentiable. Within the same framework, we also analyze temporal discretization and computability of another variant of the Euler operator formulated according to Runge-Kutta theory. We prove that, compared with this variant, the second-order operator that we formulate directly, not only imposes weaker assumptions on the vector field, but also exhibits superior convergence rate. We implement the first-order, second-order, and Runge-Kutta Euler operators using arbitrary-precision interval arithmetic , and report on some experiments. The experiments confirm our theoretical results. In particular, we observe the superior convergence rate of our second-order operator compared with the Runge-Kutta Euler and the common (first-order) Euler operators.},

  abstract     = {The grounded Laplacian matrix L − S L−S of a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) with n = | V | n=|V| nodes and m = | E | m=|E| edges is a ( n − s ) × ( n − s ) (n−s)×(n−s) submatrix of its Laplacian matrix L , obtained from L by deleting rows and columns corresponding to s = | S | ≪ n s=|S|≪n ground nodes forming set S ⊂ V S⊂V . The smallest eigenvalue of L − S L−S plays an important role in various practical scenarios, such as characterizing the convergence rate of leader-follower opinion dynamics, with a larger eigenvalue indicating faster convergence of opinion. In this paper, we study the problem of adding k ≪ n k≪n edges among all the nonexistent edges forming the candidate edge set ﹨ Q = ( V × V ) ﹨ E Q=(V×V)﹨E , in order to maximize the smallest eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian matrix. We show that the objective function of the combinatorial optimization problem is monotone but non-submodular. To solve the problem, we first simplify the problem by restricting the candidate edge set Q to be ﹨ ﹨ ( S × ( V ﹨ S ) ) ﹨ E (S×(V﹨S))﹨E , and prove that it has the same optimal solution as the original problem, although the size of set Q is reduced from O ( n 2 ) O(n2) to O ( n ) O(n) . Then, we propose two greedy approximation algorithms. One is a simple greedy algorithm with an approximation ratio ( 1 − e − α γ ) / α (1−e−αγ)/α and time complexity O ( k n 4 ) O(kn4) , where γ and α are, respectively, submodularity ratio and curvature, whose bounds are provided for some particular cases. The other is a fast greedy algorithm without approximation guarantee, which has a running time O ˜ ( k m ) O˜(km) , where O ˜ ( ⋅ ) O˜(⋅) suppresses the poly ( log ⁡ n ) poly(log⁡n) factors. Numerous experiments on various real networks are performed to validate the superiority of our algorithms, in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

They showed via the probabilistic method that n -player Lipschitz games with m strategies per player have ϵ -approximate pure Nash equilibria , for ϵ ≥ λ 8 n log ⁡ ( 2 m n ) ϵ≥λ8nlog⁡(2mn) . Here we provide the first hardness result for the corresponding computational problem, showing that even for a simple class of Lipschitz games (Lipschitz polymatrix games), finding ϵ -approximate pure equilibria is PPAD-complete, for suitable pairs of values ϵ ( n ) ϵ(n) , λ ( n ) λ(n) . Novel features of this result include both the proof of PPAD hardness (in which we apply a population game reduction from unrestricted polymatrix games) and the proof of containment in PPAD (by derandomizing the selection of a pure equilibrium from a mixed one). In fact, our approach implies containment in PPAD for any class of Lipschitz games where payoffs from mixed-strategy profiles can be deterministically computed. When instead considering games where only payoffs from action profiles can be deterministically computed, we provide two equivalent definitions of “randomized PPAD” and show that the generalized problem belongs to this class.},

  abstract     = {The graph exploration problem requires a group of mobile robots, initially placed arbitrarily on the nodes of a graph, to work collaboratively to explore the graph such that each node is eventually visited by at least one robot. One important requirement of exploration is the termination condition, i.e., the robots must know that exploration is completed. The problem of live exploration of a dynamic ring using mobile robots was recently introduced by Di Luna et al. [DC 2020]. More specifically, they studied the problem of live exploration in a dynamic ring and proposed multiple algorithms to solve this problem in the fully synchronous and semi-synchronous settings with various guarantees when 2 robots were involved. They also showed that, under certain assumptions, exploration of the ring using two robots was impossible. An important question left open was how the presence of 3 robots would affect the results. In this paper, we try to settle this question in a fully synchronous setting and also show how to extend our results to a semi-synchronous setting. In particular, we present algorithms for exploration with explicit termination using 3 robots in conjunction with either (i) unique IDs of the robots and edge crossing detection capability (i.e., two robots moving in opposite directions through an edge in the same round can detect each other), or (ii) access to randomness. The time complexity of our deterministic algorithm is asymptotically optimal. We also provide complementary impossibility results showing that there does not exist any explicit termination algorithm for 2 robots even when each robot has a unique ID, edge crossing detection capability, and access to randomness. The theoretical analysis and comprehensive simulations of our algorithm show the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm in dynamic rings. We also present an algorithm to achieve exploration with partial termination using 3 robots with unique IDs in the semi-synchronous setting, when robots have access to edge crossing detection capability and randomness but do not know a bound on the size of the ring or have access to a landmark or are guaranteed that robots have common chirality. Our algorithms are fully decentralized, lightweight, and easily implementable.},

We investigate the exact computation of maximal degenerate palindromes with gaps and mismatches. We present an algorithm which, given a degenerate string of length n and natural number parameters g and m , efficiently detects exact maximal palindromes with a gap size ≤ g , and ≤ m permitted mismatches. We show that it can be done in O ( k | Σ | ( k + log ⁡ | Σ | ) + ( k + g + m ) n ) O(k|Σ|(k+log⁡|Σ|)+(k+g+m)n) time and O ( ( g + m ) n ) O((g+m)n) space, where k represents an upper bound on the number of degenerate symbols contained in the string.

An inverted repeat is a specific type of palindrome which refers to a nucleotide sequence followed by its reverse complement. Our results can also be used to find maximal inverted repeated sequences with gaps and mismatches, where changing the structure of palindromes to inverted repeats does not affect the overall running time.

  abstract     = {In the decision tree computation model for Boolean functions , the depth corresponds to query complexity, and the size corresponds to storage space. The depth measure is the most well-studied one, and is known to be polynomially related to several non-computational complexity measures of functions such as certificate complexity. The size measure is also studied, but to a lesser extent. Another decision tree measure that has received very little attention is the minimal rank of the decision tree, first introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler in 1989. This measure is closely related to the logarithm of the size, but is not polynomially related to depth, and hence it can reveal additional information about the complexity of a function. It is characterised by the value of a Prover-Delayer game first proposed by Pudlák and Impagliazzo in the context of tree-like resolution proofs. In this paper we study this measure further. We obtain an upper bound on depth in terms of rank and Fourier sparsity . We obtain upper and lower bounds on rank in terms of (variants of) certificate complexity. We also obtain upper and lower bounds on the rank for composed functions in terms of the depth of the outer function and the rank of the inner function . This allows us to easily recover known asympotical lower bounds on logarithm of the size for Iterated AND-OR and Iterated 3-bit Majority. We compute the rank exactly for several natural functions and use them to show that all the bounds we have obtained are tight. We also show that rank in the simple decision tree model can be used to bound query complexity, or depth, in the more general conjunctive decision tree model . Finally, we improve upon the known size lower bound for the Tribes function and conclude that in the size-rank relationship for decision trees, obtained by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler, the upper bound for Tribes is asymptotically tight.},

  abstract     = {In the Multicut problem, given an undirected graph G , a set of pairs of vertices P P , and a budget k , the goal is to determine if there is a set S of at most k edges such that for each ( s , t ) ∈ P (s,t)∈P , the graph G − S G−S has no path from s to t . In this article we first study the parameterized complexity of a variant of this problem, where the input graph is edge-weighted with arbitrary weights and the goal is to find a solution of minimum weight. Since weights are arbitrarily large, the weight of the solution is not a good choice for a parameter. The weighted problem is non-trivial even on trees and we study this problem on trees parameterized by structural parameters like the number of leaves and the request degree of every vertex. The studied parameters naturally interpolate the known polynomial time and NP NP -hardness results for this problem. We also give an FPT FPT algorithm for another variant called Weighted Multicut , where given an edge-weighted tree, the goal is to find a solution of size at most k edges that minimizes the weight.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of reliable broadcast in asynchronous authenticated systems, in which n processes communicate using signed messages and up to t processes may behave arbitrarily (Byzantine processes). In addition, for each message m broadcast by a correct (i.e., non-Byzantine) process, a message adversary may prevent up to d correct processes from receiving m . (This message adversary captures network failures such as transient disconnections, silent churn, or message losses.) Considering such a “double” adversarial context and assuming n &gt; 3 t + 2 d n&amp;gt;3t+2d , a reliable broadcast algorithm is presented. Interestingly, when there is no message adversary (i.e., d = 0 d=0 ), the algorithm terminates in two communication steps (so, in this case, this algorithm is optimal in terms of both Byzantine tolerance and time efficiency). It is then shown that the condition n &gt; 3 t + 2 d n&amp;gt;3t+2d is necessary for implementing reliable broadcast in the presence of both Byzantine processes and a message adversary (whether the underlying system is enriched with signatures or not).},

  abstract     = {As modern parallel computer systems continue to grow in scale, the occurrence of failures becomes inevitable, which places severe reliability challenges on the systems&#39; underlying interconnection network . Recently, two novel indicators, named the matroidal connectivity and conditional matroidal connectivity, were proposed to better evaluate the reliability of interconnection networks. These indicators enable flexible restrictions on faulty edges in each dimension and have proven to be promising in improving the edge fault-tolerance of interconnection networks. In this paper, we aim to apply these indicators to the n -dimensional star graph S n Sn , which is a famous interconnection network with high symmetry and recursive hierarchical structure. We partition the faulty edge set F ⊆ E ( S n ) F⊆E(Sn) into n − 1 n−1 parts according to each faulty edge&#39;s dimension. By sorting the cardinality of these parts and exerting the restriction that the ( n − i ) (n−i) -th largest part&#39;s cardinality does not exceed i ! − 1 i!−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 1≤i≤n−1 , we prove that S n − F Sn−F is always connected where | F | ≤ ∑ i = 1 n − 1 ( i ! − 1 ) |F|≤∑i=1n−1(i!−1) . Then we determine the exact values of matroidal connectivity and conditional matroidal connectivity of star graphs. Moreover, we make comparisons to demonstrate our results outperform other similar works in terms of edge fault-tolerance.},

  abstract     = {Markov population models are a widespread formalism used to model the dynamics of complex systems, with applications in systems biology and many other fields. The associated Markov stochastic process in continuous time is often analyzed by simulation, which can be costly for large or stiff systems, particularly when a massive number of simulations has to be performed, e.g. in a multi-scale model. A strategy to reduce computational load is to abstract the population model, replacing it with a simpler stochastic model , faster to simulate. Here we pursue this idea, exploring and comparing state-of-the-art generative models , which are flexible enough to automatically learn distributions over entire trajectories, rather than single simulation steps, from observed realizations of the system. In particular, we compare a Generative Adversarial setting with a Score-based Diffusion approach and show how the latter outperforms the former both in terms of accuracy and stability at the cost of slightly higher simulation times. To improve the accuracy of abstract samples, we develop an active learning framework to enrich our dataset with observations whose expected satisfaction of a temporal requirement differs significantly from the abstract one. We experimentally show how the proposed abstractions are well suited to work on multi-scale and data-driven scenarios, meaning that we can infer a (black-box) dynamical model from a pool of real data.},

In more detail, under the optimal visibility range one, we give an algorithm which is optimal w.r.t. both the number of robots and colors: it uses two robots and three colors. Under visibility two, we design two algorithms: the first one uses three robots with an optimal number of colors ( i.e. , one), the second one achieves the best trade-off between the number of robots and colors, i.e. , it uses two robots and two colors.},

Our goal is to understand the communication cost needed to solve several fundamental geometry problems, including Farthest Pair, Convex Hull , Closest Pair, and approximations of these problems, in the asynchronous CONGEST KT1 model, where each node knows its ID and those of its neighbors. This extends the 2011 result of Rajsbaum and Urrutia for finding a convex hull of a planar geometric communication network to networks of arbitrary topology. We define a new model where each node has a position on the plane and nodes can communicate to each other if and only if there is an edge between them. We motivate the model and study a number of geometric problems in this model. We prove lower bounds on the communication complexity of the problems in this new model and present approximation algorithms for them. We prove lower bounds on the number of expected bits required for any randomized algorithm to solve the problems.},

We show that the q -Subset Square Colouring problem with q = 2 q=2 is NP-hard even on planar bipartite graphs and the q-Subset Square Colouring problem is NP-hard even on bipartite graphs and chordal graphs .

If a player picks a number that was previously played, that player loses the game and the other player wins. If all numbers are declared without repetition, the result is a draw. Bob has a simple mirror strategy that assures he won&#39;t lose the game and requires no memory. On the other hand, Garg and Schneider showed that every deterministic Alice requires memory of size that is proportional to n in order to secure a draw. Regarding probabilistic strategies, previous work showed that assuming Alice has access to a secret random perfect matching over { 1 , 2 , … , 2 n } {1,2,…,2n} allows her to achieve a draw in the game w.p. at least 1 − 1 n 1−1n and using only polylog bits of memory. We show that the requirement for secret bits is crucial: for an ‘open book’ Alice with no secrets (Bob knows her memory but not future coin flips) and memory of at most n / 4 c n/4c bits for any c ≥ 2 c≥2 , there is a Bob that wins w.p. close to 1 − 2 − c / 2 1−2−c/2 .},

  abstract     = {We study perpetual torus exploration for swarms of autonomous, anonymous, uniform, and luminous robots. We consider robots with only few capabilities. They have a finite limited vision (myopic), they can only see robots at distance one or two. We show that the problem is impossible with only two luminous robots and also with three oblivious robots (without light). We then address the problem assuming luminous robots (resp. oblivious) with visibility range one (resp. two). We design optimal solutions with respect to both the number of robots and colors when robots share a common chirality and have, respectively, vision one and two. We also present an optimal solution with respect to the number of robots when they are endowed with vision one and share no common chirality. Finally, we propose a solution for the case in which robots are oblivious, have vision two, and no common chirality that uses one additional robot.},

  abstract     = {Advertising becomes one of the most popular ways of monetizing an online transaction platform. Usually, sponsored advertisements are posted on the most attractive positions to enhance the number of clicks. However, multiple e-commerce platforms are aware that this action may hurt the search experience of users, even though it can bring more incomes. To balance the advertising revenue and the user experience loss caused by advertisements, most e-commerce platforms choose fixing some areas for advertisements and adopting some restrictions on the number of ads, such as a fixed number K of ads or one advertisement for every N organic searched results. Different from these common rules of treating the allocation of ads separately (from the arrangements of the organic searched items), in this work we build up an integrated system with mixed arrangements of advertisements and organic items. We focus on the design of truthful mechanisms to properly list the advertisements and organic items and optimally trade off the instant revenue and the user experience . Furthermore, for different settings and practical requirements, we extend our optimal truthful allocation mechanisms to cater for these realistic conditions. Finally, we exert several experiments to verify the improvement of our mechanism compared to the common-used advertising mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Fault-tolerance techniques depend on replication to enhance availability, albeit at the cost of increased infrastructure costs. This results in a fundamental trade-off: Fault-tolerant services must satisfy given availability and performance constraints while minimising the number of replicated resources. These constraints pose capacity planning challenges for the service operators to minimise replication costs without negatively impacting availability . To this end, we present PCRAFT ( P erformant, C heap, R eliable and A vailable F ault T olerance), a practical process to enable capacity planning of dependable services. PCRAFT &#39;s capacity planning process is based on a hybrid approach that combines empirical performance measurements with probabilistic modelling of availability based on fault injection . In particular, we integrate traditional service-level availability mechanisms (active-route-anywhere and passive-failover) and deployment schemes (cloud and on-premises) to quantify the number of nodes needed to satisfy the given availability and performance constraints. Our evaluation based on real-world applications shows that cloud deployment requires fewer nodes than on-premises deployments. Additionally, when considering on-premises deployments, we show how passive-failover requires fewer nodes than active-route-anywhere. Furthermore, our evaluation quantifies the quality enhancement given by additional integrity mechanisms and how this affects the number of nodes needed.},

  abstract     = {Since its appearance in 2008, Bitcoin has attracted considerable attention. So far, it has been the most successful cryptocurrency , with the highest market capitalization . Nevertheless, due to the method it uses to append new transactions and blocks to the blockchain , based on a Proof-of-Work, Bitcoin suffers from poor scalability , which strongly limits the number of transactions per second and, hence, its adoption as a global payment layer for everyday uses. In this paper we analyze some recent proposals to address this issue. In particular, we focus our attention on permissionless blockchain protocols, whose distributed consensus algorithm lies on a Proof-of-Work composed of k &gt; 1 k&amp;gt;1 sequential hash-puzzles, instead of a single one. Such protocols are referred to as multi-stage Proof-of-Works. We consider a simplified scenario, commonly used in the blockchain literature, in which the number of miners, their hashing powers, and the difficulty values of the hash-puzzles are constant over time. Our contribution is threefold. Firstly, we derive a closed-form expression for the mining probability of a miner, that is, the probability that the miner completes the Proof-of-Work of the next block to be added to the blockchain, before any other miner does. Secondly, we show that in multi-stage Proof-of-Works the mining probability might not be strictly related to the miner hashing power. This feature could be exploited by a smart miner, and could open up potential fairness and decentralization issues in mining. Finally, we focus on a more restricted scenario and present two attacks, which can be applied successfully against multi-stage Proof-of-Works: a Selfish Mining attack and a Selfish Stage-Withholding attack. We show that both are effective, and we point out that Selfish Stage-Withholding can be seen as a complementary strategy to Selfish Mining, which in some cases increases the selfish miner profitability in the Selfish Mining attack.},

  abstract     = {With the increase of the number of processors in the interconnection network , the failure of processors is inevitable. When the processor fails, the information passing through the failed processor will be unreliable, which may cause fatal consequences. Therefore, the research on the reliability of interconnection networks is an important topic, and the reliability of networks can be characterized by connectivity and diagnosability. In this paper, we first establish that the h -extra connectivity of the n -dimensional half hypercube network H H n HHn is κ h ( H H n ) = − 1 2 h 2 + ( ⌈ n / 2 ⌉ − 1 2 ) h + ⌈ n / 2 ⌉ + 1 κh(HHn)=−12h2+(⌈n/2⌉−12)h+⌈n/2⌉+1 for n ≥ 7 n≥7 and 0 ≤ h ≤ ⌈ n / 2 ⌉ − 4 0≤h≤⌈n/2⌉−4 , and then determine that the h -extra diagnosability of the H H n HHn under the PMC model ( n ≥ 7 n≥7 and 0 ≤ h ≤ ⌈ n / 2 ⌉ − 4 0≤h≤⌈n/2⌉−4 ) and the MM* model ( n ≥ 7 n≥7 and 0 ≤ h ≤ ⌈ n / 2 ⌉ 4 − 1 0≤h≤⌈n/2⌉4−1 ) is t h ( H H n ) = − 1 2 h 2 + ( ⌈ n / 2 ⌉ + 1 2 ) h + ⌈ n / 2 ⌉ + 1 th(HHn)=−12h2+(⌈n/2⌉+12)h+⌈n/2⌉+1 .

The goal is to determine whether there exists a subset S ⊆ V S⊆V of at most k vertices whose removal makes no terminal in T contained in a cycle in the remaining graph. When T = V T=V , SFVS degenerates to the classical Feedback Vertex Set problem ( FVS ). Both SFVS and FVS have been extensively studied in parameterized algorithms. In this paper, we study parameterized algorithms for Subset Feedback Vertex Set in Tournaments ( SFVST ), i.e., SFVS with the restriction that the input graph is always a tournament. By using the iterative compression method and a novel dynamic programming , we show that SFVST can be solved in 2 k + o ( k ) n O ( 1 ) 2k+o(k)nO(1) time, improving the bound obtained from 3 -Hitting Set .},

Previous approaches to solving the Eternity Puzzle used a refined brute-force approach, utilizing backtracking and statistical techniques that were tailored to the particular problem. Our method yields a flexible mathematical model of the tiling problem, expressed in the linear programming (LP) file format , which can be adapted for a wide range of similar puzzle problems of the Eternity type. The tiling problems are solved using a combination of programming in MATLAB , and the commercial high-performance optimization package CPLEX . We also describe the complex geometry of the Eternity Puzzle and use boundary words to represent the tiles and grids of any Eternity-type tiling puzzle. Our ILP approach is illustrated by solving four small puzzles of the Eternity-type, demonstrating that, with sufficient computing power, our approach would, in principle, yield a solution to the full Eternity Puzzle. Additionally, our publicly available set of MATLAB programs ETERNITY (v1.0.0) is available for download on Zenodo.org . These programs can be used to construct the ILP formulations, plot solutions, and be adapted by other researchers to investigate similar puzzle problems.},

The cardinality of a smallest super dominating set of G is the super domination number of G . An exact formula for the super domination number of a tree T is obtained, and it is demonstrated that a smallest super dominating set of T can be computed in linear time. It is proved that it is NP-complete to decide whether the super domination number of a graph G is at most a given integer if G is a bipartite graph of girth at least 8. The super domination number is determined for all k -subdivisions of graphs. Interestingly, in half of the cases the exact value can be efficiently computed from the obtained formulas, while in the other cases the computation is hard. While obtaining these formulas, II-matching numbers are introduced and proved that they are computationally hard to determine.},

  abstract     = {The string matching problem on a node-labeled graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) asks whether a given pattern string P equals the concatenation of node labels of some path in G . This is a basic primitive in various problems in bioinformatics, graph databases , or networks, and it was recently proven that solving it in time O ( | E | 1 − ϵ | P | ) O(|E|1−ϵ|P|) or O ( | E | | P | 1 − ϵ ) O(|E||P|1−ϵ) is hard under OVH , the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis, and thus under SETH , the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (Equi et al., 2019 [11] ). We consider its indexed version, where the graph is indexed to support string queries. We show that, under OVH , no polynomial-time index of the graph performed in time O ( | E | α ) O(|E|α) can support querying P in time O ( | P | + | E | δ | P | β ) O(|P|+|E|δ|P|β) , with either δ δ&amp;lt;1 or β β&amp;lt;1 . We present our techniques as a general framework, introducing the notion of linear independent-components (lic) reduction , from which we derive our result. This allows us to also translate the quadratic conditional lower bound of Backurs and Indyk (2015) [48] for the problem of matching a query string inside a text, under edit distance, into an analogous tight quadratic lower bound for its indexed version. This improves the recent result of Cohen-Addad, Feuilloley and Starikovskaya (2019) [49] , with a slightly different boundary condition. We also apply our technique to obtain the first quadratic indexing lower bounds for Fréchet distance and rooted unlabeled subtree-isomorphism queries.},

The latter method is called local linearisation and is shown to have desirable properties sufficient for termination and which also allow for more efficient treatment of non-linear constraints. Our methods for constructing linearisations are based on computable analysis, in particular we introduce the Cauchy-compatible compact representation of reals and prove its names to be locally compact, allowing for more efficient computation of local linearisations while maintaining δ -completeness.},

  abstract     = {A Searcher wants to find the Home node on a given Network, but his directions are unreliable. At every branch node of a network Q , a Satnav (GPS) points to the arc leading to the destination, or home node, H - but only with a high known probability p . The pointer is fixed in time, so does not change when a node is revisited. Always trusting the Satnav&#39;s suggestion may lead to an infinite cycle. If one wishes to reach H in least expected time, with what probability q = q ( Q , p ) q=q(Q,p) should one trust the pointer (if not, one chooses randomly among the other arcs)? We call this the Faulty Satnav (GPS) Problem. We also consider versions where the trust probability q can depend on the degree of the current node and a ‘treasure hunt’ where two searchers try to reach H first. The agent searching for H need not be a car, that is just a familiar example – it could equally be a UAV receiving unreliable GPS information. This problem has its origin not in driver frustration but in the work of Fonio et al. (2017) [10] on ant navigation, where the pointers correspond to pheromone markers pointing to the nest.},

Here we show that “any run” can be weakened to “some run”. We present some related sufficient conditions under which the occur-check may be safely omitted.

It supports a calculus for the specification and verification of concurrent interactive systems by interface assertions. Systems are composed acting concurrently and interacting via streams exchanged over their channels forming feedback loops. A denotational semantics is defined handling feedback communication by recursion and fixpoints based on strong causality and realizability instead of monotonicity. The resulting verification calculus for the specification logic is proved to be sound and relatively complete with respect to an operational semantics in terms of generalized Moore machines . Actually, two models of concurrent systems are defined, a more abstract one with communication and interaction modeled by untimed streams and a more concrete one working with timed streams. The untimed model is an abstraction of the timed model. The timed model allows expressing the laws of causality and realizability. Moreover, the timed model can be used to specify real-time properties.},

If each two vertices from X are X -visible, then X is a mutual-visibility set. The mutual-visibility number of G is the cardinality of a largest mutual-visibility set of G and has been already investigated. In this paper a variety of mutual-visibility problems is introduced based on which natural pairs of vertices are required to be X -visible. This yields the total, the dual, and the outer mutual-visibility numbers. We first show that these graph invariants are related to each other and to the classical mutual-visibility number, and then we prove that the three newly introduced mutual-visibility problems are computationally difficult. According to this result, we compute or bound their values for several graphs classes that include for instance grid graphs and tori. We conclude the study by presenting some inter-comparison between the values of such parameters, which is based on the computations we made for some specific families.},

We derive tight bounds on both the price of anarchy and the price of stability as a function of p , revealing an interesting separation between the general case of p ≥ 2 p≥2 and the priority-free scenario of p = 1 p=1 . In fact, while in absence of priorities the worst-case prices of anarchy and stability of non-atomic games are lower than their counterparts in atomic ones, the two classes share the same bounds when p ≥ 2 p≥2 . Moreover, while the worst-case price of stability is lower than the worst-case price of anarchy in atomic games with no priorities, their values become equal when p ≥ 2 p≥2 . Said differently, the presence of priorities simultaneously irons out any combinatorial difference between atomic and non-atomic requests and among different pure Nash equilibria to produce a unique representative worst-case situation. Notably, our results keep holding even under singleton strategies. Besides being of independent interest, priority-based scheduling shares tight connections with online load balancing and finds a natural application within the theory of coordination mechanisms and cost-sharing policies for congestion games. Under this perspective, a number of possible research directions also arise.},

  abstract     = {This article is on k -set agreement ( k SA) in an n -process synchronous message-passing system in which up to t processes can commit Byzantine failures. k SA is a decision problem in which at least each correct (i.e., non-Byzantine) process is assumed to propose and decide a value such that at most k different values are decided by the correct processes, in such a way that, if all the correct processes propose the same value v , they will decide v . This article investigates the possibility/impossibility domain of k SA in the presence of Byzantine processes. To this end it first extends a previous result and shows that k SA cannot be solved when ( n (n&amp;lt;2t+tk)∧(n−t≥k+1) . On the positive side, it presents two synchronous round-based algorithms that solve Byzantine k SA. These algorithms are optimal with respect to the value of k and the number of rounds. The first algorithm is a one-round algorithm that has two instances. The first assumes n &gt; 2 t + 1 n&amp;gt;2t+1 and solves k SA for k ≥ ⌊ n − t n − 2 t ⌋ + 1 k≥⌊n−tn−2t⌋+1 , while the second assumes n ≤ 2 t + 1 n≤2t+1 and solves k SA for k ≥ t + 1 k≥t+1 (so this second case does not require a majority of correct processes). The second algorithm is based on two new notions denoted Square and Regions that allow each correct process to locally build a global knowledge on which processes proposed which values. This algorithm has also two instances. The first assumes n = 3 t n=3t and solves 2SA. The second assumes 2 t + 1 2t+1&amp;lt;n≤3t and solves k SA where k = n − t n − 2 t k=n−tn−2t is an integer. It is worth noticing that the results presented in this article “almost” complete the possibility/impossibility cartography of k SA in synchronous Byzantine systems. The only case that remains open is when n − t n − 2 t n−tn−2t is not an integer.},

  abstract     = {By a well known theorem of Robbins, a graph G has a strongly connected orientation if and only if G is 2-edge-connected and it is easy to find, in linear time, either a cut edge of G or a strong orientation of G . A result of Durand de Gevigney shows that for every k ≥ 3 k≥3 it is NP-hard to decide if a given graph G has a k -strong orientation. Thomassen showed that one can check in polynomial time whether a given graph has a 2-strong orientation. This implies that for a given digraph D we can determine in polynomial time whether we can reorient (=reverse) some arcs of D = ( V , A ) D=(V,A) to obtain a 2-strong digraph D ′ = ( V , A ′ ) D′=(V,A′) . This naturally leads to the question of determining the minimum number of such arcs to reverse before the resulting graph is 2-strong. In this paper we show that finding this number is NP-hard. If a 2-connected graph G has no 2-strong orientation, we may ask how many of its edges we may orient so that the resulting mixed graph is still 2-strong. Similarly, we may ask for a 2-edge-connected graph G how many of its edges we can orient such that the resulting mixed graph remains 2-arc-strong. We prove that when restricted to graphs satisfying suitable connectivity conditions, both of these problems are equivalent to finding the minimum number of edges we must double in a 2-edge-connected graph in order to obtain a 4-edge-connected graph. Using this, we show that all these three problems are NP-hard. Finally, we consider the operation of deorienting an arc uv of a digraph D meaning replacing it by an undirected edge between the same vertices. In terms of connectivity properties, this is equivalent to adding the opposite arc vu to D . We prove that for every ℓ ≥ 3 ℓ≥3 it is NP-hard to find the minimum number of arcs to deorient in a digraph D in order to obtain an ℓ -strong digraph D ′ D′ .},

  abstract     = {The directed acyclic word graph ( DAWG ) of a string y of length n is the smallest (partial) DFA which recognizes all suffixes of y with only O ( n ) O(n) nodes and edges. In this paper, we show how to construct the DAWG for the input string y from the suffix tree for y , in O ( n ) O(n) time for integer alphabets of polynomial size in n . In so doing, we first describe a folklore algorithm which, given the suffix tree for y , constructs the DAWG for the reversed string y ˆ yˆ in O ( n ) O(n) time. Then, we present our algorithm that builds the DAWG for y in O ( n ) O(n) time for integer alphabets, from the suffix tree for y . We also show that a straightforward modification to our DAWG construction algorithm leads to the first O ( n ) O(n) -time algorithm for constructing the affix tree of a given string y over an integer alphabet. Affix trees are a text indexing structure supporting bidirectional pattern searches. We then discuss how our constructions can lead to linear-time algorithms for building other text indexing structures, such as linear-size suffix tries and symmetric CDAWGs in linear time in the case of integer alphabets. As a further application to our O ( n ) O(n) -time DAWG construction algorithm , we show that the set MAW ( y ) MAW(y) of all minimal absent words ( MAWs ) of y can be computed in optimal , input- and output-sensitive O ( n + | MAW ( y ) | ) O(n+|MAW(y)|) time and O ( n ) O(n) working space for integer alphabets.},

We then derive analytically some critical structural properties of the model, including degree distribution, clustering coefficient , and diameter, and show that it displays simultaneously the striking scale-free small-world phenomena observed in most real networks. We also determine all the eigenvalues and their multiplicities of the transition probability matrix for the contact graph, and exploit the eigenvalues to derive closed-form expressions for Kemeny constant of random walks and the number of spanning trees on the contact graph. Finally, we derive closed-form expressions for some interesting quantities about resistance distances, including Kirchhoff index, additive degree-Kirchhoff index, multiplicative degree-Kirchhoff index, as well as average resistance distance. As an application of resistance distances, we study the coherence of the first-order consensus dynamics, which tends to a small constant as the graph grows, implying that the graph is resistant to noise.},

  abstract     = {Given a bipartite graph , where the two sets of vertices are applicants and posts and ranks on the edges represent preferences of applicants over posts, a rank-maximal matching is one in which the maximum number of applicants is matched to their rank one posts and subject to this condition, the maximum number of applicants is matched to their rank two posts, and so on. We study the dynamic version of the problem in which a new applicant or post may be added to the graph and we would like to maintain a rank-maximal matching. We show that after the arrival of one vertex, we are always able to update the existing rank-maximal matching in O ( min ⁡ ( c ′ n , n 2 ) + m ) O(min⁡(c′n,n2)+m) time, where n denotes the number of applicants, m the number of edges and c ′ c′ the maximum rank of an edge in an optimal solution. The time bound can be considered optimal under the circumstances, as improving it would imply a better running time for the rank-maximal matching problem . Additionally, we update the matching using a minimal number of changes (replacements). All cases of: a deletion of a vertex from the graph, an addition or a deletion of a new edge or even of a change of rank of a given edge can be reduced to the problem of handling the addition of a vertex. As a by-product, we also get an analogous O ( m ) O(m) result for the dynamic version of the (one-sided) popular matching problem . Our results are based on the novel use of the properties of the Edmonds-Gallai decomposition. The presented ideas may find applications in other (dynamic) matching problems, not only related to matching with preferences.},

In this problem, the input is a set of voters having votes over a set of alternatives, a graph on the voters, a partition of voters into connected districts, a cost of every voter for changing her district, a budget, and a target winner. We need to compute if the given partition can be modified so that (i) the target alternative wins the resulting election, (ii) the modification is budget feasible, and (iii) every new district is connected. We study four natural variants of the above problem – the graph on the voters being arbitrary vs complete graph (corresponds to removing the connectivity requirement for districts) and the cost of moving every voter being uniform vs non-uniform. We show that all the four problems are NP NP -complete even under quite restrictive scenarios. Hence, our results show that district based elections are quite resistant under this new kind of electoral attack. We complement our intractability results by showing that two of our problems admit polynomial-time algorithms if the budget or the number of districts is a constant. We believe that our findings would help authorities to impose certain constraints, connectedness of districts for example, to make gerrymandering computationally harder.},

However deciding code maximality boils down to deciding whether a given NFA is universal, and this is a hard problem (including the case of whether the NFA accepts all words of a fixed length). On the other hand, it is acceptable to know whether a code is ‘approximately’ maximal, which then boils down to whether a given NFA is ‘approximately’ universal. Here we introduce the notion of a ( 1 − ε ) (1−ε) -universal automaton and present polynomial randomized approximation algorithms to test NFA universality and related hard automata problems, for certain natural probability distributions on the set of words. We also conclude that the randomization aspect is necessary, as approximate universality remains hard for any fixed polynomially computable ε .},

The goal of this game is to draw a kind of abstract painting (“Nuri”) that represents a sea with some capes (“Misaki”) of an island (represented by white cells). For this, the player has to fulfill cells of a grid in black (representing the sea) in order to draw some capes while respecting some simple rules. One of the specificity of the rules of this game is that every “Misaki” cell can only have one white neighbor. Kurodoko is also a Nikoli puzzle where some cells need to be blackened in order to ensure that each numbered cell is surrounded by the same number of white cells in the four directions (north, east, south, and west). Both of these puzzles, Nurimisaki and Kurodoko, share a common connectivity constraint. Using a deck of cards, we propose a physical ZKP protocol for each of the two puzzles above.

  abstract     = {We study a well-known communication abstraction called Byzantine Reliable Broadcast (BRB). This abstraction is central in the design and implementation of fault-tolerant distributed systems, as many fault-tolerant distributed applications require communication with provable guarantees on message deliveries. Our study focuses on fault-tolerant implementations for message-passing systems that are prone to process-failures, such as crashes and malicious behavior . At PODC 1983, Bracha and Toueg, in short, BT, solved the BRB problem. BT has optimal resilience since it can deal with t t&amp;lt;n/3 Byzantine processes, where n is the number of processes. The present work aims to design an even more robust solution than BT by expanding its fault-model with self-stabilization, a vigorous notion of fault-tolerance. In addition to tolerating Byzantine and communication failures, self-stabilizing systems can recover after the occurrence of arbitrary transient-faults . These transient faults allow the model to represent temporary deviations from the assumptions on which the system was originally designed to operate (provided that the algorithm code remains intact). We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first self-stabilizing Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) solution for repeated BRB in signature-free message-passing systems (that follows BT&#39;s problem specifications). Our contribution includes a self-stabilizing variation on BT that solves a single-instance BRB for asynchronous systems . We also consider the problem of recycling instances of single-instance BRB. Our self-stabilizing BFT recycling for time-free systems facilitates the concurrent handling of a predefined number of BRB invocations and, in this way, can serve as the basis for self-stabilizing BFT consensus.},

Second, a graph is called strongly Menger connected if for any two vertices u , v u,v in the graph, there are m i n ( d ( u ) , d ( v ) ) min(d(u),d(v)) internally disjoint paths between them, where d ( u ) , d ( v ) d(u),d(v) are the degree of u , v u,v in the graph. In this paper, we propose k -star-fault-tolerance strong Menger connectivity. A graph is called k -star-fault-tolerance strong Menger connected if after the removal of no more that k stars, the left graph remains strongly Menger connected. We show that Hypercube Q n Qn is ⌊ n − 2 2 ⌋ ⌊n−22⌋ -star-fault-tolerance strongly Menger connected. Moreover, the bound is sharp.},

  abstract     = {Finding a large set of optima in a multimodal optimization landscape is a challenging task. Classical population-based evolutionary algorithms typically converge only to a single solution. While this can be counteracted by applying niching strategies, the number of optima is nonetheless trivially bounded by the population size. Estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) are an alternative, maintaining a probabilistic model of the solution space instead of a population. Such a model is able to implicitly represent a solution set far larger than any realistic population size. To support the study of how optimization algorithms handle large sets of optima, we propose the test function EqualBlocksOneMax ( EBOM ). It has an easy fitness landscape with exponentially many optima. We show that the bivariate EDA mutual-information-maximizing input clustering , without any problem-specific modification, quickly generates a model that behaves very similarly to a theoretically ideal model for EBOM , which samples each of the exponentially many optima with the same maximal probability . We also prove via mathematical means that no univariate model can come close to having this property: If the probability to sample an optimum is at least inverse-polynomial, there is a Hamming ball of logarithmic radius such that, with high probability, each sample is in this ball.},

  abstract     = {Boolean network modeling of gene regulation but also of post-transcriptomic systems has proven over the years that it can bring powerful analyses and corresponding insight to the many cases where precise biological data is not sufficiently available to build a detailed quantitative model. Besides simulation, the analysis of such models is mostly based on attractor computation, since those correspond roughly to observable biological phenotypes . The recent use of trap spaces made a real breakthrough in that field allowing to consider medium-sized models that used to be out of reach. However, with the continuing increase in model size and complexity of Boolean update functions, the state-of-the-art computation of minimal trap spaces based on prime implicants shows its limits due to the difficulty of the prime-implicant computation. In this article we explore and prove for the first time a connection between trap spaces of a general Boolean network and siphons of its Petri net encoding. Besides important theoretical applications in studying properties of trap spaces, the connection enables us to propose an alternative approach to compute minimal trap spaces, and hence complex attractors, of a general Boolean network. It replaces the need for prime implicants by a completely different technique, namely the enumeration of maximal siphons in the Petri net encoding of the original model. We then demonstrate its efficiency and compare it to the state-of-the-art methods on a large collection of real-world and randomly generated models.},

  abstract     = {Given a network property or a data structure , a local certification is a labeling that allows to efficiently check that the property is satisfied, or that the structure is correct. The quality of a certification is measured by the size of its labels: the smaller, the better. This notion plays a central role in self-stabilization, because the size of the certification is a lower bound (and often an upper bound) on the memory needed for silent self-stabilizing construction of distributed data structures . When it comes to the size of the certification labels, one can identify three important regimes: the properties for which the optimal size is polynomial in the number of vertices of the graph, the ones that require only polylogarithmic size, and the ones that can be certified with a constant number of bits. The first two regimes are well studied, with several upper and lower bounds , specific techniques, and active research questions. On the other hand, the constant regime has never been really explored. The main contribution of this paper is the first non-trivial lower bound for this constant regime. More precisely, we show that by using certification on just one bit (a binary certification), one cannot certify k -colorability for k ≥ 3 k≥3 . To do so, we develop a new technique, based on the notion of score, and both local symmetry arguments and a global parity argument. We hope that this technique will be useful for establishing stronger results. We complement this result with an upper bound for a related problem, illustrating that in some cases one can do better than the natural upper bound.},

Firstly, an improved quantum voting scheme is proposed to facilitate anonymous broadcast. Secondly, a multi-party QHE scheme is proposed based on the improved quantum voting method. The proposed QHE scheme becomes more practical and flexible due to the reduction of the cost of delegated quantum computation, which significantly contributes to broadening the applicability of QHE in quantum networks .},

In particular, we consider an ordering of the types, and make the realistic assumption that the agents are in principle more tolerant towards agents of types that are closer to their own according to the ordering. Based on this, we study the strategic games induced when the agents aim to maximize their utility for a variety of tolerance levels.

For general graphs, however, even deciding whether such representations exist is often NP -hard. We consider apex graphs, i.e ., graphs that can be made planar by removing one vertex from them. We show, somewhat surprisingly, that deciding whether geometric representations exist for apex graphs is NP -hard as well. More precisely, we show that for every fixed positive integer g and every graph class G G such that , it is NP -hard to decide whether an input graph belongs to the graph class G G , even when the inputs are restricted to apex graphs of girth g . Here, is the class of intersection graphs of axis-parallel line segments (where horizontal segments intersect only vertical segments), and is the class of intersection graphs of simple curves (where two intersecting curves cross each other exactly once) in the plane. This partially answers an open question raised by Kratochvíl &amp; Pergel (COCOON, 2007). Most known reductions for earlier proofs of NP -hardness for these problems are from variants of 3 -SAT (mainly Planar 3 -Connected 3 -SAT ). We reduce from the problem, which uses the more intuitive notion of planarity . As a result, our proof is much simpler and encapsulates several classes of geometric intersection graphs.},

  abstract     = {A complexity measure for regular languages based on the sensing required to recognize them was recently introduced by Almagor, Kuperberg, and Kupferman. Intuitively, the sensing cost quantifies the detail in which a random input word has to be read in order to decide its membership in the language, when the input letters composing the word are truth assignments to a finite set of signals . We introduce the notion of lazy sensing , where the signals are not sensed simultaneously. Rather, the signals are ordered, and a signal is sensed only if the values of the signals sensed so far have not determined the successor state. We study four classes of lazy sensing, induced by distinguishing between the cases where the order of the signals is static or dynamic (that is, fixed in advance or depends on the values of the signals sensed so far), and the cases where the order is global or local (that is, the same for all states of the automaton , or not). We examine the different classes of lazy sensing and the saving they enable, with respect to each other and with respect to (non-lazy) sensing. We also examine the trade offs between sensing cost and size. Our results show that the good properties of sensing are preserved in the lazy setting. In particular, saving sensing does not conflict with saving size: in all four classes, the lazy-sensing cost of a regular language can be attained in the minimal automaton recognizing the language.},

We study the computational complexity of Red-Blue Separation , in which one asks whether a given red-blue colored graph has a red-blue separating set of size at most a given integer. We prove that the problem is NP-complete even for restricted graph classes.

In contrast, for triangle-free graphs and for graphs of bounded maximum degree , we show that Red-Blue Separation is solvable in polynomial time when the size of the smaller color class is bounded by a constant. However, on general graphs, we show that the problem is W [ 2 ] W[2] -hard even when parameterized by the solution size plus the size of the smaller color class. We also consider the problem Max Red-Blue Separation where the coloring of the graph is not part of the input. Here, given an input graph G , we want to determine the smallest integer k such that, for every possible red-blue coloring of G , there is a red-blue separating set of size at most k . We show that Max Red-Blue Separation is NP-hard, even for graphs of bounded maximum degree , but can be approximated in polynomial time within a factor of O ( ln 2 ⁡ n ) O(ln2⁡n) , where n is the order of the input graph. We derive tight bounds on the cardinality of an optimal solution of Max Red-Blue Separation , showing that it can range from logarithmic in the graph order, up to the order minus one. We also give bounds with respect to related parameters. For trees however, we prove an upper bound of two-thirds the order.},

  abstract     = {A Boolean network is a discrete dynamical system operating on vectors of Boolean variables. The action of a Boolean network can be conveniently expressed as a system of Boolean update functions, computing the new values for each component of the Boolean vector as a function of the other components. Boolean networks are widely used in modeling biological systems that can be seen as consisting of entities which can be activated or deactivated, expressed or inhibited, on or off. P systems on the other hand are classically introduced as a model of hierarchical multiset rewriting. However, over the years the community has proposed a wide range of P system variants including diverse ingredients suited for various needs. In this work, we propose a new variant—Boolean P systems—specifically designed for reasoning about sequential controllability of Boolean networks, and use it to first establish a crisp formalization of the problem, and then to prove that the problem of sequential controllability is PSPACE -complete. We further claim that Boolean P systems are a demonstration of how P systems can be used to construct ad hoc formalisms, custom-tailored for reasoning about specific problems, and providing new advantageous points of view.},

  abstract     = {The Voronoi diagram is a certain geometric data structure which has found numerous applications in various scientific and technological fields. The theory of algorithms for computing 2D Euclidean Voronoi diagrams of point sites is rich and useful, with several different and important algorithms. However, this theory has been quite steady during the last few decades in the sense that no essentially new algorithms have entered the game. In addition, most of the known algorithms are serial in nature and hence cast inherent difficulties on the possibility to compute the diagram in parallel. In this paper we present the projector algorithm: a new and simple algorithm which enables the (combinatorial) computation of 2D Voronoi diagrams. The algorithm is significantly different from previous ones and some of the involved concepts in it are in the spirit of linear programming and optics. Parallel implementation is naturally supported since each Voronoi cell (actually, even just portions of one cell) can be computed independently of the other cells. A new combinatorial structure for representing the cells (and any convex polytope) is described along the way and the computation of the induced Delaunay graph is obtained almost automatically.},

  abstract     = {Edge-independent spanning trees (for short EISTs) have widespread applications in fault-tolerance to enhance stability and security of networks, as well as in IP fast rerouting to prevent network breakdown caused by link failure. Then, the algorithms for constructing EISTs on many classes of graphs have been investigated. The folded crossed cube was proposed based on the folded cube and the crossed cube, which possesses such appealing properties as short diameter, short mean internode distance and very low message traffic density. In this paper, we study the existence and construction of EISTs with the same root r in the n -dimensional folded crossed cube (for short F C Q n FCQn ). For v ∈ V ( F C Q n ) ∖ { r } v∈V(FCQn)∖{r} and i ∈ { 0 , 1 , ⋯ , n − 1 } i∈{0,1,⋯,n−1} , we first propose two algorithms to obtain the sequence S v , i Sv,i and the set F v Fv , respectively. Then, based on them, an algorithm with time complexity O ( n 2 ) O(n2) by using N processors is proposed to construct n + 1 n+1 EISTs rooted at any vertex r in F C Q n FCQn , where N = 2 n N=2n . And the corresponding theoretical proof and simulation experiments are presented to verify its validity. Since F C Q n FCQn is ( n + 1 ) (n+1) -regular, the result is optimal with respect to the number of EISTs constructed. Moreover, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated experimentally in terms of average distance and average distance-diameter ratio of resulting EISTs.},

The convergence rate of these results is always of order O ( n − 1 / 2 ) O(n−1/2) .

Participants/users in such systems are usually selfish and have private information, such as costs and identities. Budget-feasible mechanism design, as a sub-field of auction theory, is a useful paradigm for crowdsensing, which naturally formulates the procurement scenario with buyers&#39; budgets being considered and allows the users to bid their private costs. Although the bidding behavior is well-regulated, budget-feasible mechanisms are still vulnerable to the Sybil attack where users may generate multiple fake identities to manipulate the system. Thus, it is vital to provide Sybil-proof budget-feasible mechanisms for crowdsensing. In this paper, we design a budget-feasible incentive mechanism which can guarantee truthfulness and deter Sybil attack . We prove that the proposed mechanism achieves individual rationality, truthfulness, budget feasibility, and Sybil-proofness. Extensive simulation results further validate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism.},

This state complexity is defined as the function that assigns the maximal state complexity of the language resulting from the cut operation to the pair of numbers m and n representing the sizes of deterministic finite automata recognizing the operands of this operation. For all considered pairs of classes, we get the exact state complexity of cut. We show that it is m or 1 whenever the first language is a right ideal, and it is m + n − 1 m+n−1 or m + n − 2 m+n−2 if the first language is prefix-closed, prefix-free, or proper prefix-convex. In the other cases, the state complexity of cut is between m n − 2 n − m + 4 mn−2n−m+4 and m n − n + m mn−n+m , the latter being the known state complexity of cut on regular languages.

  abstract     = {An iterated uniform finite-state transducer executes the same length-preserving transduction in iterative sweeps. The first sweep occurs on the input string, while any subsequent sweep works on the output of the previous one. All sweeps always start from the sole initial state. The device accepts upon halting in an accepting state at the end of a sweep. We consider devices with one-way sweep motion and two-way sweep motion, i.e., sweeps are either from left to right only, or strictly alternate from left to right and from right to left. In addition, devices may work deterministically or nondeterministically. We focus on iterated uniform finite-state transducers accepting unary languages , i.e., languages built over single-letter alphabets. We show that any unary regular language can be accepted by a deterministic iterated uniform finite-state transducer with at most max ⁡ { 2 ⋅ ϱ , p } + 1 max⁡{2⋅ϱ,p}+1 states, where ϱ and p are the greatest primes in the factorization of the, respectively, pre-periodic and periodic part of the language. Such a state cost cannot be improved by using two-way motion, and it turns out to greatly outperform in the worst case the state costs of equivalent classical models of finite-state automata. Next, we give a characterization of classes of unary languages accepted by non-constant sweep-bounded iterated uniform finite-state transducers in terms of time-bounded one-way cellular automata . This characterization enables both to exhibit interesting families of unary nonregular languages accepted by iterated uniform finite-state transducers, and to prove the undecidability of several questions related to iterated uniform finite-state transducers accepting unary languages with an amount of sweeps that is at least logarithmic.},

We prove that they admit a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm when parameterized by s and the treewidth of the input graph. The proof is based on a unified algorithm that solves the more general problem in which both edges and vertices can be removed from the input graph to obtain a set of disjoint components with bounded diameter. Our approach can also be exploited to solve a related problem, namely s -Club Cover , which asks whether it is possible to cover the vertices of a graph with at most d different s -clubs, for some fixed d ≥ 1 d≥1 and s ≥ 2 s≥2 .},

In this paper, we study such groups—known as n / k n/k -justifying groups —both theoretically and empirically. First, we show that under the impartial culture model, n / k n/k -justifying groups of size less than k / 2 k/2 are likely to exist, which implies that the number of JR committees is usually large. We then present efficient approximation algorithms that compute a small n / k n/k -justifying group for any given instance, and a polynomial-time exact algorithm when the instance admits a tree representation. In addition, we demonstrate that small n / k n/k -justifying groups can often be useful for obtaining a gender-balanced JR committee even though the problem is NP-hard.},

It is a partitioning operation of the implications which we apply recursively to obtain a binary tree representing a decomposition of the implicational base. We show that this decomposition can be conducted in polynomial time and space in the size of the input implicational base. In order to use our decomposition for the translation task, we focus on the case of acyclic splits. In this case, we obtain a recursive characterization of the meet-irreducible elements of the associated closure system.

  abstract     = {In 2011, Danicic et al. introduced an elegant generalization of the notion of control dependence for any directed graph . They also proposed an algorithm computing the weak control-closure of a subset of graph vertices and performed a paper-and-pencil proof of its correctness. We have performed its machine-checked proof in the Coq proof assistant. This paper also presents a novel, more efficient algorithm called lDFS to compute weak control-closure taking benefit of intermediate propagation results of previous iterations in order to accelerate the following ones. This optimization makes the design of the algorithm more complex and requires subtle loop invariants for its proof. lDFS has been formalized and mechanically proven in the Why3 verification tool. To investigate the impact of several possible optimizations and compare the performances of different versions of the algorithm, we perform experiments on arbitrary generated graphs with up to hundreds of thousands of vertices. They demonstrate that the proposed algorithm remains practical for real-life programs and significantly outperforms all considered versions of Danicic&#39;s initial technique.},

We study such gadgets in the zero-, one-, and two-player settings, in particular extending past motion-planning-through-gadgets work [7] , [8] to zero-player games for the first time, by considering “branchless” connections between gadgets that route every gadget&#39;s exit to a unique gadget&#39;s entrance. Our complexity results include containment in L, NL, P, NP, and PSPACE; as well as hardness for NL, P, NP, and PSPACE. We apply these results to show PSPACE-completeness for certain mechanics in the video games Factorio, [the Sequence], and a restricted version of Trainyard, improving the result of [3] .

  abstract     = {Spiking neural P systems ( SN P systems) are bio-inspired neural-like computational devices that mimic the communication between two nearby neurons and the spike changes in the neuron. This study incorporates concepts of the weight of synapses and the delay on synapses to increase the bio-explainability (the model can better simulate the communication between neurons), where the weight is a natural feature of synapses, and the delay is that in the communication between neurons, through synapses. Thus, an innovative type of spiking neural-like P system is defined, called spiking neural P systems with weights and delays on synapses ( W D S N WDSN P systems). In W D S N WDSN P systems, synapses are assigned weights and delays, where weights are real numbers and delays are natural numbers. Results proved in this paper show that W D S N WDSN P systems can reach Turing universality in the generating and accepting mode. The semi-uniform solution for the Subset Sum problem demonstrates that W D S N WDSN P systems can solve NP -complete problems efficiently.},

  abstract     = {Multi-Key Fully Homomorphic Encryption (MKFHE) supports homomorphic evaluation on ciphertexts encrypted under different keys, guaranteeing data privacy in the case of multiple mutually untrusted parties. In ASIACRYPT 2019, Chen et al. designed an LWE-based MKFHE scheme, which evaluates a boolean gate on ciphertexts followed by a bootstrapping procedure in the dynamic multi-key setting. In this paper, we propose a new MKFHE scheme from NTRU and (R)LWE, achieving better bootstrapping performance. To that end, we adapt Chen et al.&#39;s bootstrapping algorithm to the NTRU setting and construct an efficient conversion from multi-key NTRU to multi-key RLWE ciphertexts. With appropriate parameter choice, our scheme avoids the sublattice attacks that broke previous NTRU-based MKFHE schemes. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept of our construction and conduct experiments to test its performance. Our experiments indicate that gate bootstrapping in our scheme for 2 parties takes 0.18 seconds, which is faster than with Chen et al. by around 5.3 times, but unfortunately does not scale beyond that. It is however practical for uses such as oblivious neural network inference.},

Fortunately, the vast majority of data summarization tasks satisfy an intuitive diminishing returns condition known as submodularity, which allows us to find nearly-optimal solutions in linear time. However, for many applications in practice, including experimental design and sparse Gaussian processes , the objective is in general not submodular. To solve these optimization problems , an important research method is to describe the characteristics of the non-submodular functions. The non-submodular function is a hot research topic in the study of nonlinear combinatorial optimizations . In this paper, we combine and generalize the curvature and the generic submodularity ratio to design an approximation algorithm for two-stage non-submodular maximization under a matroid constraint.},

In this paper, we propose a new definition of adaptive-corruption zero-knowledge proofs that more naturally fits the setting that benefits from adaptive-input selection. We allow the non-rewindable environment to corrupt the prover adaptively based on its visibility of the messages exchanged so far. Then we show a zero-knowledge proof system for NP NP that is doubly adaptive (i.e., it enjoys adaptive-corruption under our stronger notion and adaptive-input selection) matching the same assumptions and round complexity of classical zero-knowledge proofs.},

Moreover, he conjectured a central limit theorem for the (suitably normalized) size as the number of labelings tends to infinity.

In this paper, we strengthen this result by proving that Injective Edge Coloring Problem is NP-complete for bipartite graphs by proving that this problem remains NP-complete for perfect elimination bipartite graphs and star-convex bipartite graphs, which are proper subclasses of bipartite graphs.

Since the previously defined distance-hereditary digraphs do not permit a recursive structure , we define directed twin-distance-hereditary graphs, which can be constructed by several twin and pendant vertex operations analogously to undirected distance-hereditary graphs and which still preserves the distance hereditary property . We give a characterization by forbidden induced subdigraphs and place the class in a hierarchy comparing it to related classes. We further show algorithmic advantages concerning directed width parameters, directed graph coloring and some other well-known digraph problems which are NP-hard in general, but computable in polynomial or even linear time on twin-distance-hereditary digraphs . This includes computability of directed path-width and tree-width in linear time and the directed chromatic number in polynomial time . From our result that directed twin-distance-hereditary graphs have directed clique-width at most 3 it follows by Courcelle&#39;s theorem on directed clique-width that we can compute every graph problem describable in monadic second-order logic on quantification over vertices and vertex sets as well as some further problems like Hamiltonian Path/Cycle in polynomial time .},

A Searcher searches the graph with the aim of finding all the targets with maximum probability. Here, we focus on the game in the case that the graph is a cycle. In the case that there is only one target, we solve the game for equal success probabilities, and for a class of games with unequal success probabilities. For multiple targets and equal success probabilities, we give a solution for an adaptive Searcher and a solution in a special case for a non-adaptive Searcher.

As a result, the reliability evaluation of the two kinds of networks is very important. And most scholars study the reliability of specific networks. In this paper, we put forward a kind of complete graph-based recursive networks (short as CGRNs) which includes data center networks—DCell and generalized DCell, as well as the interconnection network dragonfly, etc. Then we further investigate the reliability of such networks—the connectivity, the diagnosability under the pessimistic diagnosis strategy based on the PMC model, g -restrict connectivity, and the g -good-neighbor conditional diagnosabilities under the PMC model and the MM ⁎ model. As applications, previous results of DCell networks can be directly obtained and new results on the connectivity, diagnosability under the pessimistic strategy diagnosis based on the PMC model, g -restrict connectivity, and the g -good-neighbor conditional diagnosabilities under the PMC model and the MM ⁎ model of networks (such as generalized DCell networks and dragonfly networks), are derived. Even these reliability results can be obtained for some other networks different from DCell networks, generalized DCell networks, and dragonfly networks. In addition, it can be seen that the diagnosability under the pessimistic diagnosis strategy based on the PMC model, the g -restrict connectivity, and the g -good-neighbor conditional diagnosabilities under the PMC model and the MM ⁎ model of G r Gr are about 2 times of its diagnosability, g + 1 g+1 times of its connectivity, and g + 1 g+1 times of its diagnosability, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Partial word finite automata are deterministic finite automata that may have state transitions on a special symbol ⋄ which represents an unknown symbol or a hole in the word. Together with a subset of the input alphabet that gives the symbols which may be substituted for the ⋄, a partial word finite automaton (⋄-DFA) represents a regular language. However, this substitution implies a certain form of limited nondeterminism in the computations when the ⋄-transitions are replaced by ordinary transitions. In this paper we consider the state complexity of partial word finite automata accepting finite languages. We study the state complexity of the NFA to ⋄-DFA conversion for finite languages as well as the state complexity of the ⋄-DFA to DFA conversion for finite languages. Then we consider the operational state complexity with respect to complementation, union, reversal, and concatenation of finite languages. It turns out that the upper and lower bounds for all these operations are exponential. Moreover, we establish a state complexity hierarchy on the number of productive ⋄-transitions that may appear in ⋄-DFAs accepting finite languages. The levels of the hierarchy are separated by quadratic state costs.},

  abstract     = {We consider parsers of deterministic context-free languages and study the sizes of their syntax checking components. More precisely, we allow the input processing from left to right or, alternatively, from right to left, whatever is best for the given language. As practical examples, we establish an infinite sequence of deterministic context-free languages L k Lk , for k ≥ 1 k≥1 , such that there is an exponential size trade-off between a deterministic pushdown automaton that reads its input from right to left and another one that reads its input from left to right. Concerning the constructibility of such a parser out of a given deterministic context-free language, it is shown that it is undecidable whether the reversal of a given deterministic context-free language is again deterministic context free. Related to decidability questions, it turns out that the size trade-offs between deterministic pushdown automata that represent the reversals of their accepted languages and deterministic pushdown automata that represent their accepted languages are non-recursive. That is, one can choose an arbitrarily large recursive function ϱ , but the gain in economy of description eventually exceeds ϱ when changing from the former system to the latter. Furthermore, we study the expressive capacity of the family of languages whose reversals are deterministic context free. Finally, we turn to the family of deterministic context-free languages whose reversals are also deterministic context free and collect several of their closure properties.},

  abstract     = {While consensus (and more generally agreement problems) is at the heart of many coordination problems in asynchronous distributed systems prone to process crashes, it has been shown to be impossible to solve in such systems where processes communicate by message-passing or by reading and writing a shared memory. Hence, these systems must be enriched with additional computational power for consensus to be solved on top of them. This article presents a new restriction of the classical basic computational model that combines process participation and a constraint on failure occurrences that can happen only while a predefined contention threshold has not yet been bypassed. This type of failure is called λ-constrained crashes , where λ defines the considered contention threshold. It appears that when assuming such contention-related crash failures and enriching the system with objects whose consensus number is x ≥ 1 x≥1 , consensus for n processes can be solved for any n ≥ x n≥x assuming up to x failures. The article proceeds incrementally. It first presents an algorithm that solves consensus on top of read/write registers if at most one crash occurs before the contention threshold λ = n − 1 λ=n−1 has been bypassed. Then, the article considers two extensions. The first one assumes that the system is enriched with objects whose consensus number is x ≥ 1 x≥1 , and shows that when λ = n − x λ=n−x , consensus can be solved despite up to x λ -constrained crashes, for any n ≥ x n≥x , and when λ = n − 2 x + 1 λ=n−2x+1 , consensus can be solved despite up to 2 x − 1 2x−1 λ -constrained crashes, assuming x divides n . The second extension prolongs the previous results to the k -set agreement problem (which is a natural generalization of consensus). Impossibility results are also presented for the number of λ -constrained failures that can be tolerated.},

In both models, the adversary gives r inputs in each round and only indicates a correct answer if all r guesses are correct. The only difference between the two models is that in the delayed, ambiguous model, the learner must answer each input before receiving the next input of the round, while the learner receives all r inputs at once in the weak reinforcement model. In the second part of the paper, we investigate models for online learning with permutation patterns, in which a learner attempts to learn a permutation from a set of permutations by guessing statistics related to sub-permutations. For these permutation models, we prove sharp bounds on the price of bandit feedback. One of our lower bounds for online learning of permutations improves on a lower bound of Goldman, Rivest, and Schapire (1993) and matches an upper bound from the same paper.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce the Matroid-Constrained Vertex Cover problem: given a graph with weights on the edges and a matroid imposed on the vertices, our problem is to choose a subset of vertices that is independent in the matroid, with the objective of maximizing the total weight of covered edges. This problem is a generalization of the much studied max k -vertex cover problem, in which the matroid is the simple uniform matroid, and it is also a special case of the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a matroid constraint. In the first part of this work, we give a Fixed-Parameter Tractable Approximation Scheme (FPT-AS) when the given matroid is a partition matroid, a laminar matroid, or a transversal matroid. Precisely, if k is the rank of the matroid, we obtain ( 1 − ε ) (1−ε) approximation using ( 1 / ε ) O ( k ) n O ( 1 ) (1/ε)O(k)nO(1) time for partition and laminar matroids and using ( 1 / ε + k ) O ( k ) n O ( 1 ) (1/ε+k)O(k)nO(1) time for transversal matroids. This extends a result of Manurangsi for uniform matroids [33] . We also show that these ideas can be applied in the context of (single-pass) streaming algorithms. Besides, our FPT-AS introduces a new technique based on matroid union, which may be of independent interest in extremal combinatorics. In the second part, we consider general matroids. We propose a simple local search algorithm that guarantees 2 / 3 ≈ 0.66 2/3≈0.66 approximation . For the more general problem where two matroids are imposed on the vertices and a feasible solution must be a common independent set, we show that a local search algorithm gives a 2 / 3 ⋅ ( 1 − 1 / ( p + 1 ) ) 2/3⋅(1−1/(p+1)) approximation in n O ( p ) nO(p) time, for any integer p . We also provide some evidence to show that with the constraint of one or two matroids, the approximation ratio of 2/3 is likely the best possible, using the currently known techniques of local search.},

  abstract     = {We initiate research on self-stabilization in highly dynamic identified message-passing systems where dynamics is modeled using time-varying graphs (TVGs). More precisely, we address the self-stabilizing leader election problem in three wide classes of TVGs: the class TC B ( Δ ) TCB(Δ) of TVGs with temporal diameter bounded by Δ, the class TC Q ( Δ ) TCQ(Δ) of TVGs with temporal diameter quasi-bounded by Δ, and the class TC R TCR of TVGs with recurrent connectivity only, where TC B ( Δ ) ⊆ TC Q ( Δ ) ⊆ TC R TCB(Δ)⊆TCQ(Δ)⊆TCR . We first study conditions under which our problem can be solved. We introduce the notion of size-ambiguity to show that the assumption on the knowledge of the number n of processes is central. Our results reveal that, despite the existence of unique process identifiers, any deterministic self-stabilizing leader election algorithm working on the class TC Q ( Δ ) TCQ(Δ) or TC R TCR cannot be size-ambiguous, justifying why our solutions for those classes assume the exact knowledge of n . We then present three self-stabilizing leader election algorithms for Classes TC B ( Δ ) TCB(Δ) , TC Q ( Δ ) TCQ(Δ) , and TC R TCR , respectively. Our algorithm for TC B ( Δ ) TCB(Δ) stabilizes in at most 3Δ rounds. However, we show that stabilization time cannot be bounded for the leader election problem in TC Q ( Δ ) TCQ(Δ) and TC R TCR . Nevertheless, we circumvent this issue by showing that our solutions are speculative in the sense that their stabilization time in TC B ( Δ ) TCB(Δ) ( ⊆ TC Q ( Δ ) ⊆ TC R ⊆TCQ(Δ)⊆TCR ) is O ( Δ ) O(Δ) rounds.},

  abstract     = {Given two sequences A and B of lengths m and n , respectively, the consecutive suffix alignment (CSA) problem is to compute the longest common subsequence (LCS) between A and each suffix of B . The data structure of two-dimensional matrix for solving the CSA problem is named S-table. The S-table would be infeasible due to its quadratic-space requirement for long sequences. The linear-space S-table, proposed by Alves et al. (2005), consists of the first row of the S-table and the changes between every two consecutive rows. However, there is no further discussions and practical applications for the linear-space S-table. This paper proposes algorithms for improving three problems, related to LCS and S-table, by using the linear-space S-table. Suppose that A = A ( 1 ) A ( 2 ) A(1)A(2) (concatenation of two substrings), and we are given the S-table of A ( 2 ) A(2) and B , as well as the alignment result (LCS length) of A ( 1 ) A(1) to each prefix of B . The concatenated LCS (CoLCS) problem is to find the alignment result of A and B . For the CoLCS problem, this paper proposes an O( n )-time algorithm with the technique of set union-find to achieve the linear space. Next, for merging two linear S-tables, we propose an O ( n log ⁡ n ) (nlog⁡n) -time algorithm with the technique of range query and update to improve the quadratic-time algorithm using quadratic-space S-tables. Then, we propose an O( n )-time algorithm to update the linear-space S-table of A and B to obtain the linear-space S-table of Aσ and B , where σ denotes a new character appended to the tail of A . For further applications to long sequences by using the linear-space S-table, the algorithms proposed in this paper are essential and necessary.},

The main computational challenge in this context is the clearing problem, a fixed point search problem that essentially determines insolvent firms and their exposure to systemic risk , technically known as recovery rates. When Credit Default Swaps, a derivative connected to the 2008 financial crisis, are factored into the obligations, the clearing problem becomes more complex. Specifically, whenever insolvent firms pay their debts proportionally to their recovery rates, computing a weakly approximate solution was shown by Schuldenzucker et al. (2017) to be PPAD PPAD -complete. Additionally, Ioannidis et al. (2022) showed that computing a strongly approximate solution in the same framework is FIXP FIXP -complete. This paper addresses the computational complexity of the clearing problem in financial networks with derivatives, whenever payment priorities among creditors are applied. This practically relevant model has only been studied from a game-theoretic standpoint. We explicitly study the clearing problem whenever the firms pay according to a singleton liability priority list and prove that it is FIXP -complete. Finally, we provide a number of NP NP -hardness results for the computation of priority lists that optimise specific objectives of importance in the domain.},

In this paper we mainly address its online time and the length of signature issues, and propose a new and efficient paradigm of its construction for lattice assumptions over rings. In this paradigm the signer tries to sign for a random string and the message respectively. Specifically, we first discuss the generic construction of Fiat-Shamir lattice-based signatures. Then for a large class of lattice-based relations over rings, we propose an improved framework designed for low-power devices. This new framework allows the signer to extract a part of the signature only for a random string chosen in offline time, and thus can obtain the whole signature by less online time. In addition, the resulting scheme slightly reduces the signature size compared to the Fiat-Shamir counterparts. The performance analysis shows that our construction is efficient.},

The edge spectrum of F F is the set of all possible sizes of F F -saturated graphs on n vertices.

Determining the minimum or maximum number of edges in n -vertex F F -saturated graphs are two of the most important problems in the study of extremal graph theory. This is also a very important optimization problem in graph theory. The study of this problem is closely related to the development of other branches of mathematics, computer science, network, modern information science and technology.

We consider the compelling fairness notion of envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) in conjunction with Pareto-optimality (PO). Amanatidis et al. [1] showed that when there are at most two utility values, an EFX allocation can be computed in polynomial-time. We improve this result by showing that for such instances an allocation that is EFX and PO can be computed in polynomial-time. This is the first class apart from identical or binary valuations, for which EFX+PO allocations are shown to exist and are polynomial-time computable. In contrast, we show that when there are three utility values, EFX+PO allocations need not exist, and even deciding if EFX+PO allocations exist is NP-hard. Our techniques allow us to obtain similar results for the fairness notion of equitability up to any good (EQX) together with PO. We show that for instances with two positive values an EQX+PO allocation can be computed in polynomial-time, and deciding if an EQX+PO allocation exists is NP-hard when there are three utility values. We also study the problem of maximizing Nash welfare (MNW), and show that our EFX+PO algorithm returns an allocation that approximates the MNW to a factor of 1.061 for two valued instances, in addition to being EFX+PO. In contrast, we show that for three valued instances, computing an MNW allocation is APX-hard. Finally, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an MNW allocation for two-valued instances where the ratio of the two values is greater than a certain threshold.},

In this work, we develop a query-efficient reduction from more general games to Lipschitz games. We use this reduction to show a query lower bound for any randomized algorithm finding ϵ -approximate pure Nash equilibria of n -player, binary-action, λ -Lipschitz games that is exponential in n λ / ϵ nλ/ϵ . In addition, we introduce “Multi-Lipschitz games,” a generalization involving player-specific Lipschitz values, and provide a reduction from finding equilibria of these games to finding equilibria of Lipschitz games, showing that the value of interest is the average of the individual Lipschitz parameters. Finally, we provide an exponential lower bound on the deterministic query complexity of finding ϵ -approximate Nash equilibria of n -player, m -action, λ -Lipschitz games for strong values of ϵ , motivating the consideration of explicitly randomized algorithms in the above results.},

  abstract     = {Profit Maximization in social advertising aims at selecting some users of social network as initial adopters and information sources to trigger the spread of promotion information such that the profit generated by all the adopters reaches maximum when the dissemination terminates. A lot of related works mainly study this problem under three assumptions: pure network, single product and one-dimension diffusion model . However, in real advertising activities conducted in social networks, advertisement of competitive products may spread almost at the same time. And there are many factors that can influence the probability with which a potential consumer makes an adoption. For the purpose of approximating real social advertising, we propose the Dual-Attribute Compete (DAC) model where attributes of both potential consumers and competitive products are taken into consideration and the information about competitive products can spread simultaneously. Therefore, it can capture not only the competition between different products but also the reaction of potential consumers to products. Under DAC model, we study the Competition-based Generalized Self-profit Maximization (CGSM) problem whose purpose is selecting at most k individuals to form an optimal seed set as the source of information diffusion to maximize the profit related to adopters. Given that the objective function of CGSM problem is generally nonsubmodular, we design R-CGSM algorithm to tackle it. Based on the analysis of martingale and the concept of Shapley value, this algorithm uses sandwich method to get a pretty good solution of CGSM problem. We evaluate the R-CGSM algorithm by conducting experiments on four different data sets representing a synthetic network and three social networks in real world, respectively. Results of experiments validate the effectiveness and accuracy of R-CGSM algorithm.},

For each of these graph families, we present space-efficient algorithms for the Reachability problem. For intersection graphs of Jordan regions, we show how to obtain a “good” vertex separator in a space-efficient manner and use it to solve the Reachability in polynomial time and O(m1/2log⁡n) space, where n is the number of Jordan regions, and m is the total number of crossings among the regions. We use a similar approach for chordal graphs and obtain a polynomial time and O(m1/2log⁡n) space algorithm, where n and m are the number of vertices and edges, respectively. However, for unit contact disk graphs (penny graphs), we use a more involved technique and obtain a better algorithm. We show that for every ϵ&amp;gt;0 , there exists a polynomial time algorithm that can solve Reachability in an n vertex directed penny graph, using O(n1/4+ϵ) space. We note that the method used to solve penny graphs does not extend naturally to the class of geometric intersection graphs that include arbitrary size cliques .},

For the utilitarian objective, we present a weakly group-strategyproof efficient mechanism for up to three facilities, we give strongly group-strategyproof mechanisms that achieve approximation ratios of 5/3 and 2 for k = 1 k=1 and k &gt; 1 k&amp;gt;1 , respectively, and we prove that no strongly group-strategyproof mechanism achieves an approximation ratio less than 5/3 for the case of a single facility.

Here, this approach is advanced by stating and proving equivalent conditions for second-order stochastic dominance , a widely used way of comparing probability distributions by their spread. Furthermore, we lay the foundation for the theory of comparing statistical experiments within Markov categories by stating and proving the classical Blackwell–Sherman–Stein Theorem. Our version not only offers new insight into the proof, but its abstract nature also makes the result more general, automatically specializing to the standard Blackwell–Sherman–Stein Theorem in measure-theoretic probability as well as a Bayesian version that involves prior-dependent garbling. Along the way, we define and characterize representable Markov categories, within which one can talk about Markov kernels to or from spaces of distributions . We do so by exploring the relation between Markov categories and Kleisli categories of probability monads.},

  abstract     = {Temporal graphs have been recently introduced to model changes in a given network that occur throughout a fixed period of time . The Temporal Δ Clique problem, which generalizes the well known Clique problem to temporal graphs, has been studied in the context of finding nodes of interest in dynamic networks [TCS &#39;16]. We introduce the Temporal Δ Independent Set problem, a temporal generalization of Independent Set . This problem is e.g. motivated in the context of finding conflict-free schedules for maximum subsets of tasks, that have certain (time-varying) constraints within a given time period. We are specifically interested in the case where each task needs to be performed in a certain time-interval on each day and two tasks are in conflict on a certain day if their time-intervals on that day overlap. This leads us to consider both problems on the restricted class of temporal unit interval graphs , i.e. , temporal graphs where each layer is a unit interval graph. We present several hardness results as well as positive results. On the algorithmic side, we provide constant-factor approximation algorithms for instances of both problems where τ , the total number of time steps (layers) of the temporal graph, and Δ, a parameter that allows us to model conflict tolerance, are constants. We develop an exact FPT algorithm for Temporal Δ Clique with respect to parameter τ + k τ+k . Finally, we use the notion of order preservation for temporal unit interval graphs that, informally, requires the intervals of every layer to obey a common ordering. For both problems, we provide an FPT algorithm parameterized by the size of minimum vertex deletion set to order preservation.},

Given a tour as a sequence of pickups and deliveries, there exist polynomial time algorithms to find a schedule respecting these constraints (provided that there exists one). However, if no such schedule exists, it is natural to ask for a schedule minimising constraint violations. We model a generic fixed-sequence scheduling problem, which we call Min Pickup-Delivery Scheduling , that allows violation of time window constraints (by late visits) and ride time constraints, both penalised with linear penalty functions. Although our model only considers these two types of time constraints, we show that it can express other common time constraints such as earliness and waiting times. We prove that Min Pickup-Delivery Scheduling is APX -hard, even in the very restrictive case where only the ride time constraints can be violated and the time windows have the same length. Conversely, when only the time window constraints can be violated (by late visits), we present a polynomial time algorithm to solve the problem. Then we focus on instances with some specific structural properties and present two polynomial-time algorithms: one for the case where all the ride time constraints are bounded by a constant, and a second one for the case where all the pickups precede all the deliveries in the sequence of stops.},

  abstract     = {The Maximum Weight Stable Set Problem (MWS) is a well-known NP-hard problem. A popular way to study MWS is to detect graph classes for which MWS can be solved in polynomial time . In this context some decomposition approaches have been introduced in the literature, in particular decomposition by homogeneous sets and decomposition by clique separators, which had several applications in the literature. Brandstädt and Hoàng (2007) [6] showed how to combine such two decomposition approaches and stated the following result: If the MWS problem can be solved in polynomial time for every subgraph of a graph G which has no homogeneous set and has no clique separators then so can the problem for G . This result, namely Corollary 9 of [6] , was used in various papers. Unfortunately, it was stated in a successive paper by Brandstädt and Giakoumakis (2015) [5] that “Actually, [6] does not give a proof for this, and it seems that Corollary 9 of [6] promises too much; later attempts for proving it failed, and thus, it is unproven and its use has to be avoided.” This manuscript introduces a proof of Corollary 9 of [6] . Furthermore a third decomposition approach, namely decomposition by anti-neighborhoods of vertices, is combined together with such two decomposition approaches. Then the various papers in which Corollary 9 of [6] was used would be fixed.},

Besides, our scheme achieves semi-adaptive security under bilateral k -Lin assumption and SXDH assumption in a pairing group. Keep the same as the previous constructions, the scheme supports monotone span program as a policy and does not rely on the random oracle. Technically, we follow Wang et al.&#39;s “linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS) + inner-product functional encryption (IPFE)” paradigm [PKC&#39;19] and use (an extended variant of) functional encryption for quadratic functions (QFE) in the place of IPFE. By this, we encrypt with sublinear-size random coins and later expand them to linear-size entropy for security proof. Roughly, the use of QFE requires bilateral k -Lin assumption while the entropy expansion relies on SXDH .},

This paper considers a network of positive (i.e. trusting) or negative (distrusting) social relationships where every individual has an initial positive or negative opinion (about a topic, a product, or whatever else) that changes over time, at discrete time-steps, due to the influences each individual gets from its neighbors. Here, the influence of a trusted neighbor is consistent with the neighbor&#39;s opinion, while the influence of a distrusted neighbor is opposite to the neighbor&#39;s opinion. At any time, an individual gets one of the two opinions if, at that time, the majority of its neighbors influences the individual to behave so. Given an initial opinion configuration for all the individual, natural questions in this setting are if a given arrival opinion configuration or an equilibrium opinion configuration will ever be reached or if all individuals in a given set will ever get the same (positive) opinion at the same time. All such questions will be proved to result in problems that are tractable if all the relationships are symmetric (that is, the underlying signed graph is undirected), and that are PSpace -complete if the underlying graph is directed even when all the relationships are positive.},

  abstract     = {It is known that Bitcoin enables achieving fairness in secure computation by imposing monetary penalties on adversarial parties. This functionality is called secure computation with penalties . Bentov and Kumaresan (2014) [9] introduced the claim-or-refund functionality that can be implemented via Bitcoin. They achieved secure computation with penalties with O ( n ) O(n) rounds and O ( n ) O(n) broadcasts for any function, where n is the number of parties. After that, Kumaresan and Bentov (2014) [8] showed a constant-round protocol. Unfortunately, this protocol requires O ( n 2 ) O(n2) broadcasts. As far as we know, no protocol achieves O ( 1 ) O(1) rounds and O ( n ) O(n) broadcasts based on Bitcoin. This work accomplishes such efficiency in secure computation with penalties. We first show a protocol in a slightly relaxed setting called secure computation with non-equivalent penalties . This setting is the same as secure computation with penalties except that every honest party receives more than a predetermined amount of compensation, while the previous one requires that every honest party receives the same amount of compensation. Namely, our setting allows the compensations for honest parties to be non-equivalent. Moreover, we present a technique to remove the non-equivalence of our protocol without sacrificing efficiency. We then propose a new ideal functionality called claim-refund-or-give that can be implemented via Bitcoin.},

  abstract     = {Non-deterministic constraint logic ( NCL ) is a simple model of computation based on orientations of a constraint graph with edge weights and vertex demands. NCL captures PSPACE and has been a useful tool for proving algorithmic hardness of many puzzles, games, and reconfiguration problems . In particular, its usefulness stems from the fact that it remains PSPACE -complete even under severe restrictions of the weights (e.g., only edge-weights one and two are needed) and the structure of the constraint graph (e.g., planar and/or graphs of bounded bandwidth). While such restrictions on the structure of constraint graphs do not seem to limit the expressiveness of NCL , the building blocks of the constraint graphs cannot be limited without losing expressiveness: We consider as parameters the number of weight-one edges and the number of weight-two edges of a constraint graph, as well as the number of and or or vertices of an and/or constraint graph. We show that NCL is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) for any of these parameters. In particular, for NCL parameterized by the number of weight-one edges or the number of and vertices, we obtain a linear kernel. It follows that, in a sense, NCL as introduced by Hearn and Demaine is defined in the most economical way for the purpose of capturing PSPACE .},

  abstract     = {As data center networks and network-on-chip are developing rapidly, many graph invariants have been proposed to measure the reliability and fault tolerance of the network so that the multiprocessor systems can be ensured to operate efficiently and smoothly. The g -component connectivity of a graph G , denoted by c κ g ( G ) cκg(G) , is the minimum size of vertex cut such that G has at least g components. The g -good neighbor connectivity of a graph G , represented by κ g ( G ) κg(G) , is the minimum size of vertex cut such that each vertex has at least g fault-free neighbors. Motivated by the conditional connectivities above, the g -component diagnosability ( c t g ( G ) ctg(G) ) and g -good neighbor diagnosability ( t g ( G ) tg(G) ) of graph G have been suggested to evaluate the fault diagnostic capability of multiprocessor systems successively. In this paper, we determine the ( g + 1 ) (g+1) -component connectivity of folded crossed cubes F C Q n FCQn , i.e., c κ g + 1 ( F C Q n ) = n g − g 2 2 + g 2 + 1 cκg+1(FCQn)=ng−g22+g2+1 for 1 ≤ g ≤ ⌊ n 2 ⌋ 1≤g≤⌊n2⌋ , and ( g + 1 ) (g+1) -component diagnosability of F C Q n FCQn under the PMC model and ⁎ MM ⁎ MM⁎ model, i.e., c t g + 1 ( F C Q n ) = n g + n − g 2 2 − g 2 + 1 ctg+1(FCQn)=ng+n−g22−g2+1 .

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral images contain both spatial and spectral information , which makes it has great advantages in the field of target identification, material determination, etc. However, hyperspectral image acquisition systems usually output massive amounts of data. Compressed sensing ( CS ) and single dispatchers coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging ( SD-CASSI ) were proposed to compress the amount of data. These systems usually use numerical optimization methods to do image reconstruction by finding the optimal reconstructed image. This method generates a large number of iterative calculations, which is time-consuming. In this paper, we modeled the image reconstruction for SC-CASSI as a non-linear optimization problem and proved that the number of iterations of the solution process is exponential. We proposed an attention-driven reconstruction algorithm for SD-CASSI systems. The algorithm mainly consists of an initial convolution block and residual attention modules. A channel attention module is also introduced to mine spectrally correlated features in raw signals. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to three states-of-art reconstruction algorithms for CS-based systems. The reconstruction speed of the system is also increased by 94\% compared with the numerical method.},

Each of these semantics has a distinct role when verifying security protocols. Testing semantics are suited to security and privacy problems expressed in terms of a process equivalence problem, where tests define the space of attack strategies. A labelled equivalence is suited to proving the given equivalence problem when such security and privacy properties hold; while, dually, the modal logic describes attacks when such security or privacy properties are violated. For this particular investigation into this good-practice design pattern , we select what is perhaps the most powerful (interleaving) testing semantics: open barbed bisimilarity . Selecting open barbed bisimilarity comes with the bonus that it is a congruence hence is suited to compositional reasoning. This reference testing semantics leads to a notion of quasi-open bisimilarity and an intuitionistic modal logic for the applied π -calculus. We argue that, since we characterise the finest (interleaving) testing semantics and tests are attack strategies, our intuitionistic modal logic can describe all attacks whenever a privacy property expressed as an equivalence problem fails.},

The main particularity of the model is the usage of numerical variables whose values are shared among applicable rules, contrary to the concurrence for objects in the multiset for the traditional P systems case. In 2007, Freund and Verlan developed a formal framework for P systems to capture most of the essential features of P systems and to define their functioning in a formal way. Subsequent papers developed versions of this framework for the case of spiking neural P systems and P systems with dynamically evolving structure. These results permitted to obtain a different view on P systems giving a general framework to analyze, relate and extend different variants of P systems and other related models, like Petri nets or register machines. This paper aims to provide a similar generalization for the case of numerical P systems (NPS) and related variants like enzymatic or generalized NPS. We call the obtained model Numerical Networks of Cells (NNC). As in the case of the formal framework it allows to accurately describe NPS, as well as other types of P systems like those using fuzzy sets as computation support. Also, the new model generalizes other well-known models like Boolean networks or reaction systems and this can potentially help to bring bridges between P systems and these areas.},

First, we prove that the problem remains NP-complete for the class of planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree three and arbitrarily large girth. Also, the problem remains NP-complete for the class of planar line graphs with maximum degree four. Moreover, we study the parameterized complexity of the problem. In particular, we prove that the problem is W[1]-hard on bipartite graphs with respect to the parameter k . On the other hand, the problem is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the parameters treewidth, modular-width and ( k , c 4 ) (k,c4) , where c 4 c4 is the number of cycles with length 4 of the input graph.

Different from the traditional system level fault diagnosis models, the new fault diagnosis model, hybrid PMC model (short for HPMC model), is suitable to the circumstances that the processor and link faults occur simultaneously. Under the HPMC model, the q -edge restricted diagnosability of a system H , denoted by t q e ( H ) tqe(H) , is the maximum number p such that H can correctly identify all the faulty elements containing p faulty processors and at most q faulty links. Similarly, the p -vertex restricted edge-diagnosability of a system H , denoted by s p v ( H ) spv(H) , is the maximum number q such that H can correctly identify all the faulty elements containing q faulty links and at most p faulty processors. These two diagnosability are collectively referred to as partial diagnosability. We investigate and determine the q -edge restricted diagnosability of a system H under the HPMC model for q ≥ η ( H ) q≥η(H) , where η ( H ) = max ⁡ { | N ( u ) ∩ N ( v ) | | u v ∈ E ( H ) } η(H)=max⁡{|N(u)∩N(v)||uv∈E(H)} .

Compared with the compound graph DQcube ( D Q n DQn ), D F Q n DFQn shows better performance in terms of many metrics such as diameter, connectivity and layout cost. In detail, we first show that the connectivity, edge-connectivity and tightly super connectivity are n + 2 n+2 uniformly. Furthermore, we show that h -extra connectivity of D F Q n DFQn is κ h ( D F Q n ) = ( h + 1 ) ( n + 2 ) − 2 h − ( h 2 ) κh(DFQn)=(h+1)(n+2)−2h−(h2) .},

This work presents a sublinear solution to k -SAT and demonstrates that k -colouring can be reduced to k -SAT in constant time.

  abstract     = {In recent years, event-driven programming languages , in particular those based on Event Condition Action (ECA) rules, have emerged as a promising paradigm for implementing ubiquitous and pervasive systems . These implementations are mostly centralized, where a single server (often in the cloud) collects and processes all the inputs from the environment. In fact, placing the computation on the nodes interacting with the environment requires suitable abstractions for effective communication and coordination of (possibly large) ensembles of these distributed components — abstractions that current ECA languages are still missing. To this end, in this paper we present AbU, a calculus for modeling and reasoning about ECA-based systems with attribute-based communication . The latter is an interaction model recently introduced for the coordination of (possibly large) families of nodes: communication is similar to broadcast but the actual receivers are selected on the spot, by means of predicates over nodes properties. Thus, the programmer can specify interactions between nodes in a declarative way, abstracting from details such as nodes identity, number, or even their existence, without the need for a central server: the computation is moved on the “edge”, thus improving reliability, scalability, privacy and security. After having defined syntax and formal semantics of AbU, we showcase its expressiveness by providing some example applications and the encoding of AbC, the archetypal calculus with attribute-based communication. Then, we focus on two key properties of reactive systems: stabilization (i.e., termination of internal steps) and confluence . For both these properties we provide formal semantic definition, sufficient syntactic conditions on AbU systems, and algorithms to statically check such conditions. Hence, AbU is both a basis for the formal analysis of event-driven architectures with attributed-based interaction, and a reference model for a full-fledged language for IoT and edge computing .},

In this paper, a similar characterization is established for a family of grammars equipped with operators for referring to the left context of any substring, recently defined by Barash and Okhotin (“An extension of context-free grammars with one-sided context specifications”, Inform. Comput. , 2014). An essential step of the argument is a new normal form for grammars with context operators, in which every nonterminal symbol defines only strings of odd length in left contexts of even length: the even-odd normal form. The characterization is completed by showing that the language family defined by grammars with context operators is closed under inverse homomorphisms; actually, it is closed under injective nondeterministic finite transductions.},

Finding as many as possible many-to-many edge-disjoint paths is conducive to improving the fault-tolerance of such networks. As an interconnection network topology, (n,k) -enhanced hypercube Qn,k ( 1≤k≤n−1 ), is a momentous variant of well-known hypercube . For integers 1≤l≤n−1 and n≥2 , let δ=0 if 1≤l≤n−k , and δ=1 if n−k+1≤l≤n−1 . This paper offers a unified method to determine the minimum cardinalities of faulty links in Qn,k , whose malfunction divides this network into several connected components such that each processor has at least l+δ neighbors, each component contains no less than 2l processors and the number of average neighbors for all processors is at least l+δ , respectively. Under these three different link-faulty assumptions, but for the condition of k=2 and l=n−2 , the minimum cardinalities of such faulty links share the same value (n−l−δ+1)2l . And the value in the exceptional case is (n−l−δ)2l+1=2n−1 . In other words, we find the maximum numbers of many-to-many edge-disjoint paths of Qn,k under the above three hypotheses, which offers refined measurements for the reliability and fault-tolerance of interconnection networks .},

Functions over integer lattice have been defined submodular property that is similar to submodularity of set functions. DR-submodular is a further extended submodular concept for functions over the integer lattice, which captures the diminishing return property. Such functions find many applications in machine learning , social networks, wireless networks, etc. The techniques for submodular set function maximization can be applied to DR-submodular function maximization, e.g., the double greedy algorithm has a 1/2-approximation ratio, whose running time is O ( n B ) O(nB) , where n is the size of the ground set, B is the integer bound of a coordinate. In our study, we design a 1/2-approximate binary search double greedy algorithm , and we prove that its time complexity is O ( n log ⁡ B ) O(nlog⁡B) , which significantly improves the running time. Specifically, we consider its application to the profit maximization problem in social networks with a bipartite model, the goal of this problem is to maximize the net profit gained from a product promoting activity, which is the difference of the influence gain and the promoting cost. We prove that the objective function is DR-submodular over integer lattice. We apply binary search double greedy algorithm to this problem and verify the effectiveness.},

Given an n -vertex undirected graph G with nonnegative weights defined on edges, and a positive integer k , the Max k -Uncut problem asks to find a k -partition of the vertices of G to maximize the total weight of edges that are not in the cut. This problem is the complement of the classic Min k -Cut problem, and has close relation to many combinatorial optimization problems , including the famous Densest k -Subgraph problem. In this paper, we propose a greedy approximation algorithm for the Max k -Uncut problem with performance ratio 1 − 2 ( k − 1 ) n 1−2(k−1)n . The algorithm is very simple, which consists of only k − 1 k−1 min cut computations. The algorithm has fast running time O ( k n 2 ) O(kn2) and is hence implementable. The experimental results show that the algorithm has excellent practical performance.},

  abstract     = {In a constructive setting, no concrete formulation of ordinal numbers can simultaneously have all the properties one might be interested in; for example, being able to calculate limits of sequences is constructively incompatible with deciding extensional equality. Using homotopy type theory as the foundational setting, we develop an abstract framework for ordinal theory and establish a collection of desirable properties and constructions. We then study and compare three concrete implementations of ordinals in homotopy type theory: first, a notation system based on Cantor normal forms (binary trees); second, a refined version of Brouwer trees (infinitely-branching trees); and third, extensional well-founded orders. Each of our three formulations has the central properties expected of ordinals, such as being equipped with an extensional and well-founded ordering as well as allowing basic arithmetic operations , but they differ with respect to what they make possible in addition. For example, for finite collections of ordinals, Cantor normal forms have decidable properties, but suprema of infinite collections cannot be computed. In contrast, extensional well-founded orders work well with infinite collections, but the price to pay is that almost all properties are undecidable. Brouwer trees, implemented as a quotient inductive-inductive type to ensure well-foundedness and extensionality , take the sweet spot in the middle by combining a restricted form of decidability with the ability to work with infinite increasing sequences. Our three approaches are connected by canonical order-preserving functions from the “more decidable” to the “less decidable” notions, i.e. from Cantor normal forms to Brouwer trees, and from there to extensional well-founded orders. We have formalised the results on Cantor normal forms and Brouwer trees in cubical Agda, while extensional well-founded orders have been studied and formalised thoroughly by Escardó and his collaborators. Finally, we compare the computational efficiency of our implementations with the results reported by Berger.},

Informally, the simulatability of a VRF depicts the ability to simulate a valid proof π that y = F ( s k , x ) y=F(sk,x) for any input x and any output value y . A (simulatable) VRF can be used in the E-Cash, E-Lottery, blockchain and constructing the multi-theorem non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof. However, up to now, the existing constructions of an sVRF either rely on non-standard assumptions (e.g., the Q -type ones), or are built in the random oracle model , or resort to time-consuming techniques like the Cook-Levin reduction. In this paper, we design the first sVRF from the LWE assumption in the standard model (free of a random oracle) without using a Cook-Levin reduction. In our construction of an sVRF, we take as building blocks a pseudorandom function, a trapdoor fully homomorphic commitment (FHC) scheme, and a NIZK proof system for a language specified by FHC. Our trapdoor FHC is the key technical tool, which helps the simplification of the underlying NIZK language, thus making possible an instantiation of a NIZK proof from LWE without a Cook-Levin reduction. Together with an LWE-based PRF, we obtain an sVRF scheme from LWE.},

A restrained dominating set of a graph is a set R of vertices of the graph such that every vertex of the graph is in R or adjacent to at least a vertex of R , and the subgraph induced by vertices not in R contains no isolated vertex. An independent restrained dominating set of a graph is a restrained dominating set such that its any two vertices are not adjacent. A restrained-step dominating set of a graph is a restrained dominating set such that the subgraph induced by vertices not in this set contains a perfect matching . Restrained domination, independent restrained domination, and restrained-step domination problems are to find a restrained dominating set, independent restrained dominating set, and restrained-step dominating set with the least number of vertices on a graph, respectively. In 2015, we define supergrid graphs for computing the tracks of computer embroidery sewing machine and 3D printer. In this paper, we expand it to the class of extended supergrid graphs. Extended supergrid graphs are a natural extension of supergrid graphs, and they contain grid, triangular grid , and supergrid graphs as subclasses . The complexities of the restrained related domination problems on extended supergrid graphs remain unknown. In this paper, we will prove the restrained and independent restrained domination problems on supergrid graphs is NP-complete. Using the same technique, the restrained domination problem on grid graphs can also be shown to be NP-complete. We then solve the restrained related domination problems on rectangular supergrid graphs, which form a subclass of supergrid graphs, in linear time. Finally, we provide a tight upper bound on the minimum size of (independent) restrained dominating set for rectangular triangular-supergrid graphs forming a subclass of triangular grid graphs.},

This paper shows how to determine some vertices contained in the minimum dominating set of a graph with minimum degree at least 3. Applying a particular scheme to the graph with minimum degree at least 3, the resulting graph is 2-connected and the length of each induced cycle is 0 mod 3. Label every three vertices for as many induced cycles as possible. Then there is a way of labeling in which the set of all labeled vertices is the minimum dominating set of the resulting graph, and is contained in the minimum dominating set of the original graph. The complexity of the minimum dominating set problem for cubic graphs was shown to be APX-complete in 2000 and this problem is partially resolved by our arguments.},

In standard 2D expressions (S2D-RE) the basic terms are generators of Σ ⋆ × Δ ⋆ Σ⋆×Δ⋆ , while in generalised 2D expressions (2D-RE) the basic terms are pairs of (ordinary) regular expressions over one alphabet (1D). In this paper we study the average state complexity of partial derivative standard transducers ( T PD TPD ) for both S2D-RE and 2D-RE. For S2D-RE we obtain the same asymptotic bounds as for partial derivative automata . For 2D-RE, while in the worst case the number of states of T PD TPD can be O ( n 2 ) O(n2) , where n is the size of the expression, asymptotically and on average that value is bounded from above by O ( n 3 2 ) O(n32) . We also show that asymptotically and on average the alphabetic size of a 2D-RE is half of its size. All results are obtained in the framework of analytic combinatorics considering generating functions of parametrised combinatorial classes defined implicitly by algebraic curves . In particular, we generalise the methods developed in previous work to a broad class of analytic functions.},

  abstract     = {In 2005, Goddard et al. (2005) [12] asked the computational complexity of determining the maximum cardinality of a matching whose vertex set induces a disconnected graph . In this paper, we answer this question. In fact, we consider the generalized problem of finding c-disconnected matchings ; such matchings are ones whose vertex sets induce subgraphs with at least c connected components. We show that, for every fixed c ≥ 2 c≥2 , this problem is NP - complete even if we restrict the input to bounded diameter bipartite graphs , while can be solved in polynomial time if c = 1 c=1 . For the case when c is part of the input, we show that the problem is NP - complete for chordal graphs , while being solvable in polynomial time for interval graphs . Finally, we explore the parameterized complexity of the problem. We present an FPT algorithm under the treewidth parameterization, and an XP algorithm for graphs with a polynomial number of minimal separators when parameterized by c . We complement these results by showing that, unless NP ⊆ coNP / poly NP⊆coNP/poly , the related Induced Matching problem does not admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by vertex cover and size of the matching nor when parameterized by vertex deletion distance to clique and size of the matching. As for Connected Matching , we show how to obtain a maximum connected matching in linear time given an arbitrary maximum matching in the input.},

  abstract     = {Originally, in P systems the environment plays a passive role; that is, it can only receive objects, without having the ability to send objects to the system. Later, tissue P systems were introduced, where the cells are located in the environment in the sense that they can communicate between each other but also with the environment. In fact, a special alphabet was introduced as a way to symbolize the chemical elements available in it and that can interact with the cells. In the framework of membrane computing, all the objects of this alphabet are present in the environment with an arbitrary multiplicity at the beginning of the computation; that is, there are enough objects of this type in the environment to fire the rules that can be fired by these objects. From the computational complexity point of view, it seems to be a very strong ingredient, since it adds a virtually infinite number of objects to the system in the whole computation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the behaviour of this special alphabet can be simulated by a generation stage ruled by evolutional communication rules and/or division/separation rules, such that the ability of these systems to efficiently solve presumably hard problems is not changed if the environment does not play an active role.},

While several NP NP -hard graph problems become tractable for graph classes whose mim-width is bounded and quickly computable, no algorithmic applications of boundedness of sim-width are known. In Kang et al. (2017) [32] , it is asked whether Independent Set and 3 -Colouring are NP NP -complete on graphs of sim-width at most 1. We observe that, for each k ∈ N k∈N , List k -Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for graph classes whose sim-width is bounded and quickly computable. Moreover, we show that if the same holds for Independent Set , then Independent H H -Packing is polynomial-time solvable for graph classes whose sim-width is bounded and quickly computable. This problem is a common generalisation of Independent Set , Induced Matching , Dissociation Set and k -Separator .

Starting from an arbitrary configuration, this algorithm endlessly re-constructs a BFS spanning tree in any connected rooted network. Nowadays, it is still the best existing self-stabilizing BFS spanning tree construction in terms of memory requirement, i.e. , it only requires Θ ( 1 ) Θ(1) bits per edge. However, it has been originally proven assuming a weakly fair daemon. Moreover, its stabilization time was unknown until now. Here, we study the slightly modified version of this algorithm, still keeping the same memory requirement. We prove the self-stabilization of this variant under the distributed unfair daemon and show a stabilization time in O ( D ⋅ n 2 ) O(D⋅n2) rounds, where D D is the network diameter and n the number of processes.},

Blazewicz et al. had an O ( n 2 q n2q )-time dynamic programming algorithm , where q ≤ n + 1 q≤n+1 is the number of distinct intersite distances. When q is small, their algorithm solves SPDP efficiently. We give a new dynamic programming algorithm that requires O ( q n ( n / q + 1 ) q − 1 qn(n/q+1)q−1 ) time. This time complexity is O ( n q nq ) for any q and is better than O ( n 1.5 2 n / 2 n1.52n/2 ) when q ≤ n / 6 q≤n/6 .

In particular, this leads to a q -ary 2-traceability code of length 4 containing 3 q codewords; moreover, we prove that the size 3 q is optimal.},

B ) has exactly one neighbor in B (resp. A ). The size of a pair of perfectly matched sets ( A , B ) (A,B) is | A | = | B | |A|=|B| . The PERFECTLY MATCHED SETS problem is to decide whether a given graph G has a pair of perfectly matched sets of size k . We show that PMS is W [ 1 ] W[1] -hard when parameterized by solution size k even when restricted to split graphs and bipartite graphs . We observe that PMS is FPT when parameterized by clique-width, and give FPT algorithms with respect to the parameters distance to cluster, distance to co-cluster and treewidth. Complementing FPT results, we show that PMS does not admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by vertex cover number unless NP ⊆ coNP/poly NP⊆coNP/poly . We also provide an exact exponential algorithm running in time O ⁎ ( 1.966 n ) ⁎ O⁎(1.966n) . Finally, considering graphs with structural assumptions, we show that PMS remains NP-hard on planar graphs .},

  abstract     = {We continue our investigation aimed at spotting small fragments of Set Theory (in this paper, sublanguages of Boolean Set Theory) that might be of use in automated proof-checkers based on the set-theoretic formalism. Here we propose a method that leads to a cubic-time satisfiability decision test for the language involving, besides variables intended to range over the von Neumann set-universe, the Boolean operator ∪ and the logical relators = and ≠. It can be seen that the dual language involving the Boolean operator ∩ and, again, the relators = and ≠, also admits a cubic-time satisfiability decision test; noticeably, the same algorithm can be used for both languages. Suitable pre-processing can reduce richer Boolean languages to the said two fragments, so that the same cubic satisfiability test can be used to treat the relators ⊆ and ⊈, and the predicates ‘ ’ and ‘ ’, meaning ‘the argument is empty’ and ‘the arguments are disjoint sets’, along with their opposites ‘ ’ and ‘ ’. Those richer languages are ‘polynomial maximal’, in the sense that each language strictly containing either of them and whose formulae are conjunctions of literals has an NP -hard satisfiability problem . A generalized version of the two said satisfiability tests can treat the relator ⊄, though at the price of a worsening of the algorithmic complexity (from cubic to quintic time).},

  abstract     = {Popular matchings have been intensively studied recently as a relaxed concept of stable matchings. By applying the concept of popular matchings to branchings in directed graphs , Kavitha et al. introduced popular branchings. Let G = ( V G , E G ) G=(VG,EG) be a directed graph, where each vertex has preferences over its incoming arcs, and B and B ′ B′ be branchings in G . A vertex v ∈ V G v∈VG prefers B to B ′ B′ if v prefers its incoming arc of B to that of B ′ B′ , where having an arbitrary incoming arc is preferred to having no incoming arc. We say that B is more popular than B ′ B′ if the number of vertices preferring B to B ′ B′ is greater than the number of vertices preferring B to B ′ B′ . A branching B is called a popular branching if there is no branching more popular than B . Kavitha et al. proposed an algorithm for finding a popular branching when the preferences of each vertex are given by a strict partial order. The correctness of this algorithm is proved by utilizing classical theorems on the duality of weighted arborescences. In this paper, we generalize popular branchings to weighted popular branchings in vertex-weighted directed graphs , in the same manner as weighted popular matchings by Mestre. We give an algorithm for finding a weighted popular branching for the case where the preferences of each vertex are given by a total preorder and the weights satisfy certain conditions. Our algorithm is based on Kavitha et al.&#39;s algorithm, while it includes elaborated procedures resulting from the vertex-weights. Its correctness also builds upon the duality of weighted arborescences.},

  abstract     = {In wireless networks, broadcast and convergecast are the two most used communication primitives. Broadcast instructs a specific sink (or root ) node to send a message to each node in the network. Convergecast instructs each node in the network to send a message to the sink . Due to the collision, without labels, deterministic convergecast is impossible even in a three-node network. Therefore, networking solutions for convergecast are based on probabilistic approaches or use underlying probabilistic medium access protocols such as CSMA/CA or CSMA/CD. In this paper, we focus on deterministic convergecast algorithms enhanced with labeling schemes for wireless networks in collision-presence environment. We investigate two communication modes: half-duplex (nodes either transmit or receive but not both at the same time) and full-duplex (nodes can transmit and receive data at the same time). For these two modes we investigate lower and upper bounds for the time and size of labeling. Even though broadcast and convergecast are similar, we prove that, contrary to broadcast, deterministic convergecast cannot be solved with short labels for some topologies. That is, Ω ( log ⁡ ( Δ ) ) Ω(log⁡(Δ)) bits are necessary to solve deterministically convergecast where Δ is the maximal degree of a node in the network. We also prove that Ω ( n ) Ω(n) communication time slots are required, where n is the size of network. We provide solutions that are optimal in terms of time (transmission rounds), and by far, the closest to the lower bound in terms of space (message size) for arbitrary scenarios.},

The signature (a,b,c) , where n=a+b+c+r , is known to all three participants. The goal is for A to privately communicate her hand to B via a public announcement, without using a shared secret nor cryptography. Using a deterministic protocol, A decides its announcement based on her hand. Using techniques from coding theory, Johnson graphs, and additive number theory, a novel perspective inspired by distributed computing theory is provided, to analyze the amount of information that A needs to send, while preventing C from learning a single card of her hand. In one extreme, B wants to learn all of A &#39;s cards; the novel notion of minimal information protocol is considered, so that, in the other extreme, B wishes to learn something about A &#39;s hand.},

  abstract     = {A series of Stern-like Code-Based Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge (CBZKPoKs) in the rank setting have been proposed since 2011. These CBZKPoKs (RStern, RJKPT, RVDC, RankId, RCVE, RVéronID) are rank metric adaptations of Stern, JKPT, AGS, CVE, and Véron protocols in the Hamming setting. RVéronID has been analyzed and the witness can be recovered because improper permutation leaks the information of witness. However, there are several open problems in the rest of rank metric CBZKPoKs : (1) statistical zero-knowledge property; (2) security and completeness. In this paper, we deeply analyze rank metric permutation and its cryptographic properties, and rigorously show that RStern and RJKPT can achieve statistical zero-knowledge property. We then analyze RVDC, RankId, and RCVE and show that they do not satisfy completeness and RVDC can be broken by the rank support learning attack. To repair and strengthen security, we reconstruct the rank metric protocols (RAGS and RVéron), in which two protocols work on random linear codes without the limitation of cyclic structure. The performance analysis shows that: their communication costs (20 KB and 26 KB) are the lowest among existing Stern-like CBZKPoKs for 128-bit security. When compared with lattice-based zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge with a non-negligible soundness error such as improved Stern (PKC 2013), Bootle et al. (CRYPTO 2019), and Beullens (EUROCRYPT 2020), our protocols perform a significant advantage in communication costs.},

This motivates a novel research program, that is, using descriptive set theoretic tools to calibrate the (learning) complexity of nonlearnable families.

Otherwise, the algorithm decomposes G into its 3-edge-connected components and generates a construction sequence for each of them as well as the bridges and a cactus representation of the cut-pairs in G as negative certificates. All of these are done by making only one pass over G using an innovative graph contraction technique. Moreover, the graph needs not be 2-edge-connected. The currently best-known algorithm is more complicated as it makes multiple passes over G and uses involved reduction and perturbation techniques rather than just basic graph-theoretic techniques.},

  abstract     = {Repair operators are often used for constraint handling in constrained combinatorial optimization . We investigate the (1+1) EA equipped with a tailored jump-and-repair operation that can be used to probabilistically repair infeasible offspring in graph problems. Instead of evolving candidate solutions to the entire graph, we expand the genotype to allow the (1+1) EA to develop in parallel a feasible solution together with a growing subset of the instance (an induced subgraph). With this approach, we prove that the EA is able to probabilistically simulate an iterative compression process used in classical fixed-parameter algorithmics to obtain a randomized FPT performance guarantee on three NP NP -hard graph problems. For k - VertexCover , we prove that the (1+1) EA using focused jump-and-repair can find a k -vertex cover (if one exists) in O ( 2 k n 2 log ⁡ n ) O(2kn2log⁡n) iterations in expectation. This leads to an exponential (in k ) improvement over the best-known parameterized bound for evolutionary algorithms on VertexCover . For the k - FeedbackVertexSet problem in tournaments, we prove that the EA finds a feasible feedback set in O ( 2 k k ! n 2 log ⁡ n ) O(2kk!n2log⁡n) iterations in expectation, and for OddCycleTransversal , we prove the optimization time for the EA is O ( 3 k k m n 2 log ⁡ n ) O(3kkmn2log⁡n) . For the latter two problems, this constitutes the first parameterized result for any evolutionary algorithm. We discuss how to generalize the framework to other parameterized graph problems closed under induced subgraphs and report experimental results that illustrate the behavior of the algorithm on a concrete instance class.},

  abstract     = {The locality of a graph problem is the smallest distance T such that each node can choose its own part of the solution based on its radius- T neighborhood. In many settings, a graph problem can be solved efficiently with a distributed or parallel algorithm if and only if it has a small locality. In this work we seek to automate the study of solvability and locality: given the description of a graph problem Π, we would like to determine if Π is solvable and what is the asymptotic locality of Π as a function of the size of the graph. Put otherwise, we seek to automatically synthesize efficient distributed and parallel algorithms for solving Π. We focus on locally checkable graph problems; these are problems in which a solution is globally feasible if it looks feasible in all constant-radius neighborhoods. Prior work on such problems has brought primarily bad news: questions related to locality are undecidable in general, and even if we focus on the case of labeled paths and cycles, determining locality is PSPACE PSPACE -hard (Balliu et al., PODC 2019). We complement prior negative results with efficient algorithms for the cases of unlabeled paths and cycles and, as an extension, for rooted trees. We study locally checkable graph problems from an automata-theoretic perspective by representing a locally checkable problem Π as a nondeterministic finite automaton M M over a unary alphabet . We identify polynomial-time-computable properties of the automaton M M that near-completely capture the solvability and locality of Π in cycles and paths, with the exception of one specific case that is co- NP NP -complete.},

  abstract     = {Most runtime analyses of randomised search heuristics focus on the expected number of function evaluations to find a unique global optimum. We ask a fundamental question: if additional search points are declared optimal, or declared as desirable target points, do these additional optima speed up evolutionary algorithms ? More formally, we analyse the expected hitting time of a target set OPT ∪ S OPT∪S where S is a set of non-optimal search points and OPT is the set of optima and compare it to the expected hitting time of OPT. We show that the answer to our question depends on the number and placement of search points in S . For all black-box algorithms and all fitness functions with polynomial expected optimisation times we show that, if additional optima are placed randomly, even an exponential number of optima has a negligible effect on the expected optimisation time. Considering Hamming balls around all global optima gives an easier target for some algorithms and functions and can shift the phase transition with respect to offspring population sizes in the (1, λ ) EA on OneMax . However, for the one-dimensional Ising model the time to reach Hamming balls of radius ( 1 / 2 − ε ) n (1/2−ε)n around optima does not reduce the asymptotic expected optimisation time in the worst case. Finally, on functions where search trajectories typically join in a single search point, turning one search point into an optimum drastically reduces the expected optimisation time.},

  abstract     = {This article considers message and energy-efficient distributed algorithms for the SetCover Problem. Given a ground set U U of n elements and a set S S of m subsets of U U , we aim to find the minimal number of these subsets that contain all elements. In the default distributed setup of this problem, each set has a bidirected communication link with each element it contains. This results in a communication graph with n + m n+m nodes and degree Δ. The value Δ denotes the maximal degree of the communication graph , i.e., the maximum of all subsets&#39; sizes and the maximum number of sets an element is contained in. We present SetCover algorithm in the Beeping model that only relies on carrier-sensing. In each synchronous time step, a node can either listen to the channel or beep . A listening node learns if one or more of its neighbors beeped or if none of its neighbors beeped. In particular, it neither learns which neighbors beeped nor how many neighbors beeped exactly. Given this model, we present an algorithm that runs in O ( k 3 ) O(k3) time and has an expected approximation ratio of O ( Δ 3 / k log 2 ⁡ Δ ) O(Δ3/klog2⁡Δ) . The value k ∈ [ 3 , log ⁡ Δ ] k∈[3,log⁡Δ] is a parameter that lets us trade runtime for approximation ratio similar to the celebrated algorithm by Kuhn and Wattenhofer [14] . Our next result is a O ( k 2 ) O(k2) -time and O ˜ ( Δ 1 2 + 1 k ( n + m ) ) O˜(Δ12+1k(n+m)) -message algorithm (where O ˜ ( ⋅ ) O˜(⋅) hides polylogarithmic factors) with expected approximation ratio of O ( Δ 1 k log ⁡ Δ ) O(Δ1klog⁡Δ) in the K T 0 KT0 - Congest model. In this variant of the well-known Congest model, time proceeds in synchronous rounds, and each node can send a distinct message of size O ( log ⁡ ( n + m ) ) O(log⁡(n+m)) to each of its neighbors. Further, each node has a unique identifier of size O ( log ⁡ ( n + m ) ) O(log⁡(n+m)) . However, the crucial aspect of K T 0 KT0 - Congest is that the nodes do not know their neighbors&#39; identifiers. Our algorithm is almost optimal concerning time and message complexity as we can show that there are hard instances that require Ω ( Δ 1 2 − ϵ m ) Ω(Δ12−ϵm) messages for a constant approximation ratio.},

It was shown in [2] that every graph G contains a spanning ( λ ( G ) + 1 ) (λ(G)+1) -partite subgraph H such that λ ( H ) = λ ( G ) λ(H)=λ(G) and one can find such a spanning subgraph in polynomial time . We determine the complexity of deciding, for given positive integers r , k r,k whether a graph contains a spanning r -colourable subgraph which is k -edge-connected. We show that the problem is polynomially solvable when r &gt; k r&amp;gt;k and NP-complete otherwise. In fact, combined with the result from [2] above, this means that the problem is polynomially solvable precisely when r is such that every k -edge-connected graph has a spanning r -colourable subgraph which is k -edge-connected. One can show that all graphs whose edge set decomposes into k edge-disjoint spanning trees are 2 k -colourable. We consider the problem of deciding whether a given graph G has a collection of k edge-disjoint spanning trees whose union forms an r -colourable spanning subgraph H of G . We show that this problem is polynomially solvable when r ≥ 2 k r≥2k and NP-complete for all other values of r . We also determine the complexity of the analogous problem of deciding whether a digraph D has a collection of k arc-disjoint out-branchings such that the spanning subdigraph formed by the union of the arcs in the branchings is r -colourable.},

  abstract     = {Given an order of the underlying alphabet, we can lift it to the states of a finite deterministic automaton : to compare states we use the order of the strings reaching them. When the order on strings is the co-lexicographic one and this order turns out to be total, the DFA is called Wheeler. This recently introduced class of automata—the Wheeler automata —constitute an important data-structure for languages, since it allows the design and implementation of a very efficient tool-set of storage mechanisms for the transition function, supporting a large variety of substring queries. In this context it is natural to consider the class of regular languages accepted by Wheeler automata, i.e. the Wheeler languages. An inspiring result in this area is the following: it has been shown that, as opposed to the general case, the classic determinization by powerset construction is polynomial on Wheeler automata. As a consequence, most classical problems, when considered on this class of automata, turn out to be “easy”—that is, solvable in polynomial time . In this paper we consider computational problems related to Wheelerness, but starting from non-deterministic automata. We also consider the case of reduced non-deterministic ones—a class of NFAs where recognizing Wheelerness is still polynomial, as for DFAs. Our collection of results shows that moving towards non-determinism is, in most cases, a dangerous path leading quickly to intractability . Moreover, we start a study of “state complexity” related to Wheeler DFAs and languages, proving that the classic construction for the intersection of languages turns out to be computationally simpler on Wheeler DFAs than in the general case. We also provide a construction for the minimum Wheeler DFA recognizing a given Wheeler language.},

Besides, a number of theorems are derived and proved to refine the system. Moreover, the soundness and completeness of the proof system are proved in detail. To facilitate the completeness proof , some auxiliary lemmas are introduced and proved in advance.

We consider a natural way to relativize this notion, and we investigate for various kinds of oracles whether and how the unrelativized and the relativized version of depth differ. While most classes emerging from computability theory , once relativized to some oracle, either contain or are contained in their unrelativized version, this is not the case of depth: it turns out that the classes of deep sets and of sets that are deep relative to the halting set ∅ ′ ∅′ are incomparable with respect to set-theoretical inclusion. On the other hand, the class of deep sets is strictly contained in the class of sets that are deep relative to any given Martin-Löf-random oracle. The set built to show this separation can also be used to prove that every DNC 2 function is truth-table-equivalent to the symmetric difference of two Martin-Löf random sets, giving an alternative proof of the known fact that every PA-complete degree is truth-table equivalent to the join of two Martin-Löf random sets. Furthermore, we observe that the class of deep sets relative to any given K -trivial oracle either is the same as or is strictly contained in the class of deep sets. We leave as an open problem which of the two possibilities can occur for noncomputable K -trivial oracles.},

  abstract     = {We study admission control with packet redundancy, where large data items, called superpackets , exceed some Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) and therefore are broken into several smaller packets. It is assumed that each superpacket is comprised of k packets, and that a superpacket is considered useful if at least ( 1 − β ) k (1−β)k of its packets arrive at the receiving end, for some redundancy parameter β ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) β∈[0,1) . Our goal is to maximize the total profit of useful superpackets, under an overloaded network, where we are forced to drop packets. Our starting point is an algorithm, called priority , which is based on assigning a random priority to each superpacket. This algorithm was shown to perform well when β = 0 β=0 , with and without a buffer. However, the performance of priority deteriorates with the increase of β , since it delivers too many packets for high priority superpackets. To tackle this issue, we propose an online algorithm which introduces randomized self-elimination of packets, called pse . When there is no buffer, we show that the competitive ratio of pse is better than the competitive ratio of priority , for the case where ( 1 − β ) 3 ⋅ ρ max ≤ 1 (1−β)3⋅ρmax≤1 , where ρ max ρmax is the maximal burst size-router capacity ratio. For real-world values ( ρ max ≤ 1.5 ρmax≤1.5 ), pse outperforms priority for β ≥ 0.14 β≥0.14 . We also present simulation results, with a buffer, that demonstrate the behavior of pse in comparison with priority and tail-drop . It is shown that pse performs much better than priority when β is large. In fact, it is shown that pse behaves at least as good as both algorithms.},

  abstract     = {If each node in a wireless network has information about only its 1-hop neighborhood, then what are the limits to performance? This problem is considered for wireless networks where each communication link has a minimum bandwidth quality-of-service (QoS) requirement. Links in the same vicinity contend for the shared wireless medium. The conflict graph captures which pairs of links interfere with each other and depends on the MAC protocol. In IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol-based networks, when communication between nodes i and j takes place, the neighbors of both i and j remain silent. This model of interference is called the 2-hop interference model because the distance in the network graph between any two links that can be simultaneously active is at least 2. In the admission control problem studied in the present paper, the objective is to determine, using only localized information, whether a given set of flow rates is feasible. While distance- d distributed algorithms have been analyzed for the 1-hop interference model, an open problem in the literature is to extend these results to the K -hop interference model, and the present work initiates the generalization to the K -hop interference model. We show that the centralized version of the problem is NP-hard and then investigate distributed, low-complexity solutions for this problem. We propose a distributed algorithm for this problem where each node has information about only its 1-hop neighborhood. The worst-case performance of the distributed algorithm, i.e. the largest factor by which the performance of this distributed algorithm is away from that of an optimal, centralized algorithm, is analyzed. Lower and upper bounds on the suboptimality of the distributed algorithm are obtained, and both bounds are shown to be tight. The exact worst-case performance is obtained for some ring topologies. The performance of the distance-1 distributed algorithm is compared with that of the row constraints, and these two distributed algorithms are shown to be incomparable.},

  abstract     = {The structure of the graph defined by the interactions in a Boolean network can determine properties of the asymptotic dynamics. For instance, considering the asynchronous dynamics, the absence of positive cycles guarantees the existence of a unique attractor, and the absence of negative cycles ensures that all attractors are fixed points. In presence of multiple attractors, one might be interested in properties that ensure that attractors are sufficiently “isolated”, that is, they can be found in separate subspaces or even trap spaces, subspaces that are closed with respect to the dynamics. Here we introduce notions of separability for attractors and identify corresponding necessary conditions on the interaction graph. In particular, we show that if the interaction graph has at most one positive cycle, or at most one negative cycle, or if no positive cycle intersects a negative cycle, then the attractors can be separated by subspaces. If the interaction graph has no path from a negative to a positive cycle, then the attractors can be separated by trap spaces. Furthermore, we study networks with interaction graphs admitting two vertices that intersect all cycles, and show that if their attractors cannot be separated by subspaces, then their interaction graph must contain a copy of the complete signed digraph on two vertices, deprived of a negative loop. We thus establish a connection between a dynamical property and a complex network motif. The topic is far from exhausted and we conclude by stating some open questions.},

  abstract     = {Gödel&#39;s Dialectica interpretation was conceived as a tool to obtain the consistency of Heyting arithmetic in the 40s. In recent years, several proof theoretic transformations, based on Gödel&#39;s Dialectica interpretation, have been used systematically to extract new content from classical proofs, following a suggestion of Kreisel. Thus, the interpretation has found new relevant applications in several areas of mathematics and computer science. Several authors have explained the Dialectica interpretation in categorical terms. In particular, de Paiva introduced the notion of a Dialectica category as an internal version of Gödel&#39;s Dialectica Interpretation in her doctoral work. This was generalised by Hyland and Hofstra, who considered the interpretation in terms of fibrations . In our previous work, we introduced an intrinsic presentation of the Dialectica construction via a generalisation of Hofstra&#39;s work, using the notion of Gödel fibration and its proof-irrelevant version, a Gödel doctrine. The key idea is that Gödel fibrations (and doctrines) can be thought of as fibrations generated by some basic predicates playing the role of quantifier-free predicates . This categorification of quantifier-free predicates is crucial not only to show that our notion of Gödel fibration is equivalent to Hofstra&#39;s Dialectica fibration in the appropriate way, but also to show how Gödel doctrines embody the main logical features of the Dialectica Interpretation. To show that, we derive the soundness of the interpretation of the implication connective, as expounded by Troelstra, in the categorical model. This requires extra logical principles, going beyond intuitionistic logic , namely (suitable versions of) the Markov Principle (MP) and the Independence of Premise (IP) principle, as well as some choice. We show how these principles are satisfied in the categorical setting, establishing a tight correspondence between the logical system and the categorical framework. This tight correspondence should come in handy not only when discussing the traditional applications of Dialectica, but also when dealing with some newer uses of the interpretation, as in modelling games or concurrency theory. Finally, to complete our analysis, we characterise categories obtained as a result of the Hyland, Johnstone and Pitts tripos-to-topos construction when applied to Gödel doctrines.},

  abstract     = {Nisan and Szegedy [18] conjectured that block sensitivity is at most polynomial in sensitivity for any Boolean function . Until a recent breakthrough of Huang [15] , the conjecture had been wide open in the general case, and was proved only for a few special classes of Boolean functions. Huang&#39;s result [15] implies that block sensitivity is at most the 4th power of sensitivity for any Boolean function. It remains open if a tighter relationship between sensitivity and block sensitivity holds for arbitrary Boolean functions; the largest known gap between these measures is quadratic [20] , [23] , [9] , [12] , [4] , [10] . We prove tighter bounds showing that block sensitivity is at most 3rd power, and in some cases at most square of sensitivity for subclasses of transitive functions, defined by various properties of their DNF (or CNF) representation. Our results improve and extend previous results regarding transitive functions. We obtain these results by proving tight (up to constant factors) lower bounds on the smallest possible sensitivity of functions in these classes.

  abstract     = {Sampled string matching is a very effective technique to reduce the search time for a pattern within a text at the cost of a small amount of additional memory, used for storing a partial index of the text. This approach has recently received some interest and has been applied to improve both online and offline string matching solutions, improving standard solutions by more than 50\%. However, this improvement is currently only achievable in the case of texts on large-sized alphabets, and remains small (or absent) in the case of small-sized alphabets. In this article we propose an extension of the approach to text-sampling, known as Character Distance Sampling , to the case of small alphabets, obtaining an improvement of up to 98\% compared to standard solutions in the case of online string matching. We also extend this approach to the case of offline string matching, introducing a sampled version of the suffix array, obtaining performances up to 5 times higher than the search obtained on the standard suffix array. Differently from what has been done by previous solutions, our idea is not based on the reduction of the number of indexed suffixes, but on the construction of the index directly on the sampled text.},

  abstract     = {Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA for short) is a well known problem in the field of computational biology. In order to evaluate the quality of a solution, many different scoring functions have been introduced, the most widely used being the Sum-of-Pairs score (SP-score). It is known that computing the best MSA under the SP-score measure is NP-hard. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the Column score (defined in Thompson et al. 1999), which we refer to as Selective Column score: Given a symbol a ∈ Σ a∈Σ , the score of the i-th column is one if and only if all symbols of the same column are a , and otherwise zero. The a -column score of an alignment is then the number of columns made of only character a . We show that finding the optimal MSA under the Selective Column Score is NP-hard for all alphabets of size | Σ | ≥ 2 |Σ|≥2 , and that the associated maximization problem is poly-APX-hard. We also give an approximation algorithm that almost matches the inapproximability bound.},

  abstract     = {A properly colored walk, is a walk where every two consecutive edges have different colors, including the first and last edges in the case when the walk is closed. Properly colored walks have shown to be an effective way to model certain real applications. In view of this, it is natural to ask about the existence of properly colored walks with restrictions on the transitions of colors allowed in the edges of a graph . Let H be a graph, possibly with loops, and G a graph. We will say that G is H -colored iff there exists a function c : E ( G ) ⟶ V ( H ) . A path ( v 0 , v 1 , ⋯ , v k ) in G is an H -path whenever ( c ( v 0 v 1 ) , ⋯ , c ( v k − 1 v k ) ) is a walk in H ; in particular, a cycle ( v 0 , v 1 , ⋯ , v k , v 0 ) is an H -cycle iff ( c ( v 0 v 1 ) , c ( v 1 v 2 ) , ⋯ , c ( v k − 1 v k ) , c ( v k v 0 ) , c ( v 0 v 1 ) ) is a walk in H . Hence, the graph H determines what color transitions are allowed in a walk. An interesting application of H -walks states as follows: suppose that it is required to send a message through a hostile environment (network), in which the edges are colored with its transmission code; in order to make more difficult the decoding task, it is necessary to avoid not only monochromatic transitions, but some specific color transitions that make easier that task. Some authors have studied the existence of H -cycles in an H -colored graph, saying nothing about its length. In this paper, we give conditions that imply the existence of H -paths and H -cycles of certain length, in an H -colored graph with a given structure. As a consequence of the main results, we obtain known theorems in the theory of properly colored walks.},

(2017) [2] ) and increasing the mutation strength based on a stagnation detection mechanism (Rajabi and Witt (2020) [3] ). Whereas the latter can obtain the asymptotically best probability of finding a single desired solution in a given distance, the former is more robust and performs much better when many improving solutions in some distance exist. In this work, we propose a mutation strategy that combines ideas of both mechanisms. We show that it can also obtain the best possible probability of finding a single distant solution. However, when several improving solutions exist, it can outperform both the stagnation-detection approach and fast mutation. The new operator is more than an interleaving of the two previous mechanisms and it outperforms any such interleaving.},

Unfortunately, the components of information-theoretical fuzzy extractors consume the entropy of the sources , which results in extracted strings being too short to be applied in practice. Fuller et al. introduced the notion of Computational Fuzzy Extractor (CFE) and proposed a CFE scheme, which extracts nearly all entropy from the sources, based on the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. However, their construction applies to a limited type of sources and only supports sub-linear error correctness rate. In this paper, we propose a generic construction of CFE from Computationally Private Secure Sketch (CPSS) and Lossy Computational Extractor (LCExt). By instantiating CPSS and LCExt based on the LWE assumption, we obtain specific CFE schemes from LWE. Compared with the CFE scheme by Fuller et al., our CFE scheme not only extracts almost all entropy from the source, but also supports linear error correctness rate, as long as the source has enough entropy.},

In such network, we study the average Age of Information Optimization (AoIO) problem whose objective is to minimize the average AoI of data collected from sensors such that all data of the network are transported to the base station and the remaining energy of any sensor exceeds a certain threshold. We prove that the AoIO problem is NP-hard. To solve the AoIO problem, we first study the Total Flight Time Minimizing of UAV (TFTM) problem, which aims at finding an optimal charging solution of UAV to minimize the flight time of UAV based on the order of sensors visited by UAV. Then we prove that the TFTM problem is also NP-hard. Afterwards, we propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the TFTM problem by optimizing flight path, data collection, energy power transfer and laser charging of UAV. Based on the solution for the TFTM problem, we propose an approximation algorithm to solve the AoIO problem. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Following the Kronecker–Duval or D5 philosophy of dynamic evaluation in computer algebra , the dynamical proof method was brought into constructive algebra in order to obtain computational interpretations of the individual, concrete instances of the Kuratowski–Zorn Lemma modern algebra abounds with. We now push this approach into complete lattices , and thus capture the computational content also of generic, abstract forms of the axiom of choice such as the Teichmüller–Tukey lemma. To this end we first strengthen the (key lemma for) the Hofmann–Mislove theorem about Scott-open filters (SOF): to be a member of a SOF is equivalent, with the axiom of choice , to membership of all complete extensions. This then allows for a constructive treatment: membership of the given SOF means that from the potential element one can grow a finite labelled binary tree of an inductively defined type such that every branch of the tree eventually dips into the SOF. The ideal objects characteristic for invocations of the Kuratowski–Zorn Lemma are thus approximated and actually replaced by paths in those trees, by which we shed light on the interaction of transfinite methods and their dynamical interpretation. The first test case includes abstract dependence, especially bases of vector spaces. Key to the above lies in taking Erné&#39;s saturation map as a radical operator for Scott-open sets. Through a generalised inductive definition this radical can be pinned down in terms of universal properties; and reaches into classical pointfree topology, as exemplified by a succinct proof of Isbell&#39;s spatiality theorem.},

Typically, mathematical models are based on set theory with its actual infinite sets, which are incongruous with computer science. We will present a dynamic model that is based consequently on the potential infinite. It uses total functions, whereby functions and the function spaces are seen as interdependent, increasing finite entities. It moreover allows the integration of higher-order logic (to be demonstrated in a separate paper), provided the universal quantifier is interpreted in a specific, dynamic way.

  abstract     = {paint can is an example of a game whose positions are disjunctive sums, and a move in any component reduces that component to a nimber. Conway, in On Numbers and Games , partially analyzed the related game supernim , and called these components “superstars”, mentioning “There does not appear to be a complete theory”. The book contains one result about these games, and, until now, there has been no advance in finding good strategies. Here, we show that, for a human, the use of canonical forms is not a good approach. We present an algorithmic, recursive approach to the general case, based on a fundamental reduction of these positions, as well as on a Nimber Avoidance Theorem . An analysis of the computational time of the algorithm is presented.},

  abstract     = {The search-type problem of evacuating 2 robots in the wireless model from the (Euclidean) unit disk was first introduced and studied by Czyzowicz et al. (2014) [13] . Since then, the problem has seen a long list of follow-up results pertaining to variations as well as to upper and lower bound improvements. All established results in the area study this 2-dimensional search-type problem in the Euclidean metric space where the search space, i.e. the unit disk, enjoys significant (metric) symmetries. We initiate and study the problem of evacuating 2 robots in the wireless model from ℓ p ℓp unit disks, p ∈ [ 1 , ∞ ) p∈[1,∞) , where in particular robots&#39; moves are measured in the underlying metric space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of a search-type problem with mobile agents in more general metric spaces. The problem is particularly challenging since even the circumference of the ℓ p ℓp unit disks have been the subject of technical studies. In our main result, and after identifying and utilizing the very few symmetries of ℓ p ℓp unit disks, we design optimal evacuation algorithms that vary with p . Our main technical contributions are two-fold. First, in our upper bound results, we provide (nearly) closed formulae for the worst-case cost of our algorithms. Second, and most importantly, our lower bounds&#39; arguments reduce to a novel observation in convex geometry which analyzes trade-offs between arc and chord lengths of ℓ p ℓp unit circles as the endpoints of the arcs (chords) change position around the perimeter of the disk, which we believe is interesting in its own right. Part of our argument pertaining to the latter property relies on a computer assisted numerical verification that can be done for non-extreme values of p .},

  abstract     = {Coloring unit-disk graphs efficiently is an important problem in the global and distributed setting, with applications in radio channel assignment problems when the communication relies on omni-directional antennas of the same power. In this context it is important to bound not only the complexity of the coloring algorithms, but also the number of colors used. In this paper, we consider two natural distributed settings. In the location-aware setting (when nodes know their coordinates in the plane), we give a constant time distributed algorithm coloring any unit-disk graph G with at most 4 ω ( G ) 4ω(G) colors, where ω ( G ) ω(G) is the clique number of G . This improves upon a classical 3-approximation algorithm for this problem, for all unit-disk graphs whose chromatic number significantly exceeds their clique number. When nodes do not know their coordinates in the plane, we give a distributed algorithm in the LOCAL model that colors every unit-disk graph G with at most 5.68 ω ( G ) + 1 5.68ω(G)+1 colors in ⁎ O ( log ⁎ ⁡ n ) O(log⁎⁡n) rounds. This algorithm is based on a study of the local structure of unit-disk graphs, which is of independent interest. We conjecture that every unit-disk graph G has average degree at most 4 ω ( G ) 4ω(G) , which would imply the existence of a O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) round algorithm coloring any unit-disk graph G with (approximately) 4 ω ( G ) 4ω(G) colors in the LOCAL model. We provide partial results towards this conjecture using Fourier-analytical tools.},

The R V C C C r RVCCCr is regular and vertex-symmetric, which makes its topological properties easy to be analyzed. However, the length of the circle in R V C C C r RVCCCr is fixed to 2 r which makes R V C C C r RVCCCr is inflexible. This paper proposes the family of generalized variational CCC networks, named R V C C C ( r , k ) RVCCC(r,k) , where r is the dimension of the underlying hypercube and the length of each cycle in R V C C C ( r , k ) RVCCC(r,k) is k × r k×r .

Since the length of each circle in R V C C C ( r , k ) RVCCC(r,k) is k × r k×r , the R V C C C ( r , k ) RVCCC(r,k) is more suitable to construct any scale interconnection network than R V C C C r RVCCCr .

  abstract     = {The interest in dynamic processes on networks is steadily rising in recent years. In this paper, we consider the ( α , β ) (α,β) -Threshold Network Dynamics ( ( α , β ) (α,β) -Dynamics), where α ≤ β α≤β , in which only structural dynamics (edge dynamics of the network) are allowed, guided by local threshold rules executed by each node. In particular, in each discrete round t , each active pair of nodes u and v , computes a value E ( u , v ) E(u,v) (the potential of the pair) as a function of the local structure of the network at round t around the two nodes. If E ( u , v ) E(u,v)&amp;lt;α then the link (if it exists) between u and v is removed; if α ≤ E ( u , v ) α≤E(u,v)&amp;lt;β then an existing link among u and v is maintained; if β ≤ E ( u , v ) β≤E(u,v) then a link between u and v is established if not already present. New nodes cannot be inserted as a result of the protocol, and existing nodes cannot be removed. The microscopic structure of ( α , β ) (α,β) -Dynamics appears to be simple, so that we are able to rigorously argue about it, but still flexible, so that we are able to design meaningful microscopic local rules that give rise to interesting macroscopic behaviors. Our goals are the following: a) to investigate the properties of the ( α , β ) (α,β) -Threshold Network Dynamics and b) to show that ( α , β ) (α,β) -Dynamics is expressive enough to solve complex problems on networks. Our contribution in these directions is twofold. We rigorously exhibit the claim about the expressiveness of ( α , β ) (α,β) -Dynamics, both by designing a simple protocol that provably computes the k -core of the network as well as by showing that ( α , β ) (α,β) -Dynamics are in fact Turing-Complete. Second and most important, we construct general tools for proving stabilization that work for a subclass of ( α , β ) (α,β) -Dynamics and prove speed of convergence in a restricted setting.},

Submodular optimization naturally appears in many streaming data applications such as social network influence maximization with the property of diminishing returns. However, in a practical setting, streaming data frequently comes with noises that are small but significant enough to impact the optimality of submodular optimization solutions. Following the framework of differential privacy (DP), this paper considers a streaming model with DP noise that is small by construction. Within this noisy streaming model, the paper strives to address the general problem of submodular maximization with a cardinality constraint. The main theoretical result we obtained is a streaming algorithm that is one-pass and has an approximation guarantee of 1 ( 2 + ( 1 + 1 k ) 2 ) ( 1 + 1 k ) − δ 1(2+(1+1k)2)(1+1k)−δ for any δ &gt; 0 δ&amp;gt;0 .

Recent theoretical studies have shown that EAs can achieve good approximation guarantees for solving the problem classes of submodular optimization, which have a wide range of applications, such as maximum coverage, sparse regression, influence maximization, document summarization and sensor placement, just to name a few. Though they have provided some theoretical explanation for the general-purpose nature of EAs, the considered submodular objective functions are defined only over sets or multisets. To complement this line of research, this paper studies the problem class of maximizing monotone submodular functions over sequences, where the objective function depends on the order of items. We prove that for each kind of previously studied monotone submodular objective functions over sequences, i.e., prefix monotone submodular functions, weakly monotone and strongly submodular functions, and DAG monotone submodular functions, a simple multi-objective EA, i.e., GSEMO, can always reach or improve the best known approximation guarantee after running polynomial time in expectation. Note that these best-known approximation guarantees can be obtained only by different greedy-style algorithms before. Empirical studies on various applications, e.g., accomplishing tasks, maximizing information gain, search-and-tracking and recommender systems , show the excellent performance of the GSEMO.},

Especially in the context of quickly growing the quantity of service delivery, the performance evaluation and testing of cloud-based software services is crucial to support the Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliant quality of delivery of these services. In this work, we use the Token bucket method, a scale rate-limiting algorithmic technique, to maximize the efficiency of cloud-based service performance. Increased availability and scalability in distributed systems has been a major obstacle for a long time. For cloud computing businesses to keep their customers happy, keep their trust, and keep their money, they need to make their services easy to use.

The token-bucket rate-limiting technique was created to perform the traffic-limiting function and guarantee the availability of the cloud platform&#39;s services. Measuring both scalability and availability helps illustrate the quality of service provided to customers. The performance of cloud-based software services is evaluated with regards to scalability using elasticity measurements.

When generalizing this to positive modal logic, there is a variety of relevant hyperspace constructions based on various topologies on a Priestley space and mechanisms to topologize the hyperspace of closed sets. A number of authors considered hyperspaces of Priestley spaces and their application to the coalgebraic approach to positive modal logic. A mixture of techniques from category theory , pointfree topology, and Priestley duality have been employed. Our aim is to provide a unifying approach to this area of research relying only on a basic familiarity with Priestley duality and related free constructions of distributive lattices .},

In Minlog this has been done in the past with the use of certain coinductive predicates. In a next step we want to analyze the lookahead of these extracted programs. Doing it by hand is quite cumbersome, so instead we change our definition. Instead of a coinductive predicate we use an inductive predicate for the representation of reals that already incorporates the lookahead. In this way the lookahead becomes part of the specification which is carried through all the proofs. In the end we extract programs for computations on a signed-digit representation and we can just read off the lookahead from the specification.},

Differential privacy is proposed as a successful technique to make use of these data, without leaking personal private data at the same time. In this paper, we investigate logical reasoning for differential privacy properties and propose model checking algorithms . We introduce the branching time temporal logic dpCTL* dpCTL* to specify differentially private properties. Several mechanisms in differential privacy are formalized as Markov chains or Markov decision processes . In our framework, we show that subtle privacy conditions are specified by dpCTL* dpCTL* . In order to verify privacy properties automatically, model checking problems are investigated. We develop a model checking algorithm for Markov chains. Model checking dpCTL* dpCTL* properties on Markov decision processes however is shown to be undecidable. Therefore, we propose a sound algorithm to verify these properties in Markov decision processes. We implement our model checking algorithm into a tool, based on the PRISM language, as well as show the experimental results and a case study of stream processing in differential privacy under the essential fairness assumptions.},

The authors presented service providers utility and users choice with two functions that takes into consideration the price of the service and the degree of irrationality of users. The results have shown that there is an equilibrium point between service providers utilities. Moreover, service providers revenue increases with the augmentation of their client&#39;s irrationality. Therefore, in term of maximizing their revenues, service providers prefer irrational customers rather than rational customers. And this result has been achieved when representing the graph of the price of Anarchy which reaches the value 1 as the degree of irrationality of customers increases.},

We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time , whereas the problem is PSPACE-complete when we restrict arborescences in a reconfiguration sequence to directed paths or relax to directed acyclic graphs.

Once every vertex is coloured, Alice wins if there is a connected red component of order at least k , and otherwise, Bob wins. This is a Maker-Breaker version of the Largest Connected Subgraph game introduced in [Bensmail et al., The largest connected subgraph game, Algorithmica 84 (9) (2022) 2533–2555]. We want to compute c g ( G ) cg(G) , which is the maximum k such that Alice wins in G , regardless of Bob&#39;s strategy. Given a graph G and k ∈ N k∈N , we prove that deciding whether c g ( G ) ≥ k cg(G)≥k is PSPACE-complete, even if G is a bipartite, split, or planar graph . To better understand the Largest Connected Subgraph game, we then focus on A-perfect graphs, which are the graphs G for which c g ( G ) = ⌈ | V ( G ) | / 2 ⌉ cg(G)=⌈|V(G)|/2⌉ , i.e. , those in which Alice can ensure that the red subgraph is connected. We give sufficient conditions , in terms of the minimum and maximum degrees or the number of edges, for a graph to be A-perfect. Also, we show that, for any d ≥ 4 d≥4 , there are arbitrarily large A-perfect d -regular graphs, but no cubic graph with order at least 18 is A-perfect. Lastly, we show that c g ( G ) cg(G) is computable in linear time when G is a P 4 P4 -sparse graph (a superclass of cographs).},

  abstract     = {Thorup and Zwick [1] introduced the notion of approximate distance oracles, a data structure that produces for an n -vertex, m -edge weighted undirected graph G = ( V , E ) , distance estimations in constant query time. They presented a distance oracle of size O ( k n 1 + 1 / k ) that given a pair of vertices u , v ∈ V at distance d ( u , v ) produces in O ( k ) time an estimation that is bounded by ( 2 k − 1 ) d ( u , v ) , i.e., a ( 2 k − 1 ) -multiplicative approximation (stretch). Thorup and Zwick [1] presented also a lower bound based on the girth conjecture of Erdős. For sparse unweighted graphs (i.e., m = O ˜ ( n ) ) the lower bound does not apply. Pǎtraşcu and Roditty [2] used the sparsity of the graph and obtained a distance oracle that uses O ˜ ( n 5 / 3 ) space, has O ( 1 ) query time and a stretch of 2. Pǎtraşcu et al. [3] presented infinitely many distance oracles with fractional stretch factors that for graphs with m = O ˜ ( n ) converge exactly to the integral stretch factors and the corresponding space bound of Thorup and Zwick. It is not known, however, whether graph sparsity can help to get a stretch which is better than ( 2 k − 1 ) using only O ˜ ( k n 1 + 1 / k ) space. In this paper we answer this open question and prove a separation between sparse and dense graphs by showing that using sparsity it is possible to obtain better stretch/space tradeoffs than those of Thorup and Zwick. We show that for every k ≥ 2 there is a distance oracle of size O ˜ ( k m 1 + 1 / k ) that produces in O ( k ) time an estimation d ⁎ ( u , v ) that satisfies d ( u , v ) ≤ d ⁎ ( u , v ) ≤ ( 2 k − 1 ) d ( u , v ) − 4 , for k &gt; 2 , and d ( u , v ) ≤ d ⁎ ( u , v ) ≤ 3 d ( u , v ) − 2 , for k = 2 . Another contribution of this paper is a refined stretch analysis of Thorup and Zwick distance oracles that allows us to obtain a better understanding of this important data structure. We present simple conditions for every w ∈ V that characterize the exact scenarios in which every query that involves w produces an estimation of stretch strictly better than 2 k − 1 , even in the case of dense graphs. We complement this contribution with an experiment on real world graphs. The main finding in the experiment is that different real world graphs are likely to satisfy the required conditions and hence the stretch of Thorup and Zwick distance oracles is much better than its worst case bound in these real world graphs.},

We prove tight bounds for the number of edges for graphs for some values of the total angular resolution up to a finite number of well specified exceptions of constant size.

  abstract     = {Widespread use of string solvers in the formal analysis of string-heavy programs has led to a growing demand for more efficient and reliable techniques which can be applied in this context. Designing practical algorithms for the (generally undecidable) satisfiability problem for systems of string constraints requires a deep understanding of the structure of constraints present in the targeted cases. In this paper, we first investigate relevant benchmarks containing regular expression membership predicates, extract a series of first order logic theories, and prove the decidability , respectively undecidability , of their satisfiability problem . Further, building on the theoretical results, we present a novel length-aware solving algorithm for the quantifier-free first-order theory over regular expression membership predicates and linear arithmetic over string length. We implement and evaluate this algorithm and related heuristics in the Z3 theorem prover . Besides the theoretical aspects leading to this algorithm, a crucial insight that underpins it is that real-world regex and string formulas contain a wealth of information about upper and lower bounds on lengths of strings, and such information can be used very effectively to simplify operations on automata representing regular expressions. Additionally, we present several novel general heuristics, such as the prefix/suffix method, that can be used to make a variety of regex solving algorithms more efficient in practice. We showcase the power of our algorithm and heuristics via an extensive empirical evaluation over a large and diverse benchmark of 57256 regex-heavy instances, almost 75\% of which are derived from industrial applications or contributed by other solver developers. Our solver outperforms five other state-of-the-art string solvers over this benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Stackelberg pricing games are pricing problems over a set of items. One player, the leader , sets prices for the items and the second player, the follower , buys a subset of items at minimal total cost subject to feasibility constraints. The constraints are determined by an optimization problem . For example, the Stackelberg shortest path game is used to optimize the income from road tolls (cf. [21] ). The items are edges in a network graph and the follower buys a subset of edges forming a path. The Stackelberg pricing games studied in the literature are formulated on top of covering problems. In this paper, we introduce pricing games based on packing problems. We are interested in the complexity of computing leader-optimal prices depending on different types of follower-constraints. We show that optimal prices can be computed in polynomial time if the follower-constraints are determined by the well-known interval scheduling problem. This problem is equivalent to the independent set problem on interval graphs . In case the follower-constraints are based on the independent set problem on perfect graphs or on the bipartite matching problem, we prove APX-hardness for the pricing problem. On a more general note, we prove Σ 2 p Σ2p -completeness if the follower-constraints are given by a packing problem that is NP-complete, i.e., the leader&#39;s pricing problem is hard even if she has an NP-oracle at hand.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid and continuous development of network technology, a multiprocessor system , consisting of multiple processors and communication links, plays an significant role in big data era. The topology of a multiprocessor system is a basic architecture of great influence on the network performance. Multiprocessor systems should have some good performances such as low communication costs, high network reliability, and friendly resource sharing. Therefore, designing a high-performance network architecture is of great significance to multiprocessor systems. In this paper, we propose a more general class of balanced hypercubes with two more general edge-disjoint sets of perfect matchings as cross edges. Then we explore some basic properties of G B H n GBHn . Furthermore, we show the connectivity, super connectivity, extra connectivity and (extra) diagnosability of G B H n GBHn , respectively.},

Despite the importance of many of these problems, there has been little success in generalizing these results beyond acyclicity. In this paper, we take on this challenge and propose nest-set width , a novel generalization of hypergraph β -acyclicity. We demonstrate that nest-set width has desirable properties and algorithmic significance. In particular, evaluation of boolean conjunctive queries with negation (CQ ¬ ) is tractable for classes with bounded nest-set width. Furthermore, propositional satisfiability ( SAT ) is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by nest-set width.},

Given a graph G with vertex thresholds τ , consider a dynamic process in which vertex v becomes activated once at least τ ( v ) of its neighbors are activated. A vertex set S is called a target set if all vertices of G would be activated when initially activating vertices of S . In the Target Set Reconfiguration problem, given two target sets X and Y of the same size, we are required to determine whether X can be transformed into Y by repeatedly swapping one vertex in the current set with another vertex not in the current set preserving every intermediate set as a target set. In this paper, we investigate the complexity of Target Set Reconfiguration in restricted cases. On the hardness side, we prove that Target Set Reconfiguration is PSPACE -complete on bipartite planar graphs of degree 3 and 4 and of threshold 2, bipartite 3-regular graphs and planar 3-regular graphs of threshold 1 and 2, and split graphs, which is in contrast to the fact that a special case called Vertex Cover Reconfiguration is in P for the last graph class. On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for Target Set Reconfiguration on graphs of maximum degree 2 and trees. The latter result can be thought of as a generalization of that for Vertex Cover Reconfiguration .},

An important quantity associated with such models is the partition function , which is the weighted sum over all sets of compatible polymers. Various approximation problems reduce to approximating the partition function of a polymer model. Central to the existence of such approximation algorithms are weight conditions of the respective polymer model. Such conditions are derived either via complex analysis or via probabilistic arguments. We follow the latter path and establish a new condition—the clique dynamics condition—, which is less restrictive than the ones in the literature. We introduce a new Markov chain where the clique dynamics condition implies rapid mixing by utilizing cliques of incompatible polymers that naturally arise from the translation of algorithmic problems into polymer models. This leads to improved parameter ranges for several approximation algorithms , such as a factor of at least 2 1 / α for the hard-core model on bipartite α -expanders.},

  abstract     = {We consider a known variant of bin packing called cardinality constrained bin packing , also called bin packing with cardinality constraints (BPCC). In this problem, there is a parameter k ≥ 2 k≥2 , and items of rational sizes in [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1] are to be packed into bins, such that no bin has more than k items or total size larger than 1. The goal is to minimize the number of bins. A recently introduced concept, called the price of clustering, deals with inputs that are presented in a way that they are split into clusters. Thus, an item has two attributes which are its size and its cluster. The goal is to measure the relation between an optimal solution that cannot combine items of different clusters into bins, and an optimal solution that can combine items of different clusters arbitrarily. Usually the number of clusters may be large, while clusters are relatively small, though not trivially small. Such problems are related to greedy bin packing algorithms , and to batched bin packing, which is similar to the price of clustering, but there is a constant number of large clusters. We analyze the price of clustering for BPCC, including the parametric case with bounded item sizes. We discuss several greedy algorithms for this problem that were not studied in the past, and comment on batched bin packing.},

As opposed to the perfect synchronization achieved in the firing squad problem, mod P -synchronization thus does not require the network to be strongly connected. In our algorithm, nodes know Δ, but they ignore which nodes are central in the network. We also prove that if the bound Δ on the radius exists but is unknown, then mod P -synchronization is impossible. All nodes in our algorithm fire in less that 6 P n 6Pn rounds, where n is the number of nodes, after all nodes become active, but use unbounded counters.

  abstract     = {The suffix array, perhaps the most important data structure in modern string processing, is often augmented with the longest common prefix (LCP) array which stores the lengths of the longest common prefixes for lexicographically adjacent suffixes of a string. Together the two arrays are roughly equivalent to the suffix tree with the LCP array representing the tree shape. In order to better understand the combinatorics of LCP arrays, we consider the problem of inferring a string from an LCP array, i.e., determining whether a given array of integers is a valid LCP array, and if it is, reconstructing some string or all strings with that LCP array. There are recent studies of inferring a string from a suffix tree shape but using significantly more information (in the form of suffix links) than is available in the LCP array. We provide two main results. (1) We describe two algorithms for inferring strings from an LCP array when we allow a generalized form of LCP array defined for a multiset of cyclic strings: a linear time algorithm for binary alphabet and a general algorithm with polynomial time complexity for a constant alphabet size. (2) We prove that determining whether a given integer array is a valid LCP array is NP-complete when we require more restricted forms of LCP array defined for a single cyclic or non-cyclic string or a multiset of non-cyclic strings. The result holds whether or not the alphabet is restricted to be binary. In combination, the two results show that the generalized form of LCP array for a multiset of cyclic strings is fundamentally different from the other more restricted forms.},

  abstract     = {Randomized dimensionality reduction has been recognized as one of the cornerstones in handling high-dimensional data, originating in various foundational works such as the celebrated Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. More specifically, nearest neighbor-preserving embeddings exist for ℓ2 (Euclidean) and ℓ1 (Manhattan) metrics, as well as doubling subsets of ℓ2 , where doubling dimension is today the most effective way of capturing intrinsic dimensionality , as well as input structure in various applications. These randomized embeddings bound the distortion only for distances between the query point and a point set. Motivated by the foundational character of fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor search in ℓ1 , this paper settles an important missing case, namely that of doubling subsets of ℓ1 . In particular, we introduce a randomized dimensionality reduction by means of a near neighbor-preserving embedding, which is related to the decision-with-witness problem. The input set gets represented with a carefully chosen covering point set; in a second step, the algorithm randomly projects the latter. In order to obtain the covering point sets, we leverage either approximate r -nets or randomly shifted grids, with different tradeoffs between preprocessing time and target dimension. We exploit Cauchy random variables, and derive a concentration bound of independent interest. Our algorithms are rather simple and should therefore be useful in practice.},

Generally, the reward from a mined block includes the fixed block subsidies and the time-varying transaction fees. The latter are offered by the senders whose transactions are packaged into blocks and are increasing with the block size being larger. However, the larger block size brings the longer latency, resulting in a smaller probability of successfully mining. Therefore, decision on the optimal block size of a block to trade off two factors above mentioned is a complex and crucial problem for the mining pools. In this paper, we model the repeated mining competition dynamics among mining pools as an evolutionary game, in which each mining pool has two strategies: following the upper bound of block size B ¯ B¯ , or selecting a block size smaller than B ¯ B¯ . Because of the bounded rationality, each mining pool pursues its evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) on block size by continuous learning and adjustments during the whole mining process. A framework is built for the general evolutionary game, based on which we then explore the existence and stability of the ESSs for a case of two mining pools. Numerical experiments using the real Bitcoin data are conducted to demonstrate the theoretical results in this paper.},

Further, we want that G [ S ] G[S] is highly connected. That is, G [ S ] G[S] should be n − k n−k edge-connected. Clearly, the problem is NP -complete, as substituting k = n − 1 k=n−1 , we obtain the Connected Vertex Cover problem. A simple observation also shows that the problem admits an algorithm with running time n O ( k ) nO(k) . Since the problem is polynomial-time solvable for every fixed integer k , a natural parameter is the integer k . In all the problems we consider, the parameter is k , and the goal is to find a solution S of size at most ℓ , such that G [ S ] G[S] is n − k n−k edge-connected and G − S G−S satisfies a property. We show that this version of well-known problems such as Vertex Cover , Feedback Vertex Set , Odd Cycle Transversal and Multiway Cut admit an algorithm with running time f ( k ) ⋅ n O ( 1 ) f(k)⋅nO(1) , that is, they are FPT with the parameter k . One of our main subroutines to obtain these algorithms is an FPT algorithm for n − k n−k edge connected Steiner Subgraph , which could be of an independent interest. Finally, we also show that such an algorithm is not possible for Multicut .},

  abstract     = {The line graphs of some well-known graphs, such as the generalized hypercube and the crossed cube, have been adopted for the logic graphs of data center networks (DCNs). Conditional bijective connection networks (conditional BC networks) are a class of networks which have been proved to include hypercubes, crossed cubes, locally twisted cubes and Möbius cubes, etc. Hence, the researches on the line graphs of conditional BC networks can be applied to DCNs. Edge independent spanning trees (EISTs) on a graph have received extensive attention because of their applications in reliable communication, fault-tolerant broadcasting and secure message distribution. Since the line graph of an n -dimensional conditional BC network, denoted as L ( X C n ) , is ( 2 n − 2 ) -regular, whether there exist 2 n − 2 EISTs on L ( X C n ) is an open question. In this paper, we first propose a parallel algorithm to construct 2 n − 2 EISTs rooted at an arbitrary node on L ( X C n ) , where n ≥ 2 . Then, we prove the correctness of our algorithm. Finally, we give a simulation result of our algorithm.},

Both problems receive a digraph G and a set P P of paths in G , and their objective is to find a minimum cardinality set S S of paths, whose elements are arc-disjoint and cover all arcs of G . Despite the similarities, the solutions for each problem must satisfy different properties. For k-PSEC , the set S S must be obtained by splitting the paths in P P in order to guarantee that no element of S S has length greater than a given integer k . For PCEC , the paths in P P cannot be split, and the elements of S S are single arcs of G or complete paths of P P . PCEC and k-PSEC have practical applications in network design and network monitoring systems, being also natural versions of graph covering problems . However, there are no theoretical studies on their complexity. This work not only presents NP-hardness results for the problems, but also proves that, unless P = NP P=NP , PCEC cannot be | P | O ( 1 ) |P|O(1) -approximated in polynomial-time. Moreover, polynomial-time algorithms are presented for paths, cycles, and trees, and polynomial-time approximation algorithms are proposed for special cases of k-PSEC .},

Given a multiset F of grid vertices such that | R | = | F | , APF asks for a distributed algorithm that moves robots so as to reach a configuration similar to F . Similarity means that robots must be disposed as F regardless of translations, rotations, reflections. So far, as possible graph discretizing the Euclidean plane only the standard square grid has been considered in the context of the classical OBLOT model. However, it is natural to consider also the other regular tessellation graphs, that are triangular and hexagonal grids. In particular, the former can be considered as the most general in terms of possible symmetries and trajectories. We provide a resolution algorithm for APF when the initial configuration is asymmetric and the considered topology is any regular tessellation graph. The algorithm and its correctness are based on a rigorous methodology.},

This work is the first attempt to certify time complexity bounds of a fault-tolerant distributed algorithm. Our case study consists in formally proving, using the Coq proof assistant, the time complexity of the first Dijkstra&#39;s self-stabilizing token ring algorithm. In more detail, we formally prove both the self-stabilization and exact worst-case stabilization time of this algorithm assuming asynchronous settings. This latter result is obtained in two main steps. First, we certify a non-trivial upper bound on the stabilization time, i.e. , every execution in an N -size ring contains at most 3 ⋅ N ⋅ ( N − 1 ) 2 − N − 1 3⋅N⋅(N−1)2−N−1 steps if N ≥ 4 N≥4 , at most 3 steps if N = 3 N=3 ; and in remaining cases, the stabilization time is zero. Then, for each case, we exhibit a possible execution whose complexity exactly matches those upper bounds. Notice that the tight bounds for N = 3 N=3 and N ≥ 4 N≥4 were unknown until now, even among self-stabilization researchers.},

Furthermore, if robots have a multiplicity detection mechanism, Gathering is solvable only when the number of robots is odd. This work aims to further characterize the impact that different capabilities/assumptions (including light capability) have on the solvability of the problem. We introduce novel types of a view model called “set-view”, “arbitrary-view” and “multi-set-view,” and then propose six algorithms (five of these are optimal in terms of the number of colors of lights) to solve Gathering as a formation problem when robots have lights. The proposed algorithm in SSYNC shows that the light model is stronger than the multiplicity detection mechanism for solving Gathering as a formation problem.},

  abstract     = {We study the k -Canadian Traveller Problem, where the objective is to lead a traveller in an undirected weighted graph G from a source s to a target t , knowing that at most k edges of the graph are blocked and cannot be traversed. The locations of blockages are unknown at the beginning of the walk but a blocked edge is revealed when the traveller visits one of its endpoints. There exist graphs for which the competitive ratio of any deterministic strategies cannot be smaller than 2 k + 1 2k+1 . Conversely, there exists a very simple strategy, reposition , which achieves this ratio 2 k + 1 2k+1 . It consists in successively traversing shortest ( s , t ) (s,t) -paths and coming back to s when the traveller is blocked. We refine this analysis by detecting families of graphs for which a smaller competitive ratio can be obtained. This paper produces a global analysis to understand the impact of the size of the maximum ( s , t ) (s,t) -cuts of G on the competitiveness of deterministic strategies. We design deterministic strategies achieving a ratio ρ k + O ( λ ) ρk+O(λ) , with ρ ρ&amp;lt;2 , for two different cut parameters λ . In particular, we propose a strategy called detour with a competitive ratio 2 k + O ( μ max E ) 2k+O(μmaxE) , where μ max E μmaxE is the size of the maximum edge ( s , t ) (s,t) -cut. Another contribution is a strategy called bypass with a competitive ratio 2 3 4 k + O ( λ max V ) 234k+O(λmaxV) , where λ max V λmaxV is the size of the maximum vertex ( s , t ) (s,t) -cut of all subgraphs of G . This produces an efficient algorithm for outerplanar graphs, which verify λ max V ≤ 2 λmaxV≤2 .},

Specifically, given a weighted graph G = ( V , E ; w , c ) G=(V,E;w,c) and a constant d 0 d0 , where n = | V | n=|V| , m = | E | m=|E| , length function w : E → R + w:E→R+ and cost function c : E → R + c:E→R+ , we are asked to determine a minimum shortest path tree among all shortest path trees (in G ) whose delays are no more than d 0 d0 , where the delay of a shortest path tree is the maximum distance (with respect to w ( ⋅ ) w(⋅) ) from its source to every other leaf in that tree, and the cost of such a shortest path tree is the sum of costs of all edges (with respect to c ( ⋅ ) c(⋅) ) in that tree. In addition, when a constant d 0 d0 is the radius of G , we refer to this version of the Delayc-MSPT problem as the minimum radius minimum shortest path tree (MinRadius-MSPT) problem, and when a constant d 0 d0 is the diameter of G , we refer to that version of the Delayc-MSPT problem as the maximum delay minimum shortest path tree (MaxDelay-MSPT) problem. In addition, we consider the diameter-constrained minimum shortest path tree (Diamc-MSPT) problem, except substituting the diameter for the delay of G in the Delayc-MSPT problem, where the diameter of a shortest path tree is the maximum distance (with respect to w ( ⋅ ) w(⋅) ) between any two leaves in that tree.

  abstract     = {The cohesive subgraph k-core is a maximal connected subgraph with the minimum degree δ ≥ k δ≥k of a simple graph, where integer k ≥ 0 k≥0 . Define the core number of a vertex w as the maximum k such that w is contained in a k -core. The core decomposition problem which is calculating the core numbers of all vertices in static graphs, and the core maintenance problem which is updating the core numbers in dynamic graphs are our main concern. Although, core numbers can be updated by the core decomposition algorithms , only a small part of vertices&#39; core numbers have changed after the change of a graph. Thus, it is necessary to update core numbers locally to reduce the cost. In this paper, we study the core maintenance problem on edge-weighted graphs by using the vertex sequence k-order which is ordered by the order that the core decomposition algorithm removes vertices. We design the core maintenance algorithms for inserting one edge at a time and the method of updating the k -order, which reduce the searching range and the time cost evidently. For the removing case, we use the existing subcore algorithm to do the core maintenance and modify it with the method of updating k -order we design. Finally, we do extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our algorithms, which shows that the order based algorithm has a better performance than the existing for the core maintenance on edge-weighted graphs.},

  abstract     = {Emerging wireless and mobile applications, such as border intrusion detection with station-based drones, brought a new barrier coverage problem of using sink-based mobile sensors to cover a given line barrier with minimum energy consumption. In this paper, we focus on the uniform sink-based line barrier coverage (SLBC) problem, in which we are given a line barrier and k sink stations distributed on the plane which can emit an infinite number of sensors with an identical sensing radius. The problem aims to find their final positions on the barrier for the sensors emitted by the stations, such that the total moving distance of the sensors is minimized and each point of the barrier is within the sensing area of at least one sensor. We first observe the geometric structure of an optimal solution that any optimal solution can be considered as a set of intersecting tangent (disk) segments, where a tangent (disk) segment is a sequence of tangent disks. Then, we devise an algorithm to calculate all possible tangent (disk) segments and another algorithm to calculate the near-optimal positions for each of such segments. After computing all tangent (disk) segments and their near-optimal positions, an algorithm is proposed to transform uniform SLBC into an instance of the shortest path problem . It is shown the whole algorithm deserves a runtime O ( k 2 log ⁡ k r ε ) O(k2log⁡krε) and consumes at most ε more movement than an optimal solution, where ε is any given positive real number, and r and k are the sensor radius and the number of sink stations, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Map matching is to track the positions of vehicles on the road network based on the positions provided by GPS (Global Positioning System) devices. Balancing localization accuracy and computation efficiency is a key problem in map matching. Existing methods mainly use Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or historical transportation data to learn the transitional probabilities among road segments. Although the roads to explore can be remarkably reduced by the Markov assumption, miss-of-match and matching breaks may occur if the GPS data is highly noisy, and the transitional model needs to be learned offline. To address these problems, this paper presents Multiple Candidate Matching (MCM) to improve the robustness of map matching. MCM doesn&#39;t need to pre-train the transitional model nor the historical transportation information. MCM memorizes multiple historical matching candidates in the map matching process. It votes among historical matchings and current matchings, but generates limited number of road candidates in real-time to restrict the computation complexity. MCM for both online map matching and offline map matching are presented and their properties are analyzed theoretically and experimentally. Numerical experiments in large-scale data sets show that MCM is very promising in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness. The matching break and miss-of-match problems can be resolved effectively when compared with the state-of-the-art map matching methods.

  abstract     = {The concept of blockchain has sparked hopes in the field of communication security between IoT devices. In blockchain , all network nodes need to verify its legitimacy before accepting and recording it. Users of HIoTNs (Hierarchical IoT Networks) want to get real-time data from specific sensors in a specific implementation. Users need authentications at GNs for obtaining their required services. On successful authentications , parties on either sides of communication can create secret session keys for safe communications. Critical issues like this in HIoTNs are addressed in this work by its novel proposed multimodal-biometrics based lightweight user authentications . The scheme based on block chain technologies is called SMUAAKMPs (Secure Multimodal Biometrics-based User Anonymous Authenticated Key Management Protocols). ECDSAs (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithms) are utilised for devices and GNs, to generate public and private keys. In addition, multimodal biometric verifications are executed using fuzzy commitment approaches. The fuzzy commitment technique is then used to validate the biometric authentication using the segmented face. This work&#39;s detailed security analyses use ROR (Real-Or-Random) models where formal security verifications are done by software verification tool AVISPAs (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications). Informal security analyses show that the proposed SMUAAKMPs withstand multiple known attacks. The system also provides improved safety and functionalities at reduced costs in computations and communications when compared to UABKMPs, UAKMPs, and SMBUAKEPs.},

  abstract     = {Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a multifarious progressive disease that increases the mortality and morbidity ratio as well as becoming a life-threatening issue of an individual. Accurate and cost-effective diagnosis of diseases plays a primary role in the medical domain and a wide range of research has been carried out on disease prediction using sensory approaches along with the assistance of machine learning techniques. The traditional disease diagnosis procedures are invasive, costlier and the decision support systems were unreliable most of the time. The human exhaled breath discharged from the body is composed of various Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) which can be influenced by metabolic and disease activities . Hence, the analysis of VOCs in exhaled breath has an incredible potentiality for COPD diagnosis and can rapidly decrease the mortality rate. In this research, IoT-Spiro System is designed and an intelligent machine learning forecasting framework (IMLFF) has been proposed. IoT-Spiro System perceives the various VOCs patterns available in exhaled breath and that real-time parameter has been analyzed using IMLFF. The proposed framework incorporates a hybrid Genetic Big Bang-Big Crunch (GBB-BC) algorithm for selecting the optimal features from the real-time dataset and a Fuzzy-based Quantum Neural Network (F-QNN) classifier for diagnosing COPD. The experimental results illustrate that IMLFF outperforms when compared to recent existing approaches concerning various statistical parameters and performance metrics. From the result analysis, it has been determined that IoT-Spiro System and IMLFF framework can serve as an efficient assisting model to the medical practitioner for diagnosing COPD.},

The proposed OAOFS-MLIDS model aims to accomplish secure access control via the detection of the intrusions exist in it. To accomplish this, the proposed OAOFS-MLIDS model initially pre-processes the networking data using min-max normalization.

For ensuring the better performance of the OAOFS-MLIDS model, a wide range of simulations were carried out on benchmark dataset.

Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) information Solicitation (DIS) messages are received by a node in the RPL protocol to access the network. This function may be abused by a malicious node to transmit illegitimate DIS messages to neighbouring nodes to launch a DIS flooding attack. It is found that the DIS flooding attack raises the overhead of the network control packet , which greatly degrades the efficiency of the network. This further raises the network resource demand of the nodes. A defence scheme called DIS-mitigation in RPL is proposed to resolve this problem. The proposed system greatly mitigates the impact of the DIS flooding attack on the output of the network and also finds the nodes that produce the DIS flood attack effectively. The efficacy of the suggested scheme is related to the traditional RPL protocol and the current stable RPL mechanism. In both static and dynamic network conditions, the experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed model identifies and mitigates DIS flooding attacks rapidly and effectively, without introducing any major overhead to the nodes.},

The improved network access area and quick network setup make it an excellent technology. However, certain eradicating problems will also be present, slowing the expansion of the network. The forecasting of connection failure is still thought to be a mystery in the WSN area. The suggested method provides a thorough understanding of connection failure. This method introduces the proficient trustworthy Node ID dependent resource reservation protocol (PTN-RRP). Then, using technique weighted on end-to-end latency, the shortest path is identified. Major issues with WSN include data link failure and intrusions. This method might increase the rate of detection since it determines the shortest route from a particular preliminary point to the target. The hop address and sequence number are added to the protocol by determining the shortest path. Following the discovery of the shortest path, the likelihood of connection failure is calculated. The established trustworthy etiquette adopted has a link failure structure that can foresee and resolve connection failure-related problems. After that, a posterior probability evaluation approach is used to determine the type of assault in order to determine the attack reason intended for the connection failure. Finally, a simulation study is used to evaluate the performance of the suggested strategy. The simulation&#39;s results show that the proposed technique is extremely successful in identifying link breaks, and the developed algorithm for recognising the shortest path will shorten the time required to find the shortest way. To demonstrate the usefulness of the suggested methodology, the performance result is contrasted with currently used procedures.},

We show that for a general definition of protocols with unreliable communication with constant-storage agents such protocols can only compute predicates computable by immediate observation (IO) population protocols (sometimes also called one-way protocols). Immediate observation population protocols are inherently tolerant to unreliable communication and keep their expressive power under a wide range of fairness conditions. We also prove that a large class of message-based models that are generally more expressive than IO becomes strictly less expressive than IO in the unreliable case.},

  abstract     = {Automata based algorithms have always dominated the history of string matching, thanks to their intrinsic nature of recognizers. Among them, those based on the suffix automaton deserve a special mention, because its use has always led to elegant and very efficient solutions in practice. In this paper, we present two novel string matching algorithms based on the suffix automaton which are particularly suitable for very long strings. The first algorithm simulates the suffix automaton through the well known bit-parallelism approach, while the second makes use of an alternative non-standard simulation. We mainly focus on the second solution, which turns out to be more flexible in practice, and present some extensions of it. Experimental results suggest that both our solutions are very efficient in practical cases scaling much better when the length of the pattern increases. Moreover, our second approach is also competitive with the most effective solutions available for the exact string matching problem .},

  abstract     = {The Billaud Conjecture, which has been open since 1993, is a fundamental problem on finite words w and their heirs, i.e., the words obtained by deleting every occurrence of a given letter from w . It posits that every morphically primitive word, i.e., a word which is a fixed point of the identity morphism only, has at least one morphically primitive heir. In this paper, we introduce and investigate the related class of so-called Billaud words, i.e., words whose all heirs are morphically imprimitive. We provide a characterisation of morphically imprimitive Billaud words, using a new concept. We show that there are two phenomena through which words can have morphically imprimitive heirs, and we highlight that only one of those occurs in morphically primitive words. Finally, we examine our concept further, and we use it to rephrase and study the Billaud Conjecture in more detail.},

  abstract     = {An instance I of the Stable Matching Problem (SMP) is given by a bipartite graph with a preference list of neighbors for every vertex. A swap in I is the exchange of two consecutive vertices in a preference list. A swap can be viewed as a smallest perturbation of I . Boehmer et al. (2021) designed a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the minimum number of swaps required to turn a given maximal matching into a stable matching. We generalize this result to the many-to-many version of SMP. We do so first by introducing a new representation of SMP as an extended bipartite graph and subsequently by reducing the problem to submodular minimization. It is a natural problem to establish the computational complexity of deciding whether at most k swaps are enough to turn I into an instance where one of the maximum matchings is stable. Using a hardness result of Gupta et al. (2020), we prove that this problem is NP-hard and, moreover, this problem parameterised by k is W[1]-hard. We also obtain a lower bound on the running time for solving the problem using the Exponential Time Hypothesis.},

Given a graph G , an integer c and an ordered list of integers ( b 1 , b 2 , … , b c ) (b1,b2,…,bc) , BCP asks whether there exists a proper coloring of G where the i -th color is used to color at most b i bi many vertices. This problem generalizes two well-studied graph coloring problems, Bounded Coloring Problem ( BoCP ) and Equitable Coloring Problem ( ECP ) and as in the case of other coloring problems, the BCP is NP -hard even for constant values of c . So we study BCP under the paradigm of parameterized complexity, particularly with respect to (structural) parameters that specify how far (the deletion distance) the input graph is from a tractable graph class.},

  abstract     = {A version of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity , denoted KT KT , has received attention in the past several years, due to its close connection to circuit complexity and to the Minimum Circuit Size Problem MCSP MCSP . Essentially all results about the complexity of MCSP MCSP hold also for MKTP MKTP (the problem of computing the KT KT complexity of a string). Both MKTP MKTP and MCSP MCSP are hard for SZK SZK (Statistical Zero Knowledge) under BPP BPP -Turing reductions; neither is known to be NP NP -complete. Recently, some hardness results for MKTP MKTP were proved that are not (yet) known to hold for MCSP MCSP . In particular, MKTP MKTP is hard for DET DET (a subclass of P P ) under nonuniform ≤ m NC 0 ≤mNC0 reductions. In this paper, we improve this, to show that MKTP ‾ MKTP‾ is hard for the (apparently larger) class NISZK L L under not only ≤ m NC 0 ≤mNC0 reductions but even under projections. Also MKTP ‾ MKTP‾ is hard for NISZK NISZK under ≤ m P / poly ≤mP/poly reductions. Here, NISZK NISZK is the class of problems with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and NISZK L L is the non-interactive version of the class SZK L SZKL that was studied by Dvir et al. As an application, we provide several improved worst-case to average-case reductions to problems in NP NP , and we obtain a new lower bound on MKTP MKTP (which is currently not known to hold for MCSP MCSP ).},

In the classical ( unconstrained ) k -supplier problem, we are given a set of clients C in a metric space X X , with distance function d ( . , . ) d(.,.) . We are also given a set of feasible facility locations L ⊆ X L⊆X . The goal is to open a set F of k facilities in L to minimize the maximum distance of any client to the closest open facility, i.e., minimize, cost ( F , C ) ≡ max j ∈ C ⁡ { d ( F , j ) } cost(F,C)≡maxj∈C⁡{d(F,j)} , where d ( F , j ) d(F,j) is the distance of client j to the closest facility in F . The k -center problem is a special case of the k -supplier problem where L = C L=C . We study various constrained versions of the k -supplier problem such as: capacitated , fault-tolerant , ℓ -diversity, etc. These problems fall under a broad framework of constrained clustering . A unified framework for constrained clustering was proposed by Ding and Xu [Algorithmica 2020] in the context of the k -median and k -means objectives. We extend this framework to the k -supplier and k -center objectives in this work. This unified framework allows us to obtain results simultaneously for the following constrained versions of the k -supplier problem: r-gather, r-capacity, balanced, chromatic, fault-tolerant, strongly private, ℓ-diversity, and fair k-supplier problems, with and without outliers . We design Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) algorithms for these problems. FPT algorithms have polynomial running time if the parameter under consideration is a constant. This may be relevant even to a practitioner since the parameter k is a small number in many real clustering scenarios. We obtain the following results:},

Motivated by welfare economics, similarity is quantified using information-theoretic divergences. Worst-case fairness aims to parallel the spirit of the price of anarchy from noncooperative game theory, quantifying how much unfairness is compatible with coalitional rationality. Computing worst-case fairness is tractable in weighted voting games and classes of coalitional skill games, but NP-hard in highway allocation, induced-subgraph games and some task-count coalitional skill games. In these cases we show approximation algorithms that yield constant approximations .

Such a pair is called a Jordan decomposition of f . Ko (1991) and Zheng and Rettinger (2005) have analyzed computability-theoretic and complexity-theoretic aspects of this theorem. We complement their observations by three new results. One of our results says that there exists a polynomial time computable, absolutely continuous function f : [ 0 , 1 ] → R f:[0,1]→R with polynomial modulus of absolute continuity such that, on the one hand, the so-called standard Jordan decomposition of f is computable but, on the other hand, neither the standard Jordan decomposition of f nor any other Jordan decomposition of f can be computed easily, say, in polynomial time , or in exponential time .},

The Hamiltonian Index h ( G ) h(G) of G is the smallest r such that L r ( G ) Lr(G) has a Hamiltonian cycle [Chartrand, 1968]. Checking if h ( G ) = k h(G)=k is NP NP -hard for any fixed integer k ≥ 0 k≥0 even for subcubic graphs G [Ryjáček et al., 2011]. We study the parameterized complexity of this problem with the parameter treewidth, t w ( G ) tw(G) , and show that we can find h ( G ) h(G) in time 1 O ⋆ ( ( 1 + 2 ( ω + 3 ) ) t w ( G ) ) O⋆((1+2(ω+3))tw(G)) where ω is the matrix multiplication exponent. Prior work on computing h ( G ) h(G) includes various O ⋆ ( 2 O ( t w ( G ) ) ) O⋆(2O(tw(G))) -time algorithms for checking if h ( G ) = 0 h(G)=0 holds; i.e., whether G has a Hamiltonian Cycle [Cygan et al., FOCS 2011; Bodlaender et al., Inform. Comput., 2015; Fomin et al., JACM 2016]; an O ⋆ ( t w ( G ) O ( t w ( G ) ) ) O⋆(tw(G)O(tw(G))) -time algorithm for checking if h ( G ) = 1 h(G)=1 holds; i.e., whether L ( G ) L(G) has a Hamiltonian Cycle [Lampis et al., Discrete Appl.

Our algorithm for computing h ( G ) h(G) generalizes these results. The NP NP -hard Eulerian Steiner Subgraph problem takes as input a graph G and a specified subset K of terminal vertices of G and asks if G has an Eulerian 2 subgraph H containing all the terminals. A key ingredient of our algorithm for finding h ( G ) h(G) is an algorithm which solves Eulerian Steiner Subgraph in O ⋆ ( ( 1 + 2 ( ω + 3 ) ) t w ( G ) ) O⋆((1+2(ω+3))tw(G)) time. To the best of our knowledge this is the first FPT FPT algorithm for Eulerian Steiner Subgraph . Prior work on the special case of finding a spanning Eulerian subgraph (i.e., with K = V ( G ) K=V(G) ) includes a polynomial-time algorithm for series-parallel graphs [Richey et al., 1985] and an O ⋆ ( 2 O ( n ) ) O⋆(2O(n)) -time algorithm for planar graphs on n vertices [Sau and Thilikos, 2010]. Our algorithm for Eulerian Steiner Subgraph generalizes both these results.},

The logic allows the description of architecture configurations coordinating instances of a finite number of types of components, by means of inductive definitions similar to the ones used to describe algebraic data types or recursive data structures . For parametric systems specified in this logic, we show that decision problems such as reaching deadlock or violating critical section are undecidable, in general. Despite this negative result, we provide for these decision problems practical semi-algorithms relying on the automatic synthesis of structural invariants allowing the proof of general safety properties. The invariants are defined using the WS κ S WSκS fragment of the monadic second order logic , known to be decidable by a classical automata-logic connection, thus reducing a verification problem to checking satisfiability of a WS κ S WSκS formula.},

  abstract     = {This paper enriches a pre-existing decision algorithm, which in turn augmented a fragment of Tarski&#39;s elementary algebra with one-argument real functions endowed with a continuous first derivative. In its present (still quantifier-free) version, our decidable language embodies the addition of functions and multiplication of functions by scalars; the issue we address is the one of satisfiability. As regards real numbers, individual variables and constructs designating the basic arithmetic operations are available, along with comparison relators. As regards functions, we have variables of another sort, out of which compound terms are formed by means of constructs designating addition and differentiation. An array of predicates designates various relationships between functions, as well as function properties, that may hold over intervals of the real line; those are: function comparisons, strict and non-strict monotonicity / convexity / concavity , comparisons between the derivative of a function and a real-valued term. Our decision method consists in preprocessing the given formula into an equi-satisfiable quantifier-free formula of the elementary algebra of real numbers, whose satisfiability can then be checked by means of Tarski&#39;s decision method. No direct reference to functions will appear in the target formula, each function variable having been superseded by a collection of stub real variables; hence, in order to prove that the proposed translation is satisfiability-preserving, we must figure out a flexible-enough family of interpolating C 1 C1 functions that can accommodate a model for the source formula whenever the target formula turns out to be satisfiable. With respect to the results announced in earlier papers of the same stream, a significant effort went into designing the family of interpolating functions so that it could meet the new constraints stemming from the presence of function addition (along with differentiation) among the constructs of our fragment of mathematical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Classic automated algorithm selection (AS) for (combinatorial) optimization problems heavily relies on so-called instance features, i.e., numerical characteristics of the problem at hand ideally extracted with computationally low-demanding routines. For the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) a plethora of features have been suggested. Most of these features are, if at all, only normalized imprecisely raising the issue of feature values being strongly affected by the instance size. Such artifacts may have detrimental effects on algorithm selection models. We propose a normalization for two feature groups which stood out in multiple AS studies on the TSP: (a) features based on a minimum spanning tree (MST) and (b) nearest neighbor relationships of the input instance. To this end we theoretically derive minimum and maximum values for properties of MSTs and k -nearest neighbor graphs (NNG) of Euclidean graphs. We analyze the differences in feature space between normalized versions of these features and their unnormalized counterparts. Our empirical investigations on various TSP benchmark sets point out that the feature scaling succeeds in eliminating the effect of the instance size. A proof-of-concept AS-study shows promising results: models trained with normalized features tend to outperform those trained with the respective vanilla features.},

In the existing works, collection and collaboration are two major approaches to realize the improvement of transfer learning performance. Even though the effectiveness of these approaches has been validated in extensive experiments, there lacks the support of theoretical analysis. Consequently, how to enhance transfer learning effectively is an open problem. In light of this, in this paper, we thoroughly and deeply study the methods of improving transfer learning performance in order to provide the guidelines for applying transfer learning in real applications. Through our proof process, critical conclusions are drawn to help learn the motivation of implementing collection and collaboration, the performance gap between collection and collaboration, and the impacts of data sharing strategies on transfer learning in collaboration.

  abstract     = {Contention resolution schemes (or CR schemes), introduced by Chekuri, Vondrak and Zenklusen, are a class of randomized rounding algorithms for converting a fractional solution to a relaxation for a down-closed constraint family into an integer solution . A CR scheme takes a fractional point x in a relaxation polytope , rounds each coordinate x i xi independently to get a possibly non-feasible set, and then drops some elements in order to satisfy the constraints. Intuitively, a CR scheme is c -balanced if every element i is selected with probability at least c ⋅ x i c⋅xi . It is known that general matroids admit a ( 1 − 1 / e ) (1−1/e) -balanced CR scheme, and that this is (asymptotically) optimal. This is in particular true for the special case of uniform matroids of rank one. In this work, we provide a simple and explicit monotone CR scheme for uniform matroids of rank k on n elements with a balancedness of 1 − ( n k ) ( 1 − k n ) n + 1 − k ( k n ) k 1−(nk)(1−kn)n+1−k(kn)k , and show that this is optimal. As n grows, this expression converges from above to 1 − e − k k k / k ! 1−e−kkk/k! . While this asymptotic bound can be obtained by combining previously known results, these require defining an exponential-sized linear program , as well as using random sampling and the ellipsoid algorithm. Our procedure, on the other hand, has the advantage of being simple and explicit. This scheme extends naturally into an optimal CR scheme for partition matroids.},

Our aim is to compare these various flavors by considering the classes of formal languages that each can describe, establishing, as a result, a hierarchy of language classes. Beyond the hierarchy itself, some complexity results are given, and as part of the effort on comparing language classes new pumping lemmas are established, old classes are extended to new ones, and several incidental results on the nature of these language classes are given.},

This problem, formally know as Tree Containment, is NP-complete in general and polynomial-time solvable for certain classes of phylogenetic networks. In this paper, we connect ideas from quantum computing and phylogenetics to present an efficient Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation for Tree Containment in the general setting. For an instance ( N , T ) (N,T) of Tree Containment, where N N is a phylogenetic network with n N nN vertices and T T is a phylogenetic tree with n T nT vertices, the number of logical qubits that are required for our formulation is O ( n N n T ) O(nNnT) .},

Moving services from cloud servers to mobile edge nodes (MENs) can decrease service response time. Due to the restricted processing and bandwidth capabilities of MEC networks, service caching and replacement incurs inescapable latency and energy costs. Thus motivated, we propose the joint service caching and task offloading problem in edge networks (SCTOE) to minimize the cost of edge services. We present a collaborative service caching mechanism (CSCM) that strengthens service sharing between MENs by forming caching coalitions. We prove that SCTOE is NP-hard and that CSCM can enhance the service efficiency of the edge network by theoretical analyses. Then we utilize a random rounding algorithm (RR) to figure out the feasible solution to the SCTOE problem. Finally, we test the performance of the CSCM+RR algorithm by simulating experiments using a real dataset. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively utilize the available caching resources to maximize the performance of the algorithm in the average response delay and the profit of edge networks.},

We thus propose a new model able to build random growing networks with (almost) any wanted degree distribution. The degree distribution can either be theoretical or extracted from a real-world network. The main idea is to invert the recurrence equation commonly used to compute the degree distribution in order to find a convenient attachment function for node connections - commonly chosen as linear. We compute this attachment function for some classical distributions, as the power-law, the broken power-law, and the geometric distributions . We also use the model on an undirected version of the Twitter network, for which the degree distribution has an unusual shape. We finally show that the divergence of chosen attachment functions is directly linked to the heavy-tailed property of the obtained degree distributions.},

  abstract     = {The benefits of using crossover in crossing fitness gaps have been studied extensively in evolutionary computation. Recent runtime results show that majority-vote crossover is particularly efficient at optimizing the well-known Jump benchmark function that includes a fitness gap next to the global optimum. Also estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs), which use an implicit crossover, are much more efficient on Jump than typical mutation-based algorithms. However, the allowed gap size for polynomial runtimes with EDAs is at most logarithmic in the problem dimension n . In this paper, we investigate variants of the Jump function where the gap is shifted and appears in the middle of the typical search trajectory. Such gaps can still be overcome efficiently in time O ( n log ⁡ n ) O(nlog⁡n) by majority-vote crossover and an estimation-of-distribution algorithm, even for gap sizes almost n n . However, if the global optimum is located in the gap instead of the usual all-ones string, majority-vote crossover would nevertheless approach the all-ones string and be highly inefficient. In sharp contrast, an EDA can still find such a shifted optimum efficiently. Thanks to a general property called fair sampling , the EDA will with high probability sample from almost every fitness level of the function, including levels in the gap, and sample the global optimum even though the overall search trajectory points towards the all-ones string. Finally, we derive limits on the gap size allowing efficient runtimes for the EDA.},

Among all the existing designs, only the ones separately proposed by Zhang et al. over coding theory and An et al. over lattice are post-quantum secure. However, both schemes fall short of being practical due to their huge overhead (≫ 100 MB), and the code-based one is even insecure under impersonator attacks. Besides, all the known SH constructions are powerless to handle the problem of dynamically managing users. To fill the gap, in this work we first formalize the model of fully dynamic secret handshakes ( FDSH ), where members have the freedom of joining or leaving a group. Then, to achieve anonymous mutual authentication with ease, we introduce a newly-defined cryptographic primitive called anonymous message exchange ( AME ), where legal participants can exchange their messages anonymously. Further, two generic approaches of AME from non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge ( NIZKAoK ) are provided, along with heuristic applications. Finally, by combining a well-designed AME and other suitable techniques, we present the first lattice-based FDSH in the random oracle model offering another attractive property: full deniability, which enables users to plausibly deny their participating in interactions. Our scheme sharply reduces the communication cost (&lt; 10 MB) and surpasses the existing post-quantum systems in terms of security, efficiency, and functionality.},

  abstract     = {In 2020, Costa et al. answered a long-standing open question, proposed by Bodlaender in 1991: the graph coloring game is PSPACE -complete. They also proved that the greedy coloring game, introduced by Havet and Zhu in 2013, is also PSPACE -complete. In 2019, Andres and Lock proposed five variants of the graph coloring game, which were proved PSPACE -complete by Lima et al. in 2022. In this paper, we extend these variants of the graph coloring game to the greedy coloring game and prove that all of them are PSPACE -complete, even if the number of colors is the chromatic number . Moreover, based on the connected variant of the graph coloring game proposed by Charpentier et al. in 2020, we introduce the connected greedy coloring game and prove that two natural variants of this game are PSPACE -complete. Despite this, we prove that in split graphs these two variants of the connected greedy coloring game are polynomial time solvable and we characterize the split graphs for which the associated connected game Grundy numbers are the minimum possible value (the chromatic number). Finally, we also characterize the split graphs which are bad, a notion introduced by Le and Trotignon in 2018 regarding connected greedy colorings.},

The mixed domination problem is to find a mixed dominating set with a minimum cardinality. It has applications in system control and some other scenarios and it is NP -hard to compute an optimal solution. This paper studies approximation algorithms and hardness of the weighted mixed dominating set problem. The weighted version is a generalization of the unweighted version, where all vertices are assigned the same nonnegative weight w v wv and all edges are assigned the same nonnegative weight w e we , and the question is to find a mixed dominating set with a minimum total weight. Although the mixed dominating set problem has a simple 2-approximation algorithm, few approximation results for the weighted version are known. The main contributions of this paper include:},

  abstract     = {We consider formation problems for chains of disoriented, mobile robots with limited visibility operating in asynchronous rounds ( A A sync ). More precisely, we study the Chain-Formation and the Gathering problem. Chain-Formation considers a chain of robots between two stationary outer robots: Each inner robot has two identifiable neighbors, and the goal is to arrange the robots on the line segment connecting the outer robots. The Gathering problem considers a closed chain (without outer robots) and demands all robots to gather on a single, not predefined point. The robots move in the Euclidean plane and are luminous, i.e., equipped with a light visible to the neighboring robots. At each point in time, the light can have one out of a constant number of colors. We introduce a family of algorithms inspired by the Hopper algorithm [1] . For the Chain-Formation problem, we modify the Hopper algorithm so that we can guarantee a ( 1 + ε ) (1+ε) -approximation to the optimal chain length (instead of a 2 2 -approximation). Our main result is an asymptotically optimal algorithm for Gathering of a closed chain of disoriented, luminous robots with limited visibility in the Euclidean plane . All algorithms have a worst-case optimal runtime of O ( n ) O(n) .},

  abstract     = {With the rapid popularization of mobile devices , the mobile crowdsourcing has become a hot topic in order to make full use of the resources of mobile devices . To achieve this goal, it is necessary to design an excellent incentive mechanism to encourage more mobile users to actively undertake crowdsourcing tasks, so as to achieve maximization of certain economic indicators. However, most of the reported incentive mechanisms in the existing literature adopt a centralized platform, which collects the bidding information from workers and task requesters. There is a risk of privacy exposure. In this paper, we design a decentralized auction framework where mobile workers are sellers and task requesters are buyers. This requires each participant to make its own local and independent decision, thereby avoiding centralized processing of task allocation and pricing. Both of them aim to maximize their utilities under the budget constraint. We theoretically prove that our proposed framework is individual rational, budget balanced, truthful, and computationally efficient, and then we conduct a group of numerical simulations to demonstrate its correctness and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The scapegoating attack can cause persistent and inconspicuous performance degradation in network tomography. Defense of scapegoating attack is therefore a critical problem. Theoretically, the ideal defending scheme is to add monitoring paths to make all the links in the network be identifiable. This requires very high monitoring cost, which is unaffordable. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a diagnosis-based defending scheme for scapegoating attack, which diagnoses scapegoating attack when problematic links are detected by network tomography. The latent fact is that a scapegoating attack can be launched only when the link set manipulated by the attacker cuts the probing paths going through the scapegoat links and is not traversed by any monitoring path. This cut set is called unobserved cut set (UCS). To defense, we propose to find the UCS and add the minimum number of probing paths to traverse the UCS, so that the condition of scapegoating attack is broken and the attacking links can be detected if any scapegoating attack exists. A minimum set cover model is proposed to select the least number of defense links to cover the UCS, and a polynomial time algorithm is proposed to generate the least number of probing paths to go through the selected defense links. Evaluations on various network dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed attack and defense strategies.},

Since the first anti-slide puzzle that consists of dozens of cuboid pieces in 3D was invented, tons of anti-slide puzzles using pentominoes have been proposed. Some of them are not in a frame, which we call that interlock puzzles. In this paper, we investigate computational complexity of anti-slide puzzles and interlock puzzles in 2D. In previous work in theoretical computer science , a few models have been proposed for dealing with the notion of anti-slide, however, there exist gaps between these models and real puzzles. We first give mathematical characterizations of anti-slide puzzles and show the relationship between the previous work. Using a mathematical characterization, we give a polynomial time algorithm for determining if a given arrangement of polyominoes is anti-slide or not in a model. Next, we prove that the decision problem whether a given set of polyominoes can be arranged to be anti-slide or not is strongly NP-complete even if every piece is x -monotone. On the other hand, a set of pieces cannot be arranged to be interlocked if all pieces are convex polygons .},

  abstract     = {The independent set polynomial is important in many areas of combinatorics , computer science, and statistical physics. For every integer Δ ≥ 2 Δ≥2 , the Shearer threshold is the value ⁎ λ ⁎ ( Δ ) = ( Δ − 1 ) Δ − 1 / Δ Δ λ⁎(Δ)=(Δ−1)Δ−1/ΔΔ . It is known that for ⁎ λ λ&amp;lt;−λ⁎(Δ) , there are graphs G with maximum degree Δ whose independent set polynomial, evaluated at λ , is at most 0. Also, there are no such graphs for any ⁎ λ &gt; − λ ⁎ ( Δ ) λ&amp;gt;−λ⁎(Δ) . This paper is motivated by the computational problem of approximating the independent set polynomial when ⁎ λ λ&amp;lt;−λ⁎(Δ) . The key issue in complexity bounds for this problem is “implementation”. Informally, an implementation of a real number λ ′ λ′ is a graph whose hard-core partition function , evaluated at λ , simulates a vertex-weight of λ ′ λ′ in the sense that λ ′ λ′ is the ratio between the contribution to the partition function from independent sets containing a certain vertex and the contribution from independent sets that do not contain that vertex. Implementations are the cornerstone of intractability results for the problem of approximately evaluating the independent set polynomial. Our main result is that, for any ⁎ λ λ&amp;lt;−λ⁎(Δ) , it is possible to implement a set of values that is dense over the reals. The result is tight in the sense that it is not possible to implement a set of values that is dense over the reals for any ⁎ λ &gt; λ ⁎ ( Δ ) λ&amp;gt;λ⁎(Δ) . Our result has already been used in a paper with Bezáková (STOC 2018) to show that it is #P-hard to approximate the evaluation of the independent set polynomial on graphs of degree at most Δ at any value ⁎ λ λ&amp;lt;−λ⁎(Δ) . In the appendix, we give an additional incomparable inapproximability result (strengthening the inapproximability bound to an exponential factor, but weakening the hardness to NP-hardness).},

  abstract     = {A proper k -edge-colouring ϕ of a graph G is an assignment of colours from { 1 , … , k } {1,…,k} to the edges of G such that no two adjacent edges receive the same colour. If, additionally, ϕ guarantees that no two adjacent vertices of G are incident to the same sets or sums of colours, then ϕ is called an AVD or NSD edge-colouring, respectively (the abbreviations AVD and NSD standing for “adjacent vertex distinguishing” and “neighbour sum distinguishing”). The chromatic index χ ′ ( G ) χ′(G) of G is the smallest k such that proper k -edge-colourings of G exist. Similarly, the AVD and NSD chromatic indices χ AVD ′ ( G ) χAVD′(G) and χ NSD ′ ( G ) χNSD′(G) of G are the smallest k such that AVD and NSD k -edge-colourings of G exist, respectively. These chromatic parameters are quite related, as we always have χ NSD ′ ( G ) ≥ χ AVD ′ ( G ) ≥ χ ′ ( G ) χNSD′(G)≥χAVD′(G)≥χ′(G) . By a well-known result of Vizing, we know that, for any graph G , we must have χ ′ ( G ) ∈ { Δ ( G ) , Δ ( G ) + 1 } χ′(G)∈{Δ(G),Δ(G)+1} . Still, determining χ ′ ( G ) χ′(G) is NP -hard in general. Regarding χ AVD ′ ( G ) χAVD′(G) and χ NSD ′ ( G ) χNSD′(G) , it is conjectured that, in general, they should always lie in { Δ ( G ) , Δ ( G ) + 1 , Δ ( G ) + 2 } {Δ(G),Δ(G)+1,Δ(G)+2} . In this work, we prove that determining whether a given graph G has AVD or NSD chromatic index Δ ( G ) Δ(G) is NP -hard for every Δ ( G ) ≥ 3 Δ(G)≥3 . We also prove that, for a given graph G , determining whether the AVD or NSD chromatic index is Δ ( G ) + 1 Δ(G)+1 is NP -hard for every Δ ( G ) ≥ 3 Δ(G)≥3 . Through other NP -hardness results, we also establish that there are infinitely many graphs for which the AVD and NSD chromatic indices are different. We actually come up, for every k ≥ 4 k≥4 , with infinitely many graphs with maximum degree k , AVD chromatic index k , and NSD chromatic index k + 1 k+1 , and similarly, for every k ≥ 3 k≥3 , with infinitely many graphs with maximum degree k , AVD chromatic index k + 1 k+1 , and NSD chromatic index k + 2 k+2 . In both cases, recognising graphs having those properties is actually NP -hard.},

  abstract     = {Due to their use in crypto-currencies, threshold ECDSA signatures have received much attention in recent years. Though efficient solutions now exist both for the two party, and the full threshold scenario, there is still much room for improvement, be it in terms of protocol functionality, strengthening security or further optimizing efficiency. In the past few months, a range of protocols have been published, allowing for a non interactive – and hence extremely efficient – signing protocol; providing new features, such as identifiable aborts (parties can be held accountable if they cause the protocol to fail), fairness in the honest majority setting (all parties receive output or nobody does) and other properties. In some cases, security is proven in the strong simulation based model. We combine ideas from the aforementioned articles with the suggestion of Castagnos et al. (2020) [5] to use the class group based CL CL framework so as to drastically reduce bandwidth consumption. Building upon this latter protocol we present a new, maliciously secure, full threshold ECDSA protocol that achieves additional features without sacrificing efficiency. Our most basic protocol boasts a non interactive signature algorithm and identifiable aborts. We also propose a more advanced variant that achieves adaptive security (for the n -out-of- n case) and proactive security . Our resulting constructions improve upon state of the art Paillier&#39;s based realizations achieving similar goals by up to a 10 factor in bandwidth consumption.},

  abstract     = {We consider a swarm of mobile robots evolving in a bidimensional Euclidean space . We study a variant of the crash-tolerant gathering problem: if no robot crashes, robots have to meet at the same arbitrary location, not known beforehand, in finite time; if one or several robots crash at the same location, the remaining correct robots gather at the crash location to rescue them. Motivated by impossibility results in the semi-synchronous setting, we present the first solution to the problem for the fully synchronous setting that operates in the vanilla Look-Compute-Move model with no additional hypotheses: robots are oblivious, disoriented, have no multiplicity detection capacity, and may start from arbitrary positions (including those with multiplicity points). We furthermore show that robots gather in a time that is proportional to the initial maximum distance between robots.},

Moreover, we show that learning the weight and bias vectors of D D for a training set H H is equivalent to computing an optimal solution of the corresponding non-atomic congestion game. In particular, when D D is a deep neural network for a classification task , then the learning is equivalent to computing a Wardrop equilibrium of the corresponding non-atomic congestion game.},

We show that the language of v is eventually dendric and we focus on return words to its factors. We develop a method for computing the critical exponent and asymptotic critical exponent of balanced sequences, provided the associated Sturmian sequence u has a quadratic slope. The method is based on looking for the shortest return words to bispecial factors in v . We illustrate our method on several examples; in particular we confirm a conjecture of Rampersad, Shallit and Vandomme that two specific sequences have the least critical exponent among all balanced sequences over 9-letter (resp., 10-letter) alphabets.},

  abstract     = {We introduce and study a new search-type problem on the line with 2 searchers. As in so-called evacuation search problems with multiple searchers, we require that all searchers reach a hidden item (the exit), placed in an unknown location on a line. The novelty of our problem, weighted group search on a line , pertains to the cost function of a search trajectory, which is defined as the weighted average (1 for the light searcher and w ≥ 1 w≥1 for the heavy searcher) of the times that each searcher reaches the exit and stays there indefinitely. For that problem, we design searchers&#39; trajectories (algorithms) that aim to perform well under the lens of (worst case) competitive analysis. Our work follows seminal works in the area, in which a hidden item is searched by 1 or more searchers. For 1 and 2 searchers, when they perform in the so-called face-to-face model it is well known that the optimal trajectory has competitive ratio 9, whereas in the wireless model the optimal competitive ratio is 3. Our results are multi-fold. In our first main contribution, we provide searchers&#39; trajectories which, in the wireless model, have competitive ratio at most 1 + 2 1+2 , for every w ≥ 1 w≥1 , and we prove our algorithm to be optimal. In our second main contribution, we provide searchers&#39; trajectories which, in the face-to-face model have competitive ratio at most 6.603, for every w ≥ 1 w≥1 . Somehow surprisingly the more unbalanced the weighted average is (i.e. the larger w is), the better our search algorithm performs. Both these results heavily utilize the knowledge of weight w and the searchers&#39; identities. Finally we complement our results with some easy observations which establish upper bounds for weighted group search when either the weight and/or the identities of the robots are not known. For all our search strategies we establish closed formulas for their competitive analysis, as a function of searchers&#39; weight w . As a byproduct of our results, we also establish upper bounds for a related search problem, known in the literature as priority evacuation , in which the termination cost is solely determined by a distinguished searcher. To the best of our knowledge, the problem has been previously considered only for the circle. In a nutshell, our results imply that one distinguished searcher can evacuate, with the help of some peer searcher, faster than what it takes both searchers to evacuate, both in the wireless and the face-to-face communication models.},
