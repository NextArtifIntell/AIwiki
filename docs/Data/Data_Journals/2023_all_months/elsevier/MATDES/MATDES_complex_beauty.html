  abstract     = {Natural discontinuities originating inside rocks are often distributed in folds rather than simple straights. To represent the details of fold-shaped flaws, rock-like specimens containing a fold flaw are created by 3D sand printing, and cases involving four undulation angles ( α ) are considered. Uniaxial compression tests, digital image correlation (DIC), and the extended finite element method (XFEM) on rock-like models are conducted to investigate the influence of undulation angles on the cracking mechanism of the specimens. The 3D sand-printed specimen has obvious advantages in simulating natural rocks. Two types of crack initiation modes are observed: tip cracking and nontip cracking. DIC-based measurements and XFEM simulations show that the maximum value of maximum principal stress and strain occur near when α = 0° and 10°, while they appear in the flaw inflexion when α = 20° and 30°, which explains the difference in crack initiation. Two types of cracks are identified based on the displacement vector analysis: tensile and horsetail cracks. The crack initiation position of these two cracks is precisely determined by extracting strain data around the flaw tip. The undulation angle cannot alter the final coalescence, which is induced by the connection of horsetail cracks with the flaw.},

The creep tests were carried out based on the cement mortar specimen containing adjacent cracks, and the low-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technology were used to evaluate the evolution of crack structure in the specimen. Based on the numerical simulation, the influences of the interaction behaviour between cracks on the time-dependent propagation of cracks and failure of specimens is revealed. The results show that: The specimen presents a tension-shear failure mode, and the macro fracture on its surface is Z-shaped; Crack interaction has an important role in promoting the formation and connection of microcracks , which increases the number of seepage channels and promotes the formation of the macro fracture; The propagation of adjacent cracks show significant asymmetry and non-uniformity, due to the stress superposition effects in the rock bridge area; The interaction between cracks is manifested as the inhibition of wing crack propagation in the rock bridge area at the initiation stage and then promotion effect at the later stage.},

The integrity of the single crystal (SC), interfacial structure, phase formation, and high-temperature mechanical property were studied. The results demonstrated successful formation of a complete CMSX-6 SC structure with a crystallographic orientation deviation of 13.2° from the (0 0 1) direction, joined with C f /SiC. A gradient reaction interlayer composed of γ/γ΄ matrix, AlN, Cr 3 C 2 , and TiMoC 2 phases was formed. The maximum tear strength of the joining interface reached 32.9 MPa at 750 °C, approximately 2.5 times larger than the interlaminar bonding strength of C f /SiC. This satisfactory mechanical property was attributed to the pinning effect resulting from the infiltration of molten CMSX-6 into C f /SiC and reduced thermal stresses facilitated by the formed gradient bonding interface.},

  abstract     = {The role of the protective gases in laser-based powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is mainly to avoid the oxidation of metals during the melting and solidification process. However, the gaseous environment can also interact with metals, and result in changes in microstructure and properties. In a NiTi alloy, we found the L-PBF processes in the N 2 gaseous environment can induce TiN particles and facilitate the formation of a precipitate-dislocation network and therefore improve mechanical properties. Nitrogen segregation also led to grain refinement and the generation of high-angle grain boundaries. The as-printed NiTi in N 2 loses its shape memory effect, however, an aging process at 500 °C resulted in unchanged grain size, parallel arrays of Ni 4 Ti 3 precipitates around TiN, and a recovery of shape memory effect. The optimization of microstructure finally resulted in a high hardness of ∼4.0 GPa and a low reduced elastic modulus of ∼57.5 GPa. The manufacturing process presented in this study opens a new way for making biomedical devices with low elastic constant, high strength to weight, and high resistance to wear.},

Experimental results demonstrated that the modification of Al significantly inhibited the formation rate of the sigma phase, retarded the induction period of the chi phase, and promoted the growth process of the Laves phase. Meanwhile, the calculated grain growth kinetics of the surface layer and core layer were compared with the measured values. It was found that the Al modification enhanced the effect of Laves phase precipitation pinning and solid solution drag, which slowed the grain coarsening rate. With the modification of Al, the values of ultimate tensile strength, yield strength (0.2\% proof stress) and total elongation increased compared to those of the Al-free alloys. The plasticity of the Al-modified alloys was improved with the retardation of sigma and chi phases at the grain boundary.

  abstract     = {Machine learning emerges to accelerate first-principles calculations in materials discovery and property prediction, but developing high-accuracy prediction models requires training on large datasets of relaxed structures, which can be computationally expensive. Besides, the crystal structure prediction algorithms show promising aspects but often deviate from the ground state, leading to poor predictions. Using a crystal graph convolutional neural network, we propose an alternative and efficient method of finding the ground state by utilizing the total energy of random unrelaxed structures. The prediction model is trained on a small dataset of unrelaxed energy obtained from first-principles calculations and effectively predicts the total energy of random structures with an accuracy almost equivalent to first-principles calculations. The resulting energy landscape is then reconstructed in terms of polarity. This leads to establishing an energy landscape of a perovskite oxide in a cost-effective way, enabling a polar phase stability map of strained BaTiO 3 , a representative ferroelectric oxide. The proposed methodology efficiently allows to obtain the ground state by eliminating the computationally intensive procedure of structure optimization, thus accelerating the ground state search to map out the phase stability of strained perovskite materials in a practical manner.},

First, the ceramic injection molding (CIM) feedstock with thermoplastic properties was prepared and optimised in terms of its rheological properties to ensure good workability for the printing process at 140–150 °C. Subsequently, the thermoplastic feedstock was used to print porous ceria structures for thermochemical splitting. The feasibility of printing various porous structures with different dimensions, geometries, and macropore sizes was investigated, and the printing parameters: extrusion multiplier (EM), extrusion temperature (ET), nozzle velocity (NV), and layer thickness (LT), were optimised to prevent clogging of the printing nozzle and to achieve homogeneous overlap of the printed layers. The optimised printing parameters for ceria structures are EM 1.3, ET 150 °C, LT ∼ 0.13 mm, and NV 50 mm/s, which were determined by multiple response optimisation process. The sintered 3D-printed bars yielded relative densities of ≥ 98\% and a total microporosity of 0.29\%, measured with a Hg porosimeter.

Glass cylinders were used in uniaxial compression stress relaxation experiments, which were conducted on a molding machine, and the experimental results were fitted with the generalized Maxwell constitutive model. The constitutive model was corrected further by optimization of the long-term modulus based on the SRCC method, and friction coefficients were calibrated under different molding conditions to improve the simulation accuracy. To verify the accuracy of the corrected constitutive model, we constructed a two-dimensional axisymmetric numerical model of molding biconvex aspheric lens and extracted and compared the molding displacement curves with experimental data. The results indicate that more accurate guidance for the optimization of the glass molding process can be provided based on the corrected model.},

The CCMH scaffold was created through unidirectional freeze-casting and in situ peristaltic mineralization, resulting in uniformly distributed nano-hydroxyapatite on the porous collagen composite matrix (CCM) scaffold. The CCMH scaffold finely mimics the composition and anisotropic channel-like morphology of native bone, which exhibits high biocompatibility, excellent cellular activity and extraordinary osteogenic differentiation capability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histological analysis of rat models demonstrated that the CCMH scaffold significantly enhanced new bone formation and accelerated bone regeneration. The innovative unidirectional freezing-in situ peristaltic mineralization approach offers a robust technique for building biomimetic three-dimensional porous scaffolds with excellent biocompatibility and osteoinductivity, which show significant promise for use in bone repair and regeneration.},

The discrete element model of ceramic powder is introduced to simulate blade-spreading and roller-spreading processes. Based on the packing theory, the effect of particle gradations on the powder bed quality and particle microscopic behavior is analyzed. The results show that fine particle gradations weaken the wall effect. The powder shear dilation in blade-spreading strengthens the loosening effect, however, the compaction effect of roller-spreading weakens the loosening effect. As coarse particle gradations increase, contact force chains become loose, however, strong force arches lead to particle jamming, uneven distribution, and voids in the powder bed. Particle segregation occurs because fine particle gradations pass through the gap between the substrate and spreader, and are deposited at the front part of the powder bed, while coarse particle gradations due to jamming are deposited at the end part of the powder bed. When the particle gradation coefficient is in the range of 0.1 to 0.5, the powder bed quality and particle segregation phenomenon are significantly improved compared to Gaussian distribution. The results can provide valuable references for the selection of particle gradations in AM.},

We showed that the eutectic high entropy alloy (EHEA) and spinodal decomposition (SD) may be correlated with each other. A shift from as-cast EHEA to SD can be triggered by the strong short-range ordering in the EHEA liquid phase and high configuration entropy of the metastable phase. CALPHAD showed that the low eutectic temperature of Al 30 Co 10 Cr 30 Fe 15 Ni 15 alloy is stabilized by the short-range and topological ordering (SRO), rendering a small undercooling ΔT for partitionless solidification of the metastable B2 phase. AIMD calculations showed that the particular metastable-like liquid preordering might reduce interface energy between the eutectic liquid and saturated B2, facilitating metastable saturated phase formation even with a small undercooling and suppressing the eutectic reaction. The single B2 phase might have solidified in the spinodal region of the phase diagram resulting in a shift from as-cast EHEA to SD. The interplay between SD and EHEAs presents an alternative route to explore spinodal HEAs by simple as-casted samples without lengthy heat treatments for homogenization.},

  abstract     = {HSLA steels with different polygonal ferrite and granular bainite contents resulting from two different cooling rates were investigated. Micropillar compression tests, electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) experiments were performed to reveal microscopic strength differences and their origin. The obtained results indicate that a higher cooling rate caused a smaller granular bainite substructure size and a higher dislocation density for both ferrite and bainite. In addition, the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) values for both phases were found to be higher for the faster cooling process. This is ascribed to the increased dislocation density for faster cooling rather than the grain size as will be discussed in the manuscript. Interestingly, the macroscopic yield strength can be closely estimated by the CRSS obtained from micropillar compression considering the corresponding phase fractions. The achieved results can be used in future as input variables for crystal plasticity models.},

  abstract     = {Nafion membrane possesses good ionic conductivity and excellent mechanical stability, which can be used as electrolyte and separator of flexible supercapacitor. However, due to its solid-state structure, it is difficult for the Nafion membrane to permeate in solid-state electrode, which reduces electrochemical surface area, and increases interface resistance. The electrode materials need to be carefully designed to solve the above issues. In this study, Nafion doped polyaniline/graphene oxide composites were designed and synthesized as electrode materials to fabricate flexible supercapacitors based on Nafion membrane. The polyaniline utilization rate and the electrochemical surface area are improved by Nafion doping. In addition, the electrostatic interaction between polyaniline and Nafion can reduce the interface resistance. Graphene oxide can enhance the polyaniline electrochemical stability. The specific capacitances of flexible supercapacitor are 309 and 300F g −1 under flat and bent conditions (at 1 A/g), respectively, which are the maximum values among reported Nafion membrane-based supercapacitors. After 1000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate of supercapacitor with Nafion membrane is 87.2\%, which is higher than that with H 2 SO 4 electrolyte (83.0\%). Therefore, the Nafion membrane-based flexible supercapacitor has widespread applications in electronic products because of its high performance and good cycling stability.},

Compared to the adhesive-substrate interactions of benzyl and phenol-functionalized PSAs in water, Gallol PSA exhibited greater interactions with the substrate. Furthermore, the micropattern on the PSA surface provided a drainage channel for water during the bonding process so that water is not trapped at the substrate-adhesive interface. Moreover, the drainage channel allows the formation of small and uniform adhesion defects, which minimize the deterioration in adhesion caused by water. And the adhesive manufacturing process is also simple, without any gallol protection and deprotection steps, and can be achieved using the current adhesive industry infrastructure. This facile fabrication strategy and its adhesive properties could promote the commercialization of gallol-functionalized PSAs with underwater adhesion.},

SRO is an ordered fcc structure with nanometer size, which can be well explained by the ordered arrangement of Cr/Mo atomic layers segregated on the {422} crystal plane in austenite. Many planar slip bands are observed in the fatigue sample, the distribution of SROs is highly related with the distribution of dislocations. In situ high-energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD) experiments are performed to investigate the deformation behavior of both as-received and fatigued samples under uniaxial loading. The lattice strain evolution reveals an interesting lattice expansion in the initial elastic stage, which provides direct evidence of a decrease in SRO during further uniaxial tensile deformation, indicating that the deformation modes greatly affect the SRO transition. We believe that the high-temperature fatigue damage originates mainly from the accumulation of planar slip bands, accompanied by a local increase in SRO, which promotes work hardening near the final fatigue fracture.},

  abstract     = {An improved micromechanical model to estimate the thermal conductivity of multi-scale fiber reinforced ultra-high performance concrete (MSFUHPC) subjected to elevated temperatures is formulated in this study. This model considers the contributions of microstructure, multiscale fibers, water/cement ratio, thermal dehydration of hydrates, thermal cracking, interfacial thermal resistance, heating rate and temperature dependent thermal conductivity of each phase. To verify the proposed model, comparisons with experimental data on MSFUHPC specimens are carried out. Accordingly, factors affecting the thermal conductivity of MSFUHPC are discussed through the proposed model. Results suggest that blending multi-scale fibers and increasing the sand content can significantly enhance the thermal conductivity of MSFUHPC. While adding cenosphere particles can reduce the thermal conductivity. Overall, the thermal conductivity of MSFUHPC exhibits a decreasing trend with temperature. Meanwhile, thermal cracking occurs beyond 400 °C can remarkably decrease the thermal conductivity of MSFUHPC. A higher interfacial thermal resistance between sands and the matrix can result in a lower thermal conductivity. It is also found that thermal conductivity mainly depends on the maximum temperature experienced rather than the heating rate.},

Electrical conductivity has been found to decrease in majority of the 3D printed electronic wires. Herein we report a fundamental understanding in drop of electrical conductivity in processed silver (Ag) line wire, generally found in Ag-nanoparticle Ink, using large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of sintering of five different sizes of Ag NPs. To preserve the high conductivity of pure silver wires, the integrity of the pristine face-centered cubic (FCC) crystalline structure must be retained in the processed line wires. Simulations show that the pristine Ag FCC structures of the nanoparticles are not recovered after melting and resolidification, instead, the resolidified material is paracrystaline. The breakdown of pristine FCC structures might be the cause of the drop in conductivity of processed Ag wires. Simulation results suggest that the intermediate size nanoparticles retain highest percentage of the pristine silver face-centered cubic (FCC) structure after pulse treatments. Our results show that the most promising Ag-Ink should contain smaller to medium size silver NPs that can retain FCC structure after 3D printing of the Ag-Ink.},

The results show that, with increasing the content of N up to 0.15 wt\% in the experimental steel, the quantity and the size of eutectic carbides decrease； and the net-work eutectic carbides are gradually eliminated. The microstructure of all the steels is composed of lath martensite, twin martensite and M 23 C 6 carbides. With partial substitution of C by N, the morphology of martensite blocks evolves from a lath shape to a blocky one, the quantity of twin martensite increases, and the nano-scaled Cr 2 N nitrides precipitate in the martensite matrix. The steel containing 0.15 wt\% N exhibits the hardness of 60.5 HRC, a fracture strength of 1900 MPa and an elongation rate of 1.6\% due to hot rolling and heat treatment, which is attributed to the refinement of carbides and grains, solid solution of C and N, as well as the dense dislocation.},

As a typical difficult-to-machine material induced mainly by high toughness, NiTi alloy faces challenges such as high cutting force and difficult chip breaking during the cutting process. To solve these problems, this paper presents a novel surface dealloying assisted machining method, i.e., the preparation of nanoporous structures on the workpiece surface with dealloying treatment, to improve the machinability of NiTi alloy. Based on high speed in-situ imaging of material removal process, the presence of dealloyed layer leads to a segmented flow mode instead of homogeneous severe plastic deformation without dealloying treatment. The change in material removal mode is beneficial to decrease the cutting force and energy and improve the machined surface quality. The embrittlement effect of dealloyed layer inhibits material plastic flow and promotes periodic crack nucleation and propagation. An analytical model is developed to characterize the brittle crack propagation, which provides theoretical basis for explaining embrittlement effect of dealloyed layer. This work verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method to modify the machinability of NiTi alloy and provides new ideas for the development of manufacturing processes.},

The effects of the SiC particle size distribution and pre-oxidation on the microstructure and properties of SiC/Al composites were investigated. A new phenomenon of severe lamellar cracking was observed in SiC/Al composites without pre-oxidation treatment, which can be explained in terms of the mechanism of interlayer bonding. The results showed that the residual porosity of the sample without pre-oxidation treatment s was higher than 3\%, with a maximum of (8.16±0.57)\%, which was much higher than that of the pre-oxidised samples(1\% – 2\%). The bulk density of the powders was significantly improved by designing the material system with mono-, bi-, and tri-modal particle size distributions and the density of final SiC/Al samples gradually increases from 2.804±0.009 to 2.871±0.008 g/cm 3 , and the volume fraction of SiC increases from 36.7 vol\% to 50.1 vol\%. As a result, the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of SiC/Al composites varies consistently with the volume fraction of SiC, decreasing from 13.72 to 10.84×10 −6 °C −1 .

Different combinations of material parameters are constructed through Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) process to create a database of indentation parameters. An attempt is made to reversely obtain load-depth ( P - h ) data using a regression function for a given set of material parameters; this method is further verified by performing finite element (FE) simulations. SciDL models i.e ., physics-informed artificial neural network (PI-ANN) with autoencoder (AE) are built based on PyTorch library, and the models are trained using the generated database. Transfer learning (TL) techniques are employed to achieve better training performance with the PI-ANN model. Compared with data-driven models, SciDL models produce consistent predictions with higher accuracy; the coefficient of determination R 2 values are observed greater than 0.960. TL techniques allows the SciDL model to learn much faster (≈ 42 epochs ) than traditional method (≈ 2400 epochs ). Finally, we perform spherical indentation experiments on STS304 and SM45C, and validate the performance of the trained SciDL models; AE integrated PI-ANN model with tanh activation function predicts the material properties close to reference values of SS400 and SM45C.

The mechanical properties of this HEA were strongly deformation dependent, i.e., when deformation increased from 30\% up to 60\%, the yield strength and ultimate strength tensile increased from ∼0.9 GPa and 1.0 GPa to ∼1.2 GPa and 1.3 GPa, respectively. During tensile deformation, initial fractures occurred in the FCC phase located close to the interface between the FCC and BCC phases. With an increase of deformation, the fracture degree in the FCC phase got larger, and fractures also appeared in the BCC phase. Combined with the geometric dislocation density calculation results from an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis, it can be seen that the dislocation density near the phase interface of FCC was higher, making it more likely to produce defects.},

In this work we integrate state of the art machine learning methods using ensembles of neural networks with unprecedented data collection and integration to develop a new model for RPV steel embrittlement. The new model has multiple improvements over previous machine learning and hand-tuned efforts, including greater accuracy (e.g., at high-fluence relevant for extending the life of present reactors), wider domain of applicability (e.g., including a wide-range of compositions), uncertainty quantification, and online accessibility for easy use by the community. These improvements provide a model with significant new capabilities, including the ability to easily and accurately explore compositions, flux, and fluence effects on RPV steel embrittlement for the first time. Furthermore, our detailed comparisons show our approach improves on the leading American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E900-15 standard model for RPV embrittlement on every metric we assessed, demonstrating the efficacy of machine learning approaches for this type of highly demanding materials property prediction.},

  abstract     = {MoS 2 is 2D material applicable for electronics, photo-detectors, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. Since these applications operate at elevated temperatures, determining and controlling the environmental stability of MoS 2 is essential. This study uses Raman spectroscopic experiments at elevated temperatures to observe reversible and irreversible changes in 2D MoS 2 films with varying thickness, morphology, and substrate to explore the limits of its thermal stability. Molecular dynamics simulations and in-situ X-ray diffraction confirm that thermal expansion causes the Raman reversible spectral shifts. Further analysis reveals irreversible spectral shifts associated with oxidation and strain effects caused by oxidation with two distinct modes. The former is due to the general homogenous thinning of layers from the top layer down through randomly spaced sulfur vacancies. The latter is due to inhomogeneous oxidation, which known to occur as localized pitting at grain boundaries, void formation from nucleation centers, or stress corrosion cracking starting from edges under strain. Segregation of doping and strain contributions confirms higher strain in the edges. Annealing increases the spread of the strain distribution. These results highlight the critical role of strain, resulting from thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between substrates and 2D MoS 2 films, on their environmental stability.},

This study bridges this research gap by accurately predicting the crack initiation process in LPBF body centred cubic (BCC) microlattices and their failure mode. In this study, LPBF AlSi10Mg BCC microlattice structures were tested in uniaxial compression and their detailed response modelled using a finite element (FE) modelling methodology on microlattices with idealised struts which was validated experimentally. Crack initiation in BCC microlattices with 2 × 1 × 2 unit cells loaded in compression was observed in situ via a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The force–displacement response of the microlattice was studied with respect to crack initiation and propagation. It was found that the locations of crack initiation could be predicted by considering the equivalent plastic strain and stress triaxiality fields obtained by an FE analysis and assuming a monotonically decreasing fracture locus. Subsequently, microlattices with 4 × 4 × 4.5 unit cells were similarly subjected to compression. Using a monotonically decreasing fracture locus extrapolated from uniaxial tension testing of the bulk LPBF AlSi10Mg, an FE simulation successfully predicted the commonly reported diagonal shear band failure mode of the microlattice on a model with idealised struts.},

The α′ martensite in the as-built alloy transforms to stable α phase when annealing below the β transus, and meanwhile the dislocation density decreases and the α lamellae coarsen with increasing of annealing temperature. An excellent synergy of strength and ductility was achieved in the sample after designated heat treatments, which is better than that of the forged counterpart at both room temperature and 500 °C. In-situ tensile test at 500 °C demonstrated that the plasticity of as-built TA15 alloy was dominated by the formation of microscale shear bands (MSBs) between the α′ lamellae, which results in pronounced strain localization and limited tensile ductility. In the sample with coarsened α lamellae, it was found that the activation of pyramidal  slip system at 500 °C effectively alleviated the strain localization and cracking tendency during mechanical loading, which is essential to achieve a desired balance of strength and ductility. These findings are helpful to promote the practical applications of LPBF near-α titanium alloys.},

The results show that the destabilization of the nanostructured Ag/Cu multilayer originates from the interfacial instability perturbation driven by compositional gradient and capillary force. The subsequent destabilizing process is closely related to the cross-sectional ratio of the lamellar structure. When the thickness difference between adjacent lamellae is large, the lamellae with smaller thickness will follow a destabilizing sequence of perturbation → necking → pinching → termination migration. While the thickness of adjacent lamellae is similar, the perturbed lamellae tend to form stable grooves during roughening.},

From a microstructural perspective, the inclusion of atoms with larger ionic radius differences (reaching a 4.11\% contrast with Yb 2 Si 2 O 7 ) can cause sever lattice shrinkage (9.49\% compared to single-component disilicates), which leads to lower thermal conductivity and a change in the thermal expansion coefficient. At 1200 °C, the thermal expansion coefficient of the five high-entropy disilicates ranged from 4.57 × 10 -6 K −1 to 4.84 × 10 -6 K −1 , and the minimum thermal conductivity was only 1.14 W/m·K. Additionally, the local charge disorder facilitates the transfer of electrons around Si-O to Sc, which reduces the covalent bond strength of Si-O and regulates the thermal expansion coefficient. This phenomenon has been proved in the five non-equimolar high-entropy disilicates with different contents of Sc, effectively regulating the thermal expansion coefficient in 4.08 × 10 -6 K −1 to 5.04 × 10 -6 K −1 .

  abstract     = {This work aims to investigate the effect of the material microstructure on the effectiveness of hybridization in additively manufactured Inconel718 strut-based lattices. Two microstructures, namely the as-built solid solution and a peak aged condition, are coupled with three hybrid architectures formed by alternating face centred cubic (matrix) and octet-truss (reinforcement) domains containing 1, 8, and 64 unit cells. Digital image correlation is utilized to map the local strain distribution during compression, and finite element analysis is utilized to map stress localization. It is shown that in the as-built condition the mechanical behavior of all the hybrid lattices was very similar to that of the single-oriented components, irrespective of the reinforcement size. In the peak-aged lattices, on the contrary, including octet-truss reinforcements of sufficiently small size resulted in an increase in mechanical stability, damage tolerance, and absorbed energy, as interphase boundaries act as obstacles to shear band propagation. It is also shown that effect of hybridization is a function of the size of the reinforcements. In particular, below a critical size, the lattice behaves as a reinforced “single-phase” structure, rather than a two-phase architecture. This work defines guidelines for the design of robust lattices manufactured by laser powder bed fusion.},

The well accepted C14 phase field has been eliminated from the Nb-Cr phase diagram in a recent study that claimed that the NbCr 2 alloy shows the C15 structure up to melting. The present study was conducted to address these ambiguities. The experimental investigations show the presence of C14, C15, and C36 structures in the as-cast alloy. Differential scanning calorimetry studies of the as-cast alloy show the transformation of the eutectic mixture of bcc + NbCr 2 to single-phase NbCr 2 at 1338 K. An in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) study of as-cast alloy shows a phase transformation of C36 → C14 below 1273 K. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm two phase transformations: (a) a metastable transformation of C36 → C14 at 783 K and (b) an equilibrium transformation of C15 → C14 at 1971 K, which was validated by high temperature DTA and TEM studies. Further, extended DFT calculations on supercells with four compositions of NbCr 1.9 , NbCr 2 , NbCr 2.1, and NbCr 2.2 also corroborated the presence of the C14 phase, and consequently, the Nb-Cr phase diagram is modified. This finding resolves the controversy regarding the existence of an equilibrium C14 phase field before melting.},

  abstract     = {Nanocrystalline (NC) materials are prone to grain-coarsening at low temperatures—requiring extra solute-element addition for stability. While this approach is established mainly in simple-binary-alloys, it is adjudged “complex” for multicomponent-alloys due to complex-interactions among constituent-elements. We report for the first time that nanograins in multicomponent-high entropy alloy (HEA) stabilize themselves without requiring additional solute if constituent-HEA-elements with highest mixing enthalpy and melting point preferentially segregate to grain boundaries (GBs); a process we term self-stabilization effect in HEAs. Using in-situ X-ray diffraction, scanning/transmission electron microscopy, and atom-probe-tomography (APT), we show that Cr and Fe in NC-AlCoCrFe-HEA (9 nm grain-size) segregate at GBs by site-competition to stabilize it at 0.5 T m ( T m –melting temperature). At 0.6 T m , GB-desegregation is established to be precursor to phase decomposition, and it competes with nanograin stability; this culminates in the onset of grain coarsening at this temperature. Compared with the literature (e.g., NC-AlCoCrFeNi), NC-AlCoCrFe HEA shows exceptional nanograin-stability at high homologous-temperatures; this suggests possible breakdown of the cocktail and sluggish-effects in HEAs, since more elements do not necessarily improve nanograin stability. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the finest stable-NC-HEA produced—it paves a new way of engineering NC-HEAs without coarsening in scalable solid-state processes that require substantially-high temperatures.},

Among the sustainable processes developed to date, 3D printing enables limited generation of waste. Living materials that are grown by microorganisms are also an interesting approach to fabricate biodegradable materials sustainably. 3D printing of living materials is nevertheless challenged by a high barrier to entry due to stringent sterilization requirements. In this study, the authors use a waste ingredient, coffee grounds, to fabricate mycelium materials using 3D printing in ambient conditions. Mycelium is the vegetative parts of the fungi which forms an interconnected network, covering air-material interfaces with a dense skin. An agar gel was chosen as the printing medium and supplemented with coffee grounds, malt and peptone to double the growth rate and density of the mycelium by Pleurotus ostreatus . Despite the jelly nature of the agar-based ink, 3D printing with a resolution of about 1 mm could be achieved using direct ink writing. The growth of the mycelium embedded in the ink was studied over 28 days and demonstrated that the mycelium was efficient in reinforcing the printed part, doubling its compressive modulus up to 60 kPa. Furthermore, the objects created by this ink exhibit self-healing and can be used for gluing components together. The approach taken in this work could be adapted by the user to accommodate for functionality requirements and the available local resources, thereby addressing some of the most pressing sustainable development goals.},

The time-dependent deformation strongly affects their long-term in-service performance. This study investigates the tensile creep behavior and its underlying deformation mechanisms of Cu 50 Zr 50 BNPMGs through molecular dynamics simulations. The creep-recovery fatigue behavior is revealed. Our results manifest that both the transient and steady creep strengths increase with the solid fraction. The transient strength is larger for smaller ligament sizes, but the steady creep strength has very mild sensitivity to the ligament size. The generalized Kelvin model, consisting of two Kelvin units and one Maxwell unit connected in series, can accurately predict the creep and recovery curves. The rotation of individual ligaments, rather than atomic diffusion, is the dominant creep mechanism. During creep, the shear transformation zones are mainly developed on the ligament surface, and the strain in the ligament core is relatively smaller. The creep stress exponent has no definite relation with the creep mechanism and decreases with the increasing solid fraction. With the increase in the creep-recovery cycle number, the creep rate decreases, and the recovery procedure makes a milder impact on the creep response.},

The results show that the STFs produced with a ball milling time of 4 h or 6 h are not uniform, with some semi-solid lump remained.

  abstract     = {Elucidating the specific interaction between graphene with various structures and asphalt is essential to promote the wide adoption of graphene modified asphalt for high-performance pavement engineering. Herein, the enhancement of modified asphalts with nano-sized graphene (NG) and micro-sized graphene (MG) were systematically investigated by using dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at multi-scale levels. The results demonstrate that MG can significantly enhance the deformation resistance and low-temperature crack resistance of modified asphalt, compare with NG, and AFM confirm that MG can obviously affect the rearrangement of four components in asphalt to form a micellar structure with higher modulus and lower energy dissipation. MD simulation further verifies that the higher mechanical strength of large-sized graphene modified asphalt is attributed to the reduced slide movement of cavitation structures in asphalt, since the larger graphene not only has stronger π-π interaction with asphaltene and resin, but also induces one more specific interaction of hydrogen bonds (O-H···S) between these polar components. The coupling interaction facilitates the formation of more compact micelles, resulting in the improved mechanical properties of asphalt. The elucidation of graphene size effect on asphalt provides encouragement for understanding the enhancement of graphene modified asphalt.},

  abstract     = {A novel test specimen was designed for experimental investigations of pure and mixed mode fracture. This novel test configuration is called “modified edge notched disc bend” (M-ENDB) specimen. The M-ENDB specimen has a circular disc shape with an edge crack along its diameter that is loaded using asymmetric three-point bending. Different fracture parameters including: stress intensity factors (SIFs), geometry factors, T -stress, biaxiality ratio ( BR ), and out-of-plane constraint factor ( T z ) were determined for the suggested disc bend specimen using the extensive finite element (FE) analyses. According to the obtained results, the proposed specimen can present all combinations of mode mixities, including pure modes I, II, and III as well as mixed-mode I/II, I/III, and I/II/III deformations. Afterwards, a large number of pure and mixed-mode fracture toughness experiments were carried out on polyurethane (PUR) foam to examine the capabilities of the suggested M-ENDB specimen. Fracture path, fracture surface, fracture toughness, work of fracture, and critical T -stress of broken foams under general mixed mode conditions were investigated. Mixed mode I/II/III fracture toughness value was smaller than the pure mode I fracture toughness ( K Ic ) value showing the weakness of brittle materials against multi-axial fracture compared to pure tensile type fracture.},

The accurate determination of both parameters is crucial for the safety design and stability evaluation of real engineering structures. A model and method are developed in this paper for simultaneously determining the K IC and f t for quasi-brittle materials without size effects. And using the geometric structural parameter a e as a key design parameter. This method can get K IC and f t to be obtained by fitting curves to any two sets of quantitative specimens with different geometric structures with a e ratio equal to 3. Additionally, fracture full curves and peak load prediction lines with 95\% reliability are established for different fracture modes using quantitative design specimens with an a e ratio of 3. These curves and lines can accurately predict fracture behavior and peak loads of large specimens or engineering structures. The proposed design method is verified by combining experimental studies conducted by other scholars on quasi-brittle materials and the simulation results of ABAQUS software. This paper achieves the objective of accurately predicting the fracture properties of quasi-brittle material structures in the field, using quantitative laboratory specimens of various geometries.},

  abstract     = {Tandem Solar cells are composed of multiple layers with varying bandgap materials to facilitate the absorption of a wider range of solar energy. However, their performance is hampered by interface losses leading to current mismatching. To overcome these limitations, tandem solar cells often require the use of mirrors and lenses to concentrate and trap light to achieve optimal efficiency. Recently, the use of nanoscale 2D meta-materials has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional lenses. However, the optical optimization of these meta-materials can be both time-consuming, resources, and space-intensive, posing a challenge to their implementation. This study explores the use of deep learning to predict the optimal optical design for the top cell in tandem solar cells to maximize power conversion efficiency . Computational techniques are used to analyze the optical responses of metasurfaces . 2D-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used to train a dataset of 10,578 T i O 2 / C H 3 N H 3 P B r 3 / Z n O TiO2/CH3NH3PBr3/ZnO metasurfaces. Nine different CNN models were used with different architectures to identify the best hyperparameters that give the low mean square error . CNN displayed fast high prediction accuracy taking an average of 0.3 ± 0.05 seconds per prediction. The Deep SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm was used to gain insights into CNN&#39;s predictions and understand the behavior of complex metasurfaces integrated into a typical reference tandem solar cell architecture. The proposed metasurfaces can significantly enhance the efficiency of tandem solar cells. The active layer comprises of near 90\% absorption of the solar spectrum. The average absorption of the top cell increased in the UV-vis region (650-800nm) up to 93.4\%.},

Hence, this study examines the macro-scale features of lightweight membranes from cellulose nanofibril-alginate hydrogel, relevant for the design of various interior architectural products, such as wall claddings, ceiling tiles, room partitions, tapestries, and window screens. Through iterative prototyping experiments involving robotic 3D printing of lightweight membranes, their upscaling potential is demonstrated. Correlations between toolpath designs and shrinkages are also characterized, alongside an in-depth analysis of coloration changes upon ambient drying. Further, the tunability potential of various architectural features, enabled by bespoke 3D printing toolpath design, is discussed and exemplified. The aim is to expose the wide palette of design possibilities for cellulose nanofibril-alginate membranes, encompassing variations in curvature, porosity, translucency, texture, patterning, pliability, and feature sizes. The results comprise an important knowledge foundation for the design and manufacturing of custom lightweight architectural products from cellulose nanofibril-alginate hydrogel.

While nanoindentation already allows the determination of the strain rate sensitivity of materials by means of strain rate jump tests, these are typically limited to few discrete strain rates. With the new method, the strain rate sensitivity can be measured continuously as a function of the strain rate. Applications to fused silica, Zn-22\%Al superplastic alloy, single crystalline aluminum, various nanocrystalline metals and a palladium-based metallic glass are shown. Besides some discrepancy with the reference measurements, the new method seems only affected by the presence of a strong nanoindentation size effect. Provided this indentation size effect is not excessively large and can be corrected for accurately, the method proves robust, with no suggestion that the direction of the strain rate sweep affects the evaluation of the strain rate sensitivity.},

To design the new potential dressings, we evaluated the compatibility of biopolymers through rheological and spectroscopic analyses for hydrogels, respectively spectral, morphological, goniometric, enzymatic, and thermal stability. Rheological measurements indicated that all hydrogels were pseudoplastic, a required property for their manipulation and application. Spectroscopic and spectral analyses showed the conservation of the specific triple helix structure of collagen for samples with 30\% cellulose ethers. The morphological evaluation demonstrated that matrices presented hydrophilic and porous structures with proper swelling ability. The thermal and biodegradation study illustrated the increase of matrices’ stability with the addition of cellulose ethers gels. Biocompatibility tests showed that none of the tested matrices had any cytotoxic effect and some compositions of collagen and methylcellulose or hydroxyethylcellulose release factors that might promote fibroblasts’ proliferation and had no inhibitor effect on fibroblasts migration ability; all these results guarantee the development of a promising wound dressing based on 70\% collagen gel and 30\% cellulose ethers gels.},

Although certain structural motifs may even enable a negative Poisson&#39;s ratio, it is conventionally assumed to remain constant or near-constant during deformation. In this study, we introduce a novel design concept that enables metamaterials to switch the sign of Poisson&#39;s ratio during loading, specifically at predetermined compressive strain levels, by harnessing self-contact between individual elements of the metamaterial. Through the integration of finite element simulations and experimental testing, we establish a direct correlation between the geometrical parameters of the unit cell and the mechanical response of the metamaterial.

This study proposes an innovative solution to enhance the relative permittivity of the nanofibrous layer by redesigning it as a composite layer. By integrating electrospun aligned nanofibers of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene) into a polydimethylsiloxane elastomeric matrix , the composite active layer achieves a notable increase in relative permittivity (10.5 at 100 Hz), surpassing the individual materials&#39; values (2.5 and 2.7 at 100 Hz for the nanofibers and polydimethylsiloxane, respectively). To realize novel soft actuators, the composite active layer is placed between carbon black electrodes, with Kapton® serving as the passive layer. Remarkably, aligning the nanofibers in the transversal direction of the actuator enhances its actuation capabilities significantly. When subjected to a 25 MVm −1 electric field, the tip deflection and blocking force exhibit a ∼400\% improvement compared to polydimethylsiloxane-based actuators. To support these findings, a physics-based dynamic model is derived and validated through experimental tests in both static and transient time simulations.},

In this study, we have experimentally observed a significant linear correlation (R 2 = 0.99) between the concentration of high-valence metal ions (using iron ions as an example) and the fluorescence intensity of graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Utilizing the distinct fluorescence responses of GQDs to high-valence and low-valence metal ions, reliable quantitative detection of mixed-valence metal ions has been successfully achieved. Remarkably, we introduced real-time monitoring of mixed-valence metal ions, revealing a shift from a molar ratio of approximately 4.0 to 2.0. Density functional theory calculations have revealed significant differences in charge transfer between high-valence and low-valence states of metal ions adsorbed onto GQDs. Furthermore, the versatility of this method can extend to various types of GQDs and metal ions, highlighting its universal applicability. This work presents a simple, convenient, and cost-effective approach for quantitatively identifying mixed-valence metal ions in solution, offering a new avenue and opportunity for applications in biochemistry, environmental science, catalysis and materials science.},

However, traditional screw thread implants have been associated with certain drawbacks, including issues such as poor consistency with the alveolar bone and difficulty in customisation. Root analogue implants (RAI) are considered a promising substitute; however, they are not widely applied until now as their geometry design needs more improvements. The utilisation of porous structures, such as triply periodic minimal surfaces, in dental implants can reduce the elastic modulus, increase interconnectivity, and allow for strictly controllable structural characteristics. To achieve optimal initial and long-term stability, it is essential to have a moderate geometry that promotes a proper fit between the dental implants and the natural bone. Different porous and macro-retention structures of RAIs have been investigated due to the above two demands. However, owing to their complex porosity, such structures can only be effectively manufactured using additive manufacturing techniques. Various additive manufacturing technologies have been employed for the fabrication of dental implants and have provided good surface quality and mechanical properties. In vivo tests have demonstrated that their performance is similar to that of commercial implants fabricated using subtractive manufacturing techniques. In this review, we comprehensively examine the design concepts and processes involved in the development of dental implants, along with the application of additive manufacturing methods for their fabrication, while also offering recommendations for the future advancement of dental implant designs.},

The cytotoxicity assay revealed that the IC EGCG 50 of EGCG@cLAVs (85.1 μM) fell in the range of common cytotoxic drugs. The in vitro antimetastasis results disclosed that the EGCG@cLAVs effectively suppressed the migration and invasion of TNBC cells (4T1) with low wound healing rate and relative invasion rate of 19.10 ± 2.12\% and 15.0 ± 1.63\%, 4.0 and 6.7 times lower than that of control, respectively.

  abstract     = {This study analyzes light modulation of spiking in proteinoids, thermally condensed proteins exhibiting spike dynamics. We elucidate how light induces changes in proteinoids, modulating spike frequency. Results show proteinoids&#39; spiking can be adjusted by light intensity and wavelength. Structural investigations demonstrate light triggers conformational changes influencing spiking kinetics. Spiking proteinoids can perform Boolean logic , generating programmable expressions in response to light input modifications. This reveals potential unconventional computing applications. Our comprehensive analyses establish a fundamental understanding of light&#39;s impact on proteinoids&#39; structure and protrusion dynamics, facilitating optically programmed bio-logic gates. Outcomes will catalyze future research into light-modified proteinoids for information processing and unconventional computation. In summary, this study provides key insights into light modulation of proteinoids&#39; spiking behaviour, enabling novel optically controlled bio-logic gate operations and motivating continued efforts to integrate photo-responsive proteinoids in bioinspired computational systems.},

However, the significantly distinct physicochemical properties and the unbalanced coordinate proportion of chemotherapeutic and genetic drugs limit the actual therapeutic efficiency of the combined drug delivery strategy. Herein, we developed a simple method to self-assemble the fluorine atom-modified antisense oligonucleotide (2′F-G1319) with chemotherapeutic pirarubicin (THP) to form the carrier-free nanomedicines (2′F-G1319/THP NMs), which could efficaciously achieve the synergistic gene therapy and chemotherapy. In this study, 2′F-G1319 and THP could be self-assembled to form uniform nanoparticles through enhanced intermolecular interactions after G1319 was modified with the fluorine atom . Both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments verified that 2′F-G1319/THP NMs exhibited significant synergistic anti-tumor effects with high biostability and biocompatibility. Owing to the simple and universal synthesis process, our constructed self-assembled nanomedicine provides a promising opportunity for the wide applications of nanomedicines and is expected to realize more effective synergistic anti-tumor therapy without the addition of non-therapeutic excipients},

  abstract     = {In-process inspection of the additive manufacturing process requires a technique that can provide reliable measurements given the extreme operating environments, the small size of the defects and the cyclic melting and heating of the material, caused by subsequently deposited layers. A remote and couplant-free ultrasonic inspection technique using bulk waves that can image near-surface defects could address these in-process inspection requirements. Laser induced phased arrays (LIPA) generate and detect ultrasound based on laser ultrasonics principles, while the array is synthesised in post-processing. However, when using LIPAs for inspection, the surface acoustic waves (SAWs) interfere with the bulk wave modes giving rise to crosstalk and artefacts, which makes near-surface defect imaging difficult. This work experimentally validates and compares five techniques for SAW suppression: amplitude thresholding, mean waveform subtraction, principal component subtraction, frequency-wavenumber filtering, and phase coherence imaging. SAW suppression is demonstrated in ultrasonic images of transverse waves based on 71-element LIPA data synthesised on a Ti-6Al-4V directed energy deposition-arc (DED-Arc/Ti6Al4V) sample with a ∼1 mm diameter side drilled hole, located at ∼4 mm below the inspected surface. The reported results show that the principal component subtraction approach achieved the highest ‘signal-to-crosstalk ratio’ improvement of 16 dB, while successfully suppressing the SAW.},

  abstract     = {Cold spray (CS) is a highly potential solid-state additive manufacturing (AM) technique. In situ shot-peening-assisted CSAM was proposed to additively manufacture fully dense deposits using cost-effective and renewable nitrogen gas. The role of in situ shot-peening particles is critical but remains unclear. Here, the process was quantitatively modeled to visualize the dynamic deformation, energy conversion, as well as cell/sub-grain size and microhardness evolutions, compared to those during the conventional CSAM process, identifying the key role of in situ shot-peening particles in the AA6061 extreme deformation and microstructure characteristics during in situ shot-peening-assisted CSAM. High-fidelity modeling was verified fully by comparing the experimental and model-reproduced deformation profiles, cell/sub-grain size distributions, and increases in microhardness. The results show that the kinetic energy of in situ shot-peening particles was 470 times higher and dissipated mainly through AA6061 plastic deformation (86.36\% of total energy), leading to significant enhancement of microhardness and tensile strength. Moreover, the mixing ratio of large-size SS410 particles required to create a fully dense deposit was evaluated from an energy perspective, in good agreement with the experiment. This study elucidates the microforging principle during in situ shot-peening-assisted CSAM, providing scientific guidelines for high-quality and low-cost CSAM of high-strength aluminum alloys.},

  abstract     = {The simultaneous provision of strength and ductility of casting superalloy is challenging. In this work, a micro-grain casting process was applied to produce grain-refined K4169 alloy, which exhibited a superior combination of tensile ultimate strength, yield strength and elongation of 1204 MPa, 1041 MPa and 21.0\% at 23 °C. The tensile strengths were significantly enhanced without elongation weakened compared with the conventional casting one, which exhibited values of 947 MPa, 813 MPa and 20.0\%, respectively. As temperature decreased to −196 °C, the elongation of micro-grain K4169 further increased to 26.1\% while decreased to 13.5\% of the conventional one resulting from the different twinning tendencies related to grain refinement. This is because twinning occurs predominantly in grains orientated close to the 〈1 1 1〉 // tensile axis, and micro-grain casting process improves the probability for grains to meet this crystallography condition. The deformation twins together with stacking faults and Lomer-Cottrell locks ensured continuous work hardening, resulting in the delayed onset of necking and a better elongation. This work highlights the excellent mechanical properties of micro-grain K4169 and anticipates its enormous application potential. Moreover, the results of micromechanical behavior-microstructure-property relationship may improve the understanding of the plastic deformation of K4169 alloy and guide a further upgrading.},

Generally, the optimal path pattern is a computationally expensive, high-dimensional, and black-box permutation optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a combinatorial radial basis function surrogate-assisted genetic algorithm (CRBF-GA) to effectively generate the optimal path pattern by integrating the combinatorial radial basis function surrogate model (CRBF) with the genetic algorithm (GA). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CRBF-GA, a Ti-6Al-4V thin rod , a component of lattice, is chosen as the research object. Through numerical simulation, experimental verification, and error comparison analysis, the RBF-GA pattern is demonstrated to be the best path pattern among the random forest-assisted evolutionary algorithm (RF-EA), GA, spiral, and zigzag patterns, and it excels in achieving a more precise rod shape compared to the other patterns examined.},

In this work, we show that by designing metamaterial unit cells that have separately active and, specifically geometrically nonlinear, passive elements, many of these drawbacks can be mitigated and enhanced performance enabled (specifically, large, rapid, and resettable shape change). This separation between active and passive elements is advantageous, in that the complex active materials can be assigned only where needed, with the simplest geometries and functions. The use of geometric nonlinearity in passive elements is helpful as it provides mechanisms for augmented performance and further simplifies the role of the active elements. While all elements of the microstructural motifs used herein have been previously seen elsewhere, we suggest that the contribution provided here is a conceptual design approach that may be used more broadly for enabling new types of high-performing, stimuli-responsive metamaterials.},

The study proposes a semi-automated labeling method and employs a modified faster R-CNN, implementing ResNet50-D, aspectual anchor box optimization, and dataset augmentation. To conduct the testing to validate the proposed method, acrylonitrile butadiene rubber was exposed to hydrogen at 96.6 MPa for 24 h. The dataset was created by analyzing damaged cross-sections using a scanning electron microscope.

However, the advantage of quantitative pressure sensing of linear piezoelectric materials over ferroelectrics has not been demonstrated, while the thermal stability of linear piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) is yet to be evaluated. In this work, pressure sensors based on linear piezoelectric undoped ZnO and ferroelectric vanadium doped ZnO (V-ZnO) films are studied side by side. Both films possess similar fiber textures oriented along the polar ZnO [0 0 2] direction, yet each of the V-ZnO grains consists of strip-like domains observed by SEM. Applying triangular-wave pressures, the linear piezoelectric ZnO sensor generates triangular-wave voltage signals that are one-to-one linearly correlated to the applied pressure, showing decisive advantages for quantitative pressure sensing compared to the ‘sail-like’ voltage signals of the ferroelectric V-ZnO sensor that is many-to-one correlated to the applied pressure. Superior thermal stability is demonstrated in the linear piezoelectric ZnO sensor showing stable pressure sensing properties up to 450 °C compared to the degraded sensing properties of the ferroelectric V-ZnO sensor at 150 °C. The thermally stable piezoelectric sensors for quantitative pressure sensing based on linear piezoelectric ZnO films serve as candidates for high-performance multifunctional micro/nano systems.},

And their thin-wall-shaped bulks were prepared by laser additive manufacturing, with an emphasis on the effects of using V atoms to substitute for Nb atoms on their microstructures and mechanical properties. Also, the strengthening mechanism induced by D0 19 precipitates of as-aged V 2 Nb 4 HEA was discussed. After using V to substitute for Nb, the contents of inter-dendritic C14-Laves phases are effectively inhibited. The ductility is significantly improved with a small sacrifice of strength (i.e., σ b ∼ 851 MPa and δ ∼ 16.8\% for V 2 Nb 4 HEA). After aging treatment, the main microstructure transforms from fine dendrites to recrystallized equiaxed grains. The intercrossed needle-shaped D0 19 precipitates with a volume fraction of 7.2\% are uniformly distributed in the FCC matrix, which hinders the dislocation slip. Thereto, the as-96-hr-aged V 2 Nb 4 HEA exhibits the most excellent strength-ductility trade-off (e.g., σ s ∼ 721.5 MPa, σ b ∼ 979.5 MPa with a sufficient δ of 7.5\%).

This novel AE-based in-situ monitoring approach provides a promising alternative to quantify part density in LPBF process. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a Bayesian encoder backbone for learning the manifold representations of LPBF regimes, which were visually separable in a lower-dimensional representation using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding. The generalized representations learned by the Bayesian backbone allowed traditional classifiers trained on smaller datasets to exhibit high classification accuracy. The feature map computed using pre-trained Bayesian encoder on other datasets was also effective in anomaly detection, achieving 92\% accuracy with one-class Support Vector Machine. Additionally, the representation learned by the BNN facilitates transfer learning, where it can be fine-tuned for classification tasks on different process maps, which is also demonstrated in this work. Our proposed framework improves the generalization and robustness of the LPBF monitoring, particularly in the face of varying data distribution across multiple process parameter spaces.},

  abstract     = {Magnolol shows promise as an effective anti-tumor therapeutic agent. Nevertheless, the clinical application of this agent is constrained by its inherent water insolubility and diminished stability. In the present investigation, we have developed a new approach to address these limitations by creating an acid-responsive amphiphilic polymeric prodrug (PMag) that contains acetal bonds and magnolol, and can self-assemble into polymeric micelles (PMag-Ms) in aqueous solutions. We conducted in vitro release studies and observed that the micelles rapidly released magnolol at an acidic pH of 5.0, but only released minimal amounts of magnolol at a neutral pH of 7.4. In vitro investigations performed on gastric cancer cells elucidated that PMag-Ms selectively induced cell apoptosis and G1 phase cell cycle arrest, exhibiting higher efficacy than magnolol alone. Furthermore, in vivo studies confirmed that PMag-Ms exhibited superior inhibition of tumor growth, favorable biocompatibility with organs, increased accumulation in tumor tissues, and enhanced targeting efficiency compared to magnolol. Pharmacokinetic analysis also revealed that PMag-Ms had a longer half-life and extended duration of action in vivo . These results highlight the potential of the synthesized acid-degradable PMag-Ms as a promising therapeutic option for gastric cancer.},

In this paper, variable radian 3D printing nozzle is firstly developed to verify the controllability of extruded concrete material based on self-developed 3D building printer. Then, variable radian forming theory is presented and used to evaluate the mechanism material fracture and accumulation, and improve the molding quality of nonlinear structure. Finally, simulation analysis and experiments are designed to explore the controllable mechanism of variable radian molding and verify the consistency between the experimental results and the theoretical analysis.

In this work, we show that it is possible to inhibit this decomposition by the substitution of Fe x+ in tetrahedral sites of hercynite by Mg 2+ . Spinel series, Fe 1-x Mg x Al 2 O 4 (x=0,0.3,0.5,0.7), were prepared using arc plasma melting technique to obtain high-purity and dense materials. The composition Fe 0.7 Mg 0.3 Al 2 O 4 was subjected to further in-depth high-temperature in situ investigation of stability using High-Temperature X-Ray Diffractometry up to 1200 °C in air. Also, isothermal oxidation was conducted in the same conditions on both powdered and bulk samples, followed by subjecting the oxidized samples to structural analysis by X-Ray Diffractometry, Mössbauer Spectroscopy and X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation. The microstructure of oxidized bulk samples was analyzed by SEM/EDS. Mg substitution in hercynite was found to sluggish the spinel oxidation and decomposition.

These structures combine multiple distinct architectures into a single structure with an exceptional performance that far exceeds that of each constituting architecture. However, combining strut-based lattices poses serious challenges in establishing effective connections, primarily due to complications in formulating mathematical expressions. Here, we introduce a novel approach, inspired by the connections observed in the grain boundaries of polycrystalline materials, to design the interconnections of hybrid structures. This strategy involves shrinking the unit cell linkage, thereby addressing the difficulty of forming efficient connections at arbitrary spatial interfaces within strut-based lattice structures. We then use the relevant design theories to tune the performance of these connections and simplify the design process for hybrid structures – even for inexperienced designers. Our experimental observations confirm the efficacy of the proposed strategy, bridging the knowledge gap in the design of connected strut-based multi-lattice structures. Furthermore, this approach enhances the design of tailored hybrid structures and fosters the development of metamaterials with advanced, unique functionalities. The proposed approach has important implications for the development of designer materials, with applications in medical devices, (soft) robotics, and implants.},

  abstract     = {The worldwide increase of composites usage is accompanied by an equal increase of composite waste. While there are many reasons for discarding composite components, a primary reason is damage, with interlaminar failure being particularly common. A novel Multi-Matrix Continuously-Reinforced Composite (MMCRC) repair methodology is proposed, which incorporates repairable vitrimer resin. The procedure enables interlaminar failure repair without utilizing typical patch repair, that introduces additional damage. To achieve this a vitrimer matrix is incorporated into the damaged-prone region at the manufacturing stage. Interlaminar failure is then established and repaired using vacuum pressure and heating using an oven. With an eye to real-world application (where removing a part to be placed in an oven may not be possible), repair was also conducted utilizing localized induction heating. Both methods successfully repaired the interlaminar failure, recovering the initial strength and generating an average performance of 167\% compared to the intact sample. The reasons for the increased performance are described in detail, which lead to the conclusion that the feasibility of incorporating reparable regions at the manufacturing stage has been demonstrated successfully. It is shown an interlaminar failure repair can be achieved using a less detrimental and time-consuming processing than traditional repair methodologies.},

Until now, growing the high-quality GaN film on the diamond for device manufacture is still a great challenge. In this study, a new strategy of high-quality GaN on (1 1 1) diamond was proposed for the realization of high-performance GaN-on-diamond devices. The nano-patterned buffer engineering was utilized to greatly improved the GaN film on (1 1 1) diamond. The Al 0.78 Ga 0.22 N nano-patterned buffer reformed the morphology, ensuring that c orientation is the primary growth direction. The subsequent overgrowth of Al 0.47 Ga 0.53 N broadened the nano pillars and introduced stacking faults, improving the coalescence process and dislocations blockage. In addition, the coalescence process of the Al 0.26 Ga 0.74 N layer bent the treading dislocations, inducing the dislocations to annihilate. As a result, we could obtain remarkably high-quality GaN films on (1 1 1) diamond. The high-resolution X-ray diffraction rocking curve showed a full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of 770/986 arcsec at (0 0 2)/(1 0 2), which is the narrowest result reported. To the best of our knowledge, the RC FWHM at (1 0 2) of epitaxial GaN on diamond is reported firstly. Overall, this study provided a new strategy for obtaining high-quality GaN films on (1 1 1) diamonds for high-performance GaN-on-diamond devices.},

In addition to the temperature and cooling rates, the model incorporates the role of mechanical fields in decomposition kinetics in the Mo-V binary alloy system. Regimes for temperatures and cooling rates at which spinodal decomposition occurs are identified. Applying external loading leads to directional phase separation in the Mo-V binary system. The elastic inhomogeneity in terms of material properties between the two phases initiates the directional alignment while eigenstrains and applied external loading control the degree of alignment.

Compression tests were conducted on S-shaped reinforced honeycomb cores with different rotational structures – left-hand, right-hand, and mixed rotation. The deformation process of these cores was thoroughly investigated. Additionally, a theoretical prediction model was proposed to determine the Young&#39;s modulus and peak load of S-shaped reinforced honeycomb cores. The experimental data was compared with the theoretical model to validate its accuracy. Moreover, the study examined the effects of changing the relative density and cell wall angle of S-shaped reinforced honeycomb cores on the peak and specific peak loads. The results demonstrated that the use of S-shaped reinforced structures successfully altered the deformation mode of the honeycomb cores. In particular, the peak loads of S-LL and S-LR specimens were 29.14\% and 86.12\% higher than that of plain honeycomb, respectively. In summary, increasing the relative density of S-shaped reinforced honeycomb cores proved to enhance the peak load and specific peak load, thereby augmenting the design capabilities of these cores.},

Notably, cell imaging experiments showed that TSPy-B could selectively target tumor cells with biotin receptor overexpression and further exhibit mitochondria targeting ability. The in vitro anticancer mechanism confirmed that after cell internalization, TSPy-B localized in the mitochondrial site and produced ROS resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. ROS generation experiments showed that TSPy-B could simultaneously produce 1 O 2 and highly toxic free radicals which not depended on the oxygen level of solid tumor. The cell killing effect of TSPy-B was also confirmed in hypoxic culture model. In vivo photodynamic therapy experiments demonstrated that TSPy-B could effectively inhibit tumor growth and had good biological safety.

  abstract     = {Damage tolerance of a thin film attached to a substrate is dependent on several parameters such as film thickness, film orientation, residual stresses, nature of interfaces, microstructure and defects present. Here we study the fracture resistance and crack growth trajectory in BaTiO 3 thin films attached to elasticially stiff substrates using micromechanical experiments and finite element modeling. Microcantilever fracture tests are carried out on bi-layered systems of BaTiO 3 film on Pt-Si and SrTiO 3 substrates to study the effect of interfaces, texture and elastic mismatch on fracture toughness. The substrates in the bi-layers are chosen to force the crack to experience a shielding effect in terms of a decrease in the crack driving force. Experiments revealed an unexpectedly large increase in fracture toughness when the crack tip is closer to a stiffer substrate, qualitatively matching the predictions from the numerical model. The bi-layered films attached to the substrate showed 125\% (on Pt-Si) and 160\% (on SrTiO 3 ) increase in fracture toughness compared to the free-standing films, for the first time, revealing the significant effect of elastic modulus of the substrate on improving the fracture resistance at such micrometer length scales.},

  abstract     = {Flexible pressure sensors have found widespread application in medical diagnosis and human–computer interaction. These practical applications often require large-area pressure sensing arrays (PSAs) to explore spatial pressure distributions. However, the development of high-performance PSAs still presents significant challenges. Here, a new method is proposed for the fabrication of a high-resolution capacitive PSA in a 10 × 10 configuration. The array comprises the upper and lower electrode arrays of laser-induced graphene patterned on polyimide films, as well as the sandwiched dielectric units based on electrospun nanofiber membranes of H 3 PO 4 @PVPP (cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone). Experimental results indicate that the PSA exhibits high sensitivity across a wide pressure range (0–200 kPa), while offering a rapid response/recovery time of 24/41 ms (at 1 kPa), an exceptionally low detection limit of ∼1.2 Pa, and a good stability of 4000 cycles. Moreover, the crosstalk of the PSA was found to be as low as 1.3\%. By employing the PSA in conjunction with a convolutional neural network algorithm, a human foot-arch diagnostic system was developed for accurate detection and quantification of the plantar pressure for different types of foot arches. Such technology has significant potential in clinical detection and disease diagnosis of human foot.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, there are many researches on flexible humidity sensors based on different composites, such as polymer with graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes as conductive fillers. Herein, a flexible wearable device used for humidity detection and breath monitoring was fabricated based on the molecular designable thermoplastic polyamide elastomer (TPAE). TPAE is block copolymers consisting of the polyamide hard segments and the polyether soft segments. Among them, the hard segments (PA1212 or PA6) form the crosslinking network providing resilience, and the soft segments composed of PPO and PEO endow TPAE with flexibility and solvent-responsiveness. The resistance of TPAE-based humidity sensor decreases with the increase of relative humidity (RH), exhibiting negative humidity sensitivity. Besides, it has a wide humidity monitoring range (11\%RH ∼ 91\%RH) and good fitting degree of R 2 &gt; 0.99 which is hardly influenced by bending deformation. When the humidity sensor was exposed to organic vapor (e.g. ethanol), it exhibited a faster response of astonishing 4 s. This novel block copolymer not only shows good humidity sensing performance in many aspects, but also provides a novel strategy and approach for the preparation of the humidity sensing materials afterwards.},

The present study aimed to shed light on the key factors influencing the stick–slip behavior of polyamide-66/zinc-coated steel by conducting experiments at varying temperatures. The results revealed that the stick–slip behavior and interfacial interaction are temperature-dependent. The friction behavior transitioned from stick-slip to smooth sliding at 40 °C. The transition in the interfacial interaction from adhesion to plastic deformation with increased temperature was responsible for the reduction in stick–slip intensity. The reductions in both the potential energy and static friction force were believed to cause the decreased stick–slip intensity, as evidenced by the in-situ observation of the friction pairs through the digital image correlation (DIC) method. The present study could provide a comprehensive and targeted approach to suppressing the stick–slip behavior of polymer/metal over a wide range of temperatures.},

The present study proposes the use of a lattice structure coupon sample as a proxy for build quality control. Lattices are sensitive to variations in process parameters, impacting the resulting mechanical properties, more so than bulk mechanical test specimens. The sensitivity of lattice structures allows for the detection of subtle changes in process parameters, which can be valuable for quality control efforts, i.e. maintaining constant manufacturing quality. In this study, a series of lattice coupon samples were manufactured with varying factors as a proof of concept to demonstrate this concept. Non-destructive micro-computed tomography (CT) was used to quantify the manufacturing variations/defects. The lattice coupons are subjected to quasi-static compression testing to evaluate their mechanical properties, with differences shown indicative of changes in the manufacturing process . The work reported here acts as a proof of concept for a low-cost build quality evaluation methodology using lattice coupons and compression testing alone. When the build quality deteriorates or parameters change without the knowledge of this by the operator, this will be observed in changes in the compressive test results for lattice coupons.},

  abstract     = {Continuous basalt fiber is an emerging high-performance foundational material that can be widely used in fields such as road construction, energy conservation and environmental protection, aerospace, military equipment, and marine ships. However, it is difficult for existing processing techniques to form continuous basalt architectures with three-dimensional (3D) complex shapes. In addition, the basalt fibers in the architectures are filled with polymers, which cannot fully utilize the performance of basalt fibers. Therefore, here, we report the fabrication of continuous basalt fibers with fireproof and thermal insulation performance through the combination of an Additive manufacturing (AM) manipulator, two-step precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) processes. Using SiOC ceramics to fill between continuous basalt fibers will help improve the architectures&#39; fire and thermal insulation performance. The continuous basalt fibers coated with thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) were processed into 3D architectures under the action of the laser. Through the vacuum infiltration of the SiOC precursor and debinding process, TPU in the 3D architectures was removed. In order to reduce the structural defects generated by the first PIP process, the final part with fireproof and thermal insulation performance was fabricated through the second PIP process. We further demonstrated the final part with excellent fireproof and thermal insulation performance. The final part had a shell temperature of 788.8 ℃ and an internal temperature of about 50 ℃ under the flame spray gun for the 20 s. By replacing polymers with inorganic materials, our basalt architectures exhibit their potential applications in military, aviation, and civil fireproof and thermal insulation equipment.},

  abstract     = {As a class of strain-hardening cement-based material, Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) feature high tensile ductility and multiple cracking. However, ECCs reinforced with hydrophobic fibers attain high ductility but also exhibit larger crack widths caused by the weak bonding of the fiber/matrix interface, attenuating the durability potential of resulting infrastructures. This research aims at tailoring the crack width control ability of ECC through hybridizing hydrophilic PVA and hydrophobic PP fiber. A systematic design procedure was proposed based on the micromechanical analysis with a multi-scale investigation. Experimental results verified the hypothesized composite ductility enhancement by PP fiber and strength enhancement and crack width reduction by PVA fiber. Tight crack width of 50 μm at 2\% tensile strain can be achieved by a fiber hybridization ratio of 1:1 to ensure extreme durability. Changes in the microstructure of the matrix, associated with fresh property alteration due to fiber hybridization, were captured by micro CT scanning. Finally, the trade-off between mechanical performance, durability, and material sustainability was investigated for optimal material design. This research demonstrates that hybridizing PVA fiber with PP fiber holds promise to enhance material sustainability while maintaining the advantageous characteristics of ductile ECC and tight crack width for extreme durability.},

  abstract     = {Controlling the phase and amplitude of reflected waves has been challenging due to the inherent coupling between them. Changes in the phase of a wave often result in changes in its amplitude, and vice versa. This coupling makes it difficult to control both parameters independently. Here we report a deterministic approach, illustrated by an equivalent circuit model, to decouple the phase from the amplitude of reflected waves based on a single-layer metasurface. With the variables conversion and appropriate impedance patterns, this approach allows for the generation of 1-bit phase meta-atoms with a natural phase difference of 180° and controllable amplitude ranging from 0 to 0.9. Furthermore, the decoupling frequency can be customized by using different permittivities and dielectric thickness. These 1-bit phase meta-atoms, whose amplitude can be independently controlled, have potential in wavefront manipulation such as multi-beam antennas and hybrid radar cross section reduction metasurfaces. As a proof of concept, a metasurface for backscatter suppression is demonstrated and measured. The reflected wave is scattered by wavefront modulation with phase control in the spatial domain, while the energy is absorbed by amplitude control in the energy domain, resulting in extremely low backward scatterings in a wideband. In addition to the discussion of passive metasurfaces, the active case is also expanded on. The results of our paper demonstrate the potential of the phase- and amplitude-decoupled approach in designing multi-function metasurfaces for wavefront manipulation and radar applications.},

This study incorporates deep reinforcement learning, a subset of machine learning that teaches an agent to complete a task through interactive experiences, into mechanical metamaterial design. The approach creates a design environment for the reinforcement learning agent to iteratively construct metamaterials with tailorable deformation and hysteretic characteristics. Validation involved producing metamaterials with a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) base material that exhibited the deformation response of expanded thermoplastic polyurethane (E-TPU) while maximizing or minimizing hysteresis in cyclic compression. This alignment confirmed the feasibility of tailoring deformation and energy manipulation using mechanical metamaterials. The agent&#39;s generalizability was tested by tasking it to create various metamaterials with distinct loading deformation responses and specific hysteresis goals in a simulated setting. The agent consistently delivered metamaterials that met loading curve criteria and demonstrated favorable energy return. This work demonstrates the potential of deep reinforcement learning as a rapid and effective tool for designing mechanical metamaterials with customizable traits.

Shape morphing is achieved through flexible materials or rigid components with either kinematic or compliant joints. An additional step, namely shape locking, is needed for sustained load support. Activation of a locking mechanism can be done with any energy, among which magnetism is one. Here, we present the implementation of a magnetic locking mechanism for kinematically deformable metamaterial structures that maintain shape and support loads upon locking. The structure consists of 3D printed rigid magnetic and non-magnetic components connected by hinges. We created several prototypes of the proposed designs using two additive manufacturing methods (i.e., material extrusion and multi-material jetting) and demonstrated its application in a closed-loop grid for arbitrary shapes. Moreover, we characterized the performance of the prototypes using mechanical tests and multibody kinematic system simulations. This work highlights the viability of the locking concept and provides design considerations for future applications.

It can cause the gingival recession and tooth loss, gravely jeopardizing the oral health of people. Current therapies still suffer from issues like bleeding, pain, injured gums, limited treatment effectiveness, a lengthy treatment cycle, and bacterial resistance when using a combination of surgical intervention and antibiotic therapy. Herein, a simple one-step cross-linking process was used to create glucose oxidase (GOD) loaded upon iron alginate (FeAlg/GOD), which has a strong anti-biofilm activity, good biocompatibility, and was successfully used to treat periodontitis caused by biofilms. The results demonstrated that in the presence of a high glucose concentration in the gingival crevicular fluid, FeAlg/GOD could catalyze the conversion of glucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The produced hydrogen peroxide could convert Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ when it got to the deep periodontal pockets. Following that, the Fenton reaction was activated, producing large amounts of hydroxyl radical ( OH). In conclusion, oral plaque biofilms were removed by the FeAlg/GOD. Additionally, successful in vivo treatment was accomplished in rat&#39;s experimental periodontitis models, as evidenced by a markedly reduced inflammatory response, decreased bone loss, and made healthier gum tissue.

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in mobile electronic devices and electric vehicles, but the safety issues of lithium-ion batteries have become increasingly prominent owing to the risk of leak out and explosion with liquid electrolytes. Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity and low cost are considered as one of the most attractive alternatives to replacing liquid electrolytes. However, the poor interfacial compatibilities of SSE in lithium batteries lead to the failure, which severely hinders their development. Recent studies have shown that two-dimensional (2D) layered materials can improve the interface stability of SSE to lithium metal. In this Review, we will mainly introduce the fundamentals of SSEs and interface issues, and then summarize 2D materials-based modification strategy for SSEs. Recent advances have been highlighted in the aspects of using 2D materials for improving the interface of SSEs, which are very promising for energy applications. The availability of the 2D materials offers a rich playground, which not only improves the electrochemical performance of solid-state lithium batteries, but also conceives deep understanding the mechanism of interface modulation. Lastly, the perspective is provided to address the current challenges and issues of SSEs in lithium batteries.},

  abstract     = {The influence of the temperature gradient and the pulling velocity on solidification cracking susceptibility (SCS) during welding is studied by simulating the liquid channel evolution with a quantitative phase field model . Increasing the pulling velocity or decreasing the temperature gradient increases the pressure drop from the dendrite tip to the coalescence point, leading to an increase in SCS. Decreasing the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) decreases the permeability of the liquid channel and the liquid channel length at the same time, resulting in a decrease in the pressure drop and SCS when the PDAS is small. Consideration of the PDAS dependency on the temperature gradient and the pulling velocity influences the value of the pressure drop but does not change the tendency of SCS. The conclusions are also valid for an alloy with strong back diffusion. As the temperature gradient and the pulling velocity within the melt pool are controlled by process parameters, the findings from this work provide a theoretical basis to optimize process parameters to avoid solidification cracking.},

This becomes particularly pronounced for test geometries beyond micro-pillars and for materials with high elastic limits and high Peierls stresses . This study investigates the elastic strain limits and strain distribution in micro double shear tests conducted on single-crystalline silicon with different crystallographic orientations . In situ scanning electron microscopy images were used to obtain full-field strain maps using digital image correlation . This local strain analysis approach revealed that the shear zones of the test geometry are not solely under pure shear conditions, but also experience superimposed bending. The local strain analysis approach increases the precision of measured elastic properties to ±15\% of the literature value compared to deviations of 75-80\% using the traditional global strain analysis approach. This study highlights the limitations of the global strain analysis approach in complex specimen geometries and demonstrates the effectiveness of digital image correlation in accurately determining elastic strain at the small length scale. Furthermore, both the low defect density in the samples as well as the small length scales allow for the exploration of orientation dependent strength levels close to the theoretical limit.},

  abstract     = {Humans have been long dreaming of obtaining the ability of changing electromagnetic (EM) attributes intelligently according to the environment so as to camouflage just as chameleons do. Thanks to the unprecedented high degree of freedom in manipulating EM waves, metasurfaces can mimic EM characteristics of various environments vividly and have pushed a giant step towards this long-desired dream. Nevertheless, for most metasurfaces, the EM characteristics are fixed and thus cannot be altered according to changing environments, which hinders their applications in intelligent scenarios such as moving target camouflage. With the aim to achieve intelligent camouflage, in this work we propose a chameleon-like framework for intelligent camouflage based on EM metasurface, which integrates transfer-learning-empowered perceptron into a reconfigurable metasurface. As a demonstrative example, a chameleon-like intelligent camouflage metasurface (CLICM) system with robust extendibility was developed and measured in laboratory. The system can dynamically control the reflection spectrum in 5.1–6.5 GHz according to what it sees. Both the simulation and experiment results verify this framework. This work provides a perceptron-algorithm-metasurface framework with robust extendibility for intelligent EM manipulation and may find wide applications in camouflage and wireless communication.},

  abstract     = {The tensile properties, fracture toughness, and fatigue crack growth (FCG) characteristics of a directed energy deposited precipitation hardened stainless steel (grade: PH15-5; age hardening heat treatment condition: H900) were examined. In the as-fabricated condition, the alloy contains microfissures that are oriented parallel to the build direction, whose appearance was difficult to be detected using optical microscopy. Due to their relative orientation w.r.t. the loading direction, significant anisotropy in tensile and FCG behavior was noted, with the properties being particularly lower when the loading direction is perpendicular to the crack orientation. Despite the presence of microfissures, the alloy’s fracture initiation toughness is comparable to (or in some cases exceeds) those manufactured using either conventionally techniques or laser powder bed fusion. Activation of the extrinsic toughening mechanisms, such as crack deflection when its mode I direction is perpendicular to the microfissures and a combination of crack bridging and deflection when it is parallel, are the micromechanical reasons for the observed high toughness. The efficacy of such mechanisms is observed to depend on the plastic zone size relative to the microfissure spacing. The understanding developed in this study enables the development of strategies for enhancing the damage tolerance of additively manufactured alloys.},

The initial nucleation and subsequent growth of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) can be controlled by heat treatment after friction stir lap welding. The miniature tensile tests exhibited the relationship between the joint strength and IMC layer thickness with changes in the fracture location. Microscale tensile testing using a single edge-notch tension geometry initiates the crack and subsequent propagations near the interface, which helps identify the crack initiation site and understand the dependence of the local strength on the type of IMCs. Crack deviation behavior toward the Al side, attributed to the difference of local strength, is confirmed by in situ observations, which indicated that continuous failure can easily occur within the grown IMCs, particularly in macroscale joints. It was concluded that the crack propagation is controlled by the local crack deviation toward metal matrix, which tends to occur for the dissimilar interface with thin IMC layer. This miniature/microscale tensile testing approach is expected to clarify the essential relationship between the interfacial microstructure and the fracture behavior.},

The nanocomposite surface and phase transformation suppress cracks initiation and propagation, resulting in the high fretting fatigue life that was 30.2-times higher than that of the original TB8 titanium alloy via triggering an exceptional fretting fatigue phenomenon where damage-crack initiate towards the interior of non-fretting contact zone.

The usefulness of the process described here is illustrated by the fabrication of two types of materials: low porosity epoxy and cement matrix foams and Guefoams. As proof of concept, epoxy-based Guefoams were developed for the removal of Escherichia coli in water using iodine-impregnated activated carbon particles as the guest phase. The results indicate that the Guefoams outperform conventional bactericidal particle beds in several aspects, including their ease of handling and their tunable fluid-dynamic properties that enable high bacteria annihilation efficiency.},

It has been demonstrated that localized and sustained immunosuppressant delivery may be a suitable route for FK506 administration. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a FK506-loaded microneedle (FK506 MN) in the treatment of acute rejection in HT. The physicochemical properties of FK506 MN were evaluated, and it exhibited constant release over the course of at least 9 days with a 94.6\% cumulative release rate. Also, the FK506 MN treatment could successfully alleviate acute rejection and prolong allograft survival compared with the untreated group (mean survival time, 12.33 versus 7.25 days). Furthermore, T cell and macrophage infiltration as well as secretion of IL-2, IL-6 and IFN-γ were dramatically reduced in the FK506 MN group. As expected, no hepatoxicity and nephrotoxicity were observed after the application of FK506 MN. Taken together, FK506 MN based drug delivery system provides a novelty strategy to deliver FK506 in heart transplantation, which may be also suitable for other organ transplantations in the future.},

  abstract     = {Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) has been exploited as an emerging therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. However, insufficient intracellular H 2 O 2 levels and ultrahigh glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) severely restrict CDT efficacy. To address these concerns, in this work, a self-reinforcing biodegradable nanotherapeutic was developed to modulate the TME to amplify CDT. The nanotherapeutic (GOD-FeCaP@TPZ, abbreviated GFCT) was fabricated through a mild one-step biomineralization process using the enzyme catalyst glucose oxidase (GOD) as a template to form biodegradable iron-doped calcium phosphate nanoparticles, followed by the loading of the prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ). When GFCT decomposes and releases Fe 3+ in the acidic TME, the delivered GOD can effectively catalyze the oxidization of glucose to enhance the subsequent Fenton-like reaction by promoting intracellular acidity (via the production of gluconic acid) and improving the generation of H 2 O 2 . Moreover, the released iron constantly depletes GSH by self-cyclic valence alterations in Fe(III) and Fe(II) and then triggers H 2 O 2 to produce •OH through an Fe(II)-mediated Fenton-like reaction. Moreover, the elevated level of hypoxia induced by GOD-mediated glucose oxidization can activate the prodrug TPZ for effective chemotherapy, thus achieving remarkable synergistic therapeutic outcomes. This work provides another paradigm to augment antitumor efficacy via modulation of the TME.},

However, the clinical applications of these composites are limited due to the insufficient osteogenic and mechanical properties. In nature, the presence of amorphous iron-calcium phosphate (Fe-ACP) strengthens the mechanical properties of some biominerals, and our previous study has revealed its synthetic route and in vitro osteogenic properties. However, the potential role of Fe-ACP on biomineralization and constructing biomimetic scaffolds for bone regeneration has not been studied. Herein, a biomimetic scaffold with good osteogenic property was fabricated based on the mineralization of Fe-ACP, with the assistance of ice-templated freeze-casting. The in vitro study showed that the mineralized scaffolds possessed favorable biocompatibility and osteogenic property. Moreover, the scaffolds promoted cell chemotaxis and angiogenic property by upregulating the hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). In vivo experiment demonstrated potent early osteogenesis along with angiogenesis and ultimately promoted bone regeneration. Overall, the mineralized scaffold mediated by Fe-ACP precursors provide a unique platform to enhance bone tissue repair.},

  abstract     = {Corneal neovascularization is a severe eye disease that is often associated with an inflammatory cycle and increased oxidative stress. Excessive reactive oxygen species can cause harmful changes in the corneal epithelium and lead to vicious inflammatory cycles, resulting in an increase in corneal neovascularization. Unfortunately, many drugs used in clinic are water-insoluble and have low bioavailability on the ocular surface, which limits their effectiveness. Therefore, it&#39;s crucial to design a new drug delivery system. In this study, we designed an oxide-responsive nanoparticle system called MPA, which was consisted of the large pore sized-mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) core and the polydopamine (PDA) surface shell via the linkage with disulfide bond. Finally, the nanoparticles are endowed with the enhanced loading efficiency and the controllable release of fenofibrate (Feno) in response to the abundant ROS level in the inflammatory environment. In an in vivo study using mice, treatment with MPA@ Feno resulted in minimal corneal neovascularization area and length and significantly reduced expression of pro-angiogenic factors and oxidative stress factors. Therefore, MPA solves the problem of poor drug solubility, clearing oxygen species in the pathological environment, which will improve its therapeutic effect in corneal neovascularization.},

This study pursued the development of filaments consisting of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene yarn (UHMWPE) embedded in a matrix of polycaprolactone (UPE/PCL) and successful 3D printing. The physical characteristics and printability of the filament were evaluated in terms of key parameters including spooling speed, temperature, fiber distribution (consolidated vs dispersed), and fiber volume fraction (4≤ V f ≤30\%). An evaluation of the microstructure and tensile properties of the UPE/PCL was performed after processing and printing. Prior to printing, the filament exhibited an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 590±40 MPa with apparent fiber strength of 2.4 GPa. For the printed condition, the UTS reached 470±60 MPa and apparent fiber strength of 1.9 GPa. Fiber dispersion in the filament plays an important role on the printed properties and the potential for fiber degradation. Nevertheless, the strength of the UPE/PCL represents a new performance benchmark for compliant composites printed by FFF. This new material system can support applications where strength and toughness are key performance metrics in addition to flexibility.},

Printing trials with cylinders of 20 cm diameter and various overhang inclinations were carried out – both vertically and multi-directionally sliced. The overhang was increased until the fresh material could no longer support itself. The multi-directionally sliced objects showed the largest overhang capabilities. The thermoplastic printing mortar was able to print a maximum overhang of 80°. This demonstrated freedom of shape and applicability of the bio-based mortar to a 3D printing process could pave the way for highly optimized building components with a minimum use of material.

  abstract     = {Electrical treeing is a leading cause to the eventual breakdown of dielectric polymers under high voltages. This paper presents a simulation scheme developed based on the phase-field regularized cohesive zone model (PF-CZM) for electrical tree modelling. By using the electrical analog of the crack propagation, the localized breakdown is modelled by the evolution of surface energy, and the electrical treeing is driven by the competition between the surface energy and the stored energy following the laws of thermodynamics. The microscopic Weibull distribution of the dielectric breakdown strength is the key factor resulting in the fractal structures of the electrical tree. The model developed is mesh independent and length-scale insensitive when the mesh size is no greater than 2.5 μ m 2.5μm . The validity of the model was confirmed through experiments, which strengthens its credibility. Three types of composites are designed and compared. The results indicate that the epoxy resin enhanced with 5 vol\% silica and 1 vol\% graphene sheet has a 3.5\% longer dielectric breakdown time and a 29.2\% higher thermal conductivity than the pure epoxy resin. Overall, the model provides a valuable tool for understanding the physics of electrical treeing and designing new dielectric materials with high withstand voltages.},

  abstract     = {Visual sensors for relative humidity (RH) are of interest for distributed and autonomous environmental monitoring. Most of the visual humidity sensors are based on colorimetric sensing through the employment of hygroscopic inorganic pigments or photonic crystals (PCs). However, the toxicity of some inorganic pigments poses a risk to the environment especially if dispersed during in-situ measurements. On the other hand, the angle-dependent structural colours reading of the PCs, make these devices non suitable for autonomous and in-situ environmental monitoring. Here, we report the first visual humidity sensor using an artificial and hygroscopic seed-like robot ( I-SeedPel ) recently (2023) developed by our group for hygro-driven environmental exploration ( https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202205146 ). The I-SeedPel design is bioinspired to the hygroscopic and layered tissues of the Pelargonium appendiculatum seed and fabricated through additive manufacturing techniques using biodegradable polymers. The hygro-mechanical response of the I-SeedPel generates a reversible change of the geometrical features in the artificial seed structure (i.e., awn’s angular displacement and diameter variation) related to the RH. The variation of the geometric properties can be quantified and correlated to RH in a wide range (30–90\%), with an accuracy of 97–98\%, with a resolution of 0.17–0.52\% of RH and a good reproducibility (average RSD = 14.7\%).},

Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) has been shown to promote H-type vessel formation, a specialized blood vessel, strongly positive for CD31 and endomucin, coupling angiogenesis and osteogenesis. However, the lack of a controllable growth factor delivery limits its clinical application, causing certain complications associated with PDGF-BB administration. This study developed an injectable heparin-conjugated hydrogel (GHH) for controlled delivery to facilitate the effective binding of PDGF-BB and rapid vascularized bone regeneration. Herein, in vitro experiments involving the controlled release of PDGF-BB showed that the PDGF-BB-loaded GHH (GHHP) hydrogel demonstrated excellent cytocompatibility and osteogenic properties. The subcutaneous implantation model in rats revealed that the GHHP hydrogel has the potential to induce the formation of H-type blood vessels in vivo . Furthermore, the healing of distal femoral condyle defects in rat models in vivo demonstrated that GHHP could substantially promote H-type angiogenesis and effectively repair bone defects. Our injectable heparin-conjugated sustained-release PDGF-BB hydrogel has excellent angiogenic and osteogenic properties, thus providing a novel and promising solution for bone defect repair.},

Due to melting point depressing metalloids such as silicon and boron, hard and brittle intermetallic phases are formed during the brazing process depending on the diffusion mechanisms. These brittle phases significantly affect mechanical and corrosive properties of the compounds. To quantify the influences of their amount, morphology and distribution, deep learning image segmentation was applied to segment these phases of the athermal solidification zone and the diffusion zone. Subsequently, characteristic microstructure parameters were calculated from these. The parameters of six different brazed joint variations were compared with their experimental characterization of mechanical and corrosive properties so that several correlations could be identified. Finally, a layer-by-layer removal of a brazed joint was performed using a focused ion beam, and a 3D model was reconstructed from the generated images to gain a mechanism-based understanding beyond the previous 2D investigations.},

In this study, atomic structures of the equilibrated 18R and 10 H phases in Mg–Y–Al alloys were systematically investigated via atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-TEM) and first-principles calculations. Three structures (α-type, β-type, and γ-type) with different numbers of Mg layers (one, two, and three, respectively) sandwiched between L1 2 structures were present in the 18R phase. Meanwhile, δ-type (without Mg layers), ε-type (with one Mg layer), and ζ-type (with two Mg layers) structures were detected in the 10 H phase. The presence of the interstitial atoms in the L1 2 structure was confirmed by TEM and theoretical calculations. Based on the obtained results, a new thermodynamic model for the LPSO phase was constructed and successfully applied to establish the thermodynamic description of the Mg–Y–Al system. The CALPHAD-type calculation data obtained using the proposed thermodynamic description were in good agreement with the experimental results. The findings of this study can help elucidate the formation mechanism of LPSO phases and guide Mg–Y–Al alloy design.},

  abstract     = {During the ceramic photocuring 3D printing process, the penetration ability of incident light is hindered by the extinction effects of ceramic powders in ceramic slurry. This limitation in light penetration negatively impacts printing efficiency, especially in ceramic slurries with high solid contents. In this work, an in-situ photothermal dual crosslinking strategy, which capitalizes on the combined benefits of near-infrared photothermal energy, was proposed to realize precise and efficient direct ink writing of high solids ceramic slurries. The in-situ curing of ceramic slurries with an alumina content of up to 90 wt\% (74.5 vol\%) was successfully achieved by integrating photochemical and photothermal crosslinking strategies to recycle excess heat to enhance the energy utilization of near-infrared light. Under near-infrared irradiation (538.25 W/cm 2 , 3 s), the high solids ceramic photothermal dual curing slurry achieved a curing depth of 2.79 mm, which improved the printing rate and printing throughput compared with the photocuring slurry (2.34 mm) and the thermocuring slurry (0.98 mm). The sintered samples showed a sinter shrinkage of 8.85\% and relative density of 95.08\%. This method has great potential for application in the manufacturing of thick composite materials and high solid content slurry printing.},

So far, there are few demonstrations of wide-angle broadband absorption, due to the stringent impedance matching requirement. Here, inspired by the concept of log-periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) for broadband emission, we propose a wide-angle broadband absorption based on both indium tin oxide (ITO) material and judiciously engineered metapyramid geometry. The strip ITO arrays on the sidewalls of metapyramid follow the quasi-LPDA strategy for gradient impedance and expands significantly both angular and spectral operating bandwidth by a cascading of multiple electric and magnetic resonances, as revealed by the rigorous characteristic mode analysis. Our experimental results show that the exotic absorption reaches above 0.9 at 45° tilted incidence for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations across the band of 8 ∼ 18 GHz. Our strategy circumvents the issues of limited-angle operation, high costs and high weight raised by metal structures, providing a new paradigm toward wide-angle broadband metadevices.},

However, the specific strengthening mechanism of the cellular structure needs to be further researched. In this study, the microstructure and tensile properties of a composition-optimized Haynes 230 alloy fabricated by the LPBF method were systematically investigated. The post-heated HT1 and HT2 samples with different cellular and grain structures served as the reference. The results show that the micron-scale grain and submicron-scale cellular structures are present in the as-built (AB) sample. The cellular boundaries are characterized by solute Nb segregation and high-density dislocations. The tensile tests show that the AB sample illustrates excellent tensile properties with ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 1180.2 MPa, yield strength (YS) of 842.5 MPa and elongation (EL) of 29.3\%. The high YS mainly results from the strengthening effects of the cellular structure, which can be considered as a combination of dislocation and elemental segregation strengthening. The contribution of cellular structure to YS is much higher than that of GB strengthening. Furthermore, the deformation incompatibility of heterogeneous grain and cellular structures leads to high hetero-deformation induced (HDI) strengthening, which is also the primary reason for the abnormal upturn of strain hardening rate (SHR) in the AB sample.},

Additionally, the dissolution of S(Al 2 CuMg) into the Al- matrix is governed by the interdiffusion of (Mg, Cu atoms) and Al atoms. Notably, the θ(Al 2 Cu) phase plays a crucial role as an intermediate transition phase facilitating the dissolution of S(Al 2 CuMg) into the Al- matrix.

However, the mismatching deformation capacity between BNNS and hydrogels results in damage to the BNNS-hydrogels interface and deteriorates the tensile properties of BNNS reinforced hydrogels. By adopting nanotechnology, the brittle nature of BNNSs can be modified. A novel penta-BNNS exhibits pentagonal rings, presenting ductile behavior under tensile deformation. The tensile test is performed by molecular dynamics simulations. The simulation results show that the ultimate failure strain of the penta-BNNS is significantly increased, which is attributed to the structure transition of the pentagonal rings in the penta-BNNS under tensile deformation. Due to the structure transition, the deformation capacity of the penta-BNNS is significantly improved with respect to the hexa -BNNS.

This study proposes novel auxetic medical stents that aim to enhance critical parameters of biomedical stents. This includes load-bearing capacity, expanded opening percentage, and reduced recoil percentage. On this matter, the missing rib auxetic unit cell has been considered and geometrically modified to achieve these objectives. Two-dimensional (2D) metamaterials were fabricated through additive manufacturing technique and subjected to experimental testing. Then, finite element analysis (FEA) was employed to gain comprehensive insights into the mechanical behaviour of the proposed medical stents. Remarkably, an excellent correlation was observed between the FEA and experimental results, validating the high precision of the analysis. The findings reveal that the stents classified as “E-category” exhibit the highest final opening percentage while concurrently demonstrating the lowest recoil percentage. The base stent exhibited a relatively high recoil percentage of 15.56\%, indicating a significant amount of recoil or spring-back after deformation. In contrast, the modified “E-category” stent displayed a substantially lower recoil percentage of 1.62\%. This notable reduction in recoil percentage indicates that the modifications made to the rib-unit cells had a significant and beneficial effect on the stent&#39;s recoil behaviour and minimizing potential damage to arterial tissue during stent deployment (angioplasty) and balloon pressure. The modified design likely enhances the stent&#39;s ability to maintain its shape and resist recoil, making it more effective and reliable in its intended application. Additionally, more aspects of biomedical stents such as foreshortening, and dog-boning of the modified missing rib stents were meticulously examined through FEA.},

The ML-assisted EVS provided maxima distributions unaffected by the different sampling volumes.

The gripper comprises a magnetic control device and a spherical variable stiffness body. Simulation analysis was used to optimize its structure and enhance the efficiency ratio of the magnetic control device. The flexible variable stiffness body was initially designed to be cylindrical to increase interlocking with objects. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the gripping efficiency and adaptability of the magnetron spherical gripper, which were designed to simulate real-world application requirements. These results suggest that the magnetically controlled spherical gripper can achieve a gripping efficiency of approximately five and securely grasp objects with a relative bladder diameter ranging from 20\% to 130\%. Furthermore, it can stably grip objects up to an offset distance of 15 mm without requiring sensor assistance.

Subsequently, FS process parameter dependencies on the deposits have been investigated. The resulting optical appearance, geometry and microstructure of the deposits have been studied. A deeper surface topography was found to facilitate plasticising and therefore FS layer deposition. Defect-free layer-to-substrate (LTS) joints have been generated for all topographies showing a fine-grained recrystallized microstructure as well as flow lines in the AA6082 deposits following closely the substrate surface topography, whereas no metallurgical changes in the AISI4140 substrates have been detected. At the LTS interfaces , a correlation of flow lines to an increased occurrence of high angle grain boundaries is identified. Appearance, geometries and grain size ratios of the AA6082 deposits show a dependency on substrate surface topography. Although complete bonding was achieved in the LTS joints, no distinct diffusion zone or interfacial mixing was observed. Mechanical interlocking on the micro scale was detected only for the samples with ground substrate surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a representative fabrication process for micro 3D structures with a sub-micron fabrication resolution. As the TPL process is developed and commercialized, the TPL process requires higher process yield to be a considered reliable manufacturing technique for mass production. However, delamination is one of the main factors that reduce the yield of the TPL process. In this study, a double-step laser scanning method is proposed as a reliable high-yield TPS process to reduce the delamination effect. The method entails a simple process that polymerizes the initial interfacial layer between the structures and substrate twice. The additional laser scanning step induces a strong crosslinking in the polymer, and thereby preventing swelling and delamination. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the method is evaluated with large-scale microlens arrays. Although the process time is slightly increased, the process yield is significantly improved through the use of the double-step laser scanning method. Hence, the double-step laser scanning process can be employed as a reliable additive manufacturing process for various 3D microscale devices, and more importantly, it can be used to increase the manufacturing yield through the reduction of defects caused by surface delamination.},

The locally occurring temperature extremes and cooling rates determine solid-state phase fractions, material microstructure , texture, and ultimately the local material properties . As the shape of a part determines the local thermal history during AM, this offers an opportunity to influence these material properties through design. In this paper, we present a way to obtain desired properties by controlling the local thermal history. This is achieved through topology optimization of the printed part while considering its entire transient thermal history. As an example of this approach, this work focuses on high strength low alloy steels , where resulting phase fractions significantly influence mechanical properties such as yield strength and ductility. These solid-state phase fractions depend on cooling rates in a particular critical temperature range. The phase composition and hence the local yield strength in target regions can be controlled by constraining the cooling time in this range. Numerical examples illustrate the capability of the proposed approach in adapting part designs to achieve various desired material properties.},

In comparison, results showed that the average temperature of the powder model rises from 622.02 K to 880.88 K, and the cooling rate approximately increases from 10 6 K/s up to 10 7 K/s for the chessboard strategy. The chessboard strategy with a large scanning island yields the highest density (99.34\%). More homogeneous grain also nucleates due to the evident 〈1 1 1〉 micro-texture distribution. The refined microstructure achieved by the chessboard strategy with laser remelting leads to a superior combination of tensile strength (∼820 MPa) and elongation (∼30\%). Grain boundary strengthening and dislocations hardening are the dominant mechanisms of as-built Hastelloy X alloy.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the low-cost Mg-10Zn-1Al-0.5Cu-0.3Mn without or with the addition of MgCO 3 (labeled as S1 and S2 alloys) was successfully fabricated by a rapid-setting water-cooling method. The average grain size of the as-cast alloy decreased from 38.5 to 22.5 µm with the addition of MgCO 3 . S2 alloy possessed excellent ultimate tensile strength and elongation of 275.6 MPa and 17.5\% in the solid solution state, which were approximately 21.6 and 82.3\% higher than those of the S1 alloy. The transmission electron microscopy results showed that the MnAl 2 O 4 phase with a high melting point was formed in the melt of S1 alloy by adding 1 wt\% MgCO 3 , which had a phase relationship of (1 0 1)Mg||(3 1 1)MnAl 2 O 4 . Additionally, the results of edge-to-edge matching model showed that the MnAl 2 O 4 phase tended to grow on the Mg matrix phase. The results of the first-principles calculations exhibited that the (1 0 1)Mg||(3 1 1)MnAl 2 O 4 interface with MnO terminations was a strong interface. The MnAl 2 O 4 phase could be regarded as heterogeneous nucleation points to improve the nucleation rate and thus to refine the grain and enhance the strength. This study can vigorously provide a certain guide for the grain refinement of Mg-Zn based alloys containing Mn.},

  abstract     = {Photothermoelectric (PTE) devices have emerged as highly promising technological advancements in energy harvesting and electronics. However, the development of PTE devices faces challenges in achieving exceptional performance, adaptable flexibility, durable stability, and compatibility within a system. This study proposes a self-powered PTE device that operates at room temperature by integrating molybdenum carbide (Mo 2 C)/ Poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene)-poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) nanomaterials with a flexible poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate. We achieve precise control over the device size through a spray coating technique and employ a laser-involved mask technique for efficient fabrication. Our Mo 2 C/PEDOT: PSS devices demonstrate remarkable long-term stability and outstanding flexibility and can be folded and twisted without increasing performance degradation. The devices exhibit a responsivity of 4.2 V W −1 and a detectivity of 1.2 × 10 8 cm Hz 1/2 W −1 at 973 K black-body radiation. By employing these advantages, we integrate two potential systems—the motion tracking system and the non-destructive (NDT) imaging system—that showcase time-tracking of human radiation and high-resolution imaging. These promising platforms expand the potential of PTE technology into diverse applications, including industry, aerospace, public health, security, and wearable monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Micro-computed X-ray tomography (μCT) is a volumetric imaging tool used to quantify the internal structure of materials. μCT imaging with mechanical testing ( in situ μCT) helps visualize strain-induced structural changes and develop structure-property relationships. However, the effects on thermophysical properties of radiation exposure during in situ μCT imaging are seldom addressed, despite potential radiation sensitivity in elastomers . This work quantifies the radiation dosage effect on thermo-, chemical-, and mechanical-properties for a vinyl nitrile-based foam. Material properties were measured after (0, 1, 2, and 3) days at (8.1 ± 0.9) kGy/d. Morphological characteristics were investigated via scanning electron microscopy. Thermal transitions were assessed using differential scanning calorimetry . Viscoelasticity was measured with dynamic mechanical analysis over a range from -30 °C to 60 °C. Higher dose lead to stiffening and increased dissipation. Chemical structure was assessed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Soxhlet extraction was used to measure gel content. In summary, substantial changes occur in thermophysical properties, which may confound structure-property measurements. However, this also provides a modification pathway. Quantitation and calibration of the properties changes informed a finite element user material for material designers to explore tunablity and design optimization for impact protection engineers.},

Meanwhile, an unusual step-like stress–strain curve due to heterogeneous deformation bands including Lüders band and multiple Portevin–Le Chatelier (PLC) bands was investigated systematacially. The repeated heterogeneous deformation is due to a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The former refers a small stress concentration near the grip ends of the tensile sample, and the latter is associated with low density of initial mobile dislocations, limited capacity of mobile dislocation multiplication and the presence of meta -stable austenite. As for meta -stable austenite, stress-assisted martensite transformation (SAMT) was confirmed experimentally, which will facilitate strain concentration and the starting of heterogeneous deformation. Moreover, before strain-induced martensite transformation (SIMT), it is the plastic deformation of austenite grains through the slip of partial dislocation and stacking faults (SFs) that contributes to a larger Lüders strain. Finally, we propose that whether it is possible to make the heterogeneous deformation to be a positive side for certain working conditions, which may open new doors for the application of medium-Mn steels. We will continue to do some exploratory studies in this direction next.},

In this work, a self-delivery im mune ad enosine e ffector (designated as iMade) is fabricated to eliminate metastatic tumors via photodynamic activated immunotherapy. Among which, nano-sized iMade is composed of pyropheophorbide-a (Pyro) and imaradenant (AZD) through drug self-assembly without extra excipients. Interestingly, the uniform iMade exhibits favorable stability and dispersity, helping improve the drug delivery efficiency in tumor tissues and cells. Mechanistically, the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of iMade can not only inhibit tumor cell proliferation, but also act as an ICD trigger to induce the burst release of danger related molecular patterns (DAMPs). Successively, AZD is released from iMade to reduce the recognition of adenosine and A2AR for enhanced antigen presentation. Ultimately, iMade is demonstrated to efficiently suppress the growth of primary tumor in vivo , and simultaneously activate systemic immune response to reduce metastatic tumors while cause no obvious systemic side effects. Such a simple but efficient strategy might provide a promising combinatory for spatiotemporal tumor treatment.},

In this study, quasi-static and Progressive Repeated Loading (PRL) tests in compression have been performed on natural cork with a tensile machine. The elastic modulus was measured by a quasi-static compression test on cube or parallelepiped specimens considering different strain measurements methods: crosshead displacement, extensometer, and full field measurements method (Digital Image Correlation or DIC method). Regardless of the considered strain measurement method, the elastic modulus of cork remains in the same order of magnitude. The PRL test carried out at different nominal strains (3\%, 20\%, 46\%, 66\%, 80\%) highlighted the time dependant behaviour of cork (viscous properties). Moreover, a stiffening of the material was observed when increasing the strain at each loading/unloading cycle. Finally, the full field measurement following compression revealed the heterogeneity of the strain distribution on the cork external surface, resulting in localised regions of deformation. From the perspective of compression behaviour, these results lead to a new interpretation of cork which can be considered as a composite material.},

The results demonstrated that the self-development explosive welding was a suitable method for preparing Pt coatings, featuring a desirable undulating metallurgical interface. Two types of transition regions, namely the isolated zones and continuous layers, were formed at the wave interface, and their formation mechanisms were revealed. Besides, special attention was given to the frequent formed elliptic void in the isolated transition regions, and its formation mechanism was found to be combined actions of excessive shear instability and rapid cooling process. The multi-area EBSD analyses revealed diverse grain structures near the interface, such as formation of columnar grains in isolated transition region and small equiaxed grains in continuous melting layer. These grain characteristics provide strong supports for the interface formation mechanisms developed in this paper. Thus, this work enables to provide a new perspective for Pt coating preparation and improve the understanding of explosive welding process behavior.},

The effect of Gd on microstructure and mechanical properties of the CoCrFeNi MPEA is investigated. The addition of Gd to the CoCrFeNi base alloy leads to precipitation of a GdNi 5 -type phase with hexagonal structure (HS) and minor amounts of a Gd-rich oxide phase from the FCC matrix. Compared to the CoCrFeNi base alloy, the grain size of CoCrFeNiGd 0.05 is smaller, and the tensile yield strength of CoCrFeNiGd 0.05 significantly increases from 546 MPa to 859 MPa, along with minor sacrifices in plasticity where the elongation only slightly decreases from 20.8\% to 19.4\%. The enhanced strength of Gd-containing MPEA is mainly attributed to grain boundary strengthening from the ultrafine-grained microstructure and the precipitation strengthening contributed by the HS phase. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results demonstrate that the GdNi 5 -type intermetallic phase is coherent with the FCC matrix and shows the following orientation relationship: { 11 1 ¯ 111¯ }FCC//{ 2 ¯ 11 9 ¯ 2¯119¯ }HS. The high plasticity of the composite-structured CoCrFeNiGd 0.05 alloy is attributed to the homogenous distribution of the ultrafine HS phase and the coherent HS-FCC interface facilitating dislocation slipping.},

  abstract     = {Although the development of graphene broadband terahertz (THz) absorbers is relatively mature, studies focusing on modulating the absorption window remain limited. Existing research has mainly concentrated on achieving absorption window switching via the phase transition of materials like vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ). However, this method typically allows for switching within two specific windows, lacking the capacity for arbitrary and flexible regulation. This study introduces a novel approach involving a bilayer graphene metasurface absorber (BGMA) to address this limitation, which allows arbitrary manipulation of the absorption windows. To facilitate rapid and accurate selection of the structural parameters, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based inverse design method is employed, which achieves a tunable absorption bandwidth of 6.70 THz with an error amount to 0.59\%. Through in-depth mechanistic analyses, it is demonstrated that the BGMA can achieve tunable absorption between a low-frequency broadband absorption (L-FBA) mode and a high-frequency broadband absorption (H-FBA) mode. This tunability arises from the transition between graphene localized surface plasmon resonance and graphene surface plasmon resonance. Overall, the outcomes of this study underscore the remarkable tunable performance of the BGMA achieved through ANN-based inverse design. This innovation holds significant promise for applications in security detection, and object stealth.},

  abstract     = {Functionally graded polymer foams are advanced materials that exhibit great potential for applications in energy absorption, electromagnetic interference shielding, and high-elasticity due to the graded cellular structure for mechanical performance and functional properties enhancements. However, producing polymer foams with tailored gradient structures remains a significant challenge. Herein, a new microcellular foaming strategy with two-step adsorptions was developed to prepare thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) foams with gradient cellular structures. The TPU samples were saturated with low-pressure CO 2 in the first sorption stage and partially saturated with high-pressure CO 2 in the second sorption stage. By regulating CO 2 pressure in the first stage and adsorption duration in the second stage, TPU samples with gradient CO 2 concentrations were achieved, thereby leading to structure-gradient TPU foams. Finally, a prospective microcellular-macrocellular gradient foam with a cell size range of 30 μm to 400 μm was successfully prepared. The energy loss coefficient of structure-gradient TPU foam can be reduced by 21.5\% compared to that of the foam with uniform cellular structure. Structure-gradient TPU foams show significantly enhanced mechanical performance and elasticity, and the underlying mechanism was clarified. The super-elastic TPU foams with tailored gradient structures hold significant promise for broaden applications requiring lightweight, flexibility, and elasticity.},

  abstract     = {To obtain a fundamental understanding of mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and its prevention in advanced high-strength steels containing novel nanoscale mixed-metal precipitates, it is necessary to study local microstructure, H trapping, and crack path with new multiscale experimental and simulation approach. Spatially resolved hydrogen mapping via SKPFM is used together with investigation of the crack path using high-resolution EBSD and HMPT, and global trapping behavior of the alloys by TDS. These results are combined with newly introduced method to elucidate real-time distribution of hydrogen in the alloy using high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HES-XRD). Mixed-metal precipitates improves HE resistance of the alloy, due to nature of the trapping sites, e.g. irreversible H-trapping by carbon vacancies inside novel nanoprecipitates and high total length of PAGBs. This is because of lower possibility of build-up of critical local hydrogen content at PAGBs for intergranular hydrogen-assisted cracking due to hydrogen-enhanced decohesion mechanism. Less weakly trapped hydrogen also reduces frequency of dislocation activation and enhanced dislocation slip in {0 1 1} slip plane due to hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity in regions with affinity for transgranular hydrogen-assisted cracking at lower local hydrogen content. Direct evidence of carbon vacancies in novel nanoprecipitates is observed for the first time via HAADF-STEM.},

  abstract     = {Here, the effects of pre-precipitation annealing on the microstructural evolution and room-temperature mechanical properties of nickel-based ultra-thin strips after the subsequent high-temperature annealing were analyzed. By pre-precipitation annealing, discontinuous grain-boundary carbide was introduced into the cold-rolled 67 μm GH3600 nickel-based ultra-thin strips, which hindered the rapid migration of grain boundaries. Thus, the grain size was maintained at only 5.5 μm after holding at 1050 °C for 1 h, indicating that the high-temperature microstructure stability of the strips was significantly improved. Further, the phenomenon of local single-layer crystal and size effect caused by the abnormal coarsened grains, which were more than 100 μm in size during the single-stage high-temperature annealing (1050 °C for 1 h), was eliminated. Owing to the weakened free surface influence and an increase in the strengthening effect, such as grain boundary strengthening, as well as intragranular and intergranular back stress strengthening, the work hardening ability of the strips was enhanced after pre-precipitation annealing, thereby resulting in excellent comprehensive mechanical properties whose flow stress and elongation were 1.9 and 4.8 times those of single-stage high-temperature annealing. This study successfully provides an economical and easy-to-implement effective method to prepare solid-solution-strengthened high-performance ultra-thin superalloy strips.},

Despite prior studies on the deformation mode of expansion tubes have been conducted, the majority of them have relied on quasi-static load. This research has utilized theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches to concentrate on the behaviors of expansion tubes exposed to dynamic impacts. The experimental results show that the strain-rate effect and the downward velocity discrepancy could even cause the deformation mode transition of the expansion tube. The dynamic theoretical model of steady-state expansion force is derived and used to predict the normalized compressive force. A normalized compressive force more than 0.85 would promote buckling deformation of the expansion tube. The normalized compressive force is then used to predict the deformation mode diagrams of the expansion tube for a range of geometric parameters; this analysis reveals that the semi-angle, expansion rate, and radius/wall-thickness of the tube all play a role in determining the deformation mode, while the effect of length/radius is less evident. The expansion tube&#39;s buckling resistance is enhanced by the parent material&#39;s strain rate sensitivity and diminished by the strain hardening effect.},

The proposed methodology effectively removes the detection noise that inherently existed in EDS mappings, subsequently reinforcing the accuracy of the clustering analysis. The phase extraction procedure allows for obtaining the proportion of pores, reaction products, and unreacted solid precursors (SPs). Moreover, the component classification procedure enables further categorization of the reaction products and unreacted SPs. By analyzing the element ratios and shortest distances, the chemical compositions and spatial distributions of various reaction products could be revealed.

Given the variability of scan strategies in LPBF, optimizing the scan strategy to minimize residing spatters on powder bed is challenging but important. This study focuses on the correlation between the distribution of residing spatters, parts quality, and scan strategies (particularly scan direction and scan sequence here) under the influence of inert gas flow. A single lens reflex camera and image processing are employed to detect the distribution of spatters residing on the powder bed, providng unprecedented insight and valuable guidance for the design of scan strategy. The results reveal that the scan sequence against the gas flow induces fewer spatters residing on the powder bed. The large size residing spatters, with the diameter ranging from 80 μm to 210 μm, are concentrated along the scan direction in close proximity to the melting area. Scan sequence along the gas flow leads to rougher surface of the part, and more defects are formed between layers caused by spatter inclusions, which deteriorates the tensile properties obviously. It is recommended to employ orthogonal S-scanning strategy (S-45° with 90° layerwise rotation, scan sequence against gas flow) during the LPBF process. The selection of scanning parallel or perpendicular to the gas flow is dependent on the distribution of the surrounding processing areas, to ensure consistency of the parts quality.},

Although these drug-based therapies could stimulate the phagocytic clearance of ACs, the rapid drug clearance and poor bioavailability limited their efficacy. In this study, by co-loading AT and Met into poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticles (PLGA NPs), we developed a biomimetic nanocomplexes for targeted atherosclerosis treatment. Macrophages membrane-coated nanocomplexes efficiently avoided the clearance of NPs from immune system and achieved targeting ability to the atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, modified hyaluronic acid (HA) delivered NPs into the dysfunctional efferocytic cells of plaques, and achieved the plaques-macrophages-targeted therapy. In vitro results indicated that the biomimetic nanocomplexes reactivated efferocytosis by facilitating macrophages polarization from M1 to M2 phenotype through enhancing ERK5/MerTK pathway and inhibiting cellular senescence through inhibiting p53-p16/pRB pathway. In vivo study indicated that this biomimetic nanocomplexes accumulated in the atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in reduction of necrotic core area and protection against plaque rupture by reactivating efferocytosis.

Abnormal crosstalk between macrophages and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) is a key factor for unexpected clinical efficacy. Here, we reported a therapeutic strategy for the programmed intervention of macrophages and PDLSCs based on folic acid-modified liposome hydrogel composites loaded with genistein (FA-GEN-Lip@Gel). FA-GEN-Lip@Gel exhibited excellent thermos-sensitivity and injectability, could sustained-release genistein for more than 120 h. Flow cytometry showed that FA-GEN-Lip@Gel shifted macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. We further confirmed the anti-inflammatory mechanisms that FA-GEN-Lip@Gel regulate TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB axis in macrophages. In addition, FA-GEN-Lip@Gel could promote osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs via remodeling of cytokine secretion of IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α and IL-10 in macrophages, as verified by conditioned culture system. Therefore, FA-GEN-Lip@Gel significantly reduced periodontal inflammation in vivo according to ELISA, H&amp;E and immunofluorescence staining. Meanwhile, FA-GEN-Lip@Gel promoted alveolar bone regeneration by remodeling RANKL/OPG balance and increasing osteogenic markers of ALP, BMP2 and RUNX2. Altogether, this study develops a novel liposome-hydrogel composites that can be efficiently simultaneously boost inflammation resolution and osteogenic differentiation in periodontitis via modulating the crosstalk between macrophages and PDLSCs.},

In this study, four types of bioactive bioceramic, including hydroxyapatite (HA), strontium (Sr)-incorporated hydroxyapatite (Sr5-HA, Sr10-HA, Sr20-HA) with Sr ions concentrations of 0, 5, 10 and 20\%, were investigated for their osteogenic and angiogenic properties. The in vitro results showed that Sr-HA could enhance the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via Erk1/2 MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, and promote the proliferation and angiogenic gene expression of HUVECs via PI3K/AKT pathways. Moreover, HUVECs conditioned medium could apparently promote the osteogenesis of BMSCs, and BMSCs conditioned medium could enhance the angiogenic capacity of HUVECs. Furthermore, in vivo angiogenesis evaluation and bone formation estimation indicated that enhanced newly-formed vessels and new bone formation were observed in Sr-HA porous scaffolds compared to pure HA scaffold. Thus, this study suggests that Sr-incorporation is a promising modification strategy for bone implants to achieve enhanced angiogenic and osteogenic capacities.},

  abstract     = {Peri-implantitis is a highly prevalent disease caused by bacterial plaque that results in inflammation. The disease starts from the soft tissue and gradually spreads to the hard tissue around the implant. If left untreated, it can lead to decreased bone density and loss of the implant. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the antibacterial and biological activity of implants to achieve dual functions. In this study, we prepared a Ce-doped TiO 2 coating on the surface of pure titanium by micro-arc oxidation (MAO) for the prevention of peri -implantitis. We systematically investigated the physicochemical properties, antibacterial activity, and biocompatibility of Ce-doped coatings in vitro and in vivo . The results demonstrated that the increase of Ce concentration in the coating could increase the proliferation, adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro . Results from in vivo osteogenesis experiments demonstrated that the 2Ce-MAO coating exhibited superior efficacy in promoting implant repair in osteoporotic rats. Furthermore, the results of in vitro and in vivo antibacterial experiments indicated that the Ce-TiO 2 coating exhibits excellent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. These findings suggest that the Ce-TiO 2 coating prepared via MAO may be a promising approach for preventing peri -implantitis and promoting osteogenesis in osteoporosis.},

  abstract     = {Osteolytic lesions of bone tumors lead to stress-induced loss of load-bearing bones, making it difficult to treat tumors and repair bone tissue structures. Magnetic hyperthermia has become an effective minimally invasive treatment for malignant bone tumors without depth limitations. However, the effectiveness of magnetic heat therapy alone is not satisfactory, and if combined with chemotherapy, it can lead to significant systemic side effects. It is important to efficiently target chemotherapy substances to the correct area for combined therapy. We have developed a biomimetic bone magnet (BBM) that uses polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement-loaded permanent magnet materials with good support performance to create an intrinsic tumor magnetic field. This magnetic field has magnetothermal properties and collects drug-loaded magnetic phase change nanoparticles (mCNPs) circulating in the blood for magnetothermally triggered chemotherapy. Moreover, PMMA has good mechanical properties, providing potential stress support for bone reconstruction after bone tumor treatment. Importantly, both in vivo and in vitro experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of magnetic hyperthermia through minimally invasive injection of BBM phase transition. This new method achieves magnetic targeting by manufacturing tumor biomagnets to generate strong magnetic fields within the tumor, which opens up new avenues for treatment strategies for malignant bone tumors.},

This study aims to compare the novel scaffold-driven double-barrel approach with the DBFF method, and investigate the biomechanical behavior of 3D-printed porous titanium scaffolds with varying design parameters. The mandibular reconstruction model underwent FEA in two surgery phases, under two experimental loads and two design parameters. The experimental scaffold design was categorized into 9 groups based on the porous diameters (D P = 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm) and strut diameters (D S = 0.4 mm,0.5 mm,0.6 mm). The results illustrated that the stress in fibula, cortical and trabecular bones for all groups were within the ranges of normal physiological levels. The porous scaffolds effectively transmit mechanical stimulation, resulting in bone graft materials achieving up to 99.9\% strain, with low stiffness to avoid stress shielding. The study revealed that the design parameters of Group B and Group F were more conducive to meeting biomechanical demands and promoting bone regeneration. This study presents scientifically proven and effective clinical solution for restoring both function and aesthetics of mandibular defects, while also providing valuable insights for future design criteria in bone regeneration scaffolds.},

Enzymatic sensors are frequently utilized, but they have challenges of enzyme degradation and indirect charge transfer through a redox mediator, which affect their reusability and shelf life. Here, enzyme-free nickel oxide thin film electrode in an alkaline medium is used to enable direct charge transfer with glucose. A chemical reaction between glucose and the electrode surface occurs, leading to an additional oxidation (Ni +2 /Ni +3 ) of the electrode under external bias. Additionally, the colorimetric analysis further validated this reaction through the transformation of a dark-colored NiO (Ni +3 ) electrode into a bleached color state (reduced from Ni +3 to Ni +2 ) through the oxidation of glucose. As the glucose concentrations increase to 5 mM, the color of the electrode is no longer optically readable (ΔT\% ∼ 66\%). The corresponding amperometric response is determined with a detection limit of 2 μM and a 3579 μA mM −1 cm −2 sensitivity, and it also recognizes a passive response to other interfering species and facilitates its one-month shelf life. Additionally, a two-electrode electrochemical colorimetric liquid cell-type glucose sensor has been designed to pave the way for future applications.},

Microstructural features act as pinning sites for the motion of magnetic domain walls (DWs) leading to changes in the magnetization of the sample. This phenomenon is the basis for industrially relevant non-destructive Barkhausen noise (BN) technique. With magnetic force microscopy (MFM), using bulk samples, and Lorentz microscopy, using thin films, we noticed that bulk and thin samples have similar domain structure still giving different BN signal amplitudes. We could explain an in-plane DW movement under out-of-plane applied magnetic field using anisotropy energetics. In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in Lorentz mode was used to visualize the motion of DWs and their interactions with different pinning sites. To help the interpretation of DW motions, alignment and denoising processes were tailored for in-situ TEM studies. Multi-instrumental and multidimensional structural analysis enabled us to visualize and verify many theoretical hypotheses related to the origin of BN signal in ferrite and ferrite-pearlite steels.},

ODS FeCrAl alloy with nominal composition Fe-12Cr-6Al-0.3Zr-0.3Y 2 O 3 was produced into a thin-walled tube via high-precision tube rolling. A portion of the as-received (AR) tube was subjected to a full recrystallization heat treatment. Both variants were subjected to burst testing at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Severe Accident Test Station. The recrystallized tube exhibited burst temperature margins 200 °C higher than that of C26M, whereas the AR tube only achieved burst properties comparable to the wrought FeCrAl alloy. The burst experiments were simulated in the BISON finite element code through the development of new viscoplastic material databases for each heat treatment condition, informed by high temperature tensile tests of tube specimens and existing literature data on creep mechanisms. Finally, an ODS FeCrAl burst criterion was obtained using simulated burst experiments across the entire range of test conditions.},

However, the 3D penta-mode exploration is still limited to traditional diamond lattice. Here, we propose a novel 3D penta-mode metamaterial design whose geometry is based on truncated octahedron. The configurations of regular truncated octahedron (RTO) and transformed truncated octahedron (TTO) exhibit isotropic and anisotropic penta-mode property, respectively. By introducing the modular origami and boundary constrains, a transformable penta-mode design metamaterial between RTO and TTO configurations is proposed. The tunable anisotropy of the penta-mode is experimentally demonstrated, based on which we analyze the effective acoustic impedance and wave velocity, and illustrate their ability to manipulate the amplitude and wavefront of acoustic waves. Our findings offer a wider 3D transformable penta-mode metamaterial flatform to achieve the tunable control of acoustic wave in fluids.},

Currently, stroke is treated mainly by thrombolysis, and treatment for its complications, and treatment for pathological processes within the stroke lesion is lacking. This is mainly because most drugs are unable to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to reach the site of injury to exert their therapeutic effects. Therefore, this study aims to develop biomimetic nanocladding devices capable of crossing the BBB, targeting the site of injury, and blocking the pathological process. Since the injury site is a highly inflammatory area, we selected the apoptotic body membrane (ABm) of activated T cells with inflammatory targeting ability to prepare biomimetic nanocladding devices (BND) and use them as the carriers to carry catalase (CAT) (BND-CAT) for the treatment of stroke rats. The results show that BND can not only target inflammatory lesions, but also regulate the transformation of microglia subtypes, thereby inhibiting inflammation within the lesions. In addition, BND-CAT could also inhibit oxidative stress, protect the mitochondria, increase the ATP content in the lesion, suppress the endoplasmic reticulum stress, and ultimately inhibit the apoptosis of neurons in the lesion.},

To address these drawbacks, we here report Lipo-PTO as the prototype of a new class of liposome-functionalized photothermal theragnostic agents, which can eradicate cancer cells in vivo with high selectivity. Lipo-PTO is activated by low pH and superoxide (O 2 •– ) to specifically deliver and convert preloaded cyanine molecules to release Cy-NH in the tumour microenvironments, eventually enabling the activation of photothermal properties to induce tumour ablation. In further studies on Lipo-PTO for treating breast cancer (BC) in mouse models, Lipo-PTO usage was characterized by a high degree of biocompatibility, optimal retention time pharmacokinetics and tumour regression with minimal collateral damages. This study here thus illustrates an innovative strategy to target intrinsic attributes of tumour microenvironments for improved therapeutic precision and efficacy in PTT applications.},

The QSGS algorithm is utilized to construct a two-dimensional digital structure of the porous media, enabling the determination of effective thermal conductivity through LBM simulations. The simulation results demonstrate good agreement with experimental data, exhibiting a maximum relative error of only 1.7\%. The study examines the influence of key factors on effective thermal conductivity, including temperature, porosity, fiber distribution, and fractal dimension. The effective thermal conductivity increased by approximately 6.1\% for each 10 °C increase in temperature between 10 °C and 50 °C. Moreover, the effective thermal conductivity showed an average decrease of 16.3\% with each 10\% increment in porosity. The increase in thermal conductivity becomes more significant with increasing temperature and decreasing porosity. Conversely, an increased fractal dimension correlates with a decline in effective thermal conductivity. The effective thermal conductivity is influenced synergistically by the directional growth probability of the solid phase and the direction of heat flow. The findings offer valuable insights into thermal conductivity behavior and heat transfer mechanisms in plant fiber porous media.},

  abstract     = {A new formulation is presented that extends the material distribution topology optimization method to address boundary-effect-dominated problems, where specific boundary conditions need to be imposed at solid–fluid interfaces. As an example of such a problem, we focus on the design of acoustic structures with significant viscous and thermal boundary losses. In various acoustic applications, especially for acoustically small devices, the main portion of viscothermal dissipation occurs in the so-called acoustic boundary layer. One way of accounting for these losses is through a generalized acoustic impedance boundary condition. This boundary condition has previously been proven to provide accurate results with significantly less computational effort compared to Navier–Stokes simulations. To incorporate this boundary condition into the optimization process at the solid–fluid interface, we introduce a mapping of jumps in densities between neighboring elements to an edge-based boundary indicator function. Two axisymmetric case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design optimization method. In the first case, we enhance the absorption performance of a Helmholtz resonator in a narrow range of frequencies. In the second case, we consider an acoustically larger problem and achieve an almost-perfect broadband absorption. Our findings underscore the potential of our approach for the design optimization of boundary-effect-dominated problems.},

  abstract     = {The compressive residual stress field (CRSF) relaxes during the fatigue crack growth (FCG) process, and the pattern of this relaxation remains unclear. Residual stress (RS) relaxation leads to a change in residual stress intensity factor (RSIF), which significantly affects the fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) and thus affects the assessment of fatigue crack growth rate. To this end, this work designed a series of experiments to explore the FCG behaviour in compressive residual stress fields (CRSFs) by considering RS relaxation. Firstly, shot peening(SP) treatments were conducted on the specimens. Then, residual stress fields (RSFs) at different crack propagation stages were measured to analyse the relationship between surface RS and inner RSF distribution. The derived weight function and the real-time RSF are combined to calculate the RSIF with/without considering RS relaxation. Finally, the effect of RS relaxation on the accuracy of FCGR assessment was investigated. The results show that the positive effect of CRS on the fatigue performance of the peened specimens is primarily embodied in the early stage of the FCG process. With the continuous relaxation of the CRSF, the difference in FCGR between the peened and unpeened specimens gradually decreases and tends to disappear. When the applied SIFs are large enough, the CRS would completely relax, and the inhibiting effect of CRSF on FCGR would fail. The proposed method in this work can effectively predict the FCGR of the peened specimen when considering the RS relaxation.

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is an emerging new paradigm in the production of industrial parts since it allows the fabrication of near-net shape products directly from designs, which is impossible with conventional manufacturing techniques. However, hot cracking phenomena in AM are a critical issue with non-weldable alloys, rendering manufactured parts unusable. There are solutions to this problem, such as alloying Hf with non-weldable Ni-based superalloys to improve cracking resistibility. Although this solution was proposed a few decades ago, the mechanisms of how Hf could prevent hot cracking in Ni-based superalloys have not been clarified in detail, until now. In this study, we revealed the Hf-driven microstructural changes in direct-laser-deposited Ni-based superalloys using various characterization techniques and phase-field simulations. Moreover, the calculated thermal strain and cracking susceptibility decreased with the Hf addition. The results demonstrated that Hf induced specific solidifying processes and resulting microstructural changes that are advantageous to the prevention of hot cracking.},

The strengthening mechanism of the composite material under three cooling rates was analyzed, and the failure mechanism of the composite material was elucidated by means of in-situ tension and EBSD testing. The results showed that increasing the cooling rate simultaneously refined the grains, secondary dendrites, and eutectic silicon, resulting in improved distribution uniformity of SiC and the stacking fault density of eutectic silicon. Additionally, the relationship between the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) and cooling rate (v) of the SiCP/A359 composite was described using the equation SDAS = 56.02v^(-0.3). There was a positive correlation between cooling rate and yield strength, with particle strengthening being the main contributor to the strength of composites with high cooling rates, resulting in significantly higher strength than samples with low cooling rates. The geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) density at the eutectic Si-Al boundary was found to be higher than other positions after the material was loaded, and the main crack propagated mainly along the eutectic region. Secondary cracks, including SiC cracking, eutectic silicon cracking, interface separation, and shrinkage cracking, may become part of the main crack by bridging.},

This was accomplished by using a 2-dimensional data correlation method for nano-indentation, EBSD and ab initio data, as well as EDS for phase separation in a multi-phase material. Here, a single-phase Fe-24Ni-0.4C austenitic steel and a two-phase Fe-9.5Ni-0.5Co Seymchan meteorite were used as example materials. In a first step, the combination of high-speed nano-indentation mapping data with elemental and orientation distribution maps allowed the estimation of indentation moduli along specific crystal surface planes normal directions, (0 0 1), (0 1 1) and (1 1 1) using a least squares optimisation based on starting values from DFT or experimentally determined stiffness tensors. A second global optimisation step to estimate the single crystal stiffness tensor using pre-solved solution parameters of the Vlassak-Nix equations yielded reasonable correspondence between the experimentally determined stiffness tensors from correlative nano-indentation data and other methods. The presented method demonstrates generally the possibility to derive directionally sensitive elastic properties from high-speed nano-indentation for cubic materials statistically.},

With the addition of copper increasing from 0\% to 1.0\%, and then 2.6\%, the strength increment of peak-aged alloys due to precipitation strengthening increases from 274.8 MPa to 329.3 MPa, and then 343.0 MPa. Based on the copper-induced change of the parameters of clusters, GPI zones and η′ precipitates coexisting in the aged alloys, the enhanced precipitation strengthening has been discussed in detail by considering their coherent, modulus and short-order strengthening. In the alloy without copper, the coherent strengthening from η′ precipitates play a main role in precipitation strengthening. In copper-containing alloys, the contribution of clusters to strengthening become significant. The addition of copper decreases coherent strengthening and modulus strengthening from η′ precipitates, but increases modulus strengthening from GPI zones and clusters, and short-range order strengthening from clusters more apparently, and consequently enhances strength of the alloys after aging.},

However, the lack of knowledge on atomic segmentation and SRO during solidification process has hindered the design and synthesis of HEAs. Herein, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations combined with Mont Carlo calculations on FeCoNiCuAl HEA to investigate the SRO and atomic segregation during solidification process. Our findings reveal that the BCC phase exhibit stronger competitiveness during homogeneous crystallization. The SRO and atomic segregation are driven by the enthalpy of mixing for unlike atomic pairs, resulting in an energetically favorable atomic configuration and structure distribution. In the solidified FeCoNiCuAl system, Al-Fe pairs are favored in BCC phase while Co-Ni pairs dominate in the FCC phase. Cu tends to segregate at the edge of the FCC phase without forming intermetallic compounds with other elements. Furthermore, optimized atomic configuration and structure distribution at 700 K and 500 K are not energy-favorable at 300 K, indicating that atomic segregation in the HEA occur throughout the crystallization process. These findings hold significant implications for the design and preparation of HEAs with desirable structures and properties.},

In this study the metal-matrix composites (MMC) of Ti-6Al-4V alloy reinforced with light and hard particles of TiC (up to 80\%, vol.) were made using blended elemental powder metallurgy of hydrogenated titanium. Post-sintering solution treatment for 45 min. at 880 °C and 1000 °C and water quenching followed by the 5 hrs. aging at 550 °C was used to additionally refine the microstructure and properties of MMC. For the duration of thermal exposure throughout solution treatment and additional aging the matrix and reinforcement phase underwent distinct structural changes that modified the mechanical properties of materials. It has been shown that the used reinforcement presents an exceptional opportunity for hardening of Ti-based composites without compromising their low specific weigh. It can increase the hardness of material by more than 40\% due to the ability of TiC to chemically react with the matrix to form a strong interfacial bond and its ability to form hard compounds of Ti 2 C and Ti 3 AlC in the expense of the relatively soft matrix alloy.},

Here, we propose for the first time a green and facile route to synthesize europium-complex-based hybrid materials by using micrometer-sized hydroxyapatite (HAP). Simultaneous formations of the europium complex and monetite took place after the reaction. Not only did HAP function as an eco-friendly alkaline reagent, but it also acted as a matrix to disperse the europium complexes. The quantum yield and lifetime of the as-synthesized hybrid materials are comparable to that of pure europium complex prepared by using traditional base reagents. Furthermore, versatile applications of the hybrid materials are also demonstrated in our proof-of-concept experiments, including bone tissue engineering, luminescent toys, and portable luminescent chalks. Notably, the proposed eco-friendly strategy is also applicable to other types of lanthanide-complexes-based hybrid materials.},

However, the complex interaction between microstructure evolution and oxidation in a tribolayer obscures the formation mechanisms of nanolamellar oxidation and transformation. In this paper, samples of tribolayers at different oxidation stages were prepared by a focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out method. The dynamic evolution process and distribution of oxides in tribolayers during the dry sliding process were analyzed by characterization and molecular dynamics simulation. The nanolamellar oxidation processes and the effects of oxide nanoparticles on self-lubricating behavior were investigated. The results showed that oxygen diffused into the nanolamellae, resulting in continuous oxidation and the formation of an oxide/metal interface. The nanolamellar oxides were broken and refined in the further friction process and eventually transformed into oxide nanoparticles. The oxidation process was influenced by frictional shear, and the growth of oxides proceeded along the direction parallel to the nanolamellae with high-density dislocations. The above results provide a theoretical basis for the next step to improve the wear resistance and corrosion inhibition of metals by designing lamellar structures.},

This method has been proven to provide reliable results for both HEA materials, including the CoCrFeMnNiTi0.3 HEA composition which was found to be inherently brittle and contained both σ-phase and Laves phase compounds with a hardness close to 14 GPa and a soft FCC phase.

From empirical correlations and finite element analysis (FEA), the calculated value for m ranged from 0.0333 to 0.0359, thus evidencing that the FEA simulations provide an accurate and suitable means of capturing the deformation behaviour of such alloys when subjected to shearing.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic composite sheets loaded with carbonyl iron powders (CIP) are widely used due to their high-efficiency microwave attenuation at very thin thickness because of their outstanding permeability and magnetic loss. However, their performance varies dramatically at various incident angles and polarization modes, namely transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes. In this study, it is demonstrated that two-dimensional (2D) patterning could offer an effective solution for achieving wide-angle performance in both TE and TM modes. Different shapes of the 2D patterns (circles, hexagons, and cross-holes) are investigated and their dimensions are optimized through full-wave simulation. The consistent results with the experiment reveal that these 2D patterns with optimized dimensions could improve TM mode performance significantly to above 20 dB attenuation for an oblique incident angle up to about 40°, thanks to the resulted field resonance revealed by simulation. Due to the improved TM mode performance, the patterned composite sheet could exhibit almost identical high-efficiency attenuation in both modes, becoming polarization-insensitive. The performance improvement also comes with a ∼16\% reduction in weight. Given these merits and the ease of fabrication, the low-profile and robust 2D patterned magnetic composite sheets could attract great attenuation in practical applications for wide-angle and polarization-insensitive microwave attenuation.},

A Cu-1.0Cr-0.4Zn-0.1Zr-0.05Si alloy was designed and the combining effects of Zn and Si elements on the microstructure and high-temperature mechanical properties of the alloy were studied. The tensile strength of the alloy at room temperature was 556 MPa, and it was 349 MPa at 500℃ with a softening temperature of 620℃. The main strengthening phases of the alloy were submicron Cr 3 Si and nano-scaled Cr-rich precipitates. The Zn elements were uniformly solid-solved in the Cu matrix, and the addition of Zn and Si elements significantly retarded the phase transformation of the Cr-rich precipitates. Thermodynamics and kinetics analysis showed that Zn and Si elements promoted the dispersive precipitation of the nano-scaled FCC coherent Cr-rich precipitates by reducing the nucleation energy barrier, while the Si and Zr elements inhibited the coarsening of the Cr-rich precipitates by enriching at the phase boundaries, effectively impeding dislocation motion and grain boundary migration, which mainly contributed to good high-temperature strength and resistance to softening of the Cu-Cr-Zn-Zr-Si alloy.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) composed of multiple principal elements have attracted considerable interest in recent decades as a new class of metallic materials. Among them, the equi-atomic CoCrFeMnNi HEA system has great potential for application as a structural material due to its excellent properties in various fields, but it has a drawback of relatively low yield strength (YS) at room temperature. Here, for the first time, we propose the bake hardening (BH) as a breakthrough to overcome the relatively inferior YS of the CoCrFeMnNi HEA system. We found that the carbon-added CoCrFeMnNi HEAs are not only bake-hardenable, but also exhibit unprecedented BH responses than conventional bake-hardenable materials, with BH responses up to 120.0 MPa depending on the carbon concentration in the matrix. It is the outcome of the mutual synergistic effect between the massive solid solution strengthening characteristic from lattice distortion of the HEAs and the Cottrell atmosphere generated during the BH process. This study demonstrates that the carbon-added CoCrFeMnNi HEAs are more advantageous to apply the BH effect than conventional bake-hardenable materials, which suggests the possibility of industrialization of various interstitial HEA systems as well as carbon-added CoCrFeMnNi HEAs.},

  abstract     = {One of the long-term concerns regarding titanium alloy wires involves microstructural inhomogeneity, mechanical instability and product unreliability in service. In this study, a strategy of micro-alloying was utilized to address the issue in Ti-6Cr-5Mo-5V-4Al (Ti6554) β -titanium alloy wires. The microstructures and mechanical properties of Ti6554 hot-rolled wires were optimized through boron (B) additions. The results manifest that B-addition promotes microstructural homogenization of wires, wherein the microstructure nearly completely consists of normal grain region (NGR) without abnormal grain region (AGR) like that in the B-free alloys. This microstructural homogenization relieves mechanical fluctuation amongst different samples and renders plastic flow highly repeatable upon stretching. Meanwhile, B-addition strengthens wires whilst maintains decent ductility and thereby achieves the better combination of strength and ductility in comparison with that in the B-free wires. The analyses indicate that the addition of B facilitates the universal occurrence of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) to form NGRs at the expense of AGRs, which is beneficial to microstructural homogenization of hot-rolled wires. A good plastic accommodation resulting from NGRs and strengthening caused by TiB laths endow Ti6554 wires superior strength-ductility synergy. These findings provide helpful guidance for microstructural and performance optimization of titanium alloy wires.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a novel Sc/Zr/Ti/Er-modified 2219 aluminum alloy was designed and wall-shaped components were then fabricated by wire-arc directed energy deposition (DED). Due to the heterogeneous nucleation promoted by primary Al 3 X dispersoids, the as-deposited alloy exhibits a highly equiaxed fine grain structure. Two heat treatment schedules were conducted to tailor the strength and thermal stability of the alloy. Compared with the classical T6 heat treatment, the additional homogenization step before the T6 heat treatment (HT6) prefabricated more Al 3 X dispersoids, which indirectly promoted the transition from θ″ precipitates to θ′ precipitates, resulting in a slight reduction in strength. However, this homogenization step helps to avoid the aggregation of pores by promoting pores ripening and significantly alleviates the anisotropy of ductility. In addition, the better thermal stability of the HT6 heat treated alloy is due to more Al 3 X dispersoids and finer θ′ precipitates with high coarsening resistance caused by the segregation of Sc and Mn at the θ′/Al interface during thermal exposure. In general, the wire-arc DEDed micro-alloyed 2219 Al alloy exhibits a promising combination of strength and ductility after heat treatment and its mechanical properties are superior to those of the wrought micro-alloyed Al-Cu alloys.},

Three steels with different alloying element contents underwent Q&amp;P processing, resulting in multiphase microstructures rich in retained austenite . High cycle fatigue tests and analysis of fatigue fracture surfaces were performed using SEM and EBSD techniques. The results indicate satisfactory high cycle fatigue performance in Q&amp;P treated martensitic stainless steels, surpassing traditional counterparts. Fatigue cracks predominantly form and propagate along martensite packet and block boundaries, while prior austenite grain boundaries and MnS inclusions have minimal influence on fatigue crack formation and growth. Microplastic deformation at the fatigue crack tip enhances local KAM values and triggers localized transformation of retained austenite grains. It is hypothesized that the developed Q&amp;P treated martensitic stainless steels exhibit improved resistance to low cycle fatigue.},

However, due to notable differences in the capabilities of these techniques, researchers often encounter difficulties in selecting the appropriate glass feedstock or determining the optimal/complementary strategy for achieving a specific production task with desired resolution, accuracy, and efficiency. To shed light on potential solutions, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that covers subtractive, additive, and formative manufacturing of functional micro/nanostructures using the broadest forms of glass feedstocks (including blocks, powders, and precursors). Initiating with a complete technical classification, the fundamentals, developments, and recent breakthroughs in micro/nanostructuring of glass are comprehensively outlined. Subsequently, the essential features (including spatial resolution, surface finish, accuracy, and efficiency) of the collected glass micro/nanomanufacturing techniques are comparatively evaluated, followed by detailed discussions of their capabilities and current challenges. Finally, future prospects are summarized to highlight potential opportunities and directions in glass micro/nanofabrication. This review will offer a panoramic guideline to the selection and innovation of glass materials and processing strategies for application-oriented precision and efficient manufacturing of diverse glass-based functional micro/nanostructures.},

In this study, a novel, simple and low-cost sandwich structure is assembled. The carbon fiber/reduced graphene oxide/polydimethylsiloxane (CF/rGO/P) with excellent compression electrical properties is used as the intermediate layer, and the flexible polyvinylidene fluoride/rGO/P (PV/rGO/P) is used as the upper and lower layers. A composite assembled graphene sponge column with outer pressure resistance and middle compression resistance is prepared. Results show that this composite sponge has a small resistance(30–100 Ω/cm). Under 60\% compression deformation, the resistance sensitivity could reach 36.44. The physical adsorption of methylene blue (MB) dye has reached more than 93.7\% after 24 h, and the electrochemical adsorption rate is 3.12 times faster than the physical adsorption rate. This sandwich assembly structure exhibits an excellent positive synergistic effect, maintaining high adsorption and desorption properties for MB dyes under high compression cycles. It can be applied to the recovery of cationic dyes in the dynamic flow waste liquid, thereby broadening the application of hydrogel graphene nanosponge in the field of environmental protection.},

  abstract     = {New composites with high energy dissipation and self-healing properties are required for structural materials, textiles, and protective equipment. This paper proposes a cross-scale strategy to design sacrificial bond composites (SBCs) using non-linear adhesive materials, like self-assembled proteins or mechanical adhesives, placed between opposite-facing magnets. Upon external loads, SBCs effectively dissipate deformation energy across their sacrificial bond interfaces following a biomimetic toughening mechanism similar to nacre’s. When the external load breaks the sacrificial bonds of a SBC, the opposite-facing magnets brings together the separated interface, allowing the reforming of its sacrificial bonds and the self-repairing of the composite after sustaining large strains. After mechanical failure at 600\% strain, the consensus tetratricopeptide repeat (CTPR) protein films allows protein-based SBCs to recover 70\% of their original tensile strength after letting their sacrificial bonds to reassemble for 1 h, at room temperature, in the presence of moisture. Mechanical adhesive-based SBCs, after their mechanical failure at 325\% strain, are able to self-repair faster, regaining 85\% of their tensile strength in less than 1 s. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the fabrication of a reusable and lightweight fall arrest system exploiting mechanical adhesive interfaces and a protein-polyester yarn for the creation of high-energy dissipating textiles.},

Subsequently, RS redistribution with crack growth is studied by two groups of specimens with gradually decreased distances between notch tip and weld centerline, and its influence on FCG is linked to crack closure and applied load. The results show that RS redistribution mainly depends on the distance from crack tip to weld centerline, and RS at a crack tip is always compressive during fatigue cycling. In addition, the length of contacted crack wake gradually increases at the beginning of FCG (crack closure effect), which decreases FCG rate together with compressive RS at a crack tip.},

However, the inevitable contact and friction between catheters and complex human channels usually lead to severe patient burdens. A fabrication strategy for variable-stiffness catheters based on time-dependent helical flow was developed by regulating the alignment of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanorods in polyolefin elastomer (POE) catheters. In particular, the uniaxial and off-axial alignments of the TiO 2 nanorods were manipulated to adjust the mechanical properties of each section in the POE catheters, where the processing flow pattern was transformed from axial to helical. To achieve the desired performance in practical applications, two catheters with a programmable helix angle of embedded TiO2 nanorods along the axial direction were designed. Correspondingly, the as-designed catheters displayed remarkably reduced interventional loads (e.g., a maximum reduction of 49.3\% and 39.7\% in single- and multi-curvature channels, respectively) and an enhancement of 50\% in rotation synchronization, indicating promising potential for application in catheter-assisted interventional therapy.

Previous studies have examined the mechanical performance of solders with manufacturing-induced voids typically by generating excessive voids intentionally using simulation analysis without/insufficient experimental results. Electronic assembly standards such as IEC 61191-2, J-STD-001G, and IPC-A-610G do not cover voiding due to conflicting opinions and insufficient experimental evidence. In this context, comprehensive experimental results are needed to verify simulation results and assist in setting the standard. Silicon-based Power MOSFET packages with different locations, sizes, and patterns of pre-existing voids with nearly the same percentage of voids (30–33\%) have been chosen to address this critical issue. The Power MOSFET test samples underwent power cycling-based accelerated degradation testing at various stress levels and monitored the location and rate of solder degradation at specific time intervals. It is found that small dispersive voids in solder life are useful, but clusters can accelerate damage propagation. Contrary, large dispersive voids at the edges initiate solder damage, reducing solder life. Our experimental investigation findings indicate that pre-existing voids&#39; positions, sizes, and patterns should be considered when establishing solder void inspection standards. This would improve power devices&#39; reliability for end-user power supply and control.},

However, this research aims to provide, for the first time, a comprehensive overview of the recyclability of carboxylated nitrile rubber (XNBR), spotlighting changes in molecular dynamics through multiple recycling cycles beyond tensile tests. A uniquely recyclable XNBR, incorporating ZnO as a multifunctional additive, was designed alongside a simple, scalable, two-step recycling process. Evidence of the delicate balance between crosslink density and molecular entanglements that affects the dynamics of the recycled material was found. Recycling also restricts the molecular dynamics near ionic domains; attributed to a higher crosslink density (from 3.69 × 10 - 5 3.69×10-5 mol cm −3 in the pristine sample to 6.00 × 10 - 5 6.00×10-5 mol cm −3 after the third cycle), caused by a decreased ionic clusters size (aggregation number drops from 12.2 to 6.9). Remarkably, negligible differences ( &lt; 10\% &amp;lt;10\% ) in compressive fatigue behavior and an enhanced chemical resistance in different solvents (up to 350\% 350\% increase in motor oil) were also observed, ensuring suitable performance in conditions closer to service. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of XNBR recycling and provides a broad understanding of this material at the molecular level.},

  abstract     = {Noncarbon support materials (NCSMs) used in the membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) have received extensive attentions due to their better chemical stability, excellent corrosion resistance and high electrical conductivity. To develop high-quality MEA, great efforts have been devoted to improving the electrochemical performance and durability of MEAs through the surface engineering of NCSMs. With this context, the recent progress of the NCSMs as catalyst support and diffusion layer is summarized. The functional mechanisms and critical roles of NCSMs in MEAs are firstly discussed in terms of the structure-functions relationship. The design strategies and fabrication process based on different noncarbon materials (e.g., metal-based materials and carbides) as catalyst supports are summarized from the perspective of nanoscale structures like nanoparticles, nanofibers, and nanotubes. The structural design and surface modification of the noncarbon materials applied to the diffusion layer and stack-level MEA are also analyzed. Finally, the current limitations, prospective and future development tendency of NCSMs in MEA are proposed. This review is believed to provide an in-depth overview and promising research directions for the design of catalyst supports in fuel cells.},

In this paper, the geometric voxel construction method is used to heterogeneity model the thermal conductivity of a cement-based diatomite/silica aerogel composite (DSAC), and thermal conductivity simulations are carried out using a heat conduction model framework analogous to an electrical resistance model framework. The simulation results show that the simulated thermal conductivities of cementitious DSAC materials with different DSAC composite contents agree well with the corresponding experimental values. The saturated thermal conductivity of the cementitious DSAC material is 2.5 times the dry thermal conductivity at 28 d. This shows that the thermal conductivity model proposed in this paper can effectively predict the effective thermal conductivity of cementitious DSAC materials and can provide strong support for the material design and performance prediction of cementitious DSAC materials.},

Results showed that NCC significantly improved micro-scale geopolymer gels aggregation on the surface of PEF through the nano-scale calcium (Ca)-triggered electrostatic attractions and high bonding between N/CASH-polyethylene. Due to micro-scale gel aggregation, meso fiber dispersion, geopolymers with 12 mm + 6 mm PE fiber + 1\% NCC showed the best synergistic effect on macro- scale bending toughness and multiple cracking characteristics. The relationship of fiber reinforcing index-toughness, toughness-crack amount and toughness-crack fractal dimension tracked good linear, natural log and exponential function, respectively.

In this paper, zirconium silicate (ZrSiO 4 ) highly reflective ceramic glaze coatings were prepared on both ceramic and metal substrates. Their macro and micro structure evolution treated at different heating temperatures were studied. The reflectivity of the coatings was on average 85\% over the range of 400 and 2400 nm and reaches a maximum of 94\% at 1064 nm. The coatings on ceramic substrates showed good stability when irradiated under high-energy continuous laser with power density of 2000 W/cm 2 for 60 s. On the other hand, the coatings prepared on metal substrates formed a layer of dense, glaze-like material after high-energy continuous laser irradiation with power density of 500 W/cm 2 for 10 s or 1000 W/cm 2 for 5 s, demonstrating good anti-laser performance.},

In this paper, a flexible and novel material interface design and manufacturing method for hierarchical macro/nano optical glass lenses is proposed. To verify the feasibility of the presented manufacturing strategy, the deformation history and flow driving mechanism of multiscale structured surfaces during second hot embossing were studied by simulations and experiments. The results showed that solid-like glass preform exhibits a higher nanoscale deformation resistance and elastic recovery, which can reduce the distortion levels of the nanostructured surface. At small scales, molecular confinement greatly reduces the tectonic deformation of nanostructured surface at relatively low applied heat and pressure. However, beyond a specific thermal energy threshold, nanostructured convex surfaces are easily compressed into a smooth flattened surface. By collaborative control of embossing conditions, the nano-surface integrity of multiscale structured surface can be ensured during second hot embossing. Compared to the smooth macroscale optical lens, the hierarchical macro/nano glass lens exhibited better optical transmittance and antireflection properties. The proposed design and manufacturing strategy provides a facile and flexible solution for building the hierarchical macro/micro/nanostructure functional optics.},

The presented work optimized the topologies of ILM unit cells to maximize strength in tensile and shear loading using gradient-based parametric optimization and genetic algorithms. Experimental validation confirmed that the optimized designs achieved considerable strength increases compared to a human intuitive design. In several cases, the optimized designs were approximately double the effective interfacial strength compared to that achieved via expert intuition alone. The strength improvement was seen for isolated unit cells and arrays of interacting unit cells (metasurfaces). An analysis of the topologies of the optimized designs showed that tall dendritic geometric features with large contact surfaces yield robust solutions in tension, while short and broad geometric features with large contact surfaces yield better results in shear loading. This study revealed the importance of shape optimization to maximize ILM effectiveness under single- and multi-objective scenarios.},

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising cancer treatment modality; however, the potential molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Herein, we designed a near-infrared (NIR) light-activated nanoplatform (TPBC-PEG) to explore the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of PDT by using a model of intratibial primary and pulmonary metastasis osteosarcoma. Under laser irradiation, TPBC-PEG photosensitizer dose-dependently inhibited proliferative and metastatic capabilities while promoting apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells in vitro, and also effectively suppressed carcinogenesis and pulmonary metastasis in osteosarcoma xenograft mouse model. Moreover, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis after high-throughput mRNA-seq indicated that the HIPPO signaling pathway was one of the 20 most significantly related signaling pathways. And a series of experiments for determining the HIPPO signaling activity were conducted to reconfirm the specificity. Collectively, PDT of TPBC-PEG micelles against carcinogenesis and pulmonary metastasis of deep-seated intratibial osteosarcoma was achieved by activating HIPPO signaling pathway. Our study identified a hitherto uncharacterized molecular mechanism of PDT, which may provide new insights to understand and design promising nanoplatforms for future cancer therapies.},

Among the four substrates, TNT-70 was the most prominent to induce the differentiation of macrophages to the pro-healing M2 phenotype via significant down-regulation of pro-inflammation genes (CD86, iNOS, CD11c) and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), as well as up-regulation of anti-inflammation genes (CD206, Arg-1, IL-10) and cytokines (TGF-β, IL-10). Furthermore, TNT-70 could stimulate the osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the angiogenic ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via multiple paracrine signaling. In vivo experiments suggested that TNT-70 significantly relieved early inflammatory response around the implant, facilitated coupled osteogenesis and angiogenesis, and effectively promoted the osseointegration of peri-implant. This study provided a reference for fabricating surface topography on Ti implant for improving osseointegration and relieving associated excessive inflammatory response.},

Besides, mesoporous nanocarrier-based therapeutics delivery system has drawn plenty of attention and Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles have been demonstrated intrinsic Fenton-like activity which is much higher than analogous synthesized Fe 3 O 4 . In this work, in order to precisely diagnose and effectively eliminate lung tumor cells, we have synthesized mesoporous hollowed Co 3 O 4 nanocarriers with ICG loading and surface grafting of RGD peptides. We have demonstrated that the biodegradable nanoplatform is a promising NIR II fluorescent contrast agent for accurately delineating tumor counters and phototheranostic agent with photo-heat conversion efficiency as ∼59.93\% under 808 nm light exposure. More importantly, the corresponded hyperthymia progressively potentiates the ROS production via Co ions catalyzation. Our Co-based nanocomposite could efficaciously suppress the tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo accompanied by 808 nm laser illumination. In summary, all data highlights the potency of biodegradable Co-based mesoporous nanocarriers as contrast agents for multimodal imaging and photothermal augmented ROS amplification for efficient lung tumor inhibition.},

The powder materials are characterized in detail using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Their processability via laser beam powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) is proven, and microstructure as well as mechanical properties of the additively manufactured specimens are assessed. All powders feature a dendrite-type microstructure with Nb/Ta-rich dendritic and Ti-rich inter-dendritic phases. Crystal structures of the powders are strongly composition-dependent. Nb- and Ta-rich Ti-35Nb-6Ta and Ti-22Nb-19Ta feature a body-centered cubic lattice, whereas Ti-rich Ti-20Nb-6Ta and Ti-27Nb-6Ta powders are characterized by multi-phase microstructures, consisting of non-equilibrium martensitic phases. Processing by PBF-LB/M causes significant changes in their microstructures: the dendrite-type morphologies vanish, and the formation of microstructures with a homogeneous element distribution can be observed in all additively manufactured parts. Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) as well as elongation at fracture are assessed by tensile testing. UTS values are found to be in a range from 651 MPa (Ti-35Nb-6Ta) to 802 MPa (Ti-20Nb-6Ta); strain-to-failure is between 21.3\% (Ti-35Nb-6Ta) and 31.7\% (Ti-22Nb-19Ta). Ductile fracture behavior is seen for all TNT alloys investigated.},

Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are lightweight, compact, and have high power-to-weight ratios, and thus can easily be embedded without affecting the overall device shapes. Here, a review of SMA-based haptic wearables is provided. The article starts with an introduction of SMAs, while incorporating analyses of relevant devices documented in the literature. Haptic and SMA materials fields are correlated, with haptic perception insights aiding SMA actuator design, and distinct SMA mechanisms offering diverse haptic feedback types. A design process for SMA haptic wearables is proposed based on material-centered approach. We show SMAs hold potential for haptic devices aiding visually impaired people and promise in immersive technology and remote interpersonal haptic communication.},

  abstract     = {4D printing is the additive manufacturing (3D printing) of objects that can transform their shape in a controlled and predictable way when subjected to external stimuli. A thermo-responsive shape memory polymer (SMP) is a highly suitable material to 4D print smart devices, due to its actuation function and the capability of recovering its original shape from the deformed one upon heating. This study presents the results of employing an epoxy resin in the additive manufacturing of complex-shaped smart devices with shape-morphing properties using laser stereolithography (SLA). To quantify the shape memory behaviour of the shape memory epoxy (SMEp), we first investigate the thermomechanical properties of the 3D-printed specimens in a tensile testing machine coupled with an environmental thermal chamber. This approach allows us to determine the shape fixity and recovery of SMEp. Next, we propose effective designs of complex-shaped devices, with the aim of promoting shape morphing through micro-actuators and compliant joints acting as active regions in combination with multiplying mechanisms or kinematic chains in each of the devices. We manufacture the complex-shaped prototypes by using SLA directly from the computer-aided designs. The shape memory trials of the 3D-printed prototypes reveal quite precise shape recovery of the devices, illustrating their shape-memory. In fact, the inclusion of micro-actuators and compliant joints within the complex-geometry devices allows for local triggering, deformation and recovery, resulting in a prompt response of the devices to heat. Therefore, innovative designs, along with the suitable smart material and high-quality manufacturing process, lead to 4D printed devices with fast actuation and shape-morphing properties. Overall, this research may contribute to the development of smart materials and 4D printing technology for applications in fields such as biomedical engineering, robotics, transport and aerospace engineering.},

  abstract     = {Several efforts have been made to develop walking smart soft robots through different strategies such as the use of complex aligned magneto-active materials. Here, we show a simple approach for the design of a smart soft robot using an elastomer film with randomly distributed ferrimagnetic nanoparticles able to be remotely controlled by a magnetic field. The magneto-active robot has a rotating-square kirigami geometry resulting in a flexible smart auxetic metamaterial (i.e., a negative Poisson-ratio structure). Alongside the standard translational locomotion on a smooth-surface under a steady magnetic force, the auxetic kirigami structure mimics the crawling-locomotion of worms over a high-roughness surface under an oscillatory horizontal field, even climbing vertical-obstacles. A theoretical understanding for this new locomotion mechanism stresses the relevance of the kirigami metamaterial design and the ferrimagnetic response of the particles. The soft robot can also transport a payload having weights higher than the weight of the smart elastomeric film. The smart auxetic structure further presents a rolling locomotion by properly orienting the magnetic field, meaning multiple remote locomotion mechanisms.},

In view of potential small-scale applications, we probe here nanomechanically the stress-induced austenite–martensite transition in single crystalline austenitic thin films as a function of temperature. In 0.5 µm thin films, a marked incipient phase transformation to martensite is observed during nanoindentation, leaving behind pockets of residual martensite after unloading. These nanomechanical instabilities occur irrespective of deformation rate and temperature, are Weibull distributed, and reveal large spatial variations in transformation stress. In contrast, at a larger film thickness of 2 μm fully reversible transformations occur, and mechanical loading remains entirely smooth. Ab-initio simulations demonstrate how an in-plane constraint can considerably increase the martensitic transformation stress, explaining the thickness-dependent nanomechanical behavior. These findings for a shape-memory Heusler alloy give insights into how reduced dimensions and constraints can lead to unexpectedly large transformation stresses that need to be considered in small-scale actuation design.},

In this work, fluorinated PDMS was obtained through the cross-linking reaction between fluorosilane and PDMS, which was evenly mixed with the combustion product of silicone rubber (mainly composed of SiO 2 ) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP), and the mixed coating was deposited on the surface of PET fabrics by spraying method to construct a superhydrophobic flame-retardant coating. The coated fabrics shows good superhydrophobicity (water contact angle is 155.61 ± 1.42°, sliding angle is 3.2 ± 0.4°) and self-cleaning performance. In particular, the prepared coated fabrics also has excellent mechanical durability, and it still does not lose its superhydrophobicity after 10 abrasive paper rubbing cycles, 60 min washing and even 300 bending and twisting cycles. In addition, compared with the original fabrics, the coating shows excellent flame retardant performance, which can realize self-extinguishing within 10 s in vertical combustion experiment.},

However, lattices with uniform or simple gradients cannot match the regional diversity needs of functional advantages in service. This study proposed a field-driven AM data processing framework for dual functionally graded TPMS lattices. For unified data processing, mathematical functions, simulated outcomes, and geometric models were transformed into fields. I-WP and Diamond units were selected as the primitive and filling structures of Ti-6Al-4V lattices, respectively. According to the functional requirements, the gradient distribution design guided by the simulated stress field is completed through the proposed framework. The results illustrate that the field-driven dual graded lattices present superior compressive mechanical response. At almost equal volume fractions, their compressive strength is approximately 100\% more than that of primitive lattices and 69\% greater than that of dual uniform lattices. Furthermore, the dual lattices have larger specific surface areas than the primitive lattices, making them better at heat insulation and heat dissipation. This field-driven digital framework will show enormous potential in the matching design of functionally graded lattices.},

We present processed BMGs and BMG composites of the same composition with improved thermomechanical stability, from which high strength retention at temperatures, compared to the cast glass, by above 100 K higher is registered via dynamic mechanical analysis. ∼100 nm thin surface layers comprised of Ti, Cu, and Zr oxides form at the surface of the alloys, as identified by high-resolution transmission microscopy. Also, ∼4 orders of magnitude lower passivation current density along with ∼2 orders of magnitude lower corrosion current density of the processed glass compared to the values of the as-cast state confirms an extremely high stability in a 0.9 wt\% saline environment which can be linked to surface hydrophobicity. Cytocompatibility analysis conducted by seeding human gingival fibroblast cells directly onto the thermoplastically formed Ti 40 Zr 10 Cu 36 Pd 14 BMG reveals no adverse effect on cytocompatibility.

The presence of a membrane had a positive effect on the production and secretion of aggrecan (Agg), and incorporation of BG particles significantly improved the production and secretion of collagen type II (Col2). Each of the introduced PCL modifications leads to articular cartilage cell (NHAC-kn) viability improvement and results in a decrease in the cytotoxicity of the material.

This study engineered and fabricated a three-dimensional (3D)-printed anisotropic biomimetic trabecular porous Ti-6Al-4V cage for lumbar interbody fusion. The study evaluated the structural design, manufacturability, mechanical properties, and cellular functions of the fabricated structures compared to currently available interbody cages. In vitro tests assessed the biofunctionality of the 3D-printed porous cage, which revealed anisotropic biomimetic trabecular porous Ti-6Al-4V cages with 65\%-85\% porosity, and 600 μm pore size. The microscopy analysis of surface properties indicated in situ micro- and nano-roughness. The mechanical properties decreased progressively with increasing porosity, and the optimized frame-reinforced porous cage achieved higher compressive strength and stiffness than the fully porous fusion. The 70\% 3D-printed porous frame-reinforced cage had suitable mechanical performance compared with the polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) cage. The anisotropic biomimetic trabecular porous structures and the surface micro- and nano-roughness modifications achieved excellent biological functions in vitro.

  abstract     = {Various wounds caused by burns, trauma, surgery, and genetic irregularities, including acute and chronic wounds, pose a huge burden on global healthcare. Many therapeutic strategies, such as nanomedicine and regenerative medicine, have been applied to wound repair and skin regeneration. As a promising and exciting nanomaterial, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) encompass many desirable properties, including crystalline porous structure, tunable size, good mechanical stability, large specific surface area, and exceptional chemical stability. Most importantly, the performance of MOFs can be modulated by changing synthesis steps and conditions. MOFs can release metal ions to modulate cellular behaviors and kill various microorganisms, which meets this dual agent release therapeutic strategy for wound healing and skin regeneration. Additionally, MOFs can act as carriers for delivering bioactive agents in a desired manner. Recently, an increasing number of researchers have conducted many studies on applying various MOFs in wound healing and skin regeneration. Based on this, we perform this study to report the current status and further perspective of MOFs-based therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, the molecular process of wound healing and the fabrication of MOFs were also discussed.},

In this study, a tumor microenvironment responsive and high O 2 -economic effect nano-theranostic agent GOx@NPs was constructed through the self-assembly of GOx and CDDO-Fe, which was synthesized by coupling natural chemotherapeutic drug CDDO-Me blocked by ferrocene (Fc) with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probe hemicyanine (I-CyOH) via redox-responsive linker dimercaptoisopropionyl, and then introducing tamoxifen (estrogen receptor target fragment) to hemicyanine to enhance the active targeting ability. The NIR fluorescence probe I-CyOH not only achieved an accurate diagnosis, but also possessed photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect. The active targeting fragment tamoxifen enhanced the accumulation of pathological site and alleviated the hypoxia microenvironment through the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory to reinforce the PDT efficiency of I-CyOH. Moreover, the combination of Fc and GOx could achieve starvation therapy and enhance chemodynamic therapy (CDT). In vitro and vivo experiments exhibited that the effective dual sensitive synergistic therapy possessed significant therapy efficiency and lower side effects. This study provides a valuable strategy for constructing dual sensitization and high economic of intelligent nano-theranostic agents for tumor diagnosis and synergistic cancer therapy.},

In this work, a heterogeneous gradient structure was introduced into CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) microfibers via thermomechanical processing. The annealed CoCrFeNi microfiber displays an ultrahigh yield strength of ∼ 1 GPa, an ultimate tensile strength of 1.45 GPa, and an outstanding uniform elongation of 75\% at 150 K. These excellent properties originate from the ultrafine grains and heterogeneous gradient structure, as well as the activation of multiple deformation mechanisms including deformation twins, dense dislocations, stacking faults, Lomer-Cottrell locks, phase transformation and 9R phase. Our work not only suggests that HEA microfibers have great potential for structural applications in cryogenic environments, but also sheds light on the design of advanced multi-component metallic microfibers with superior mechanical properties.},

Most mechanical metamaterials are based on the large structural deformation of units, while the transmission and synchronization of these motion deformations among units are poor which leads to difficulty in designing and controlling the properties. In this study, a modular mechanism based on the kinematics of Sarrus linkage is constructed, and this mechanism is tessellated to a metamaterial with constant negative Poisson’s ratios and a clearly defined deformation path. By varying the specific parameters of the modular mechanism, Poisson’s ratios of the metamaterial can be programmed and almost constant. Hence, a novel approach to constructing metamaterials based on the kinematics of linkages is proposed in this work.},

  abstract     = {Tuning the mass density and bulk modulus independently is the key to manipulate the propagation of sound wave. Acoustic metamaterials provide a feasible method to realize various acoustic parameters. However, the relevant studies are mainly concentrated in air, and the huge impedance difference makes it difficult to directly extend these airborne structures to underwater application. Here, we propose a metafluid to realize independent manipulation of the mass density and bulk modulus underwater. The metafluid is composed of hollow regular polygons immersed in the water. By adjusting the side number of the hollow regular polygons and choosing proper materials, the effective mass density and bulk modulus of the metafluid could be modulated independently. Based on the flexible adjustment method, metafluids with same impedance but different sound velocities are designed and used to realize an underwater impedance-matched gradient index lens. In addition, by combining the proposed metafluid with other artificial structures, acoustic parameters with great anisotropy can be achieved, which is exemplified by the design and demonstration of an impedance-matched underwater acoustic carpet cloak. This work can expand the practicability of underwater metamaterials and pave the way for future potential engineering applications in the practical underwater devices.},

Nevertheless, even though the inner PFA microstructure of a green body is an essential precondition for tailoring the properties of porous ceramics, the approaches established to date have only focused on post-processing. To address this gap, the present study demonstrates a novel DLP approach to elucidate how PFAs are formed in green bodies during DLP 3D printing. Specifically, complex UV light scattering patterns that are common in composite DLP 3D printing and often detrimental were exploited to modify the interface between PFA and the ceramic-polymer matrix. This was done through modulation of the size difference between ceramics and PFAs as well as the DLP&#39;s process parameters. Additionally, a method for inferring the interfacial properties of PFAs embedded in a green body through surface characterization is proposed.},

A comprehensive systematic study was conducted to thoroughly assess mixtures&#39; mechanical properties, physical proficiency, fresh properties, and printing qualities. The inclusion of MA exhibited the desired fresh properties required for 3D printing and promising physical and mechanical properties. Evaluation of the mechanical properties of designed 3DPHWC indicates that replacing SA with MA increases both cast and printed samples&#39; strengths. The 3D printed M100 sample achieved higher 28 days flexural and compressive strengths by 18\% and 20\%, respectively, compared to printed control mix (M0). Micro-CT study correspondingly demonstrated improvements in the composites&#39; porosity, pore size, and pore morphologies. The linear attenuation coefficients (LACs) and half-value layer (HVLs) for slow neutron and gamma-ray were measured to assess radiation shielding characteristics. A significant performance improvement was obtained for slow neutrons by introducing the magnetite aggregate. Unlike slow neutrons, no significant difference was observed between cast and printed samples against γ-rays. Moreover, the effect of porosity on the shielding performance was discussed.},

The thermomechanical stress and slag corrosion tests indicated that since the micro-closed pores effectively relieved the thermal stress and CaZrO 3 absorbed massive crack-propagation energy, the cold modulus of rupture and residual strength ratio respectively reached 14.4 MPa and 73.4\% after thermal shock cycles, nearly half higher than that of the fused magnesia based castables. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect of micro-closed pores and intergranular CaZrO 3 phase significantly reduced the slag-wettability, improved the interfacial energy and dihedral angle, leading to the decline of slag penetration indice (decreased by ∼34.8\%).

Herein, based on the dynamic dual-crosslinking mechanism, we fabricated a silk microfibers (SMFs)-based multifunctional hemostatic hydrogel by incorporating tannic acid-coated SMF (TA@SMF) motifs into the network of poly(vinyl alcohol)-borax (PB) hydrogel. The cohesion-enhancing strategy, along with dynamic borate-diol bonds and hydrogen bonds, synergically provide the hydrogel with enhanced bio-adhesion and self-healing properties. TA@SMF/PB gel has an elongation at break of more than 600\% and adheres to pig skin even after 24 h immersion in water. In vitro experiments have shown good antibacterial, antioxidant, biocompatibility, and hemostatic properties of the TA@SMF/PB gel. In vivo degradation and mouse liver hemostatic test further verified its biosafety and rapid hemostasis performance. The hemostatic time of 42.0 ± 4.9 s in TA@SMF-0.5 was significantly shorter than that in other experimental groups. This study is the original report for functionalizing SMFs with TA as a hemostasis material, which affords a versatile SMF-based toolkit that provides promising candidate materials for rapid hemostatic and infectious wound healing.},

To overcome these limitations, we fabricated a near-infrared (NIR)-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)/Prussian blue microgel (PNA@PB). The microgel featured improved stability and higher loading of Prussian blue (PB), achieved by chemically linking it to the polymer. For cancer therapy, the microgel was loaded with the model drug doxorubicin (DOX) to obtain PNA@PB@DOX, resulting in a high loading capacity of 26\% and encapsulation efficiency of 51\%. Upon exposure to 808 nm NIR laser light, the photothermal PB in PNA@PB@DOX raised the temperature above the lower critical solution temperature of the microgel, causing the microgel to shrink and release the drug by 36\%. The NIR-triggered drug release by PNA@PB@DOX resulted in improved photothermal/chemotherapy performance, both in vitro and in vivo experiments using A549 lung cancer cells, compared with PNA@PB. The combination of photothermal therapy from PB and photothermal shrinkage-induced chemotherapy from PNA was found to be highly effective in killing cancer cells.},

However, understanding the tribological and wear characteristics of graphene on polymer substrates under high-temperature conditions is essential for predicting whether graphene will fail as a solid lubricant for flexible substrates in high-temperature environments. Herein, the friction and wear characteristics of monolayer graphene on flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates are studied by atomic force microscopy using a heated tip. The friction of graphene before wear is more stable than that of PDMS, demonstrating that graphene can be used as a solid lubricant to stabilize the stick-slip motion of the tip on the flexible substrate at elevated temperatures. The friction of graphene shows an increasing trend with the heating temperature increasing due to an enlarged tip-graphene contact area. However, the friction of graphene considerably decreases with the tip sliding velocity increasing at a speed of less than 0.5 µm/s, resulting from a reduced tip-graphene contact area. The thermally-induced wear of graphene is caused by the coupling effect of the temperature and the sliding velocity. These results can provide an in-depth understanding of graphene as a solid lubricant for flexible polymer-based MEMS/NEMS devices in high-temperature environments.},

Intravitreal injection of Exo resulted in the inhibition of pathological angiogenesis, accompanied by downregulation of immune response genes. Mechanistically, Exo were specifically phagocytized by microglia, resetting their activation status through the inhibition of the innate STING/NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, upon MMP stimulation in the retina, KAI was cleaved, effectively quenching multiple angiogenic factors simultaneously. This dual anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic strategy demonstrated significant therapeutic effects, including suppressed neovascularization, and reduced vascular leakage in the retina. Exo KAI treatment demonstrated no noticeable side effects, positioning these engineered nanodrugs as a promising alternative for ischemic retinopathy and refractory ocular neovascularization due to their combined effects.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogel treatment as a common cooling method could effectively ease pain and promote wounds healing by reducing thermal injury to the skin. However, the inherent low thermal conductivity of polymers limits the improvement of hydrogels’ cooling performance. The present study reports a simple method by combining thermal conductive fillers 1D hydroxylated multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNT-OH) and 2D hydroxylated hexagonal boron nitride (BN-OH) to construct 3D conductive networks in hydrogels for cooling treatment and burn therapy. It is interesting that the thermal conductive fillers are aligned via varying the mass ratios of CNT-OH to BN-OH. Hence, the utilization efficiency of the thermal conductive fillers is improved; and the thermal conductivity of the hydrogels is enhanced up to 1.31 W*m −1 *K −1 , which is 226\% to the pristine hydrogel of 0.58 W*m −1 *K −1 . Consequently, the optimized hydrogel exhibits rapid cooling abilities that the heated porcine skin only takes 168 s to decrease 30 °C with the treatment of the hydrogel. More importantly, the thermal conductivity enhanced hydrogel exhibits the capacities of rapid cooling, reducing heat injury and pain relieving, and promoting wound healing in vivo tests, which prove that the enhanced thermal conductive and moisturizing hydrogel can be a good alternative for burn therapy.},

  abstract     = {Bioinks for cell-based bioprinting face availability limitations. Furthermore, the bioink development process needs comprehensive printability assessment methods and a thorough understanding of rheological factors&#39; influence on printing outcomes. To bridge this gap, our study aimed to investigate the relationship between rheological properties and printing outcomes. We developed a specialized bioink artifact specifically designed to improve the quantification of printability assessment. This bioink artifact adhered to established criteria from extrusion-based bioprinting approaches. Seven hydrogel-based bioinks were selected and tested using the bioink artifact and rheological measurement. Rheological analysis revealed that the high-performing bioinks exhibited notable characteristics such as high storage modulus , low tan(δ), high shear-thinning capabilities, high yield stress, and fast, near-complete recovery abilities. Although rheological data alone cannot fully explain printing outcomes, certain metrics like storage modulus and tan(δ) correlated well (R 2 &gt; 0.9) with specific printing outcomes, such as gap-spanning capability and turn accuracy. This study provides a comprehensive examination of bioink shape fidelity across a wide range of bioinks, rheological measures, and printing outcomes. The results highlight the importance of considering the holistic view of bioink&#39;s rheological properties and directly measuring printing outcomes. These findings underscore the need to enhance bioink availability and establish standardized methods for assessing printability.},

However, bare magnesium alloy stents are still limited by some problems such as too fast degradation, poor hemocompatibility, and inability to regulate the behaviors of vascular cells in clinical applications. Surface modifications are highly requested to improve the corrosion resistance and biocompatibility of magnesium alloy stents. Herein, a fucoidan-based coating consisting of MgF 2 layer, polydopamine (PDA) and fucoidan was constructed on Mg-Zn-Y-Nd (ZE21B) alloy to improve its corrosion resistance, hemocompatibility and rapid endothelialization for vascular stent application. Compared to bare ZE21B alloy, the modified ZE21B alloy exhibited better corrosion resistance and hemocompatibility. More importantly, the endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) exhibited a distinct dose-dependent behaviors towards the fucoidan grafting density. The relatively low fucoidan grafting density promoted the proliferation, spreading and migration of ECs, but suppressed these behaviors of SMCs. The results of in vivo implantation experiments indicated that the fucoidan-based coating modified ZE21B alloy can inhibit intimal hyperplasia, relieve tissue inflammation, and promote the rapid endothelialization. Thus, the fucoidan-based coating provides a simple and effective strategy to develop novel magnesium alloy stents with improved corrosion resistance, good hemocompatibility and pro-endothelialization potential.},

To be effective, such treatments require cell separation methods that do not modify cellular surfaces. In this study, we developed cell separation materials using ethylene glycol-based thermoresponsive block copolymer brushes and cell-affinity peptides. A poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate- co -propargyl acrylate) (P(HEMA- co -PgA)) brush was grafted onto a glass substrate through atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Subsequently, poly(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl methacrylate) (PMEO 2 MA), P(MEO 2 MA- co -HEMA- co -poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate [PEGMA]), or P(MEO 2 MA- co -PEGMA) was grafted onto the P(HEMA- co -PgA) brush-coated substrates through a second ATRP. A Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Glu-Asp-Val (GGGREDV) peptide was conjugated to the copolymer brush via a click reaction. The prepared copolymer brushes exhibited thermoresponsive properties. The block copolymer brushes having the P(MEO 2 MA- co -HEMA- co -PEGMA) and P(MEO 2 MA- co -PEGMA) segment exhibited effective human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) adhesion and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) repulsion at 37 °C. By reducing temperature to 20 °C, adherent HUVECs were successfully recovered from the copolymer brushes. Using these copolymer brushes, HUVECs were separated from contaminant NHDFs and smooth muscle cells with these simple changes in temperature. The development of thermoresponsive ethylene glycol-based copolymer brushes with affinity peptides could be a useful cell separation material for tissue engineering applications.},

The synthesis of late-term antibacterial properties with total morphosynthesis on medical devices nonetheless remains an elusive goal. Herein, we utilize a mineralized strategy coupled with ion exchange to generate lamellar-type magnesium calcium phosphate thin films with a three-step pathway: Construction of nanofiber porous structure on the substrate as ions reservoir, incorporation of magnesium substitutional transition sodium titanate layer, and mineralization of a lamellar calcium phosphate coating. Synthetic lamellar coatings exhibit excellent osteointegration effects in infectious scenarios. More importantly, the underlying transition layer can blow up the possible delayed infection like a landmine after the upper calcium phosphate coating is degraded under the physiological environment. This work highlights the pivotal role of the magnesium ions in mediating the growth of the total morphosynthesis of calcium phosphate coating and the underlying magnesium titanate layer in ensuring the possibility to eliminate delayed infections under time-dependent degradation.},

However, it is a great challenge to deliver drugs accurately and efficiently to the target and exert synergistic effects due to multiple biological obstacles in vivo . Here, we constructed a novel size-variable three-dimensional mesh nanocluster (HA/P-A cluster) cross-linked by bifunctional peptide R14 for tumor targeted co-delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and pPD-L1 trap. The ERP effect and the targeting effect of the outer layer of HA synergistically mediated the accumulation of nanoclusters in tumor tissues. Subsequently, R14 was broken by matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and the nanoclusters (180 nm) were cleaved into ultra-small size nanoparticles (∼10 nm), achieving deep penetration while targeting tumor cells through RGD at both ends of R14. Based on this strategy, DOX acts as an initiator to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) while immunodrugs block the PD-L1 pathway. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that HA/P-A cluster effectively retarded tumor growth. Moreover, HA/P-A cluster treatment resulted in a significant increased CD8 + T cell infiltration in tumor tissue. In conclusion, this strategy provides a new direction for targeted co-delivery of nanoplatforms to improve chemoimmunotherapy in solid tumors.},

The smaller particle size of initial powder would be more favorable to getting slurry with high solid content and low viscosity. CaP green body with high precision and high curing rate could be fabricated at the exposure energy density and exposure time of 6.20 mJ cm −2 and 2 s, respectively. Moreover, the post-curing treatment could eliminate the interlayer cracks and increase the curing rate from 69.78\% to 93.91\% of green body. After that, the mechanical strength of CaP ceramics increased by 46.34\%. In-vitro cellular experiments showed that 3D printed CaP ceramics had good biocompatibility, and could promote the osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs. In-vivo rat cranial defect implantation revealed 3D printed CaP ceramics exhibited better osteogenic ability than the commercial ones (BAM®), reaching the close level with the autografts.

  abstract     = {Vitrimer composites with bond- exchange reactions offer significant advantages in terms of repair and recyclability. The mechanical properties of such composites can be designed by modifying the epoxy/anhydride ratio, thus allowing their interface properties to be customised. In this study, the mode-I interfacial fracture properties of vitrimer carbon fibre composites with different epoxy/anhydride ratios are investigated experimentally and numerically. The results show that composites with an epoxy/anhydride group ratio of 1:0.5 exhibit the highest fracture toughness, with a maximum value of 1.6 mJ/mm 2 . Meanwhile, the analysis of the composites’ microscopic fracture morphology indicates their good bonding performance with carbon fibres. Subsequently, a multiscale numerical approach is developed to simulate the mode-I fracture response of composite laminates and establish a trilinear cohesive model to simulate the macroscopic interfacial fracture behaviour. In this approach, a matrix elastic–plastic constitutive model and the J-integral method are applied to obtain the stress distribution in the fibre-bridging phase via a double cantilever beam fracture test. The macroscopic fracture behaviour obtained via simulation is consistent with the experimental results. Therefore, the proposed multiscale numerical simulation method, which correlates the matrix properties with macroscopic fracture parameters, allows the interlaminar properties of composites with novel matrices to be evaluated effectively.},

The reaction rates of each mineral dissolution, product precipitation, ionic diffusion, and adsorption were calculated individually through the degrees of undersaturation and supersaturation associated with the ionic concentration, all of which were coupled in the modified Poisson–Nernst–Planck equation. The hydration heat flow was then theoretically calculated by the superposition of the reaction rates of silicate and aluminate phases, which was derived from the calculated ionic concentration. The model was validated by comparison with experimental data obtained under various conditions, showing consistency. The combined effect of multi-mineral reactions and interactions on hydration kinetics was investigated using the model, and the results indicated that (1) faster dissolution of gypsum or a higher ratio of tricalcium aluminate to tricalcium silicate leads to a larger time interval between silicate and aluminate peaks; (2) faster precipitation of calcium silicate hydrate results in a more significant difference between silicate and aluminate peaks; and (3) the sulfate ion retards cement hydration kinetics shifting from silicate to aluminate dominance.},

  abstract     = {Spatially distributed sensing has gained significant value in diverse domains, with wearables as a notable application. In this work, a flexible skin-like sensor was developed for distributed pressure sensing. The sensing skin comprised a carbon black/silicone composite lattice structure embedded in a silicone sheet. The lattice-patterned structure is a distinct departure from conventional uniform sensing skins. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) was employed to reconstruct electrical resistance over the sensing area, which was then mapped into pressure distribution based on the principle of piezoresistivity. EIT offers continuity and design simplicity as it eliminates the need for internal wiring, making it a promising technique in the wearable industry. The lattice sensing skin offered favorable sensing attributes, including quick response and recovery (75 ms and 84 ms at 85 kPa), a linear response with sensitivity as high as 0.119 kPa −1 , a full-scale range of at least 100 kPa, and high repeatability (∼0.5\% drop in maximum relative resistance over 300 cycles). The sensing skin was responsive over its entire area in both flat and non-planar conditions and was able to detect both single- and multi-point touch. The sensitivity and tactile area detectability varied depending on the position of applied pressure over the sensing area. Future studies will examine other lattice patterns and conductive composite fillers with the intention to develop a framework for optimizing the lattice sensing skin for tailored accuracy and resolution.},

In this work, high frequency SiC nanobeam resonators with a diameter of ∼100 nm and with lengths of tens of micrometers were designed and demonstrated, which was produced based on the high quality monocrystal 3C-SiC nanowire material with high aspect ratio characteristics. The resonance behaviors of the nanobeam resonator was studied using an integrated mixing circuit measurement system with the pressure from 10 −3 to 10 −1 Torr. It was observed that the resonant frequency was up to 9.16 MHz, which was a distinguished essential feature for high sensitivity detection. The tunability of SiC nanobeam resonators was about 22\%, which can be conveniently controlled by adjusting DC voltage on the gate. It was examined that the detection value of the SiC nanobeam resonator can be as low as zeptogram, which indicated its ultra-sensitive mass detection behaviors. The results show that the SiC nanobeam resonator has high resonant frequency, large tunability and high sensitivity, which is expected to be a high-performance device for biosensing and mechanical sensing.},

An additive manufacturing (AM)-based combinatorial experiment was employed to determine the optimal composition of coating layers. Various compositional combinations of Al-Si-Zn layers were deposited onto an Al plate using a multi-nozzle direct energy deposition system, and the wetting behavior of the cast materials onto the combinatorial samples was examined to select the best composition of the coating layer. The selected coating layer was sprayed on the cooling pipes, and an actual-scale motor housing integrated by the pipe was produced by a compound die casting. The Al-Si-Zn coating layer caused the surface of the coating layers on pipes to partially melt when in contact with the molten alloy during the casting. Consequently, a reactive layer was rapidly formed between the coating and cast materials before solidification. As a result, the interfacial bonding strength increased to 13 MPa and heat transferability between the wrought and cast materials was improved. Therefore, we described the AM-based combinatorial exploring method for the interfacial coating layer to overcome the interfacial issues between the wrought and cast materials of compound casting.},

This paper explores how Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM), Design for Assembly (DfA), and Design for Disassembly (DfD) strategies, along with Additive Manufacturing&#39;s (AM) capability to produce intricate parts, can contribute to the fashion industry&#39;s shift towards a Circular Manufacturing model. The focus is on footwear manufacturing and its carbon footprint issues. The proposed additively manufactured shoe design utilizes Polyamide 12 and Thermoplastic polyurethane as feedstock, featuring a glueless mechanical assembly system based on a snapfit. Notably, the upper part of the shoe incorporates a variable lattice structure to ensure flexibility in different areas. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) demonstrates that the snapfit assembly exceeds the industry standard&#39;s minimum disassembly force requirement. Additionally, an optimization algorithm for the variable lattice structure results in a 34\% mass reduction while maintaining the desired Young&#39;s modulus in each shoe zone. This design approach aligns with the footwear industry&#39;s sustainability goals, aiming to reduce environmental impact and enhance product durability.

  abstract     = {When a cubic lattice packaged by a boundary layer is subjected to a mechanical and temperature load, the force and length change of the bonds are equivalently evaluated by the average stress and strain of the unit cell. Provided a displacement gradient variation at a certain stress state, the variation of stress related to the strain variation provides the effective stiffness of the material at the corresponding configuration. It is discovered that the effective elasticity and thermal expansion coefficient can be tailored by the prestress through the boundary layer, which generates a configurational stress. Because the bonds of a cubic lattice depend on the material types , we consider the harmonic potential of springs for cellular lattices and Hertz&#39;s contact potential of balls for granular lattices, respectively. The cubic symmetry of effective elasticity is demonstrated for the three types of cubic lattices. By taking the orientational average, isotropic elastic constants can be obtained for randomly oriented lattices. As the bond length changes with the prestress of the boundary layer and controls the thermoelastic behavior , a novel design method of lattice-based materials confined in a spherical shell is demonstrated to achieve zero thermal expansion and a positive temperature derivative of elasticity.},

However, traditional IGBT encapsulation materials are unsuitable for high-voltage applications due to the excessive electric field stress generated at the triple junction; an insulation-enhanced encapsulation material is therefore necessary. Here, using an electrically assisted stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing strategy, we fabricate an encapsulation material with graded permittivity that can uniform the electric field stress distribution in IGBTs. Compared with pure resin and uniform-dispersed BaTiO 3 -resin composite encapsulation, the graded BaTiO 3 -resin composite reduces the generated maximum electric field stress ( E m a x ) from 190.2 to 108.3 kV/mm (nearly a 50\% decrease). Regarding the partial discharge inception voltage, the devices packaged with graded BaTiO 3 -resin composite (4.07 kV) also performed better than devices packaged with resin (1.96 kV) and uniform-dispersed BaTiO 3 -resin composite (2.51 kV).

To address this issue, The photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor is first developed for the detection of TC-HCl by comparing and analyzing ternary Bi 2 (Te 1-x Se x ) 3 nanomaterials prepared through different ratios of hydrothermal methods . Specifically, the Bi 2 (Te 1-x Se x ) 3 /Indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode can interact with TC-HCl rapidly and selectively which results in a significant reduction of the photocurrent signal. By regulating the ratio of x, it is found that Bi 2 Te 2.85 Se 0.15 /ITO have the best stability and the fastest response time in the detection of TC-HCl. The response/recovery speed of the sensor to TC-HCl is fast to 0.23 s, a low detection limit of 0.08 pmol/l (S/N = 3) and a linear detection fit of up to R 2 = 0.992. Moreover, the sensor has good stability and specificity for TC-HCL detection, providing a new perspective for the development of PEC sensors.},

  abstract     = {2D III-VI semiconductors have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic devices due to their tunable bandgaps, efficient light absorption and high carrier mobility. Among III-VI group, 2D indium telluride (InTe) has been studied very little compared with its well-known congeners such as InSe and GaSe. Although InTe possesses remarkable electrical and optical properties, the investigation of its device applications is greatly hindered due to the shortage of scalable synthesis method. Here, we synthesized centimeter-scale 2D InTe films via a pulsed laser deposition method. The structure of as-grown InTe films was systematically studied, exhibiting good continuity, uniformity and high degree of crystallinity. Meanwhile, layer-dependent bandgaps (1.21∼1.65 eV) were observed from the optical characterization. The InTe based photodetectors show a broadband photoresponse from ultraviolet (370 nm) to near-infrared region (980 nm). The photoresponsivity and detectivity of the InTe photodetectors can achieve 6.35 A/W and 1.55×10 11 under 370 nm illumination, respectively, which outperform many photodetectors based on large-area 2D materials. Notably, InTe photodetectors also demonstrate strong layer-dependent photoresponse from 2 L to 10 L upon different wavelength illumination. Our work will inspire the research interests to further develop the practical applications of 2D InTe in the field of photodetection devices.},

As an ideal, environmentally friendly renewable energy, hydrogen can satisfy human clean energy requirements. Therefore, whether hydrogen can be catalytically generated in the wastewater treatment process is a highly meaningful investigation. Herein, Bi 2 Te 3 /Te/C heterojunction nanowires with high specific surface area and rich pore structure were successfully synthesized. The efficient catalytic degradation process is accompanied by the generation of hydrogen. The catalytic degradation of methylene blue and methyl orange was achieved in less than 20 s and 150 s, respectively. Meanwhile, in scaled-up degradation/hydrogen production experiments, fast and efficient H 2 production from NaBH 4 can be realized in the presence of Bi 2 Te 3 /Te/C nanowires. The mechanism of efficient synergistic organic dye degradation and hydrogen production is due to the efficient carrier transfers and accumulation at the hetero-interface. In contrast to previous work, rapid degradation of organic dyes and hydrogen production by decomposition of NaBH 4 were achieved without the help of high-cost catalysts such as precious metals. This work could provide an alternative pathway for the future degradation of organic matter in synergistic heterogeneous catalytic wastewater and recovery of by-products including hydrogen.},

  abstract     = {Architected materials exhibit extraordinary properties in comparison with conventional materials and structures, resulting in additional functionality and efficiency by engineering the geometry in harmony with the base material. Buckling-induced architected materials (BIAMs) are a class of architected materials that exhibit a significant potential to absorb and dissipate energy owing to their local instabilities. Previous studies have shown a trade-off between energy dissipation and geometrical recoverability in metallic BIAM, which limits their use in applications that require both of these features. This study, for the first time, presents 4D printing of buckling-induced architected iron-based shape memory alloys (BIA Fe-SMAs) using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The results show that 4D printing of BIA Fe-SMAs can offer both energy dissipation and geometrical recoverability (i.e., recentring). The study was conducted on two different alloy compositions of Fe-17Mn-5Si-10Cr-4Ni. Quasi-static cyclic tests were performed on the two BIA Fe-SMAs, and the samples were subsequently heated to 200 °C to activate the shape memory effect (SME) of the base material. The samples could recover the residual deformations accumulated during the cyclic load owing to the SME of the base material, which led to shape-recovery ratios of 96.8 and 98.7\% for the studied BIA Fe-SMAs. The results of this study demonstrate that 4D printing of BIA Fe-SMAs can yield an enhanced multi-functional behavior by combining the material&#39;s inherent functional behavior with the functionalities of the architected structure. Notably, BIA Fe-SMA samples could reconfigure their initial shape without damage after densification, which sets them apart from conventional crushable lattices.},

  abstract     = {Metasurface absorbers have gained increasing attention in the field of electromagnetic (EM) absorption in recent years. The conventional design method often involves designing various structures and comparing absorption bandwidth and intensity to determine the absorber&#39;s structural parameters. The absorption of EM waves by absorbers involves a complicated process of electric field excitation and impedance matching. Although design experience can reduce the number of design iterations, the selection of artificial parameters is often imprecise and can result in design bias. Fortunately, machine learning (ML) algorithms offer the possibility of automating the design of critical parameters for metasurfaces, which can effectively reduce the laborious design process and the high cost of trial and error. In this study, a pyramid-based metasurface absorber (PMA) and an inverted pyramid-based metasurface absorber (IPMA) were designed and optimized using the random forest (RF) algorithm. The results show that the absorption bandwidths of the two absorber models are 2.68 THz and 2.42 THz, respectively, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is only 0.60\%, which is significantly better than other classical ML and deep learning (DL) algorithms. This study offers a new approach for designing complex systems related to EM wave absorption, reflection, and transmission propagation.},

Furthermore, the expression of inflammatory factor IL-1β had decrease significantly. Subsequently, PPE@rGO-Pue had shown chondro-protective effect for OA, which was evidenced by the suppression of MMPs, resulting in matrix degradation and the increase of Col2a1 and GAG that attenuated the cartilage erosion.

  abstract     = {A novel wire arc additive manufacturing process is proposed to produce porous metal (PM). The innovation is to convert harmful welding pore defects into a beneficial structure of PM, and then the PM parts can be additive manufactured layer by layer. Air was transferred to the molten pool as pore promoters to maximize the formation of the welding pore defects. The triple-wire indirect arc process was used for fabricating multi-layer parts to reduce interlayer filling. The primary advantage is that the process can directly produce macro-pore structures rather than depositing pore walls along micro paths in laser additive manufacturing. The uniform diameter of the pore ranges from 500 to 2700 μm, and the typical porosity is 64\%, 49\%, and 87\%. The process could achieve a high deposition rate of 11.5 kg/h. Due to martensite formation, the pore walls can achieve high microhardness of over 200 HV.},

It has been shown in this study that HA-PEI, a molecule formed by covalently combining HA and PEI, can effectively treat advanced ALI. Through the CD44 receptor, HA-PEI could target the liver actively, with the highest liver-targeting effect confirmed at 1000 K. The underlying mechanism of protection of HA-PEI is by increasing oxygen content, reducing ROS, and maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential. HA-PEI also inhibits the secretion of inflammatory factors and blocks the migration of immune cells to the liver, protecting the hepatocytes not suffer from secondary damage. More importantly, for late-stage ALI, NAC, as the only FDA-approved drug, is completely ineffective, whereas HA-PEI has an excellent therapeutic effect. This work provides a new safe therapeutic agent for ALI, which has a bright application prospect.},

  abstract     = {Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality. The collaterals provide an alternative pathway to preserve the ischemic brain tissue, and determine the penumbra range, where the neurons are salvageable. Therefore, accurately monitoring the collaterals and identifying the penumbra are crucial. Herein, a low-immunogenic nanoprobe-based MRI strategy is developed to simultaneously identify the infarct core, collaterals distribution, and ischemic penumbra distributions. The low-immunogenic nanoprobe was constructed by covalently attaching self-peptide on the surface of biocompatible Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles as a stealth coating. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments clearly revealed that the nanoprobes can effectively avoid capture by macrophages, and exhibited prolonged blood half-life to continuously enhance the contrast of blood vessels in a longer time window in susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), which enabled the delineation of the collaterals and ischemic penumbra. More importantly, combined with the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), the infarct core, collateral vessels, and the ischemic penumbra range can be identified simultaneously. In this context, the stroke progress including infarct core growth, collateral vessel formation, and penumbra distribution, can be better understood. This nanoprobe-based strategy thus offers a practical route for precise diagnosis of ischemic stroke, which remains a challenge for conventional MRI strategies.},

However, the preparation of pressure sensors with high sensitivity and wide sensing range still faces great challenges. This study reveals an flexible heat-resistant variable density point pressure sensing array (PSA) with ultra-wide sensing range based on Ti 3 C 2 T x -MXene. MXene containing polar oxygen-containing functional groups coated polyester fiber fabricated the pressure sensing layer while a stainless steel wire core is used as a flexible electrode for signal collection. The signal processing device rapidly converts the mechanical signal into electrical signal output to increase the transmission speed and range. Experimental results show that the PSA can effectively sense dynamic and static pressures with high sensitivity (0.14–0.87 kPa −1 over a pressure range of 7.2 Pa–2000 kPa), a wide sensing range (0–15000 kPa), fast response time (80 ms), 10,000 cycles (2000 kPa) stability and maintains a 81.25\% current response. The noval fully woven structural flexible PSA exhibited larger area, of which the weave density is varied to control resolution and the pressure mapping is referenced to each pixel point to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze shape and pressure distribution.

Recently, zero-order topological vortex modes have been designed in phononic structures, in analogy with zero-energy fermionic states modulated by Jackiw-Rossi binding mechanism. Such localized modes may have potential applications for biosensing, bioimaging and on-chip communication. In this work, we propose a pillared phononic plate with a Kekulé distortion of pillars position to bind topological modes at a vortex core via dispersion engineering. The phase winding and amplitude diagrams of the topological vortex mode are observed experimentally. It is found that existence of vibration peaks and corresponding mode patterns are strongly robust against the random perturbation of resonant frequencies of pillars at the vortex core. We further design a topological resonant sensor for mass sensitivity. The frequency of the topological vortex mode is almost linearly sensitive to added small mass at the vortex core in terms of mass values and positions. The proposed pillared plates provide a platform for potential applications such as energy localization and harvesting, remote health monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Auxetic lattices exhibit a negative Poisson’s ratio and excellent energy absorption capability. Here, we investigate the compressive performance of auxetic cubic chiral structures. By utilising finite element analysis (FEA) verified by interrupted mechanical testing and x-ray computed tomography, the auxeticity and failure mechanisms at the large strain deformation have been evaluated. The FEA results show that the initial elastic–plastic response agrees with the prediction of the classic scaling laws of bending-dominated lattices. At increasing plastic deformation, the energy absorption and auxeticity are dependent on relative density, i.e., the slenderness ratio, of the constitutive struts. In the plastic regime, the auxeticity decreases with relative density. Ductile fracture precedes densification in relative densities above 1.2\% , 1.2\%, thus dictating a new scaling law for the variation of the maximum energy absorbed with density. The numerical model predicts the scaling of mechanical properties, fracture strains, and energy absorption of the constitutive unit cell and finite-sized specimens in the relative density ranging from 0.3\% 0.3\% to 6.5\% 6.5\% . However, to accurately model the failure mechanism, geometrical imperfections should be included. The scaling laws derived from this work may aid the design of next generation auxetic lattices with tailored mechanical properties.},

  abstract     = {Osteosarcoma, occurring most frequently in adolescents, are highly malignant bone tumor and prone to develop local recurrence and long-distance metastasis. Therefore, new comprehensive therapeutic strategies for osteosarcoma are urgently needed. Different from traditional photothermal therapy (PTT), low temperature PTT (LTPTT) not only brings less heat damages to the surrounding normal tissues but also prevent tumor metastasis. Nevertheless, its therapeutic effects are severely attenuated due to the tumor thermo-resistance induced by the overexpression of heat shock protein (HSP). In our work, an acid-responsive core–shell nanocomposite was fabricated for cancer therapy. The nanoplatform can independently encapsulate alkyl radical initiator 2,2-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl) propane]-dihydroch-loride (AIPH) in the mesoporous polydopamine (MPDA) core and HSP inhibitor (gambogic acid, GA) in the zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) microporous shell, called MPDA/AIPH@ZIF-8/GA (MAZG), which could achieve the combined functions of LTPTT and thermodynamic therapy (TDT). After endocytosing by tumor cells, the pH-responsive degradation of the ZIF-8 coating stimulates the rapid release of GA, which can effectively inhibit HSP expression in advance, and then simultaneously enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of LTPTT. Further, both in vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that the as-synthesized MAZG nanocomposite exhibited favorable biosafety and remarkable tumor growth inhibition.},

However, all clinical drugs require long-term use to relieve the disease, causing toxicity and side effects. Zinc tends to activate the self-defense system to repair SCI, but the currently reported zinc supplementation is not efficient to cure SCI due to the poor targeting effects. The zinc delivery system has been employed to improve the targeting efficiency, which also increases the complexity and toxicity of drugs. On the other hand, we envisage that if there is a drug that can accumulate and activate endogenous zinc in the lesions of the spinal cord and stimulate immunotherapy, it can not only reduce long-term drug dependence but also significantly improve the therapeutic effect on SCI. Herein, we found zinc deficiency for SCI mice, but more zinc accumulated in the lesions of the spinal cord after the administration of GSH-AuNCs in SCI mice. Meanwhile, more microglia/macrophages polarize toward M2 from M1 phenotypes after zinc accumulation which enhances immunotherapy effects. Thereafter, the inflammatory response was inhibited, which exerts a neuroprotective effect. As well as this, the current treatment showed memory effects for zinc accumulation even after stopping the drug administration, allowing endogenous zinc to continue its induction of multiple therapeutic effects. Due to the direct and memory curative function, the lesions of SCI mice were well recovered and the motor functions were also significantly improved.},

Unfortunately, the overall response rate of ICIs in pretreated metastatic breast cancer (BC) is generally less than 20\% due to many challenges, including low immunogenicity and immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (ITM). Herein, we synthesized nanoliposomes that codelivered diclofenac (DC) and Mn (5,10,15,20-tetrakis (4-chlorophenyl) porphyrin) Cl (PMnCl) (denoted MD@Lip) to overcome these challenges. DC could block lactate transporters (monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 4) on the cancer cell membrane, thus reducing the concentration of lactate, which acts as a critical regulator of the ITM. Meanwhile, PMnCl-induced sonodynamic therapy (SDT) could induce apoptotic and/or necrotic tumour cell death. Importantly, SDT could induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) during the tumour cell debris generation, which changed the state of tumour cells from nonimmunogenic to immunogenic. Thus, MD@Lip was verified to activate T cells, inactivate regulatory T cells and regulate the levels of immune cytokines, ultimately inhibiting primary and distant tumours by improving the antitumour effect of anti-PD1-based immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen-induced failure in a partially-recrystallized Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy with different aging conditions was studied by in-situ electrochemical hydrogen charging method, and the hydrogen-induced cracking mechanism was elucidated by investigating the microstructure-dominated deformation behavior. It was found that in naturally-aged and peak-aged samples, cracks initiate at sample surfaces, and deformation dominated by shearing facilitates hydrogen diffusion, resulting in a high hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. However, in the over-aged sample, deformation dominated by bypassing cannot transport hydrogen efficiently, which exerts no effect on crack initiation at the sample center. In addition, the same cracking pattern exists on all samples in silicone oil and in-situ hydrogen charging environments. The grain boundary of recrystallized grains is prone to strain localization, leading to intergranular cracking. In unrecrystallized grains, transgranular cracks propagate along intersections of slip lines and subgrain boundaries. This study improves the understanding of hydrogen embrittlement in new generation Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy by linking the existing hydrogen embrittlement mechanism to the deformation behavior dominated by microstructures.},

  abstract     = {Knowing the mechanical behavior of silicon at elevated temperatures is crucial for many high-temperature applications and processes. This work aims to expand the knowledge of these properties, especially on length scales relevant to miniaturized silicon structures. Therefore, nanoindentation experiments were performed on two differently doped (1 0 0) silicon wafers with varying oxygen content, from room temperature up to 950 °C. Residual impressions were microscopically characterized via confocal laser scanning microscopy. From this dataset covering an exceptionally large temperature range the elastic modulus and hardness as well as strain rate sensitivity, activation volume, and energy were evaluated. Generally, a change in deformation behavior can be identified between 300 °C and 400 °C. Above this transition temperature, the hardness drops exponentially. Also, the material becomes strain rate sensitive. These observations support the assumption that the deformation mechanism shifts from high-pressure phase transformation to dislocation-controlled plasticity with increasing temperature. Furthermore, a change in strain rate sensitivity, activation energy, and activation volume above 800 °C implies a further shift in the rate-controlling mechanism of dislocation motion. Lastly, the more strongly doped sample with the higher oxygen content showing higher mechanical strength is discussed regarding solid-solution strengthening and dislocation locking by oxygen atoms.},

  abstract     = {Lattices based on triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) are attracting increasing interest in seminal industries such as bone tissue engineering due to their excellent structure-property relationships. However, the potential can only be exploited if their structural integrity is ensured. This requires a fundamental understanding of the impact of imperfections that arise during additive manufacturing. Therefore, in the present study, the structure-property relationships of eight TPMS lattices, including their imperfections, are investigated experimentally and numerically. In particular, the focus is on biomimetic network TPMS lattices of the type Schoen I-WP and Gyroid, which are fabricated by laser powder bed fusion from the biocompatible alloy Ti-42Nb. The experimental studies include computed tomography measurements and compression tests. The results highlight the importance of process-related imperfections on the mechanical performance of TPMS lattices. In the numerical work, firstly the as-built morphology is artificially reconstructed before finite element analyses are performed. Here, the reconstruction procedure previously developed by the same authors is used and validated on a larger experimental matrix before more advanced calculations are conducted. Specifically, the reconstruction reduces the numerical overestimation of stiffness from up to 341\% to a maximum of 26\% and that of yield strength from 66\% to 12\%. Given a high simulation accuracy and flexibility, the presented procedure can become a key factor in the future design process of TPMS lattices.},

However, achieving efficient dispersion of LDHs within the PLA matrix poses a challenge in the fabrication of PLA/LDHs nanocomposites. In order to enhance the dispersion of LDHs in the PLA matrix and improve their compatibility with PLA, in this study sodium stearate (SS) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were used as surface modifiers and intercalation modifiers for LDHs, respectively. Notably, the strategy of intercalation-surface combined modification for LDHs nanofillers in PLA was explored for the first time. Furthermore, the resulting PLA/LDHs nanocomposites were prepared via a sonication-assisted solution compounding method. The results indicate that the addition of LDHs modified through different methods and concentrations affects not only the thermal properties and crystallinity of the PLA/LDHs composites, but also improves the tensile strength and elongation at break of PLA. Notably, the PLA_LDH_SDS_SS_9\% composite exhibited an elongation at break that was 230\% higher than neat PLA. This study fills a research gap in the field of PLA/LDHs nanocomposites and establishes a significant foundation for the future preparation and application of these.},

The BMS-MIL composite is mainly composed of Al 3 Ti and Ti phases, with a small amount of Al 2 Ti and AlTi phases. Al 3 Ti is in the shape of polygonal platelet, and a 5–8 μm diffusion layer composed of Al 2 Ti and AlTi is distributed on the surface of the platelets. Ti6Al4V connects the platelets and is present in a continuous network frame structure. Compared with the layered structure Ti6Al4V/Al 3 Ti metal-intermetallic laminate (LS-MIL) composite, the fracture strain of BMS-MIL composite increases by 125.1\% while maintaining high strength under load perpendicular to layer, and the compressive strength of BMS-MIL composite increases by 26.3\% under load parallel to layer, respectively. Material isotropy in compressive properties has been significantly improved. In bending tests, the strength of the BMS-MIL composite is 1.9 times that of the LS-MIL composite.

According to the electromagnetic simulations of microwave phase shifters with patterned HZO thin films, it is underlined the importance to have selectively targeted areas covered with HZO instead of full-coverage wafers, to gain a further increase in the microwave performance of low-voltage tunable high-frequency components. The impact of the ASWE method on the morpho-structural properties was studied using various investigation tools in a non-destructive manner. X-ray reflectivity (XRR) has been employed at different immersion times, up to 120 s. Based on the extended Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis, as well as from the simulation of the experimental curves in the framework of parallel-tempering algorithm, the determination of the etching rate became possible. X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) clearly indicated the complete removal of HZO after etching processes at 180 s. The method is fast, reliable, and low-cost, thus filling the actual gap in providing the necessary ferroelectric thin films exclusively in selected areas of interest.},

At present, combination of multiple affinity chromatography is regard as an efficient phosphopeptide enrichment strategy. Therefore, designing and preparing composites with multiple affinity sites is of great significance. Herein, the Oxid-Ti 3 C 2 T x /UIO-66-NH 2 composites with multiple affinity sites are rapidly synthesized by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) technology at low temperature and atmospheric pressure. The in-situ nucleation of UIO-66-NH 2 and TiO 2 can be flexibly regulated through the feed ratio of MOF precursors and the DBD duration individually. The UIO-66-NH 2 has large specific surface area, high porosity and plentiful Zr-O clusters. Oxid-Ti 3 C 2 T x provides abundant exposed Ti sites and Ti-O clusters. Based on these, Oxid-Ti 3 C 2 T x /UIO-66-NH 2 composites exhibited high sensitivity (0.1 fmol μL −1 ), satisfactory selectivity (BSA: α-casein = 100: 1, molar ratio) and superior repeatability for phosphopeptide enrichment. In addition, the composites performed well in biological samples like nonfat milk (24 phosphopeptides), human saliva (15 endogenous phosphopeptides) and human serum (all 4 endogenous phosphopeptides), demonstrating a huge application potential in phosphoproteomics study. More importantly, this study opens a new path to synthesize MXene/MOF composites with controllable oxidation degree and flexible compositions regulation efficiently, revealing its broad application prospects in various fields.},

However, achieving further advancements in print resolution to the submicron and even nanoscale, particularly for low-viscosity inks with significant spread, requires nozzles with diameters in the hundreds of nanometers. It is particularly challenging and complicated to manufacture nozzles with such small diameters. In this paper, a concise method based on high-resolution E-jet printing was developed to fabricate nano-nozzles, which in turn enable high-resolution printing of a range of low-viscosity inks. First, the hybrid polymer nozzle mold consisting of BN303 nanomesa and SU-8 micromesa was fabricated by E-jet printing and ultraviolet (UV) lithography. Subsequently, the polymer nozzle was produced through a casting process of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and subsequent bonding. In addition, the preliminary E-jet printing was performed with poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) ink using the polymer nozzle, resulting in lines as small as 140 nm. These outcomes demonstrate the compatibility of E-jet printing with high resolution and showcase the potential of the developed polymer nano-nozzles to significantly expand the scope of E-jet printing applications.},

Using AM allows the designer to create complex shapes including ones based on curved elements, which can take the shape of curved beams or minimal surfaces. Filling a space with repetitive patterns is not restricted to straight elements or struts, as not even nature solves all structural problems with them. Hence, curved elements have been widely used in metamaterial design, with potential applications in the biomedical, transportation, and packaging industries, among others. Mechanical metamaterials conformed with curved constituent elements are more flexible than those based on straight elements, which increases their energy absorption capacity while reducing stress concentration. The deformation mechanism of topologies with the same geometrical parametrization could be changed from stretch- to bending-dominated when modifying the specific parameter, e.g. increasing the curvature. The effective properties of curve based metamaterials have been studied by means of computational, analytical, and experimental approaches mainly based on standard compressive tests . An optimal distribution of material via parametric control of these topologies will lead to enhanced and customized mechanical properties .},

To design structures with the target mechanical properties, it is crucial to understand the correlation between the mechanical characteristics and structural information. To this end, we explored the similarity in the mechanical behavior between atomistic structures and actual 3D-printed zeolite structures. The zeolite structure was chosen because of its various structural parameters such as pore size, distribution, and geometry. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed that similar behavior was observed in the mechanical responses at an atomic scale and with a 3D-printed macro-scale structure. 3D printing with ductile thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filaments showed a high degree of agreement with microstructure-level simulations. The mechanical response of zeolite structures is classified depending on their linearity and the characteristics with respect to the applied strain, to anticipate the potential applications of mechanical metamaterials. Further comparative analysis was conducted between the structural characteristics and mechanical properties, linking the changes in the stress to factors, such as density, porosity, angle, and bond length. This study demonstrates that metamaterial design with a mechanical response can be achieved using atomic-level structural design degrees of freedom.},

Using a bridge notch geometry, which can promote the formation of a sharp natural crack after bridge-failure rather than creating a comparably blunt FIB notch was proposed as a strategy to reduce FIB-induced artifacts more than a decade ago. Even though bridge-failure is widely assumed and predicted by finite element method (FEM) simulations, it has never been observed and quantified experimentally. This study presents the first experimental observation of bridge notch failure and crack arrest before the entire through-thickness main notch (after crack arrest) propagates, which is possible by designing thin bridges and using a stiff experimental setup with superior load resolution. Consequently, we obtained up to three corresponding fracture toughness values from one bending cantilever and significantly less scattered data. Using previously reported geometry correction factors calculated by FEM, the fracture toughness estimated from the bridge-failure was compared with the one from the failure of the main through-thickness notch in CrN/AlN multi-layered and CrN hard coatings.},

Here, the FG microstructure properties available in literature are reviewed, followed by Focused Ion Beam - Scanning Electron Microscopy investigation and compression tests. Specifically, a single 100 μm × 150 μm cross section was obtained, and the 2D pore sizes and shapes were quantified using image segmentation. Monotonic and cyclic out-of-plane compression tests were performed in single and stacked configuration . Stress-strain curves showed three domains: the initial toe, the transition and the densification domain. The cyclic tangent modulus was also calculated from the cyclic tests. Many observations suggested that FG behaves similarly to crushable foams, crumpled materials and compacted powders, and that both crystalline microstructure and crumpled mesostructure play a predominant role in the deformation mechanism .},

  abstract     = {Customizable stress plateau of lattice structure is sought-after for various engineering applications . In this study, we present a new design strategy to achieve customizable plateau, by introducing the concept of embedding self-similar structure in a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, which thereby constitutes a novel FCC hierarchical lattice (FCCH). These FCCH specimens were experimentally validated through quasi-static compression tests, on samples 3D-printed through selective laser melting using SS316L. These deformation characteristics were clarified by finite element analysis . The experimental and numerical results consistently show the serrated, dual, and upward plateaus were experienced for the 0 th -order FCC, 1 st -order FCCH, and 2 nd -order FCCH structures, respectively. The mechanical reinforcements are based on the stronger interactions between unit cells induced by the embedded sub-structures. The deformation mechanisms dominated by hierarchical order are determined by horizontal layer-by-layer interaction as well as longitudinal buckling and collapse. The effect of geometric configuration show that stress plateau can be customized via optimizing different slave-cell sizes, connecting face-centers of lattice components, and arranging row layered gradient strategies.},

While well-defined in crystals, it is challenging to identify such topological footprints in the amorphous structure of metallic glasses (MGs). Here, we uncover an unforeseen vacancy-like structural motif named Q7, which refers to an atomic Voronoi polyhedron with seven quadrangular faces, by investigating MG local atomic configurations with the help of machine learning. The Q7 motif exhibits characteristics similar to crystalline vacancies and plays a significant role in short-range structural disorder in MGs. The atoms at the center of the Q7 motif display larger local entropy, atomic volume, and local tension. Additionally, its concentration follows an Arrhenius-like relationship with temperature, accurately indicating the glass transition temperature, and is strongly correlated with the yield and failure of MGs during mechanical deformation. The discovery of the Q7 motif provides new insights into understanding the intricate relationship between local disorder and structural relaxation in MGs, offering a remarkable ability to predict their thermal and mechanical behavior. This potentially paves the way for enhancements in the design and manufacturing processes of MGs and other amorphous materials.},

Nevertheless, in situations with bone defects located in high-stress areas with intricate and varying mechanical environments, the scaffold necessitates reinforcement to withstand the limit stress. Achieving a balance between the “mechanical load-bearing properties, elastic modulus, and permeability” represents a substantial challenge. A scaffold with locally personalized reinforced was proposed based on slime mould algorithm (SMA), called bionic trabecular bone scaffold with slime mould algorithm (Bio-Tb-S-SMA), that is capable of echoing hard tissue characteristics. Additive manufacturing (AM) was utilized to fabricate the scaffold owing to its superior manufacturing flexibility. Compression tests, friction tests and bidirectional fluid–structure interaction experiments to evaluate the mechanical load-bearing properties, service stability, and permeability of scaffold. The results demonstrate that Bio-Tb-S-SMA effectively adapts to the complex in vivo stress environment, exhibiting strong bone-bearing capacity and service stability, while simultaneously retaining excellent permeability. Bio-Tb-S-SMA has broad potential for use as a bone repair material, and the bionic design and bionic reinforcement algorithm inject new vitality into the field of tissue engineering.},

The extraordinarily unique attributes provided by NDs include biocompatibility, easy production, chemical inertness, rich surface chemistry, small size, and fluorescence resistance. In biomedical sciences, all these characteristics uplift the standards of ND particles. Recent studies on the biomedical side have been found to strengthen its significance ever since ND tested positive for utilization in diagnostics and drug delivery. In addition, NDs have been proven beneficial in the manufacturing of biodegradable surgical instruments, scaffolds for tissue engineering, and drugs to eliminate resistant microbes and viruses. Genetic materials are also delivered to the center of the nucleus with the aid of ND particles. In this review, we have discussed in detail all the benefits of NDs, their applications in sensors, ND-blood interactions, blood-contacting, orthopedics, anti-cancer agents, antimicrobial agents, and drug/gene delivery.

However, due to their high positive charge, manganese ions cannot freely penetrate biological membranes, and it is challenging to target them to the cells. Liposomes have been widely used as an effective drug delivery system. Using metal ions as active carriers to establish a gradient is an effective way to load chemotherapy drugs, but its low delivery efficiency and significant degradation of effective drugs by lysosomes may result in reduced therapeutic effects. In this study, we constructed an active drug-loading liposome (LMD@LA) that enters cells through thiol-mediated endocytosis to encapsulate both the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin and manganese ions to achieve sustained manganese ion release. The combination of chemotherapy-induced immunogenic cell death and innate immune therapy with manganese ions was used to treat tumors. The liposome was able to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, reduce the resistance of B16F10 and 4T1 tumors to doxorubicin, and decrease the migration and invasion abilities of tumors by binding with lipoic acid.},

The system was obtained by encapsulating Streptococcus salivarius K12 membranes on triclosan-loaded PLGA nanoparticles using an extrusion method. The constructed nanocomplexes (K12/TCS@PLGA-NPs) inherited the properties of the source cell membrane, bionically adhering to the oral mucosa and binding to the candida albicans hypha.

To solve this problem, the nano-silica(nano-SiO 2 )/polyimide(PI)/cellulose composite models were designed and their mechanical, and dielectric properties were predicted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The preparation of corresponding nano-SiO 2 /PI/cellulose insulating paper was guided by the MD simulation results and their surface morphology, mechanical properties, and electrical properties were investigated. The experimental results are in good agreement with the MD simulation results and confirmed that P3 insulating paper possesses the best comprehensive performance, and its tensile strength, relative permittivity, dielectric loss, volume resistivity, and breakdown strength are 71.44 MPa, 2.39, 0.2\%, 5.16 × 10 15 Ω∙m, and 75.8 kV∙mm −1 , respectively.

Although high-sintering temperature is required for obtaining dense KNN ceramics, it favours alkalis volatilization with deleterious effects on the physical properties. Together with the need of more environmentally-friendly technologies for ceramic manufacturing, cold sintering (CSP), a low temperature sintering process, is a promising technique. CSP of incongruently dissolving materials (with different dissolution rates of constituents) is, however, a challenge. In this work, a systematic study of the interaction of KNN particles with water under different pH conditions and temperatures is used to elucidate the nature and mechanisms of KNN dissolution. The KNN dissolution follows the trend [K + ] &gt; [Na + ] ≫ [Nb 5+ ]. Differences are demonstrated between acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions, with the latter exhibiting less incongruence. Acidic pH increases solubility of KNN and promotes the incongruence of dissolution. Oppositely, alkaline pH decreases solubility of KNN and prevents dissolution incongruence. The incongruence of KNN dissolution in aqueous media is quantified. These observations have implications for our understanding of powders dissolution and offer opportunities to control the stoichiometry of the powders, that might be the key for CSP of incongruently dissolving materials.},

Our metamaterial is composed of identical unit cells with two concentric Archimedean spiral cuts and a permanent magnet embedded in the unit cell&#39;s center. By utilizing external electromagnets, we further amplify the fabrication asymmetry, through the inherent asymmetry between a repulsive vs attractive state between the permanent magnets and the electromagnets.

  abstract     = {Diabetic wound treatment poses significant global challenges in clinical work and research, alternative treatment approaches need to be developed urgently. Exudate management and angiogenic function are critical to improve diabetic wound healing. In this work, a Janus bilayer electrospun dressing is fabricated via modified electrospinning technologies. The outer layer of dressing is hydrophilic deferoxamine (DFO)-loaded polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) random nanofiber, while the inner layer is hydrophobic PCL nanofiber with mesh-like structure and patterns, and the bilayer layers are fabricated via layer-by-layer assembly. The mechanical properties, wettability, and drug release performance of the Janus dressing were studied. Difference in wettability between the two layers enables excess biological fluid to drain away from the wound, and simultaneously trigger the cascade release of DFO in the outer layer. The in vitro data evidenced that the Janus dressing had good biocompatibility. The mesh-like inner surface is considered favorable for attachment and proliferation of fibroblast, and the controlled release of DFO significantly enhanced tube formation. In vivo results from a diabetic full-thickness cutaneous wound model showed that the Janus dressing created a unique microenvironment that accelerates the wound healing process through effective biofluid draining and stimulation of angiogenesis process. The findings indicated that the Janus dressing presented a potentially valuable method for the management and treatment of diabetic wound in clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Low-cost perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have experienced unprecedented gains in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25\% of lab-scale devices. To be realized in the market, however, PSCs are not only required to be efficient but also scalable in production. While spray coating has viability as an industrial manufacturing process for perovskite photovoltaics scaling, optimizing the spray conditions is often seen as a challenging and time-consuming process due to its complex and multidimensional parameters. Herein, we use a machine learning (ML) approach to capture the relationship between spray parameter settings to the resultant photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs from experimental collected data points. This data-driven approach has the potential to accurately predict PCE values given the manufacturing parameters, enabling optimization and resulting in an increased experimentally recorded PCE. Furthermore, we also used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict defect size distributions in the PSC structures to improve the understanding of defect formation mechanism at given spray parameters. The implications of the results are discussed for optimizing spray manufacturing process of efficient perovskite photovoltaics.},

A porosity constraint is introduced to control the proportion of lattice generated while optimising the beams for minimum compliance. A novel tetrahedron element-based lattice with tapered trusses and a near-isotropic elastic response is developed to accurately map the relative densities from topology optimisation to a 3D printable structure. Topology optimised solid structures (0\% porosity), used for benchmarking, are found to have high stiffness but can be susceptible to buckling. At the other extreme, structures comprising entirely of lattice (100\% porosity) are shown to have low initial stiffness and low residual toughness. An experimental parametric study reveals that porosity can be tailored between these two bounds to achieve both high stiffness and high residual toughness.},

  abstract     = {Studies have primarily simulated the interface pressure and skin surface stress produced by compression textiles or garments with a single pressure level. However, only a few studies have reported the biomechanical transmission behaviors of compression fabrics from the skin to deeper soft tissues of the human body, especially within the context of compression fabrics providing multiple pressure levels. Therefore, to address this limitation, this study developed novel 3D finite element (FE) models to characterize and visualize the interface pressure exerted at the skin surface by elastic compression stockings (ECSs), a type of typical compression textiles, with either low- or high-pressure levels, and to analyze the resulting stress and stress transmission effects within lower limb tissues. The results of the validated FE models indicated that the simulated interface pressure favorably agreed with the measured pressure data. A close relationship existed between the pressure magnitudes and the lower limb surface curvatures, with the highest interface pressure occurring at the anterior and posterior bony regions of the ankle with greater surface curvatures than those of the posterior calf. The internal tissue stress distributions largely varied, which may be one of the potential causes for the inconsistency observed between the claimed pressure doses and those practically delivered inside. Overall, this study serves to improve the understanding of the working mechanisms of the ECS-lower limb system, allowing for improved functional material design and evaluation of the pressure effectiveness of compression textiles and garments used in physiotherapy.},

We embedded the embryonic spinal-cord-derived NPCs in glycol chitosan (gC)-oxidized hyaluronate (oHA) hydrogels (=NPC graft). The NPC graft was transplanted into spinal-cord-injured Sprague-Dawley rats. Afterwards, the aligned PLGA-GNP nanofibrous mat was positioned onto the NPC-grafted region (=Injury + NPC graft + PLGA-GNP (A) nanofibrous mat (INP) group). We also added Injury (=I) and Injury + NPC graft (=IN) groups as control groups.

To address this problem, a novel metal–organic framework (MOF)/polypeptide hybrid nanocomposite was synthesised for the combined chemo-photodynamic therapy of MDR bacterial infection. A lipase-sensitive crosslinker was used to prepare the crosslinked polypeptide outer shell of the nanocomposite, and ciprofloxacin (CIP) and methylene blue (MB) were incorporated in the zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF)/poly- γ -glutamic acid (PGA) nanocomposites to form the combined therapeutic system (ZIF/PGA-C/M) for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ). The ZIF/PGA-C/M displayed a negative surface charge of −11.2 mV at physiological pH, indicating improved structural stability and biocompatibility. The pH/lipase dual responsive drug release showed that up to 99.4\% CIP and 76.0\% MB were released at pH 5.5 in the presence of lipase from the ZIF/PGA-C/M. Moreover, the incorporated MB can effectively generate singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) to kill the bacteria by a photodynamic effect under NIR irradiation. Remarkably, ZIF/PGA-C/M showed an efficient inhibition rate towards MRSA in both planktonic and biofilm phenotypes, and a synergistic therapeutic effect against MRSA infection in the mice model of skin infection.},

Below that value, both flow stress and elastic modulus decrease with decreasing pillar diameter, as evidenced for a measurement series with a fixed ligament size of 350 nm where the flow stress decreased by more than 50\% (from approximately 5 to 2.5 MPa) and the elastic modulus was reduced from approximately 0.5 GPa to almost zero.

As core physical bias in the SaTNC model, the information associated with interaction among alloying elements achieved by Transformer-based neural network is introduced to constrain the representation of the superalloy. The SaTNC model exhibits competitive generalization performance and the results have verified the high capability of the SaTNC model to capture the sensitivities of creep rupture life on alloy composition and service conditions. Moreover, Transformer-based deep representation for superalloy with both effectiveness and interpretability is obtained. The material insights including the interactions among alloying elements and their combined effects on the creep rupture life of superalloy are extracted from this deep representation. Finally, with the aid of the SaTNC model, a potential alloy composition space with low density and excellent creep resistance at high temperatures is identified, which will be experimentally verified in the future.},

However, one of the major problems is their poor bioactivity which may lead to aseptic loosening after long-term service. To solve this problem, calcium phosphate (Ca-P) coatings are in-situ synthesized on rapidly solidified ZTA eutectic bioceramics by laser cladding technology with mixed powders of CaHPO 4 ∙ ∙ 2H 2 O and CaCO 3 after granulation as precursors. X-ray diffraction results show that Ca-P coatings are mainly composed of Ca 0.2 Zr 0.8 O 1.8 , AlPO 4 , Ca 4 P 2 O 9 , Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 and Ca 2 P 2 O 7 . The amount of calcium phosphates reaches a maximum when using a laser power of 800 W and a scanning rate of 650 mm/min. Cross-sectional morphologies and energy dispersive spectrometer analysis indicate excellent interfacial bonding between the substrate and coating. In vitro tests prove that Ca-P cladded samples can induce apatite with flake-like morphology similar to those on the bioceramic coatings cladded on titatinum alloy precipitation and promote MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. This work reveals that laser cladding has the potential to improve the biomineralization of solidified ZTA eutectic bioceramics enabling prolonged clinical service life.},

An important process in recycling is shredding where materials joined in multi-material structures are liberated or detached. Until now, no physics-based models exist to describe shredding processes adequately. The proposed approach uses finite element simulations to model the shredding of a multi-material structure (steel and fiber-reinforced polymers with an adhesion joint) in a rotary shredder based on previous experimental investigations. Simulations successfully replicate the shredding phenomena, but the stochastic nature of the process results in different load cases making a strict quantitative comparison between simulations and experiments challenging. Comparing similar load cases of two experiments and the corresponding simulations, the estimated liberation degree ranges from 56\% to 100\% (63\% to 99\% in experiments). The estimated energy consumption varies from 1.4 kWh/t to 1.7 kWh/t (1.0 kWh/t to 1.4 kWh/t in experiments), marking a significant step in achieving a reasonable physics-based estimation of required energy. However, the number of fiber-reinforced polymer fragments is underestimated, ranging from 22 to 50 fragments (50 to 78 in experiments). The presented method is a novel contribution to recyclability assessment and recycling-oriented design.},

Particle patterning via acoustics offers an attractive path to generate a wide variety of 2D periodic patterns that introduce tailorable hierarchical porosity , useful for controlling surface area, transport distances, and other properties. This method is most effective with micron scale particles and patterns of tens to hundreds of microns. To enable systematic exploration of the broad design space for such patterns, this work develops a model of 2D and 3D assembly of particles at high loadings and validates the obtained patterns against both experiments and more computationally intensive modeling techniques. Using this simple model, connections are mapped between input parameters (like actuation conditions, particle volume fraction, material properties) and output geometrical features (like void size and shape, pattern connectivity, and surface area) so that they can be tailored to given applications. The utility of this simple model is illustrated by predicting and then experimentally demonstrating new hierarchical patterns resulting from multiple waves of different frequencies interacting. These multiscale patterns offer the potential to lift the limits on surface area, diffusion distances, and other features.},

The Cu sample containing ITBs was synthesized using magnetron sputtering on a sapphire substrate. Firstly, pillars along [1 1 1] compression direction were milled on the film surface. As multiple slip systems were activated upon loading, the dislocation-ITB interaction in this direction was dominated by the dislocation–dislocation interactions. Another set of pillars was milled from the side of the film (in the thickness of the film) in a nominally [13 4 ¯ ] compression direction. Compression in this direction activated a single slip in each grain, which facilitated the investigation of the interaction between dislocations and ITBs. Post - mortem images showed that slip traces were not distinctly connected at the boundary unlike ideal slip transmission in pillars containing a coherent twin boundary. Moreover, bi-crystalline pillars in the single slip direction are stronger than single-crystalline pillars. The observations indicate that ITBs are not impenetrable for dislocations, but the boundary demonstrates some resistance to transmission.},

  abstract     = {Wave springs are a novel type of axial compression spring that offer complete axial load transmission and a significant free height reduction when compared to coil springs. In this paper, it is shown that direct 4D printing using bilayers on a fused filament fabrication system can be used to create deployable, polymer wave springs that do not suffer from layering effects, as is common in other cyclically loaded additively manufactured parts. Bilayer actuators enable a flat print configuration and subsequent deployment by a thermal stimulus that then aligns the layers in the direction of the wave in the spring. Due to this, the springs exhibit exceptional performance under cyclic loading, reaching 10 4 104 cycles without failure. After plastic deformation caused by extended cyclic loading, the springs can be redeployed to recover their original mechanical properties using cold programming. These findings show the great potential of direct 4D printing in fused filament fabrication to create functional, 4D printed components with complex geometry and greatly increased lifespan compared to conventional 3D printed parts. The presented approach to compression spring fabrication further provides a standard component that enables the design of highly integrated, monolithically printed, and tunable mechanical systems.},

  abstract     = {Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) of engineering thermoplastics is a well-established additive manufacturing technique. In this work, an experimental investigation of the tensile-shear behaviour of L-PBF processed polyamide-12 (PA12) is presented, with a particular focus on the concurrent effect of build orientation and rate dependency at strain rates ranging from 10 −3 to 10 3 s −1 . Results show that the deformation behaviour features significant anisotropy at both low and high strain rates, while quasi-static ultimate strength in either tension or shear shows no dependence on the build direction. As the strain rate increases, the tensile strength is characterised by apparent positive rate dependence but remains insensitive to the build orientation; however the shear strength displays significant build orientation-dependent anisotropy, highlighted by the decreasing shear strength of specimens printed in the loading direction. Post-mortem scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrates torn dimples with stretched filaments in quasi-static fractography, while cleavage facets with flake structures retrieved from high-rate loading. A fibrillar structure is observed from high-rate torsional loading indicating adiabatic decohesion during rapid crack propagation. These findings draw attention to the significant anisotropy of L-PBF PA12 parts in a high-rate loading regime and provide directions to improve the current L-PBF techniques.},

  abstract     = {The paper focuses on the effect of the scanning strategies on the microstructural evolution, defect formation, and macro-hardness performance of laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) produced samples of low alloy 20MnCr5 steel. Respect to the scanning strategies, advanced characterization techniques were employed to study (i) as-built microstructure, (ii) inclusion size and distribution, and (iii) details of compositional variation around porosity and within the build. Microstructural characterization shows that the chessboard scanning strategy can provide a favorable microstructure for the improvement of mechanical performance. However, macro-hardness results show a lower mechanical performance compared to the linear scanning strategy samples, which is contradicted by the improved microstructure. Experimental results reveal that the chessboard scanning strategy promotes the oxidation reaction and in-situ oxide (SiO 2 ) formation in L-PBF, which leads to significant defect formation due to the excessive thermal profile from the overlap of the laser. This has been validated through finite element analysis and thermodynamic computation. The advantages of microstructural improvement using the chessboard strategy can only be realized with strict control of the metallurgical quality during the L-PBF process. Thermal profile optimization and oxygen elimination during the L-PBF process could be critical for the improved metallurgical quality and superior mechanical performance of the as-built components.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical metamaterials such as origami or ordered 3D printed structures have shown tremendous applications in science and technology. However, the main disadvantage of these systems is their dependency on a perfectly ordered structure, making them sensitive to defects. Disordered metamaterials offer a way to circumvent this sensitivity. Within disordered metamaterials, crumpled systems have recently received increased attention due to their intriguing properties such as negative Poisson’s ratio, low density, high mechanical shock absorption, and easy manufacturing process. Mechanical relaxation of these systems was successfully explained by stretched exponential and logarithmic models, typically used for complex relaxation in amorphous systems. This drove researchers to study crumpled systems as amorphous systems with a complex energy landscape. Further research remarked similarities between crumpled structures and other metastable systems such as glasses, by studying the mechanical memory effect. Edward’s statistical mechanics was also applied to crumpled systems to unravel their statistical properties. In this review, we summarize different aspects of crumpled materials and their potential to be exploited for designing new robust disordered metamaterials. Finally, we build on the current knowledge and introduce a design principle to make crumpled origami-like structures with robust mechanical responses.},

The analysis of grain boundaries (GBs) by APT allowed the quantification of the P segregation and other solute elements, in all the analyzed samples, before and after long-term ageing heat treatments. The post-weld stress-relief heat treatment applied to the samples before the ageing heat treatments leads to important GBs segregation levels. Following thermal ageing treatments allow a relative increase of GB segregation. P segregation increases with the various thermal ageing conditions. The experimental data were used to model P segregation in high-angle GBs. The simulations show that P segregation is kinetically limited by bulk diffusion, explaining the observed P segregation increase with temperature. P segregation in GBs in the CDZ of the DMW should remain low compared to the expected equilibrium segregation level during the entire reactor service. In addition to solute segregation in extended defects, APT measurements revealed the presence of Cu-rich clusters in GBs, dislocations, and grains in all the aged samples.

However, the inherent incompatibility of SBS and CR in asphalt is still a critical issue. Herein, 3D porous graphene (3DPG) with high surface area and rich micropores as reinforced additive was investigated in SBS/CR blend-modified asphalt for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate that incorporating 3DPG can effectively improve the compatibility of SBS and CR in asphalt and thus significantly enhance the high and low temperature performance and fatigue resistance of the modified asphalt, compared with that without 3DPG. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the nanopores in graphene can endow graphene with electrophilic property, providing a capability of absorbing nonpolar molecules in asphalt while the non-pore part in graphene can interact with polar molecules by conventional π − π stacking. The two forces within graphene can break the original colloidal structures of asphalt, which is conductive to the homogenous formation of SBS network and swelling of CR in asphalt, significantly promoting the pavement performance of the modified asphalt. This work presents the great potential of 3DPG as new additive to solve the inherent incompatibility of SBS/CR blend-modified asphalt for high-grade pavement engineering.},

  abstract     = {For the first time, the ultrasonic surface rolling processing (USRP) technology was applied to a real bearing raceway, and a finite element simulation model for USRP on a bearing raceway was established. Practical tests were conducted to evaluate the surface integrity of the bearing raceway before and after USRP treatment. The USRP parameters were optimized using Taguchi-gray correlation analysis. The results show that the optimal process parameters for the 7224 bearing raceway are: an amplitude of 10 μm, a static pressure of 2400 N, a spindle speed of 45 rad/min, and rolling times of 7. In the process of USRP, residual compressive stress results from inhomogeneous elastic and plastic deformation. Adjacent tempered martensitic laths merge and deflect at a certain angle along the rolling direction to form directional grain stacks, resulting in a flocculent plastic deformation layer. The USRP based on the finishing mechanism of “peak-cutting and valley-filling” can improve the surface micro-morphology, reduce roughness value Ra to approximately 0.16 μm, and effectively eliminate microscopic cracks caused by grinding. The micro-hardness of the bearing raceway surface increased from 760 HV to 840 HV under the dual action of surface grain refinement and work hardening effect.},

Such upscaling enables fair comparison of the simulated macroscopic stress–strain response with experimental results obtained for 3D printed ABS/TPU hybrid samples with a fusion-bonded interface. Overall, the stress–strain response predicted from a FEA-based model shows a good correlation with the experimental data signifying good predictive efficacy of the simulation approach. Thus, by interactively linking the molecular structures of the polymers and the processing parameters with the macroscale interfacial adhesion response of the fusion bond line, the experimentally validated comprehensive approach presented in this paper paves the way for atomistic engineering of the molecular structures as well as efficient fine tuning of processing parameters to meet desired macro-scale performance needs besides enabling exploration of the mechanisms and atomistic origins of the interfacial damage at the fused bond line.},

Fast cooling rates during low-temperature LPBF lead to metastable weakly ordered β phase, i.e., bcc–(Ti,Al,Nb) with pronounced 〈1 0 0〉 texture in build direction and nanosized segregations within grains elongated in the build direction. For high-temperature LPBF a Widmanstätten microstructure was observed with lenticular O phase precipitates within the β matrix. Microscopical and in situ high-energy synchrotron diffraction investigations demonstrate that the microstructure formation can be widely explained by the precipitation of O phase from supersaturated β rather than by a sequence of solid-state phase transformations, as it would be expected under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. A detailed analysis of the microstructural gradient in the subsurface region, however, demonstrates that precipitation from metastable β cannot fully explain the observed microstructures, and that the process energy density, i.e., the intensity of the intrinsic heat treatment of LPBF, plays a relevant role. The investigation of the graded area near the surface of the LPBF materials produced with high pre-heating temperature is particularly interesting as it reveals preferred nucleation of the O phase at subgrain boundaries and dislocations.},

In this study, a design strategy for a TPMS lattice with cell-scale regional curvature differentiation was presented. The design strategy attempts to optimize the lattice mass distribution to increase the compressive load-carrying capability. The implicit functions-based implementation ensures the simplicity and applicability of the proposed method, and guarantees the smoothness of designed lattices. The finite element (FE) approach is adopted as the primary research instrument, and validated using powder bed fusion (PBF) fabricated samples. According to these findings, the curvature ratio—a key design parameter effectively regulates the plateau stress and energy absorption of the gyroid lattice. In the compressed direction, one of the as-designed lattices has an 25\% increase in plateau stress. To enhance the compressive properties, the design strategy does not depend on altering the lattice deformation mode but rather on minimizing the stress concentration. A curvature ratio- and relative density-dependent constitutive equation derived by a modified Gibson-Ashby model is obtained and predict the plateau stress with &lt; 5\% average error.},

Nevertheless, the bioinert PEEK elicits an acute and irreducible inflammatory immune response after implantation, resulting in fibrous encapsulation and ultimately inferior osseointegration. Therefore, endowing the PEEK surface with immunomodulatory function is essential for advanced osseointegration. Herein, surface bisphosphonation of PEEK is achieved by using mussel-inspired chemistry together with alendronate, which can not only mitigate the early servious inflammatory immune response by promoting macrophages polarization toward the pro-healing M2 phenotype, but also construct a favorable osteoimmune microenvironment to promote the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the osteogenesis of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. In vivo evaluation reveals an ameliorative osseointegration of PEEK implant after surface bisphosphonation, confirming the in vitro results. Our findings elucidate that the PEEK implant after surface bisphosphonation can positively regulate early immune reaction to facilitate subsequent angiogenesis and osteogenesis processes, which is desirable for orthopedic and dental implantation.},

  abstract     = {When space solar cell array is subjected to harsh temperature cycle, such as planet orbit, thermal fatigue cracks in bonding area are easily induced. With the aim of improving bonding quality and elucidating failure mechanism of parallel gap resistance welding (PGRW) joints in temperature cycling environment, the present research investigates the effect of current density on bonding quality and thermal fatigue behavior of PGRW joint between Ag interconnector and front electrode of GaAs solar cell. When current density is set at 417 A/mm 2 , a solid diffusion bonding is achieved at the Ag/Au interface, which also possesses adequate joint strength as ensured by both pressure and input energy of PGRW. Crack initiation by thermal fatigue is found at joint edge, which subsequently propagates along the interface as the environment temperature cycling continues. Further investigation reveals that the conducted temperature cycling generates serious tensile and compressive stress in the multi-layered joint structure. Since such reciprocating forces directly induce micro-plastic deformation and strain accumulation at joint interface, failure by crack is finally generated at the joining interface.},

  abstract     = {The selection of optimal process conditions is very important for the production of large pultruded thermoplastic profiles. This study investigates the influence of pulling speed on the temperature distribution and consolidation of glass fiber/polypropylene (GF/PP) preconsolidated tapes during thermoplastic pultrusion. For this purpose, several pultruded thermoplastic profiles with a cross-section of 75 mm × 3.5 mm were produced at various pulling speeds, and their cross-sections were studied under a microscope. In addition, a 3D numerical model was developed to analyze the influence of the pulling speed on the temperature distribution and to predict the consolidation of the tapes. Full consolidation of the tapes was observed in the profiles produced at a pulling speed of 0.2 m/min. The profiles produced at a pulling speed of 0.4 m/min contained unconsolidated tape, which resulted in reduced flexural, tensile, and compressive strengths by as much as 43\%, 15\%, and 23\%, respectively. The results of the simulations and microscopic investigations show that the GF/PP tapes consolidate at temperatures above the Vicat softening temperature. Finally, a GF/PP tube with dimensions of 50 mm × 40 mm × 5 mm was produced using the optimum pulling speed and temperature determined using the developed 3D model. These results provide valuable insight into the design of thermoplastic pultrusion regimes.},

  abstract     = {Superhydrophobic coatings are gaining importance not only in military technology, industrial engineering, power systems and transportation, but also in food science and biomedicine, where they have enormous potential for real-time applications. Many research institutes have recently been working on the development of superhydrophobic blood-repellent tubes to replace clinical heparin-coated tubes during ECMO therapy, but biological toxicity and high blood adhesion have significantly hampered their practical applications. In this study, we created a cardiopulmonary bypass tube with good superhydrophobicity and blood repellency. In terms of biotoxicity, coagulation time, protein and platelet adsorption, the results show that the superhydrophobic-treated tube clotted in 36 min, compared to 21 min for a clinical Bioline heparin-coated tube and 14 min for bare PVC tube. When compared to the bare PVC tube, the clotting time of the superhydrophobic-treated tube was increased by 157\% due to the Cassie-Baxter wetting state of the resulting superhydrophobic blood-repellent coating. Meanwhile, the protein and platelet adsorption on the superhydrophobic-treated tube were decreased by 32\% and 74\%, respectively. It should be noted that we were the first to explain the superhydrophobic anti-platelet adsorption mechanism from the perspective of inhibiting thromboxane-A2 secretion during blood coagulation. Clarification of platelet activation process and activating substances is vital for understanding the anticoagulant properties of superhydrophobic coatings. On the other hand, non-inflammatory response of the organism was confirmed in the vivo experiments and the cell viability after a 48-hour cytotoxicity assay was about 101\%, indicating that the superhydrophobic-treated tubes are non-toxic.},

  abstract     = {In this study, line heat inputs are lumped to improve the computational efficiency while preserving stress directionality in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The lumped hybrid line (LHL) model predicts part distortion accurately within 10 µm of the experimental error in reasonable time. The effects of part geometry and scanning strategies on part distortion and failure during LPBF of thin-wall components are evaluated. Eight different printing patterns including different vector lengths and interlayer scan rotations for five different part lengths are studied. Simulation results show that the compressive stresses in the longitudinal and build directions create buckling, which limits subsequent layer deposition. This causes in-process part failure called the limiting build height (LBH) effect. A strong correlation between the vector length and residual stresses is shown. Longer vector lengths generate smaller compressive residual stresses along the build direction while inter-layer scan rotations homogenize the internal stresses in the scanning plane. Increasing the vector length and introducing scan rotations are useful processing strategies to improve the LBH. Moreover, part failure can be mitigated by varying the part geometry. Increasing the part thickness reduces the susceptibility to buckling and increases the LBH, whereas part length alters the failure mode.},

First, the numerical homogenization method with beam elements was used to estimate the effective thermal and elastic properties of a microlattice. Second, the topological design, subject to required geometric constraints, was formulated as a mixed integer programming problem to discover a series of multi-material microlattices that present customized isotropic values of negative thermal expansion coefficient and negative Poisson’s ratio.

Firstly, considering transducer contour size compensation, the UPS images are obtained by numerical simulation on the DD6 single-crystal material plates with different crystal orientations. Secondly, the fitting equations are obtained by analyzing the UPS images to calculate wave velocity in the thickness direction. Finally, a 5-joint UPS scanner is designed to validate the accuracy of wave velocity simulation results experimentally, and it indicates a good agreement with conventional ultrasonic velocity measurement.

Here we investigate the mechanical response upon hydrogen loading of ferritic Fe-16Cr, Fe-21Cr and Fe-4Al alloys. We use a novel in situ setup for electrochemical backside hydrogen charging during nanoindentation. Single-phase ferritic Fe-Cr binary alloys with high hydrogen diffusivity and low solubility, are ideal for in situ studies during hydrogen charging, particularly the effect of diffusible and lightly trapped hydrogen is targeted. The hardness increases linearly with increasing hydrogen content until a quasi-equilibrium state between hydrogen absorption and desorption is reached while Young&#39;s modulus remains unaffected. Above this transient region, the slope of the absolute hardness experiences a drastic decrease. The hardness variation in Fe-21Cr is anisotropic as determined for (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (1 1 1) oriented grains. Increasing the Cr content enhances the hardening effect in (1 0 0) orientation: a 16.7\% hardness increase is observed in Fe-21Cr, while Fe-16Cr, shows an increment of 10.8\%. A Fe-4Al alloy increases slightly in hardness by only 4.3\% at the applied current density of 3 mA/cm 2 . The hardening effect is caused by enhancing dislocation density, as revealed by studying the cross-section underneath the nanoindentation imprints.},

The process relies on tailor-made precursor resins rich in metal–organic and organic constituents, which can lead to carbon-based residues incorporated within the ceramic microstructures. While these are generally considered unwanted impurities, our study reveals that the presence of carbon-rich residues in the form of graphitic and disordered carbon in tetragonal ( t -) ZrO 2 can benefit the mechanical strength of TPL microstructures. In order to achieve a better understanding of these effects, we deconvolute the structural and materials contributions to the strength of the 3D microarchitectures by comparing them to plain micropillars. We vary the organic content by different thermal treatments, resulting in different crystal structures. The highest compression strength of 3.73 ± 0.21 GPa and ductility are reached for the t -ZrO 2 micropillars, which also contain the highest carbon content. This paradoxical finding opens up new perspectives and will foster the development of “brick and mortar”-like ceramic microarchitectures.},

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) characterizations reveal that both alloys consist of an ultrafine-grained face-centered-cubic (fcc) matrix, a high number density of nanoscale Y-Ti-O precipitates and a small number of (Cr 0.75 Ti 0.25 ) 2 O 3 oxides. However, the nanoscale Y-Ti-O precipitates in the two alloys show distinct phase and microstructure.

However, the traditional TCCs have no wave transmission capability. The hollow glass microspheres (HGMs) were used to prepare the coating in our work, and ZrO 2 was coated on its surface (Zr-HGM) to improve the solar reflectivity. The Zr-HGM powders were obtained by a homogeneous precipitation method with an appropriate reaction time of 4 h. By investigating the optical and dielectric properties, we found that the solar absorption of the coating with Zr-HGM was reduced by half compared to the coating with the original HGM. The microwave transmittances were all above 96.5\% from 2 to 18 GHz. Our findings have proposed a preparation method for a new CFRP-based TCC, which will ensure the stable operation of the satellite antenna.},

Experimental quantification of residual stress built-up and its relaxation at high temperatures provides the time-dependent evolution and model validation for residual stress predictions. Via in situ time-of-flight neutron diffraction, a real-time study of residual stress relaxation is carried out on Inconel 718 (IN 718) blocks with different initial residual states after oil or water quenching and annealing processes. The residual stresses are largely relieved after 14 ∼ 20 h at 718 °C, and multi-stage kinetics of relaxation are observed. The staged feature is correlated to the competing stress relaxation mechanisms in the atomic scale that are clued from the evolution of neutron diffraction data. Although with large initial discrepancy in samples due to different thermal treatments, the final residual stresses tend to be within small variations after the relaxation.},

Stable crack growth geometries—where the FIB-prepared notch stably propagates through the sample—have the potential to ameliorate some of the FIB-based challenges. In this work, we propose a new sample geometry for testing interface toughness at the micron scale which results in intrinsically stable crack growth. This geometry is straightforward to fabricate using established FIB-based methods and testing setups. We prove the stability of crack growth by finite element modelling and by experimentally applying the approach on a hard coating–silicon interface. We observe that even with small imperfections, the FIB-milled notch propagates towards the interface and the natural crack stably grows along the interface.},

On one hand, traditional bone implants with intrinsic brittle and poor recovery features hinder their immediate implantation for cranioplasty applications. On the other hand, using exogenous growth factors to enhance the osteo-bioactivity of bone implants often leads to efficacy, safety, and cost concerns. Thus far, the authors develop a growth factor-free pliable hydrogel with multiple functions for mediating endogenous growth factor production and stem cell functions in cranioplasty. The pliable hydrogels are based on GelMA networks, in which the mechanical properties and protein affinity were strengthened by the crosslinked poly (ethylene glycol) disuccinimidyl succinate (PEG-(SS) 2 ), while the antioxidant capability and osteoinductivity were remarkedly enhanced through the decoration of magnesium-seamed C-propylpyrogallol[4]arene cages (PgC 3 Mg). In vitro and in vivo results confirmed that the versatile hydrogel with excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability can improve osteogenic differentiation and cranial bone regeneration by facilitating growth factor production, endogenous cell recruitment and angiogenesis. These findings indicate that the versatile hydrogels represent a potential avenue for developing growth factor-free pliable scaffolds in cranioplasty after TBI.},

Scanning electron microscopy, mechanical testing, contact angle measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, and infrared spectrometry confirmed the successful construction of the coatings on UHMWPE without causing obvious oxidative degradation. The biofunctionalized UHMWPE surface significantly promoted cell adhesion and proliferation, and inhibited bacterial formation in vitro and in vivo . A preliminary in vivo study of canine hip replacement showed that the UHMWPE acetabular cup with the coating had good biocompatibility and promoted new bone formation and integration.

In this paper, two auxetic microstructures and three typical lattice microstructures are established, and a microscopic-macroscopic acoustic performance study scheme is established through the Johnson-Champoux-Allard-Pride-Lafarge (JCAPL) model. Auxetic-BCC porous materials have lower acoustic resistance and reactance amplitudes than many typical porous materials through experimental verification and comparative analysis of numerical calculations. The porous material&#39;s thickness and the backing cavity&#39;s thickness have similar effects on sound absorption performance when controlling a single change in structural parameters, and there is an optimum thickness. As acoustic resistance and reactance are dominant at low and high frequencies, respectively, noise reduction is better at low (high) frequencies than at minor (large) porosity, and the porosity of 76.4\%–82.0\% has the best sound absorption effect. Changes in prism length of materials with high porosity are more sensitive than those with low porosity, so the prism length with porosity of 76.4\%, 79.0\%, and 82.6\% shall be designed to be less than 1.1 mm, 0.9 mm, 0.8 mm, respectively.

We employed gradient boosting algorithmic models, such as XGBoost, LGBoost, and AdaBoost, for selecting the best feature set and constructing the most effective model from among 118 feature parameters through techniques such as three-step feature selection method, ten-fold cross-validation, and grid search. As the uneven distribution of the original dataset significantly impacts the model’s performance, we implemented five nonlinear transformation techniques and three oversampling techniques to improve the model. The results indicated that the nonlinear and oversampling techniques improved the model’s performance by improving the distribution balance. Finally, we interpreted the constructed models through Shapley additive explanation, providing relevant rules concerning GFA. The techniques employed and the rules presented herein contribute to the statistical understanding of GFA and may facilitate the discovery of novel MGs.},

The data set for ML model construction is first collected by using the Halton sequence and simulated using the finite element method (FEM). To validate the data set, the results obtained from the FEM simulation are compared with those obtained from the compression test. The Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models for Poisson’s ratio and porosity are constructed to extract important design insight. A Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) are used to analyze the sensitivity of the porosity and Poisson’s ratio to the hexachiral design parameters. GSA result shows that the strut’s thickness is the most decisive parameter that affects the Poisson’s ratio. The application of SHAP also reveals that the relationship between the strut thickness and Poisson’s ratio is nonlinear. Finally, the minimum Poisson’s ratio value is achieved by design with minimum strut thickness, minimum node radius, and maximum strut length.},

Moreover, a spring-based forelimb mechanism is designed. This mechanism not only adjusts the robot with different starting jump posture angles but also maintains a smooth landing by providing cushioning. The kinematics and efficiency models of jumping are also established by the D-H parameter method and geometric method, and they are verified and analysed.

Porous designs such as truss-based and sheet-based lattices have gained much attention in recent years due to their versatility. The multitude of lattice design possibilities, coupled with a growing list of available 3D printing materials, has provided a vast range of 3D printable structures that can be used to achieve desired performance. However, the process of computationally or experimentally evaluating many combinations of base material and lattice design for a given application is impractical. This research proposes a framework for quickly predicting key mechanical properties of 3D printed gyroid lattices using information about the base material and porosity of the structure. Experimental data was gathered to train a simple, interpretable, and accurate kernel ridge regression machine learning model. The performance of the model was then compared to numerical simulation data and demonstrated similar accuracy at a fraction of the computation time. Ultimately, the model development serves as an advancement in ML-driven mechanical property prediction that can be used to guide extension of current and future models.},

The stress–strain curve of the lattice structure, obtained from the FE simulation, agrees well with the experimental results before the condensation. According to the conducted experiments, the failure mechanism for the considered cases is bending dominated with high plastic deformation at the connection area of nodes and struts.

  abstract     = {This study is concerned with the nonlinear creep characteristics of extruded Poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) dominated by β β -phase polymorphs over the temperature range 40 °C − 80 °C and tensile stress levels between 5 MPa and 12.5 MPa. The measured data using the developed experimental setup as well as the dynamic mechanical analyzer invariably suggested a nonlinearity taking place at temperatures near to 60 °C, where α c αc -relaxation began corresponding to 100 °C above the measured glass transition temperature of PVDF-HFP. The results from accelerated testing conditions indicated the transition to tertiary creep stage at 24\% to 28\% strain, irrespective of test condition, referred to as critical strain range. Following the identification of Findley power law model constant at different test conditions, a generalized temperature- and stress-dependent model was developed with only 7 constants. The comparisons between the measured and modeled data conveyed the model effectiveness in describing the nonlinear creep characteristics of the polymer over the measured temperature and stress levels. Time-temperature-compliance master curves were consequently constructed using the developed generalized model, which in combination with the critical strain failure criterion, provided the essential design data including the maximum allowable ranges of stress and temperature for achievement of 20 years creep life.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we have investigated the stress dynamics arising from the Orthorhombic-Tetragonal Polymorphic Phase Boundary (PPB) in lead-free potassium sodium niobate (KNN)-based ceramics and its temperature dependence, as a means to elucidate the characteristics of PPBs in lead-free piezoelectric oxides. The dynamics are dictated by the phase transitions that occur upon cooling from the cubic phase and the coexistence of different crystal structures. Our findings reveal that the growth of Orthorhombic phases is constrained by the high-temperature tetragonal phase distributions. In particular, it is evidenced that two main mechanisms regulate the decrease of stress processes in which structural and microstructural effects are correlated; the first one is associated to a purely microstructural effect in which bimodal grain distribution hinders the formation of non-180° domains. By contrast, the second is mainly governed by ferroelectric domain distribution and the occurrence of pseudo-cubic regions around room temperature associated with local structural heterogeneity (that is, polar nano regions, PNRs). Specifically, these mechanisms generate regions with different stress state and explain the widening of the phase transition due the phase coexistence.},

With the increase of B content, morphologies of borides change from curved to straight, and flake shape, ribbon shape, needle/rod shape, and blocky appear in turn. Curved boride particles have a lamellar structure composed of TiB 2 and B2 layers, accompanied by the random appearance and distribution of Ti 3 B 4 and B f -TiB layers. Except for the absence of the B2 layer, straight needle-like and blocky boride particles have roughly the same structure as curved boride particles, revealing that the formation of curved boride particles is accompanied by divorced eutectic with the matrix and internal irregular eutectic, while no eutectics occurs in straight boride particles. The lack of B atoms during solidification in alloys with lower B content results in a less regular structure and higher stacking fault density of curved boride particles compared to straight boride particles in alloys with higher B content. In addition, some needle-like boride particles are observed to have pure B27-TiB structure without intergrowth. The difference in morphologies and structures can be attributed to the difference in formation mechanism and crystallographic structures of the borides.},

The deformation mechanisms and microstructure evolution were systematically studied by comparative investigation of Ti-4Al-2.5V-1.5Fe alloys with and without boron. The results indicated that the addition of boride had a significant effect on the material parameters. Furthermore, TiB greatly improved the spheroidization and recrystallization of the alloy, and it can effectively limit grain growth during thermal exposure. Consequently, both high-temperature forging and further thermal deformation facilitated the generation and retention of the fine grain structure, dramatically improving the processibility of Ti alloys. For bare alloys, severe plastic deformation often leads to inhomogeneous microstructures and flow instability, which is harmful to mechanical integrity. In contrast, the addition of borides can significantly mitigate flow localization. In this study, boron-modified titanium alloys exhibited improved processibility and beneficial mechanical properties attributed to beneficial effects due to the addition of borides, which may enable new strategies for manufacturing high-strength titanium alloys in a more cost-effective way.},

The main matrix of three alloys was L1 2 ordered phase, and Si,Ti-rich grain-boundary precipitate phase generated with the addition of Co. In Co1 alloy, distinct dual-phase core–shell structure was found within grain due to the precipitation of extra FCC disordered secondary phase, which leads to a better strength-plasticity combination (compressive strength of 3441 ± 50 MPa, and fracture strain of 46.0 ± 1.5\%) than Co0 and Co0.5 alloy at room temperature. With the increase of temperature, particular anomalous yield effect was discovered in Co1 alloy. It is clear that SFs became main deformation substructure in Co1 alloy at elevated temperature, and the interaction between non-coplanar SFs motivated the generation of L-C Locks, which assists the K-W Locks to pin dislocations movement and enhance the yield strength from room temperature to about 650 ℃. In addition, the interaction between SFs resulted in the formation of nano-spaced SF network, which contributes to the dynamic Hall-Petch effect. Finally, excellent high-temperature yield strength was achieved in as-cast Co1 alloy, which is higher than room-temperature yield strength until 950 ℃.},

  abstract     = {Most industrial hot working operations of heat treatable Al alloys are frequently comprised of several successive deformation stages, and therefore the in-depth understanding and better prediction of flow stress evolution during multi-stage thermomechanical processing are required in modern aluminum industries. In this work, the effects of pre-precipitation microstructures on the complicated flow stress behaviors of an Al-Cu-Mg-Zr alloy during multi-stage hot deformation were first investigated. Further, a new integrated model was developed to predict the multi-stage flow stress behaviors. Concretely, by considering dynamic microstructural evolution, a microstructure-based constitutive KM + Avrami model in which the parameters could be well described by the empirical relationship with the Zener-Hollomon parameter was developed to predict the whole flow stress evolutions of single-stage deformation. Then, a novel approach was proposed to describe the whole flow behaviors during multi-stage hot deformation by integrating the microstructure-based constitutive approaches and a physically-based recovery model for static softening. A good modeling capability and agreement between the modeled and experimental flow stress results was found for the studied alloy with three types of pre-precipitation microstructures. In addition, the in-depth dynamic and static softening mechanisms with the influences of pre-precipitation were also discussed based on modeling analysis and microstructural observations.},

Here, oriented microtube arrays of high-entropy decagonal quasicrystal approximants are prepared in Al 20 Si 20 Mn 20 Fe 20 Ga 20 alloy by simple melt spinning. Transmission electron microscopy revealed microtubes are mostly composed of alternating arrangements of (1/0, 2/1) quasicrystal approximant domains (lattice constants: a = 0.73 nm, b = 1.23 nm, and c = 2.24 nm) and defective (1/0, 2/1) domains. However, heat treatment leads to the change of the structure and morphology of microtubes. At 873 K, a primitive cubic phase existed, and at 973 K, microtube morphology disintegrated and the (1/0, 2/1)-related domain transformed into complex domains, showing instability. By nanoindentation testing, microtubes show the hardness of 10.9 GPa and the elastic modulus of 189.3 GPa. However, after heat treatment at 873 K, these values decreased to 5.3 GPa and 128.4 GPa, and to 3.2 GPa and 107.9 GPa at 973 K. We demonstrate that the formation of microtubes is mainly related to the temperature gradient, twinning growth of approximant domains, and also the insufficient supply of raw materials in the later stages of solidification.},

However, the underlying mechanism of the anti-site defects in γ′ precipitates that severely affect stability and performance have rarely been explored. The present work therefore specifically investigated the structural stability and mechanical properties of strictly stoichiometric and off-stoichiometric γ′-Co 3 (Al, Nb) phases by using the first-principles calculations. The results show that the change in the Al/Nb ratios in the compounds could induce the instability of the L1 2 structure, while an increase of Nb atoms leads to compounds with predominantly covalent bonds exhibiting stronger mechanical properties. After evaluating the Gibbs free energy of these γ′-Co 3 (Al, Nb) phases at finite temperature, it is found that Co 29 Al 2 Nb 1 and Co 29 Al 1 Nb 2 compounds with anti-site defects can be thermodynamically stable at greater than 710 and 905 K, respectively. Accordingly, Co-10Al-2Nb and Co-2.5Al-3Nb alloys were successfully prepared experimentally, further confirming that the γ′-Co 3 (Al, Nb) phase with anti-site defects can precipitate preferentially and remain stable during the 168 h annealing treatment.},

Recent studies have elaborated on the sensing capability of PDMS POFs, yet the in-depth analysis of the processing-property relationship of PDMS POFs remains unexplored. A straightforward processing strategy was developed for core only PDMS POFs and PDMS/THV (terpolymer of tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene, and vinylidene fluoride) core/clad POFs. The optimization of chemical formulations and process parameters such as curing temperature and curing time provided the development of POFs with tailored mechanical and optical properties. The tensile modulus of the moulded PDMS POFs could be tuned in the range of 0.2–3.0 MPa, with attenuations as low as 0.11 dB/cm in the near infrared region (NIR). Furthermore, the load and pressure sensing capability of the PDMS POFs was demonstrated with sensitivity to loads as low as 0.1 N and highly accurate pressure sensing up to 300 kPa. The systematic approach presented in this study enables the processing of elastic PDMS POFs with tunable mechanical and optical properties, which can be tailored to suitable sensing applications in the field of healthcare monitoring, biomedicine, and soft robotics.},

Bimodal microstructures were observed in all RUE deformed samples. Increasing the RUE ratio under the same cumulative strain enhanced the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) process, resulting in higher aspect ratios of deformed grains and dynamic precipitation of β phases. The bulk long period stacking ordered (LPSO) phases promoted the DRX process through a particle-stimulated nucleation mechanism, while the β phases hindered the growth of DRXed grains by a pinning effect during deformation. As the RUE ratios increased, the LPSO phase gradually aligned towards the extrusion direction. The R1P3 sample demonstrated the best balance between strength and ductility under small RUE ratio and multi-pass deformation, with ultimate tensile strength, tensile yield strength (TYS), and elongation reaching 382.5 ± 3.1 MPa, 302.3 ± 4.2 MPa, and 8.7 ± 0.5\%, respectively. The different contributions of LPSO phases strengthening and heterogeneous deformation-induced (HDI) strengthening led to variations in TYS in different samples. Adjusting the uniformity of the deformed grain size in the bimodal microstructure based on HDI strengthening can further enhance the synergistic improvement of the alloy&#39;s strength and ductility.},

However, strut based LSs suffer from a low buckling strength that limits their effectiveness in structural applications requiring high stiffness and strength. We propose a novel method for designing buckling-resistant strut-based LS by harnessing the buckling response of the base LS. A simple cubic strut LS with square cross-section struts was investigated with its buckling modes as a guide to design modified stiffened LS while maintaining the same relative density and stiffness. The weak regions in the LS were modified using conventional geometries, such as hollow rectangular, hollow hexagonal and angle designs. Experimental analysis of additively manufactured LS demonstrates increase in the buckling strength of up to 35\% can be achieved without compromising the stiffness of the LS. The numerical simulations are further validated with experimental results with discrepancy below 10\%. Finally, it was also found that the trends in the buckling strength were consistent for samples based on different relative densities and independent of material type. These results demonstrate that the current methodology can be further extended to other LSs to enhance their buckling resistance without reducing the stiffness of the base LSs.},

The manufacturing temperatures of industrially important Zr-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) relative to steels are low, and exist between the liquidus temperature T l Tl ( ∼ ∼ 850 °C) and glass transition temperature T g Tg ( ∼ ∼ 400 °C). However, these materials show limited plastic deformability (ductility) at room temperature (strains typically less than 3\%); moreover they soften but exhibit limited ductility at high processing temperatures. Their low ductility should be improved because it impedes fatigue resistance and machinability, such as via cold (plastic) forming. In this study, chemical composition changes, which reduced T g Tg , resulted in remarkably ductile BMGs with extreme deformations of over 70\% under compression, thereby enabling their energy-efficient processing at low temperatures. In contrast to previously reported conclusions on the high GFA and deformation-induced nanocrystallization being the precursors to ductility, formation of a low amount of meso-crystallites within the glassy material during cooling efficiently hindered the propagation of shear bands and microcracks under loading, thus increasing significantly ductility. This characteristic, in addition to optimal chemical composition, played an important role in improving the ability of BMGs to undergo solid-state processing at low temperatures and increased deformation rates.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge of the liquidus is important for the design and processing of many materials. For instance, deep eutectics are important for the design of metallic glasses, and recently multi-principal element alloys have been designed based on eutectic compositions or melting temperatures extrapolated from binary liquidus data. In this study, we provide a general framework for predicting binary liquidus only from the properties of the pure elements and thermodynamic properties calculated by Miedema’s model. Our framework combines three machine learning models that are trained and evaluated on liquidus data collected from 466 CALPHAD assessments of binary phase diagrams. The first model predicts the formation of liquid miscibility gaps with a prediction accuracy of 95.3\%, outperforming the empirical Mott model. The second and third models predict the equilibrium onset temperature of solidification and the critical temperature of liquid miscibility gaps, respectively. An important feature of our models is that they can give indications of the presence of congruent melting phases and eutectics. Using our framework, we predict the liquidus in 1563 binary systems not included in our CALPHAD dataset, many of which are unknown. By collecting more data, our framework will continue to grow towards better liquidus prediction.},

Increasing effort has been spent on the inoculation of these intermetallics, hoping to promote a finer distribution. Recently Al-5Ti-1B (wt.\%), originally developed to refine α α -Al, has been shown to refine Al 13 Fe 4 , an intermetallic phase present in a variety of Al alloys. However, mechanisms of the formation and growth of the intermetallics on the inoculants are unclear. In this paper, Ti is added to Fe-containing Al alloys to produce a large number of potent Al 3 Ti particles, the active inoculant in Al-5Ti-1B. We use a combination of electron backscattered diffraction, in situ synchrotron X-ray radiography and post-solidification X-ray computed tomography to investigate the formation and growth of primary Al 13 Fe 4 on Al 3 Ti inoculants, first in a model Al-Fe alloy, with key insights then confirmed in a high Fe-containing, recycled 6xxx alloy. Crystallographic orientation relationships between Al 13 Fe 4 and Al 3 Ti are analysed comprehensively, and the formation and growth dynamics of Al 13 Fe 4 on Al 3 Ti is also unveiled. A strong link is revealed between the formation of Al 13 Fe 4 on Al 3 Ti and a twinning-related pseudo-symmetry of Al 13 Fe 4 . Finally, a potential strategy to refine both intermetallics and α α -Al in recycled alloys with elevated Fe concentration is proposed.},

In this paper, a synergic anti-scaling Cu-Zn-CeO 2 coating on the pipeline steel substrate was fabricated by one-step composite electrodeposition and magnetic stirring. It shows the wettability transition from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic of the multi-scale structured Cu-Zn-CeO 2 coating without low-surface-energy modification after heating at 60℃ for 60 min and stored in air for ∼ 35 days. The wettability transition is owing to the hydrocarbons adsorption. The heating treatment and the multi-scale structure improve the hydrocarbons adsorption and reduce the transition time. The inherent hydrophobic CeO 2 is beneficial for the superhydrophobic property and reduces the transition time. Compared with the steel substrate and previous superhydrophobic Cu and Cu-Zn coatings, it indicates the superhydrophobic Cu-Zn-CeO 2 coating shows the promising synergic anti-scaling property due to its superhydrophobicity and the anti-scaling property of Cu-Zn alloys. This eco-friendly synergic anti-scaling Cu-Zn-CeO 2 coating also shows excellent self-cleaning and anti-fouling properties. Moreover, the stability of the superhydrophobic Cu-Zn-CeO 2 coating was enhanced compared with our previous superhydrophobic Cu-Zn coating due to CeO 2 nanoparticles. This research enriches the theory and the technology of the wetting field, which also provides a technical basis for solving scaling problems of pipelines.},

  abstract     = {High performance sheet metals with a multi-phase microstructure suffer from deformation induced damage formation during forming in the constituent phases but importantly also where these intersect. To capture damage in terms of the physical processes in three dimensions (3D) and its stochastic nature during deformation, two challenges remain to be tackled: First, bridging high resolution analysis towards large scales to consider statistical data and, second, characterising in 3D with a resolution appropriate for sub-micron sized voids at a large scale. Here, we present how this can be achieved using panoramic scanning electron microscopy (SEM), metallographic serial sectioning, and deep-learning assisted automatic image analysis. This brings together the 3D evolution of active damage mechanisms with volumetric and environmental information for thousands of individual damage sites. We also assess potential surface preparation artefacts in 2D analyses. Overall, we find that for the material considered here, a dual phase (DP800) steel, martensite cracking is the dominant but not sole origin of deformation induced damage and that for a quantitative comparison of damage density, metallographic preparation can induce additional surface damage density far exceeding what is commonly induced between uniaxial straining steps.},

In this study, we report formation of heterogeneous nonequilibrium microstructures in near-equiatomic NiTi fabricated via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing, and further discuss their underlying formation mechanisms and influences on shape memory effect of the LPBF NiTi. Specifically, the heterogeneous microstructures include the core (HCP α-Ti)-shell (Ti 2 Ni) structural nano-sized precipitation phases in columnar grains, which were resulted from high undercooling and cooling rate during LPBF solidification, the intermediate R phase in cellular and columnar grains, which was stemmed from residual thermal stress during LPBF, the nano-sized cellular substructure in columnar grains with boundaries decorated with Ti 2 Ni precipitates, which was originated from enriched Ti atoms at the solidification front during directional and orderly solidification of melt pools, together with the abundant dislocations. Interestingly, the two-way shape memory strain of 0.8\% in LPBF NiTi was obtained by cycle loading–unloading-heating–cooling training process. These findings achieved in this work enrich the knowledge on formation mechanism of heterogeneous microstructures in LPBF NiTi SMAs, and further pave the way for engineering applications of two-way shape memory effect of LPBF NiTi shape memory alloys.},

Traditional methods of designing cellular materials typically rely on trial and error or iterative optimization, which often leads to limited productivity and high computational costs. While data-driven approaches have been explored for the inverse design of cellular materials, many of these methods lack robustness and fail to consider the manufacturability of the generated structures. This study aims to develop an efficient inverse design methodology that accurately generates mechanical metamaterial while ensuring the manufacturability of predicted structures. To achieve this, we have created a comprehensive dataset that spans a broad range of mechanical properties by applying rotations to cubic structures synthesized from the nine cubic symmetries of cubic materials. We then employ a physics-guided neural network (PGNN) consisting of dual neural networks: a generator network, which serves as the inverse design tool, and a forward network, which acts as a physics-guided simulator. The goal is to generate desired anisotropic stiffness components with unit-cell design parameters. The results of our inverse model are examined with three distinct datasets and demonstrate high computational efficiency and prediction accuracy compared to conventional methods.},

Crumpling is an alternative to develop three-dimensional structures by randomly folding a sheet of material and offering a simple yet effective method to generate a unique, stiff and lightweight three-dimensional structure with minimal processing. Here, composite films made from polylactic acid (PLA), and exfoliated graphite (EG) were elaborated using solvent casting method. Additional pore formation is achieved adding calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) particles as porogen. Films were characterized to corroborate the integration of exfoliated graphite to the PLA matrix as well as crystallinity changes due to EG and CaCO 3 particles. Microscopy help to identify pore formation after CaCO 3 remotion. Tensile tests, after increasing EG concentration in PLA, corroborate the formation of stiffer films with lower tensile strength, while pore formation decreased tensile strength and Young&#39;s modulus. After adding 0.5\% wt. of EG, tensile strength partially recovered while Young&#39;s modulus was maintained. Composite films allowed to obtain 3D crumpled structures. Tests under compression help finding that 0.5\% wt. of EG in PLA matrix resulted in a yield strength (26.6 MPa) and Younǵs modulus (32.5 MPa) increase, making necessary the application of considerable force to deform them.},

However, their development is hampered by the lack of room-temperature printable liquid crystal (LC) photoresists. Here, we developed new light-responsive LC photoresists by incorporating novel conjugated polymers (CPs) as photothermal agents for the DLW-TPP technology. The CPs displayed a remarkable photothermal effect and effectively avoided the aggregation problems that always happened for inorganic nanoparticles in photoresists. Moreover, the CPs incorporation lowered the nematic-to-isotropic temperature of the LC photoresists which is beneficial for room-temperature DLW-TPP. The printing parameters, including laser power and scanning speed, were investigated using the developed LC photoresists. It was found the range of printing parameters decreased with the increase of the CPs loading fraction from 0.1 to 0.5 wt\%, which was attributed to the high photothermal conversion efficiency (52.7\%). A well-defined CPs/LCEs microactuator with CPs as low as 0.3 wt\% was printed, which could achieve a large 25.0\% actuation strain in 5 s upon near-infrared (NIR) light stimulation. It could be used for thriving soft micro-robotics and micro-membranes with controllable separation capabilities.},

However, their high processing costs remain a major obstacle to their commercialization. This research offers a practical guideline to significantly reduce production costs through tailored alloy design and precise control of thermoplastic forming (TPF) process parameters. Specifically, we discovered commercially available MGs with a low glass transition temperature ( T g ) can be developed in the Zr-rich alloy systems. Moreover, we addressed the challenge of maintaining a wide TPF window in Be-free Zr-based MGs while keeping T g low. Our research has yielded the development of Be-free Zr-rich multicomponent MGs with a low T g below 350 °C (623 K) and a wide TPF window of over 70 K, resulting in excellent thermoplastic formability (TPFA). Notably, the MGs we developed exhibit a lower T g than advanced engineering plastics like Polyimide and Polybenzimidazole, which suggests that the TPF process of plastics could be extended to MGs. In addition, we employed Flash-DSC to accurately identify the TPF window and TPFA according to the heating rate in a wide range from 10 -1 to 10 4 K/s, and proposed novel TPFA parameters that are based on continuous heating transformation diagram with iso -viscosity contours. Our findings demonstrate that even marginal MGs have a significant advantage in manufacturing micro-to-nano scale products that can be molded at ultra-fast heating rates, similar to advanced engineering plastics. Indeed, this work will undoubtedly inspire us to further explore the potential of MGs as a practical material for industrial applications.},

However, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed noticeable amounts of crystallites in limiting compositions with x = 20 at\% and x = 60 at\%. Glass transition and crystallization temperatures grow with increasing Ag content, while room-temperature resistivity and temperature coefficient of resistance are shown to be highly sensitive to the amount of crystalline phase.

Upon rapid remelting process, the recast layer converts to a γ solid solution with its outer layer (∼0.4 μm thick) decorated by densely dispersed Al-rich oxide nanoparticles. Such a particulate-reinforced composite possesses a nanohardness 55\% higher than the base metal. The severely deformed layer with denser dislocations in the γ matrix than in the γ′ interior forms a 400 μm-deep work-hardened layer. Under cyclic loads, the near-surface structure still preserves the SX structure with increased stacking faults density in the γ matrix. Despite increased surface roughness, the synergistic action of compressive residual stress, work hardening, and heterogeneous near-surface microstructure prolongs the fatigue life of SX superalloys by ∼36.5\%. This work sheds light on the development of novel surface-strengthening techniques for engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {A bottleneck in the development of high-strength non-oriented silicon steels for drive motors of new energy vehicles is the balance of strength and magnetic properties. This paper successfully tackled this problem through the optimization of thickness reduction for hot and cold rolling and the formation of coherent precipitates using a Cu-alloyed non-oriented silicon steel. More specifically, a thickness reduction of 96\% in the course of hot rolling promoted the homogenization of microstructure during the following normalization treatment. Subsequently, a deformation degree of 80\% during cold rolling ensured the inheritance of the uniform microstructure and inhibited the abnormal growth of recrystallized grains during annealing, thereby suppressing the iron loss to a value as low as 15.6 W/kg. At the meantime, this combined process promoted the inheritance of λ-fibers and the formation of {114}〈481〉 texture in the annealed sheet, improving the magnetic induction intensity B 50 to 1.606 T. In addition, under the joint effect of a variety of strengthening mechanisms, the yield strength of this annealed sheet reached 668 MPa. A pronounced increase in strength, about 207 MPa, was derived from precipitation hardening by the great difference in the modulus between coherent Cu-rich clusters and the α-Fe matrix.},

This paper integrates laser ultrasonics and Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT) to characterize the corrugated interface accurately. A photoacoustic platform is developed for the non-contact automatic acquisition of laser ultrasonic signals, and these signals are filtered and gated to achieve high-quality imaging. Meanwhile the effect of signal acquisition efficiency on imaging quality is also discussed. Since the ultrasonic excitation point is separated from the detection point in this experiment, an interface profile calculation method based on the ellipses’ common tangent line is developed, and the double-layer imaging of the corrugated clad plate is realized using the fitting curve of the interface profile and Fermat’s principle. The results show that the image obtained by this method are consistent with the results obtained by the 3D surface profiler and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), which indicates that this method can not only provides an essential reference for the research of corrugated rolling process, but also provides new approaches for non-contact non-destructive-testing applications in the materials processing industry.},

It is demonstrated that the ANN calibrated KMC model can predict quantitatively the microstructure evolution of NiO-YSZ composite. The microstructural parameters such as volume fraction, specific surface area, and triple-phase boundary length density of sintered NiO-YSZ are well predicted within acceptable errors. The proposed framework can be adapted for the simulation of the microstructure evolution of any other composite electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells and other composites fabricated by sintering.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite oxide heterostructures exhibit a series of correlated electronic functionalities, associated with the coupling among the lattice, charge, spin and orbital orderings. As a fundamental thermodynamic parameter, temperature measurement is critical to both fundamental research and practical devices. To date, most of temperature sensing for heterostructures are based on electrical resistance-based thermometry. However, they are sensitive to environmental conditions as well as electromagnetic interference, and are impractical in harsh environments or close systems due to the direct contact operation mode. Contactless optical thermometry based on lanthanide luminescence appears as a promising alternative technique, and aims to bypass abovementioned limitations. Herein, we propose a reliable fluorescence intensity ratio-type optical thermometer based on the thermally coupled energy levels of Er 3+ , which allows remote probing the temperature variation in a series of perovskite heterostructures. Especially, the proposed optical thermometry also enables in-situ characterization of phase transition occurred in the perovskite heterostructures. Our work demonstrates the great potential of optical thermometry in the exploration of thermal phenomena in perovskite oxide heterostructures.},

Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear, and there has been no study to quantify this behavior. To fill the research gap, multiscale characterization and modeling on AC were performed in this study. At the microscale level, nanoindentation tests were conducted to characterize the aggregate contact characteristics in the contact region (CR). The CR was found to have a sandwich-like structure consisting of two interfacial layers, large filler particles, and asphalt mastic. Accordingly, micromechanical models of CR were developed to predict its mechanical behavior in tension and compresison (T&amp;C). The modeling results showed that aggregate contacts significantly increase the compressive modulus, leading to the substantial TC asymmetry of CR. The predicted viscoelastic properties of CR were further applied to the developed mesostructural model of AC. The predicted master curves in T&amp;C showed significant asymmetry and quantitatively agreed with the experimental ones, demonstrating the effectiveness of the adopted modeling approaches. This study is the first study to quantify the asymmetric performance of AC. The outcomes can be applied to evaluate AC’s TC asymmetry effects on pavement performance.},

In this work, we propose an approach introducing a priori knowledge into data-driven structural optimization of IMSs at low frequencies (0–10 kHz), reaching a 31.78\% decrease of average TL compared to conventional impedance-gradient designs. Contradicting the long-standing wisdom (impedance-gradient), an impedance-jumping layer appears in the optimized structure, which is revealed to lower TL at frequencies 0–5 kHz but at a cost of TL increasing at higher frequencies (5–10 kHz). Then the introduction of inhomogeneity alleviates this degeneration and enhances the overall performance of the IMSs. The methodology and results in this work motivate the novel designs of high-performance acoustic metamaterials for waterborne applications.},

Fibres are represented as rigid chains of discrete element method particles and we compress systems of fibres in a representative volume element periodic in three dimensions. In the used electric resistor network method, the particles are used as discretisation points to construct a system of linear equations linking the particle conductivities to their local electric potentials and in turn allowing for predictions on the electric macroscale properties of the fibre system. A carried out dimensional analysis suggests suitable scaling laws to unify different macroscale fibre systems in two different regimes - a percolating and a conductive regime. The dimensionless macroscale conductance is found to depend on the percolation threshold and percolation probability. It is moreover found that the critical solid volume fraction for rigid fibres is not only dependent on the fibre aspect ratio, but can also depend on the compression height of the system. Additionally, correlations between transmittance and solid volume fractions are found allowing for possibly simple solid volume fraction estimations in experiments.},

The decrease of Mg/Al ordering changes the interlayer spacing of LDHs and improves the defect sites with low oxygen coordination on the LDHs laminate, which enhances the removal efficiency of CR from 45.6 to 97.7\%. This study reveals that a defect enhancing combined mechanism of surface adsorption and the anion-exchange in MgAl-LDHs can obtain an outstanding adsorption efficiency for removing CR. The reactivity of the Mg/Al disorder with O defect on the LDHs laminate increases with the reduction of frontier orbitals energy gap (Δ E gap ), resulting in a high adsorption capacity for CR.

  abstract     = {A unique deposition approach combining atomic layer deposition (ALD) and magnetron sputtering was used to fabricate a series of thin film multilayer structures of Al (50 nm) and Al 2 O 3 (ALD, 2.4–9.4 nm) on flexible polymer substrates without breaking vacuum. The multilayers together with 50 nm and 150 nm Al reference films were analyzed by cross-sectional TEM analysis and experimentally strained in biaxial tension to investigate their deformation behavior. Al film stresses and peak widths, measured in situ with Synchrotron X-ray diffraction, are in good agreement with post-mortem surface SEM and through-thickness FIB analysis of the multilayers. It was revealed that brittle cracking of the multilayer can be avoided, and that the lateral and through-thickness crack resistance improve as a function of decreasing oxide layer thickness. An attempt to model the full biaxial yield surface of the multilayers, which remains experimentally challenging, appears to be valid up to 2.4 nm oxide thickness. Model predictions are further compared to compression data, obtained from the unloading segments of the tensile tests. Describing the mechanical behaviour under multiaxial stress conditions is of utmost importance for a diverse understanding of these multilayers across a variety of potential carrier systems and loading cases.},

  abstract     = {Photo-induced actuators enable potential applications involving soft robots, biomedical engineering, and microelectromechanical system due to the contactless energy supply and high spatial and temporal controllability of light. However, obtaining a fast and reliable photo-induced actuation remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a strategy to realize rapid photo-induced actuation by utilizing a composite actuation mechanism, which combines photoelectric effect and electrostatic actuation mechanism. Novel photo-induced PLZT-based electrostatic actuators (PPEAs) are then proposed towards micro gap regulator (MGR) and micro gripper. Within the electrostatic pull-in point, we demonstrate that the gap of the PPEA regarded as an MGR can be tunable upon light irradiation through simulations. Besides, the pull-in instability enables the PPEA with rapid clamping action to be a micro gripper. Micro grippers with sandwich-like multilayer arms are fabricated using a simplified photolithography process and the fundamental operation and performance of our gripper are demonstrated through a series of experiments. More importantly, the two developed components are driven rapidly and reliably by light, providing great potential to facilitate the current research in photo-induced actuation.},

In this study, a new method—single source with series modifications (SSSM)—was optimized for preparing a high-quality MC, and aluminum-rich clay (kaolin) was activated with a multistep treatment that included calcination (Cal), acid etching with alkali neutralization (Al–An), and raw clay supplementation and aging (RSA). The results showed that the removal efficiency of Prorocentrum donghaiense by the SSSM–MC exceeded 85\%; Cal, Al–An, and RSA were indispensable processing steps for preparing the best MC with the SSSM method. The changes occurring in the mineral structure and chemical composition of kaolin treated by the different steps were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, 27 Al-NMR and Al-Ferron. Surface dehydroxylation and disruption of the kaolin lattice after calcination significantly changed the aluminum structure from Al VI to Al V and Al IV . The relatively reactive Al V was readily released from the kaolin lattice with acid etching, and it subsequently reacted with external OH – to generate different polyhydroxyaluminum species because alkali was added during the Al–An step. The acidity of the above complex was further decreased by RSA, greatly increasing the yield of SSSM–MC while assuring the quality.},

This study prepared a multifunctional composite composed of a “sandwich” electrospun nanofibrous membrane with sustained drug release property and adhesives for sutureless application. The composite was assessed here through microscopic, spectroscopic, wettability, rheological, mechanical, and drug release analyses. The results of these characterizations are consistent with the characteristics of anti-adhesion biomaterials. In addition, the anti-adhesion effectiveness was demonstrated in fibroblasts and rats. Briefly, the composite not only decreased the proliferation, viability, and penetration of fibroblasts but also repressed cell spreading on the material surface by regulating Yes-associated protein (YAP) and inhibited oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) simultaneously in vitro. Meanwhile, histological analysis, functional tests, gross observation, and protein analysis in vivo showed that composite was effective in reducing tendon adhesion formation. Hence, we draw the conclusion that our composite can protect tendons from peritendinous adhesion after injury and provide a new direction for future application of peritendinous anti-adhesion.},

Repairing senile osteoporosis fractures is a great challenge, but a desirable way to address this issue is by developing multifunctional titanium(Ti) implants with antiaging and pro-osteogenic effects. Herein, to endow TI substrate with an antiaging effect for enhanced bone formation, an exercise-induced myokine(irisin) was loaded on titanium dioxide nanotubes(TNTs) and then a multilayered structure composed of chitosan(Chi) and gelatin(Gel) was constructed on the substrates via a layer-by-layer-assembly technique(TNT-IR-LBL). The surface topography of TNT-IR-LBL was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy(AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) and water contact angle measurements, respectively. As an exercise-induced myokine, the irisin secreted from skeletal muscle exhibits strong activity for against the chronic diseases. The implants synthesized here displayed good biocompatibility towards osteoblasts. Moreover, irisin was sustainably released from TNT-IR-LBL for more than 3 weeks. In vitro studies indicated the TNT-IR-LBL substrates promoted osteoblast differentiation. In addition, compared to bare titanium, TNT-IR-LBL significantly promoted new bone formation around the implant interface in senile osteoporosis rats 4 weeks after implantation. Overall, this study provides a promising candidate to develop Ti-based orthopaedic implants to repair senile osteoporosis fractures.},

  abstract     = {Constitutional supercooling and backmelting are common interface instability phenomena that occur during crystal growth and induce serious component inhomogeneity and defect proliferation; these flaws impede further crystalline devices. However, the interpretation and prevention of the above instabilities are extremely difficult because of the elusive melt convection behavior and extreme crystal growth environments. Herein, we use the growth velocity-related growth interface electromotive force (GEMF) to visualize the interface instability and trace the crystallization kinetics in situ , which can even predict the intrinsic unstable growth induced by components segregation (constitutional supercooling) and melt convection (backmelting). This factor further determines the real-time upper and lower limits of the critical growth velocity, squeezing a unique stable growth region. The predicted stable region complies well with the macro-tomography of the as-grown boules. Besides, 2D and 3D micro-mappings indicate ion segregation saturation due to the onset of constitutional supercooling. On this basis, a quantitative criterion for understanding and preventing critical interface instability is proposed. This GEMF-based method can help us understand ions migration and solidification under critical conditions, and further, be used to optimize the growth parameters of bulk single crystals and alloys, or manipulate the instability phenomena to fabricate natural unique microstructures.},

  abstract     = {Biomimetic surface modification of scaffolds with osteoinductive molecules is a promising strategy for improving the bioactivity of scaffold and stimulating stem cell signals in bone tissue engineering. Zirconia (ZrO 2 ) offers excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility, but its bio-inert nature hinders its use in bone regeneration applications. Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 7 (rhBMP-7) and arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) peptide were investigated for their potential use as surface-modifying biomolecules on the ZrO 2 scaffold. Our results showed that human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) were induced to osteogenic differentiation by rhBMP-7 and RGD in a dose-dependent manner. Significantly enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity and up-regulated expression of osteogenic genes in hDPSCs were associated with rhBMP-7 and RGD grafting onto the ZrO 2 scaffold. Western blot analysis revealed that rhBMP-7 and RGD grafting led to activation of the SMAD1/5, p38 MARK, and ERK signaling pathways during hDPSCs differentiation. After 4 and 8 weeks of transplantation, the hDPSCs-seeded ZrO 2 -RGD-BMP-7 scaffold facilitated osteogenic differentiation and enhanced in vivo bone formation in critical-sized calvarial bone defects. The results support the simultaneous use of rhBMP-7 and RGD as surface-modifying biomolecules and hDPSCs as a source of osteogenic stem cells in conjugation with ZrO 2 -based porous scaffold for bone tissue engineering.},

One promising approach to fill this gap involves the development of innovative piezoelectric scaffolds for improved bone regeneration. Scaffolds with the appropriate piezoelectricity can positively influence the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to regenerate bone tissue, since surface electrical charges play a key role in the mechanotransduction process. In this work, polymeric-based composite scaffolds with piezoelectric properties intended for bone tissue engineering are reviewed. Special attention is paid to biocompatible, piezoelectric polymers that show suitable properties to be processed by additive manufacturing techniques. Previous works on composite scaffolds based of these polymeric matrices and containing piezoceramic additives are summarized. The use of piezoelectric nanostructured composite formulations containing lead-free ceramic oxide nanoparticles with perovskite structure is highlighted. Also, different commonly applied mechanical stimuli to activate the piezoelectric effect of the developed materials are presented.

Owing to its unique micro-architecture, the sandwich plate successfully underwent adequate convex deformation under bending, even when many chips were embedded in its core. However, the plate was fabricated by adhesively bonding stainless-steel face sheets to a polymer truss core, and this fabrication process was complex and expensive. Moreover, the detailed dimensions of this plate were determined iteratively through trial-and-error. In this study, we develop a fresh approach to monolithically fabricate the entire body of the auxetic plate from a polymer by using three-dimensional printing. First, three mechanical constraints, which are needed for designing the face sheets and the core to realize compliant and convex deformation, unlike that of an ordinary sandwich plate, are defined. A precise mechanical design procedure is applied for dimensional optimization of the plate, and the mechanical behaviors of the fabricated specimen are observed by subjecting it to tensile and bending loads. The optimally designed polymer specimen exhibited a high level of convex deformation, as indicated by its adequate flexural rigidity ( D = 0.0565 Nm 2 ) and curvature ratio (0.625) when bent to the minimum curvature radius of ρ = 150 mm.},

  abstract     = {Artificial bone scaffolds with a porosity of ≥64\% were manufactured using hydroxyapatite (HA). The Freeze-gel Casting method using tert -butyl alcohol (TBA) as a solvent was adopted to maintain proper mechanical strength. The manufactured HA scaffold had excellent internal connectivity owing to the continuous connection of the long columnar pores and arrangement of the constant pore walls. For the HA scaffold, compression tests at different strain rates under uniaxially compressed loads were performed, and the compressive behavior according to the strain rate was analyzed. A maximum yield stress of 2–3 MPa was observed, and the overall compressive behavior was divided into elastic, plateau, and densification sections, which were different from the brittleness behavior of ordinary ceramics and similar to that of polymer materials. The compressive behavior of the HA scaffold was successfully simulated by applying the Frank–Brockman–Zairi constitutive model used to simulate elasto-viscoplastic material behavior. Seven material parameters belonging to the constitutive equation were proposed for the HA scaffold by adopting a deterministic approach for material parameter identification. Models can be developed from methods for simulating the mechanical behavior of a porous ceramic scaffold to predict the long-term mechanical behavior of the scaffold inserted in vivo, which may help in bone defects recovery.},

  abstract     = {In thick unidirectional glass fiber-reinforced composites, the out-of-plane embedded wrinkle flaws have a major impact on compressive failure, which should be taken into account and assessed during the design, manufacturing, and inspection phases. The thick unidirectional coupons with embedded wrinkles of various severities were manufactured and tested. The deformation of the wrinkle region was captured by the Digital Image Correlation (DIC). As the wrinkle angle increased, the compressive failure stress decreases and the modulus does not change significantly, while the wrinkle amplitude has a negative effect on both the compressive failure stress and elastic modulus. The linear texture image regression approach is used to account for the path of fibers. The high-fidelity three-dimensional finite element (FE) models considering the real paths of the fibers are established. To reveal the interplay and impact of wrinkle severity parameters on the compressive failure behavior of composites, the progressive damage analyses and cohesive elements are also incorporated. Compared with the experiments, the FE studies accurately identify the dominant failure modes and failure stress values for various wrinkle severity parameters.},

In inguinal hernia repair, PP mesh may have a negative effect on the reproductive system. In this study, the protective effect of an electrospun fibrous membrane was investigated in an autologous control experiment of inguinal hernia repair in rabbits. Tissue adhesions, obstructions of the spermatic cord, orchiatrophy, and reproductive system abnormalities were highly correlated and mainly appeared soon after implantation. The fibrous membrane, which serves as a biocompatible physical barrier, successfully reduced the deformity and dysfunction of the spermatic cord, testicle, and reproductive system, while polypropylene mesh caused severe damage. In the sub-chronic and chronic stages, at 90 and 180 days, respectively, the peritonealization of the remaining mesh was in the process while the fibrous membrane was degrading. The structure and function of the spermatic cord, testicle, and reproductive system were well protected and maintained because the newly formed tissue prevented contact between the mesh and the spermatic cord. Thus, introducing a fibrous membrane in inguinal hernia repair reduces the adverse effects of polypropylene mesh.},

Most studies have focused on the functionalization of scaffolds for osteoinduction and osteoconduction for bone regeneration. However, in our previous study, we found that shape conformity between a defect and the scaffold was also a major factor with regard to enhancing bone regeneration. Thus, in this study, we performed a quantitative analysis of the shape conformity between the defect and scaffold using several novel experimental scaffolds. Employing several scaffolds with different conformities that increased linearly, the degree of bone regeneration was analyzed through new bone volume measurements and a histological analysis in conjunction with an in vivo experiment using rat calvaria. For the quantitative analysis, we compared the new bone volume reconstructed from a three-dimensional model based on CT data. New bone maturation was analyzed with respect to shape conformity through a histological analysis. Proliferation, maturation, and new bone formation were promoted by scaffold shape conformity. Thus, for bone regeneration, the AM precision and the fabrication technique are critical as the shape conformity of the scaffold to the bone defect is highly dependent on AM fabrication errors.},

  abstract     = {This work identifies sources of error in melt pool characterization tests that are frequently employed to study processing parameters in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing (AM). At an early stage in process parameter development, researchers typically characterize the shape of single, non-overlapping melt tracks formed with varying processing conditions such as laser power and scanning velocity. However, as L-PBF enters mainstream manufacturing, researchers must test the limits of these commonly relied-upon characterization experiments to avoid errors that could impact process development. Hence, this study expands on conventional methods by depositing single-tracks and overlapping multitracks on a powder layer at multiple interpass temperatures, thereby mimicking heat buildup during the manufacturing of a multilayer part. While single-track melt pool depth and width do not increase as a function of interpass temperature as expected, multitrack experiments demonstrate a clear gradient in both melt pool depth, width and bead height between the first and final tracks. This work quantitatively demonstrates that the setup of single-track characterization experiments has a notable impact on the process parameter development. Alternatively, multitrack experiments closely capture the deposition conditions and melt pool variability observed during multilayer part fabrication.},

The relationship between the composition and performance of photocatalysts during doping and loading of single-atom is explained through electronic properties, and their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance is explored. Loading and doping have a synergistic effect on the modification of ZrO 2 , and doping effectively improves its catalytic performance. Among them, P doping greatly reduces the Gibbs free energy of the reaction. After the introduction of Pt single atoms, Pt@ZrO 2 (1 1 1)-P still has the best structure for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and the good surface electronic activity significantly improves the hydrogen evolution reaction(HER) activity (free energy of −0.01 eV).

Biomembrane nanostructures ( e.g., exosomes and cell membrane-derived nanostructures) are characterized by superior biocompatibility, intrinsic targeting ability and immune-modulating properties. However, their application is greatly limited by uncontrolled drug release and insufficient responsiveness, which can be overcome by metal nanostructures with distinct physicochemical properties ( e.g., optoelectronic and magnetic properties). Therefore, the combination of these two nanostructures (defined as biomembrane and metal nanostructures [BMNs]) may facilitate the development of innovative nanostructures with multiple functions for cancer theranostics. BMNs have attractive advantages such as enhanced biocompatibility, natural targeting ability, intelligent responsiveness and controlled drug release, which are important for developing next-generation cancer nanostructures. This review summarizes recent advances in BMNs in cancer theranostics and highlights different types of engineering approaches and theranostic mechanisms. A series of engineering strategies for combining different biomembrane nanostructures, including liposomes, exosomes, cell membranes and bacterial membranes, with different metal nanostructures (gold, silver and copper) are summarized. The combination strategy can greatly enhance the targeting, intelligence and functionality of BMNs, thereby serving as a stronger cancer theranostic method.

Conventional antibiotics can mitigate bacterial load; however, they fail to inhibit bone resorption and the inflammatory response. To enhance bone regeneration during bacterial infection, an optimal therapeutic strategy should not only eradicate bacteria but also inhibit inflammation and osteolysis. In this study, we fabricated a multi-biofunctional coating, designated MSNs-BMP4-EN, by covalently immobilizing mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with human bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and loading with enoxacin (EN) for antibacterial effect with inhibiting inflammation and osteolysis. Antimicrobial assessments revealed that MSNs-BMP4-EN markedly obstructed bacterial adhesion and colonization. Subsequent in vitro assessments demonstrated that it facilitated osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cell and impeded early osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, MSNs-BMP4-EN effectively restrained the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, thereby counteracting the infection-induced inflammatory milieu and promoting bone regeneration. Collectively, these findings indicate that MSNs-BMP4-EN exhibits excellent antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and bone resorption inhibitory attributes during initial stages of bone-related infection, thereby further improving bone regeneration. As a result, this bioactive nanocomposite has excellent prospects for treating bone infections.},

  abstract     = {Metakaolin (MK) has emerged as a highly promising supplementary material in low carbon binders for the construction industry. In wide range of applications, from lime to cement–based materials, its hardening performance relies on the pozzolanic reactivity between MK and calcium hydroxide (CH), resulting in the formation of diverse calcium-aluminate/silicate hydrates. The reaction sequence is affected by specific conditions dictated by the binder system employed in various applications. To advance the design of binders that reduce the carbon emissions, a systematical review on MK-based reactions is crucial. This review encompasses a broad range of MK/CH ratios and examines the effect of alkali hydroxides, carbonates and sulfates. The focus is on the formation and stability of pozzolanic hydrate phases over time and under different curing temperatures. Additionally, the review addresses the characteristics that directly affect MK reactivity, such as the (calcined) clay structure and the dissolution of the reactants. The systematic findings shed light on the hydrate phase assemblage, enabling a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms in complex systems, like MK cementitious blends. The results of this review serve as a valuable foundation for the development of novel “low-carbon” binder designs and compositions for both cementitious and lime-based binders.},

  abstract     = {Flexible conductive fibers have attracted significant attention in the wearable electronics field because of light weight, small size, and easy shape morphing. To date, there are few reports on multifunctional flexible conductive fibers. Finding a facile and effective solution for large-scale production of flexible conductive fibers is still a challenge. In this work, a flexible core-sheath fiber with excellent electrical conductivity (24.71 Ω·m) and visible light sensing is fabricated, which contains a merocyanine diol (MC(OH) 2 )/CrCl 3 ·6H 2 O/ethanol aqueous solution core layer and a silicon rubber outer layer. The synthesized MC(OH) 2 is an intelligent molecular switch with a visible light response that can reversibly convert from open-form MC(OH) 2 to closed-form spiropyran diol (SP(OH) 2 ) after short visible light irradiation. In the reverse process, the transition from SP(OH) 2 to MC(OH) 2 can occur gradually in the dark. This can be used to sense visible light in addition to electrical conductivity. The reversible change in the electrical resistance of the MC(OH) 2 /CrCl 3 ·6H 2 O/ethanol aqueous solution reaches 15.59\%. This fiber shows excellent electrical conductivity, good flexibility, a sensitive visible light response, good photochromism, a simple structure, low cost, easy preparation, and suitability for industrial large-scale production, offering promise for applications in the fields of flexible and wearable electronics.},

HERMS have two phase structures, C11 b and C40, due to allotropic transformation. Compared to C40, C11 b has better fracture toughness, but it is now difficult to synthesize single-phase C11 b . The first-principle was used to systematically study phase formation ability of HERMS. Formation enthalpy ( Δ H f ΔHf ), mixing enthalpy ( Δ H mix ΔHmix ) and mixing enthalpy difference ( δ mix δmix ) were calculated for 504 MSi 2 -type HERMS structures. δ mix δmix , VEC and Δ H mix C 11 b ΔHmixC11b were identified to characterize and predict phase stability of MSi 2 -type HERMS, in which δ mix δmix is a decisive factor, and has general applicability and important guiding significance for material systems with allotropic transformation. The generalized criteria of predicting phase formation for MSi 2 -type HERMS were proposed. C11 b phase formation criterion is VEC &gt; 4.58, δ mix δmix ΔHmixC11b ΔHmixC11b &gt; 0.09 eV/atom. Its accuracy was verified by experimental data to be 100\%. This work is of great significance for composition design of HERMS and the further study of C11 b -type HERMS.},

  abstract     = {Rapid tempering is a remarkable sustainable and energy-efficient way to modify properties of as-quenched martensite, particularly its toughness and ductility. In this work, tensile and fracture toughness properties, and microstructural evolution of a medium-carbon (0.4 wt\%), low-alloy steel under different rapid tempering circumstances are discussed. The hot-rolled and direct-quenched specimens were subjected to rapid tempering treatments (heating rate of about 90 °C/s) to the different tempering temperatures (320–720 °C). As a reference material, one sample was subjected to conventional tempering at 420 °C for one hour. The results indicated that the mechanical properties and microstructural features are influenced considerably by tempering temperature rather than the holding time. Despite the short tempering duration, the strength of tempered martensite dropped (from a max. tensile strength of ∼ 2100 MPa to a min. of ∼ 1100 MPa) while ductility increased with increasing tempering temperature (from a tensile elongation of 4\% to ∼ 15\%). However, the rapidly tempered sample at 420 °C experienced a loss of fracture toughness as a result of coarse stick-like cementite precipitation. Microstructural observations revealed that, even with a short time frame, tempering temperature plays a significant role in the resulting cementite morphology. At lower tempering temperatures, the cementite precipitates have a stick-like structure, while at higher temperatures, they become more globular/spheroid-like. This change in cementite morphology led to an enhancement in fracture toughness. Overall, the results indicated that, by a proper design of the rapid tempering process, an excellent combination of tensile properties and fracture toughness can be obtained compared to conventional tempering while significantly saving time and energy.},

Crack growth micromechanisms were analyzed by experimental fracture tests and in-situ microscopy observations. Large damage zones around the crack tip with fiber bundle bridging and pull-out were observed in the crack wake, justifying more advanced cohesive zone modeling suitable for composite materials design. The polymer matrix resulted in much higher fracture energy of the biocomposites compared to native wood due to increased local cohesive strength. This strength increased from the polymer contribution and more homogeneous stress distribution in the wood fibers.},

The applicability of shear-stiffening gel is limited because it generally cannot demonstrate good shape stability, strain sensitivity, and energy dissipation ability simultaneously. In this study, multiple hydrogen bonds and metal coordination bonds are incorporated into a shear-hardening gel to fabricate a new impact-hardening polymer (IHP-Cu) with multi-level energy dissipation pathways, thereby achieving a balance between shape stability, rapid self-healing, and energy dissipation. IHP-Cu maintains a stable shape in its natural state, exhibits significant strain-sensitive behavior at different strain rates, and supports a weight of 400 g at room temperature for 10 s after damage. In compression cycling tests, its energy absorption efficiency exceeded 90\%. In the frequency-dependent test (strain rate of 0.1 s −1 ), its elastic work and viscous dissipation increased by 24 and 12.5 times, respectively, compared to those of the conventional shear-hardening gel. This paper also reveals the energy dissipation mechanism of IHP-Cu, thus providing a theoretical basis and reference for the development and optimization of new protective materials.},

  abstract     = {Determining the fatigue behaviour of metallic materials using standardised testing methods is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, several methods have been proposed to shorten the testing time and improve the fatigue optimisation of materials and components. This work presents a new fatigue testing method based on fatigue damage monitoring that allows determining the fatigue resistance in a short time and with few specimens. The presented method, named as the stiffness method , monitors the inelastic strains as an indicator of fatigue damage evolution. Strain measurements were carried out by digital image correlation techniques and showed to effectively follow damage evolution during fatigue tests. Results are convincing and more evident to obtain and discuss than other monitoring techniques, like temperature dissipation. In addition, the method overcomes the main limitations of the existing fast testing methods by avoiding the utilisation of complex apparatus, like infrared cameras or acoustic emission sensors. The approach has been validated in ten different metallic materials, as titanium and aluminium alloys, carbon steels, and stainless steels. The estimated fatigue limit was compared with values obtained following standardised tests, showing excellent agreement. Results allow pointing out the stiffness method as an efficient and effective tool for rapidly determining the fatigue behaviour of metallic materials.},

The exploration of a refractory high entropy alloy Nb-Ti-Zr-Cr-Mo is proposed here as test case for a new strategy. Based on the proven methodology of mixture design and on combinatorial thin film metallurgy, the composition space is explored by a limited number of chosen gradients to build an alloy library comprising hardness and ductility, two antagonistic properties. The workflow is showcased here by studying the properties of the as-grown graded film, which presents wide amorphous domains and contrasted mechanical properties. This experimental dataset then trains machine learning models to provide continuous predictions of the alloy properties over the entire composition space. We show that optimal alloy properties are expected close to the binary edges of the quinary.},

  abstract     = {The intricate interplay between the characteristics and properties of amorphous/nanocrystalline alloys, specifically saturation flux density ( B s ) and Curie temperature ( T c ), has long been a perplexing task, despite their remarkable properties. However, recent developments in the field of machine learning (ML) have offered a promising paradigm for the accelerated discovery of these elusive alloys. Notably, it has become clear that their properties depend not only on their chemical composition but also on their thickness and annealing process. To further advance this paradigm, 5 ML methods were employed to predict B s and T c based on original features (OFs) and polynomial features (PFs). Impressively, it was discovered that ML model with the largest R 2 score on OFs displayed an outstanding capability, with interpretable method, which could be of great aid to alloy design. Further analysis revealed that the explicit formulas based on PFs quantitatively provided direction for optimization. Finally, the Fe 81.4 Si 3.4 B 11.4 Cu 0.8 Nb 3 alloy, with appropriate annealing time (AT1), annealing temperature (AT2) and thickness (THK), demonstrated promising B s = 1.79 T and T c = 661.6 K.

We develop a computational procedure that can be used to design various bistable kirigami surfaces. Their deployed 3D shape and stability as well as the nonlinear stiffness can be successfully predicted as validated with experiments. Using the proposed approach, we found that the range of stiffness for deployed bistable kirigami surfaces can be significantly broadened by using spatially varying hinges without altering the shape and stability of deployed structures.

The structural transformation and strain localization of Al 0.3 CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy during nanoindentation are investigated using molecular dynamics, and the hardening-softening mechanism is discussed. The simulations demonstrate that the prismatic dislocation loop with independent nucleation is discovered for the first time in the [111] orientation. Dislocation multiplication and cross-slip lead to an increase in indentation resistance, resulting in work hardening. Free dislocation slip and dislocation annihilation accommodate plastic strain will reduce indentation resistance, resulting in plastic softening. Twin boundaries can effectively block dislocation propagation, which contributes to hardening. However, twin boundaries cause a softening effect in the later stage of plastic deformation owing to two reasons: (1) the formation of steps and the partial slip where the slip plane and Burgers vector are parallel to the twin boundary, (2) steps and local damage zones in twin boundaries become new nucleation sites for dislocations. The phase-field-crystal method confirms that Al 0.3 CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy has the highest hardness when the twin spacing is 2.467 nm.},

The roles of heterogeneous nanostructure on the mechanical and corrosion behavior were revealed by nano-indentation and Scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) methods. Compared to the substrate 304 ASS, the hierarchical HEA film not only shows much higher nano-hardness and modulus values, but also possesses a higher electron transfer resistance (12158 vs 4567 Ω.cm 2 ) and lower overall corrosion rate (6.28*10 −4 vs 6.84*10 −3 mm·year −1 ). Moreover, the outer nano-lamellar layer shows higher nano-hardness (∼8.1 GPa) but lower surface potential values (∼-261 mV) than those of the inter equiaxed zone (∼5.9 GPa and ∼−150 mV). The former arises from the significant grain refinement strengthening effect, while the latter is attributed to an obvious increase in the high energy and chemically active areas such as grain boundaries and triple junctions. This work demonstrates the capability of hierarchy to adjust the comprehensive performance of multi-functional films, which possess superior mechanical property and comparable corrosion performance than those of the as-cast bulk HEA alloys.},

  abstract     = {Medium- and high-entropy carbides (MECs and HECs) have a wide range of advanced applications and, in many cases, outperform monocarbides. However, the behavior, oxidation mechanisms, and factors defining oxidation resistance of some popular HECs at high temperatures have not been studied in detail yet. In this study, the oxidation behavior of MEC and HECs including (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr)C, (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Mo)C, (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Hf)C, and (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,W)C was investigated under both non-isothermal and isothermal conditions at temperatures up to 1200 °C, and a possible oxidation path was described. It was found that under non-isothermal heating conditions, the oxidation of HECs occurred in three stages, each governed by first-order chemical reactions, and was limited by the formation of ZrO 2 , Me 2 Me 6 O 17 , and MeMe 2 O 7 oxides, respectively. In the case of isothermal heating, the oxidation of (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr)C, (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Mo)C, and (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Hf)C follows a logarithmic law and was limited by the formation of a protective Me 2 Me 6 O 17 layer. In contrast, isothermal oxidation of (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,W)C followed a linear law due to the formation of volatile WO 3 . The results of the study have a high potential for practical application for the production of HEC ceramics for various high-temperature purposes and could be used for further understanding of functional characteristics and development of the new ceramic compositions.},

  abstract     = {According to the controlled shear rate (CSR) test, the shear stiffening gel (SSG) exhibited viscoelastic behavior, which can be fully described by the general Maxwell model. A specific analytical model was established to identify the material parameters automatically based on simulated annealing (SA) optimization. Besides, according to the CSR tests under different temperatures, the influence of temperature and strain rate on the mechanical behavior of SSG was assumed to be decoupled. And an applicable engineering relation was introduced for parameter adjustment of the Maxwell model near room temperature. The reliability of the material parameters was verified through the results comparison of the low-speed impact tests of SSG and corresponding FE simulations. Based on field analysis of the FE simulations, the mechanism of the stress dispersion ability of SSG was elaborated. A feasible design idea was introduced to fully utilize this property. In order to verify the effectiveness of the design idea, a series of egg impact tests were developed, conducted, and analyzed. And the protective idea proved helpful in fully invoking the stress dispersion potential of SSG assembly for impact protection and improving the lightweight design.},

To overcome the poor characteristics of BJ parts, infiltration is a generally applied post-process; however, it results in a low infiltration volume and large number of residual voids in the uninfiltrated section. This study aims to effectively improve the mechanical properties, microstructure, and density of polymer-based BJ parts by overcoming limitations of infiltration process via warm isostatic pressing (WIP) that applies heat and pressure. The infiltrated specimens with epoxy are vacuum-packed, and the WIP process is performed at a target temperature of 130 °C and pressure of 8 MPa. Consequently, the infiltration volume increases by up to 195.2\%, and the number of residual voids in the uninfiltrated section, where the infiltrants do not reach, is significantly reduced. Further, in terms of the mechanical properties, the tensile strength increases by 1215\%, compressive strength by 1280\%, and flexural strength by 535\%. In addition, the results of transmission, scanning electron microscopy, and microcomputer X-ray tomography reveal a clear decrease in the number of voids.},

Here, coarse-grained numerical models of pure CF and GFCF are constructed based on molecular dynamics, and the role of graphene in GFCF and corresponding microscopic deformation mechanisms under compression are investigated. It is found that the compressive modulus of GFCF (5.3 MPa) is much larger than that of pure CF (0.7 MPa). The filling of graphene inhibits the aggregation of CNTs, enhances the dispersion of CNTs, impedes the rearrangement of CNTs, and ultimately improves the compressive modulus of the whole material by improving the bending ability of CNTs. It is further found that the compressive modulus of GFCF can be increased to a maximum of 7.4 MPa as the number of graphene flakes increases to 300, but remains almost the same as the graphene thickness increases. The results in this paper deepen the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms of GFCF and provide scientific guidance for the application of CNT and graphene-based materials.},

  abstract     = {Surfaces with tailored wettability have attracted considerable attention because of their wide range of potential applications. Wettability can be finely designed by controlling the chemistry and/or morphology of a surface. However, the commonly adopted analytical theories of Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter cannot describe a variety of intermediate and metastable states, being a thorough understanding of the combined chemical and morphological effect on surface wettability still lacking. Hence, the design and optimization of these surfaces is generally expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we propose a numerical method based on the phase-field model to predict the wettability of micro-structured surfaces and assist their design. First, we simulated the sessile droplet experiment on flat surfaces to calibrate model parameters. Second, we modelled several surface morphologies, intrinsic contact angles and droplet impact velocities. Finally, we produced and tested 3D printed flat and micro-structured samples to validate the phase-field model, obtaining a reasonable qualitative and quantitative agreement between numerical and experimental results. The validated model proposed here can help design and prototype surfaces with tailored wettability. Furthermore, integrated with atomistic/mesoscopic simulations, it represents the last step of a predictive multi-scale model, where both chemical and morphological features of surfaces can be designed a priori.},

The microstructure evolution considering grain junction effects has not been explored in depth yet. In this paper, DRX nucleation at the 2-, 3- and 4-grain junctions of a nickel-based superalloy was investigated. A proposed passive grain boundary bulging (PGBB) mechanism operated well at 2-grain junctions, and accounted for the continuity of necklace structure during the early stage of hot deformation. For the 3-grain junctions, a two-step strain-induced bulging of grain boundary fragments, which closely adjoined the junctions, was found to dominate the DRX nucleation. In addition, an increasing nucleation priority from 2-, 3- to 4-grain junctions was confirmed by the established thermodynamic model, while the nucleation priority differences of the same kind grain junctions were quantitatively analyzed by using the Taylor factors of their component grains. Finally, the DRX microstructure evolution of a 4-grain stacking unit during hot deformation was described. The understanding of DRX associated with 2-, 3- to 4-grain junctions made it more effective to tailor the microstructure of nickel-based superalloy forgings.},

However, the methods of fabricating such types of silicon steel via laser-powder bed fusion (LPBF) have not been fully investigated. In this study, near grain-oriented and near non-oriented Fe-3.5 wt.\%Si silicon steel is fabricated using LPBF by controlling processing parameters. Different textures are investigated using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and the morphology of the molten pool is characterized by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Magnetic properties are measured with alternating current (AC) method. The results show that reducing both the linear energy density (LED) and laser power leads to a change in the side morphology of the molten pool from large, flat, and well-overlapped to small, protuberant, and less-overlapped, resulting in an extremely strong θ-fiber texture or a random distribution of grain orientations, respectively. Additionally, reducing both the laser power and scanning speed causes the top morphology of the molten pool to change from teardrop to elliptical shape at the trailing edge, resulting in a shift in the angle between the 〈0 0 1〉 of grains in the θ-fiber texture and the scanning direction from 45° to 30°. Samples with fewer defects (i.e., larger grain size and fewer pores) and a larger area fraction of 〈0 0 1〉//H exhibit higher permeability, although this superiority is not so significant due to residual stress and high dislocation in the as-built samples. This study provides insight into the relationship between processing parameters, texture evolution, and magnetic properties in LPBFed silicon steel.},

  abstract     = {Metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs) offer the advantages of efficient gate control and low power consumption due to the large junction capacitance. However, the strong Fermi-level pinning caused by the metal-induced gap states makes it a great challenge to build a high-quality Schottky junction with a large energy barrier and low leakage current. Moreover, the upper limit of the work function of conventional metals is around 5 eV, which prevents the formation of a wide depletion region and the reduction of power consumption. In this work, 2D semimetals with high work function have been used as the gate to fabricate 2D van der Waals MESFETs. Compared with PtSe 2 and PdSe 2 , TiS 2 with ultrahigh work function of 6.6 eV forms the largest Schottky barrier height with MoS 2 . And TiS 2 /MoS 2 MESFETs display a sub-0.1 V threshold voltage owing to the large built-in potential and exhibit a small subthreshold swing of 73 mV/dec. The tuning of the channel carrier density from the back gate can further optimize the device performance and provide a strategy to build AND logic gate in a dual-gated transistor. Our work successfully demonstrates the use of high-work-function 2D semimetal to realize high-performance MESFET with low power consumption.},

Optimizing these parameters is a resource-intensive endeavor, though, especially in high-dimensional scenarios or for complex materials like fiber reinforced plastics. Surrogate models are able to reduce the computational effort, however, data generation still proves to be resource-intensive. Additionally, their data-driven nature may lead to physically implausible results in limit cases. As a remedy, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) include known physics into the training for enhanced surrogate reliability. This allows to cast a physically consistent, data- and mesh-free manufacturing surrogate for variable process conditions and material parameters. The paper demonstrates how PINNs can be embedded in a design-framework to enhance process understanding, to devise engineering-interpretable processing windows and to support time-efficient process optimization at the example of a thermochemical manufacturing process with fiber-reinforced composite materials. In this work, an over 500-fold speed up of the process optimization is achieved compared to conventional approaches.},

We demonstrated that MTC MXene&#39;s potentiality for the conversion of the photo to heat showed better efficacy in inhibiting the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MTC under laser treatment completely killed MRSA, a combined treatment that caused an irreversible antibacterial effect. Also, MTC impeded bacteria-associated infections by completely killing MRSA in an infected wound, preventing tissue proliferation, angiogenesis, and tissue inflammations, demonstrating good biocompatibility, a sure prospect for clinical translation. Furthermore, the collaborative work of the MTC and the local hyperthermia significantly ameliorated MRSA-induced subcutaneous infection and bacterial keratitis, preserving the structural wholeness and transparency of the infected cornea. This study suggests that MTC may serve as a potential platform to augment near-infrared (NIR) therapeutic eradication of bacteria actively and precisely.},

  abstract     = {Postoperative bacterial infection and poor osseointegration with surrounding bone tissue are not only the critical causes of implant failure but also the major challenges in clinical application. Hereby, Titania (TiO 2 ) microporous/nanofiber coating was firstly prepared on the surface of titanium (Ti) material by alkali-heat treatment process, and strontium (Sr)-doped coating (TS) was then prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. Finally, polydopamine-assisted co-deposition technology was utilized to deposit vancomycin (Van) onto TS surface (TSV), thus obtaining a medical composite coating with antibacterial property and improved osseointegration ability. According to antibacterial test, TSV has not only a 99.99\% killing effect on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but also a good anti-biofilm ability. The cell experiments showed that TSV could enhance the adhesion and proliferation of osteoblasts. Compared with pure Ti and TS, TSV induces the formation of bone apatite in simulated body fluid (SBF) test quickly, indicating that the coating has good biological activity. According to histopathological observation and bone morphology analysis, TSV showed highly effective infection prevention and excellent osteointegration in vivo . These test results suggested that it is feasible to prevent implant-associated infection and promote osseointegration by functionalization of the implant, so as to provide a fresh direction for clinical research.},

  abstract     = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing of 2XXX series Al alloys could be used for low volume specialist aerospace components, however, such alloys exhibit hot cracking susceptibility that can lead to component failure. In this study, we show two approaches to suppress the formation of hot cracks by controlling solidification behaviour using: (1) TiB 2 additions; and (2) optimisation of LPBF process parameters. Using high-speed synchrotron X-ray radiography, we monitored LPBF of Al-2139 in situ , with and without TiB 2 under a range of process conditions. In situ X-ray radiography results captured the crack growth over 1.0 ms at a rate of ca. 110 mm s −1 , as well as pore evolution, wetting behaviour and build height. High-resolution synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (sCT) was used to measure the volume fraction of defects, e.g. hydrogen pores and microcracks, in the as-built LPBF samples. Our results show adding TiB 2 in Al-2139 reduces the volume of cracks by up to 79\% under a volume energy density of 1000 to 5000 J mm −3 , as well as reducing the average length, breadth, and surface area of cracks.},

The coating-substrate system is of interest for application in radio frequency superconducting cavities as an improvement on bulk niobium cavities. The microstructural and chemical properties of the substrates and coating were examined by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), electron backscatter diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and focused ion beam cross-sectioning. The abrasion resistance was investigated by scratch testing under progressive loads up to 200 N, after which the scratched surfaces were characterised by SEM/EDS to determine the failure mechanisms of the coatings. Several stages of coating damage were identified, including nodule compression, cracking, pitting, fragmentation, comminution and detachment. Nevertheless, substantial amounts of fragmented and embedded coating remained attached to the copper up to the highest load. The findings indicated similar abrasion resistance behaviour for the EP and CP conditions.},

  abstract     = {Mass reduction and strength-to-weight optimisation are of increasing interest in mechanical engineering. Natural materials such as bone face the same challenges and strike an optimal balance between weight and mechanical performance. Several approaches sought to reproduce trabecular bone’s mechanical efficiency, for example topology optimisation or cellular materials. These approaches are often restricted by their computational cost or their spatial homogeneity. Here we develop a 3D mass reduction method bio-inspired from trabecular bone that provides both fast computation and stress driven architecture. The mass reduction method is based on a bio-inspired porous pattern. The pattern is locally adapted to the estimated stress in a mechanical part through an algorithm. This results in an optimised porous architecture that mimics the trabecular form-function relationship. This 3D mass reduction method was validated through 3-point bending experiments. At equal mass, the proposed method showed 66\% improvement in bending stiffness compared to a 2.5D bio-inspired method and 111\% improvement compared to a topology optimisation method. Our results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for strength-to-weight optimisation. It is applicable in various industries to lighten parts, reduce raw material usage, design composite sandwich cores or personalised bone-tissue scaffolds.},

The influence of ultrasonic amplitude ( A ), distance between laser focus point and ultrasonic roller ( d 0 ) on microstructure of Pb-Sn alloy deposition layer were explored. There is a good consistency between experiment and simulation with relative error of 4.33\%. The results show that the roundness of grains is improved significantly after rolling, and the grain are refined with the increase of A and d 0 . In all tests of this study, comprehensive effect of ultrasonic rolling achieves the best when d 0 is taken as 24 mm and A is taken as 20 μm, the average grain diameter ( D 0 ) in grain size counted zone is 18.8 μm which is 23.23\% lower than that without rolling.

The architected structures include body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice, shell-based triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS), and hybrid foam (HF) composed of beam and shell with multiple adjustable parameters. The simulated effective properties touch on the applicability in heat transfer, fluid flow, and mechanically stressful situations. The dimensionless effective properties of the structures are presented in graphical form to clearly illustrate structurally dependent properties. Compared to the stochastic metal foams, the architected structures (BCC, TPMS, and most HF) showed higher effective thermal conductivities and permeabilities. This indicates a potential to improve the efficiency of a thermal or fluid flow system by replacing the stochastic foam with architected foam. Additionally, the HF structure shows broad tunability of specific properties. All effective properties simulated were rendered dimensionless to only reflect the impact of topology, and plotted in charts to show trends. These charts can aid in the selection of porous structures in diverse applications.},

Scaffold models were constructed using triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) and the optimal porosity was obtained by mechanical evaluation. The results showed that pFe incorporation significantly improved mechanical properties, especially for PLA/5pFe scaffold, which was 121\% higher than that of PLA scaffold. It may be that molten PLA molecules penetrate the pore network of pFe particles, forming spatial interlocks and encapsulations, thereby improving the efficiency of stress transfer. In addition, a chemical catalytic cycle is expected to be formed between PLA hydrolysis and pFe degradation to promote the degradation of composite scaffolds. Moreover, the composite scaffold also showed good biomineralization and cytocompatibility in vitro. These properties make the PLA/pFe composite scaffold promising for bone tissue engineering applications.},

In this work, it was found that cracks in LPBFed TiAl4822 alloy were more likely to occur in the region near the interfaces between α 2 and B2 phases, and the underlying mechanism was addressed. This leads to a strategy to reduce or eliminate these cracks via reducing the phase interfaces between α 2 and B2 phases by adjusting its phase composition. Through the design of LPBF process parameters, the purpose of adjusting phase composition of LPBFed TiAl4822 alloy in a wide range (from nearly α 2 single-phase, to α 2 + B2 + γ, and then to nearly B2 single-phase) was realized. As expected, with the reduction of the interfaces between α 2 and B2 phases, the cracking behavior has been significantly alleviated. The exciting result was that the crack-free sample could be achieved in the LPBFed TiAl4822 alloy with nearly α 2 single-phase structure. Its compressive strength was measured to be 1460.7 MPa comparable to that of its casting counterpart.

This paper proposes the design of a healable Al alloy to suppress hydrogen blistering and improve the damage management. The strategy consists of solute atoms diffusing towards nano-voids and precipitating on their surface, thereby filling the damage sites. A new healable Al alloy was thus developed and successfully manufactured by LPBF. 3D X-ray nano-imaging evidenced that the addition of Mg in 4xxx series Al alloys suppresses the hydrogen blistering. This is expectedly due to Mg in solid solution which increases the hydrogen solubility in the Al matrix and due to the healing of these hydrogen pores. Moreover, a significant healing of voids smaller than 500 nm diameter is observed. In-situ heating inside transmission electron microscopy pointed out that Al matrix diffuses inside the fractured Mg2Si particles, thereby demonstrating the healing ability of the new alloy. This has opened the doors to development of new healable Al alloys manufactured by LPBF as well as to new post-treatments to tailor mechanical properties and microstructure without hydrogen blistering.},

This study, for the first time, Cu lattice structures are fabricated through laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) with green laser (λ = 515 nm). Structural and microstructural analysis confirm that the lattice structures consist of well-defined unit-cells and show dense microstructure. The deformation behavior is investigated under a wide range of strain rates from ∼0.001 /s to ∼1000 /s. The stress–strain curves exhibit a smooth and continuous deformation without any post-yield softening, which can be attributed to the intrinsic mechanical properties of Cu. Correlated with post-mortem microscopy examination, the rate-dependent deformation behavior of pure Cu lattice structures is investigated and rationalized. The current work suggests that the complex Cu architectures can be fabricated by L-PBF with green laser and are suitable for dynamic loading applications.},

  abstract     = {Water electrolysis is one of the most crucial processes in the development of new energy sources, where ultra-clean fuel is produced - hydrogen. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the sluggish process of overall water splitting. Therefore, this study presents the design, characterization and electrochemical study of cobalt-based electrocatalysts embedded into porous carbons derived from an Al-metal–organic framework (MOF). The key aspects to be revealed were carbonization temperature and aluminium impact on the composite electrochemical performance. It was found that aluminium presence boosts the OER performance of the anode via lowering electrolyte resistance, reaching an overpotential of 380 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm −2 , which is improved by 80 mV compared to the composite without aluminium. Similar effect was present in EIS measurement, where the electrocatalyst functionalized with cobalt in the presence of aluminium showed the lowest resistances, 0.89 Ω and 2.82 Ω for R1 and R2. This is due to the formation of additional electrocatalytically active species in the form of Al-Co alloy what was clearly proved by the XPS study. It shows that cobalt favoured aluminium to act simultaneously as active sites accelerating the efficiency of the OER process. Additionally, carbon played the role of a booster of the OER activity of cobalt with sustained high durability during cycling. Therefore, a facile procedure to tune the structure of carbon-based structures derived from Al-based metal–organic frameworks is proposed and the resulting cobalt/aluminium modification serves as a robust electrocatalyst for OER.},

Electrodes are the key component of LIBs that determines battery performance. LiFePO 4 is a common electrode used in battery technology due to its long cycle life and good safety. Laser structuring of electrodes has recently been considered a promising approach to increase energy density. In this work, LiFePO 4 electrodes were structured into a grid-type pattern by varying the laser power, resulting in different aspect ratios. To evaluate the effects of the structuring, wettability and electrochemical performance were tested. The wetting property was investigated using spread area, wetting time, and contact angle measurements. Besides, the wetting rate was measured using the wetting balance test and capillary rise test. Lucas Washburn model and Zhmud extended model were used to quantitatively express the wetting rate. The influence of gravity on the wetting performance was also investigated by comparing those models. Furthermore, an electrochemical test was performed to see the cyclic stability, rate capability, and charge–discharge profile with a C rate up to 1C.},

  abstract     = {Graphene holds great promise in optoelectronics because of its high broadband light absorption across a wide range of wavelengths. Despite low optical absorption, various techniques have been devised to address this challenge. This study presents a new highly sensitive, photodetector based on three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene derived from fluorinated polyimide (fPI-3DPG). This material is produced via a laser photothermal process and features micro- and nanopore structures that increase the light absorbing area and support optically resonant structures. The resulting fPI-3DPG photodetectors display high photoresponsivity of 4.4 mA W −1 in the visible light range, an ultrahigh signal-to-noise ratio of ∼208, and a noise equivalent power of 0.54 × 10 −11 W Hz −1/2 . These photodetectors are also mechanically durable, surviving 10,000 cycles of bending and twisting. The laser photothermal method used in this study enables fast, cost effective production of wearable and flexible optical sensors for imaging and spectroscopy applications, making this 3D graphene a promising functional material for sensing technologies.},

But they exhibit fracture behavior when the porosity changes, resulting in structural failure. The high curvature surface factor is introduced to improve the fracture behavior of the biomimetic surface structure. Combine the high curvature surface factor to construct novel biomimetic homogenized surface structures. Novel radial gradient surface structures and axial gradient surface structures are designed based on the construction concept of cone functions and linear functions gradients. Theoretical, experimental and numerical methods are used to investigate the mechanical properties of novel biomimetic multimodal surface structures. Euler theory states that the properties of lattice structures are determined by the relative density of structures. The load distribution in the radially gradient structure is uniform, and the deformation mode presents overall failure, which can achieve better resistance and dissipation of the load. The deformation modes of axial gradient structures present layered failure. The underlying mechanism of the difference in mechanical properties of biomimetic multimodal structures is explained in detail. It’s very important significance for targeted application in protective engineering.},

Results show that the as-fabricated alloy is fully austenitic with the absence of carbides—a typical feature in the cast alloy that necessitates its solutionizing and quenching. The strength (σ y = 595.5 ± 18.1 MPa, σ u = 950.2 ± 28.6 MPa) and hardness (318.6 ± 7.1 HV) of the LPBF HS are superior to those of the conventionally fabricated HS, while the impact toughness is similar, and ductility is inferior. The yield strength enhancement is mainly due to the refinement in the grain size and increase in the dislocation density, which occurs due to the rapid solidification conditions that prevail during LPBF. This rapid solidification also prevents carbide formation and retain the main alloying elements (C and Mn) in solution. Thus conventional water quenching process can be completely eliminated.},

  abstract     = {Ductile damage in dual-phase steels deteriorates the mechanical properties, resulting in a lowered crashworthiness and a shorter life-time under cyclic loading. However, most works focus on the observation of damage under simple strain paths, even though work pieces are often subjected to combined strain paths during forming. In this work, we set out to characterise the damage behaviour for a DP800 steel subjected to combinations of tensile and bending loads. To this end, we use an automated approach based on machine learning to quantify damage in high-resolution SEM panoramic images, coupled with finite element modelling to determine the stress state, and high-throughput nanoindentation to determine the strain hardening behaviour. We find a strong connection between loading direction and damage formation in both steps of the forming process. By focussing on different possible combinations of positive and negative triaxiality, we show that the combination of two deformation modes with positive triaxiality leads to a promotion of damage formation. A negative triaxiality applied after a positive triaxiality leads to void closure, reducing the number of damage sites and total void area. Importantly, deformation with negative triaxiality carried out before deformation with positive triaxiality inhibits damage nucleation and growth due to strain hardening.},

Briefly, PE film is firstly pretreated by UV-Ozone (UVO) to raise the surface energy of PE for driving adsorption of BB. Then hyperthermal hydrogen bombardment is used to cleave C-H bonds at the interface of PE-BB for accomplishing colvalent immobilization of BB. The chemical structure, morphology, thermal properties, barrier and antimicrobial properties of the resultant BB-grafted-PE (PE-g-BB) films are examined to verify covalent immobilization. Even after 60 min accelerated labilization test by ultrasound intervention, the modified film maintained excellent microorganism inhibition and antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus with respective R values of 1.6 and 3.0.},

Since the individual material constituents in optical coatings are often selected only for their desirable optical properties, mechanical characterization of the optical nanomultilayers is typically limited. Here, AlN/SiO 2 , TiO 2 /SiO 2 , and AlN/Al 2 O 3 nanomultilayers synthesized in non-optimized and optimized optical performance layer configurations are tested using microtensile, nanoindentation, and pillar splitting techniques to highlight the effects of optical optimization on mechanical performance. Trends within each type of test and across all deformation modes reveal that layer thickness, volume fraction, and interfacial crystallinity can be viewed as controlling features for optical and mechanical performance, although their correlation may vary. It was observed that both configurations of the AlN/Al 2 O 3 NMs exhibit the highest mechanical performance across all three testing techniques with an average experimental transmittance of 93.8\% for the optimized layer configuration. Overall, the results from this expanded view of mechanical properties in ceramic optical nanomultilayers suggest the possibility of tuning film characteristics for joint optimization of opto-mechanical nanomultilayered coatings.},

The as-deposited GYbZ/YSZ coating is composed of a dense continuous layer at the bottom and a columnar layer growing on it. The columnar layer comprises taller coarse columns, shorter tapered columns, and particles filling in the gaps between the columns. The thermal shock behavior of the coating is evaluated in a burner rig at 1300 °C, during which the coating mainly fails in the form of delamination. The coating initially delaminates in the regions where the particles are embedded beneath the taller GYbZ columns tips. Subsequently, delamination occurs in the lower region of GYbZ coating and eventually fails at the TGO/YSZ interface. A finite element model tailored to the microstructural characteristics of the DCL coating was established. Stress distributions of the coating indicate that the discontinuities of the strain tolerance caused by abrupt microstructural or componential changes lead to multiple out-of-plane stress ( σ 22 ) concentration spots. The position and procedure of the delamination of GYbZ coating obtained based on the energy release rate of each σ 22 concentration spot are consistent with experimental results.},

In this study, an amorphous interlayer was introduced between Mo and Cu phases in Mo-Cu alloys by using the high-temperature infiltration method. With the increase of infiltrated temperature from 1300 °C to 1450 °C, the thickness of the amorphous interlayer wad increased from 2 nm to 13 nm. The formation process, thermodynamic driving force, stability of the amorphous interlayer in Mo-Cu alloy, and its contribution to mechanical properties were systematically investigated. By using the “macroscopic atom approach” Miedema&#39;s model, the thermodynamic driving force and stability of the amorphous interlayer were proved. It was found that the thickening of the amorphous interlayer can significantly improve the interfacial bonding, thus leading to an increase in the tensile strength of the Mo-Cu alloy from 520 to 600 MPa and failure strain from 0.15 to 0.31 The deformation behavior of the Mo-Cu alloy shows that the amorphous interlayer can effectively absorb interfacial dislocations during deformation, and relieve the stress concentration at the interface by crystallization, thus delaying the initiation and propagation of cracks at phase boundaries, which broke through the limitation of the trade-off between strength and plasticity of such Mo-Cu immiscible materials.},

Here, combinatorial synthesis by directed-energy deposition (DED) and hardness measurements were used to rapidly map the composition-dependent strength of the ternary Al-Ce-Mg system. Tensile testing and microstructure characterization of selected compositions were performed to elucidate the compositional dependence of the strengthening mechanisms. Al 11 Ce 3 precipitates were present in all cases, and the maximum hardness (1.25 GPa) was measured for the Al-8Ce-10Mg composition. A combination of (i) Hall-Petch strengthening, based on the FCC-matrix-phase cell size; (ii) particle strengthening, based on Al 11 Ce 3 volume fraction and size; and (iii) solid-solution strengthening, based on Mg composition of the matrix phase, were used to account for the measured strengths.

  abstract     = {Improving chondrogenic differentiation while inhibiting hypertrophic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is of vital importance to effectively repairing cartilage injury. Accordingly, kartogenin (KGN) and antioxidants, which promote chondrogenic differentiation and inhibit hypertrophic differentiation, respectively, have shown great potential in promoting cartilage repair. However, KGN is poorly soluble in water, hindering efficient intracellular delivery. Near-infrared light (NIR)-responsive mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (MPDA) reportedly exert antioxidative effects by eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we assessed whether KGN loaded in MPDA can accelerate cartilage injury repair in rats. Specifically, a thermosensitive phase-change material (PCM, melting point 39 °C) combined with KGN was loaded into MPDA as a gatekeeper (KGN@MPDA-PCM). The results showed that KGN@MPDA-PCM exhibited excellent photothermal properties under NIR irradiation, which induced PCM melting and consequent KGN release. In combination with antioxidative therapy, NIR-triggered KGN release enabled the nanocomposite to accelerate MSC chondrogenic differentiation and inhibit hypertrophic differentiation. Importantly, negligible damage to primary organs and satisfactory biocompatibility were observed in the rat model. RNA sequencing found that this MPDA-based platform promotes chondrogenic differentiation by promoting fibronectin-1 (Fn1) expression and activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Collectively, these findings highlight the therapeutic potential of this MPDA-based platform for accelerating cartilage injury repair.},

  abstract     = {Developing thermoregulating textiles based on passive radiative cooling strategies has recently attracted considerable attention as an emerging means of providing localised thermoregulation for wearers. This cooling mechanism not only has been used to enhance the thermal comfort in both indoor and outdoor spaces, but it has also been regarded as one of the promising methods of reducing dependency on energy-intensive air conditioning systems. This article reviews recent advances in developing fibrous structures with passive radiative cooling functionality including mid-infrared (MIR) transparent textiles, and textiles with passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) effect. The fundamental working mechanisms, fabrication methods, and reported performances of these functional textiles are reviewed and compared. Specific attention is paid to recent technological advances in obtaining the radiative cooling functionality via conventional manufacturing methods including coating, fibre spinning, nanofibres electrospinning, weaving/knitting of fabrics, and nonwovens. Passive radiative cooling mechanisms of several natural species are also discussed, to guide the development of novel thermoregulating textiles. This article provides a comprehensive review of the status of passive radiative cooling technology in textiles and delineates some possible pathways for future improvements with potential applications in sportswear, protective clothing, and other wearable textiles.},

  abstract     = {Atherosclerosis, formed by fibrofatty lesions in the artery wall, underpins myocardial infarctions, strokes and disabling peripheral artery diseases. Inflammation with multiple maladaptive roles runs through atherosclerotic inception, propagation, and complications. Given degree of inflammation differing among atherosclerotics, inflammation-targeted nanomedicine may produce individualized monitoring and manipulation of inflammatory regulators beyond traditionally slowing down atherosclerosis progression. Equipped with biomimetic membrane, microenvironment-responsive and targeting structures, nanomedicines could escape from the innate immune system and autonomously navigate to targeted lesions, thereby muting inflammation in atherosclerotic sites. Moreover, nanoparticles’ advantages go beyond advancing pharmacology. The optimal physicochemical properties of nanoparticles favor noninvasive imaging function to provide diagnostic and prognostic information of atherosclerotic plaques. Despite efficacious ability of the preclinical anti-inflammation nanotherapeutics to reduce atherosclerotic risks, future translation of inflammation-targeted nanomedicines requires to comprehensively refine the strategies that the nanomedicines forestall inflammatory pathways via systemic exposure, drug-cell interactions, and endothelial barrier reconstruction. In this review, we outline the development of diverse nanomedicines to specifically identify pathophysiological changes and combat advanced atherosclerosis along with dynamically tracing inflammatory markers. Finally, challenges and opportunities of inflammation-targeted nanomedicines are highlighted to pave avenues toward personalized medicine for atherosclerosis to stem the growing global burden of cardiovascular diseases.},

  abstract     = {Shape memory alloys (SMA) are a class of smart materials with inherent shape memory and superelastic characteristics. Unlike other SMAs, iron-based SMAs (Fe-SMA) offer cost-effectiveness, weldability, and robust mechanical strength for the construction industry. Thus, applying these promising materials to advanced manufacturing processes is of considerable industrial and academic relevance. This study aims to present a pioneer application of a Fe–Mn–Si–Cr–Ni–V-C SMA to arc-based directed energy deposition additive manufacturing, namely wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), examining the microstructure evolution and mechanical/functional response. The WAAM-fabricated Fe-SMAs presented negligible porosity and high deposition efficiency. Microstructure characterization encompassing electron microscopy and high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed that the as-deposited material is primarily composed by γ FCC phase with modest amounts of VC, ε and σ phases. Tensile and cyclic testing highlighted the Fe-SMA&#39;s excellent mechanical and functional response. Tensile testing revealed a yield strength and fracture stress of 472 and 821 MPa, respectively, with a fracture strain of 26\%. After uniaxial tensile loading to fracture, the γ → → ε phase transformation was clearly evidenced with post-mortem synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis. The cyclic stability during 100 load/unloading cycles was also evaluated, showcasing the potential applicability of the fabricated material for structural applications.},

The challenges associated with the fabrication of a sharp transition from steel to aluminum are uncovered using ex-situ characterization techniques and thermo-mechanical modeling of the deposition process. It was found that the fabrication of a sharp steel-aluminum transition is challenging with extensive cracking observed at the interface. The cracking was attributed to the combined effect of residual stress development due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch and the presence of ordered intermetallics with low ductility at the interface. Using a coupled thermodynamic and thermo-mechanical modeling approach, potential pathways to enable the fabrication of steel-aluminum bi-metallic structures using additive manufacturing are proposed. The results presented here can lay the foundation for future work on the fabrication of bi-metallic steel-aluminum structures using directed energy deposition.},

Applications such as thin-film bulk acoustic wave resonators or highly confined electro-optic modulators require thin films, which are still challenging to be obtained with the necessary crystalline quality by deposition methods. Alternatively to deposition, crystal ion-slicing (CIS) or Smart Cut TM enables obtaining thin films hundreds of nanometers thick from the bulk single-crystal utilizing high-energy and dose implantation of light atoms. The price to pay is the partial degradation of the initial crystalline perfection, which translates to a degradation of the piezoelectric performance of the material if the CIS-induced damage is not eliminated. This work aims to understand the physics of the recrystallization process of the CIS-damaged LNO crystal upon thermal annealing. The study of the coherent and diffuse scattering by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, complemented by micro-Raman backscattering spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), allowed to study the recovery of the crystallinity from the CIS-induced lattice strain and stress and the progressive reduction of the defects clusters dimension.},

  abstract     = {Supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) are inorganic-organic hybrid materials with a unique periodic nanostructure, and thus they have been gaining growing attention for their intriguing functional properties and parallelisms with hierarchical biomaterials. Their mechanical behavior remains, however, poorly understood, even though its understanding and control are important to allow SCNCs’ implementation into devices. An important aspect that has not been tackled yet is their time-dependent deformation behavior, which is nevertheless expected to play an important role in materials containing such a distribution of organic phase. Hereby, we report on the creep of ceramic-organic SCNCs with varying degrees of organic crosslinking, as assessed via nanoindentation. Creep strains and their partial recoverability are observed, hinting at the co-presence of viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity, and a clear effect of crosslinking in decreasing the overall material deformability emerges. We rationalize our experimental observations with the analysis of stress exponent and activation volume, resulting in a power-law breakdown behavior and governing deformation mechanisms occurring at the organic sub-nm interfaces scale, as rearrangement of organic ligands. The set of results is reinforced by the evaluation of the strain rate sensitivity via strain rate jump tests, and the assessment of the effect of oscillations during continuous stiffness measurement mode.},

  abstract     = {Here the authors present an active thermal control system using 4Dprinted shape memory polymers and demonstrate how distinct deformation mechanisms lead to unique, tunable thermal properties using stretching- and bending-dominated architectures. Infrared thermography measurements with varying temperature and compression settings show that at low strains, radiation drives the effective conductance increase as the view factors among the struts increase with increasing strain, and at higher strains, conduction drives the effective conductance increase as the strut-to-strut contact areas increase. The effective thermal conductance increases from 4.41 m W / K 4.41mW/K to 14.52 m W / K 14.52mW/K and from 3.23 m W / K 3.23mW/K to 10.48 m W / K 10.48mW/K for the Kelvin foam and octet-truss microlattices, respectively, as strain increases from 0\% 0\% to approximately 70\% 70\% . As the strain is adjusted, the stretching-dominated octet-truss architecture exhibits abrupt changes in shape and conductance due to buckling. The bending-dominated Kelvin foam architecture allows for gradual geometric changes and precise tuning of thermal conductance. These findings provide a new understanding of thermal transport phenomena in 4D-printed metamaterials, which may be a breakthrough in tunable thermal systems.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufactured (AM) components are increasingly being applied to fatigue-limited applications and are often safety–critical, necessitating confidence in the predicted fatigue response. The fatigue failure mode is highly sensitive to variations in loading, materials and geometry; therefore, published AM fatigue data must be accompanied by robust supporting documentation for confident adoption. International standards provide robust guidance on these documentation requirements; however, there are currently no formal methods for quantifying the uncertainty within published AM fatigue test data. A set of documentation criteria are proposed based on the core requirements of recognised standards for fatigue and AM test reporting. These documentation criteria form the basis for applicability indices proposed to quantify the uncertainty of reported AM fatigue test data. The applicability indices offer a new way to evaluate the suitability of fatigue data for specific applications and are demonstrated for publicly available Powder Bed Fusion Ti-6Al-4 V fatigue data. This large number of datasets are examined in terms of the influence of process variables on the observed fatigue response. These observations provide a reference for AM fatigue designers to be aware of the influence of relevant variables on fatigue response, as well as for AM fatigue researchers to identify strategic opportunities for novel contributions.},

Therefore, identifying novel therapeutic methods are a vital topic for improving therapeutic effects of NHL. IR780, a near-infrared dye, can be used as a photosensitizer both for photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). In this study, we designed an effective nanoparticle system for carrying IR780 and Idarubicin, thus hoping to combine PTT/PDT and chemotherapy to treat NHL. This nanosystem consisted of PEG-b-PTMC nanoparticles. IR780 and Idarubicin (IDA) were loaded separately into PEG-b-PTMC nanoparticles, which had regular sphere shapes and relatively small sizes. Upon near-infrared laser irradiation at 808 nm, PEG-b-PTMC nanoparticle (IR780 + IDA NPs) showed strong PTT/PDT efficacy with high-efficiency endocytosis and increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. By the evaluation of the photothermal conversion, we can confirm that IR780 + IDA NPs has been successfully delivered and exhibited significant synergistic effects on inhibiting cell proliferation in Raji and U937 cells. In vivo experiments have also demonstrated that IR780 + IDA NPs has a significant inhibitory effect on lymphoma and has a good biological safety.

In bulk form, core losses as a result of eddy currents would be too large to allow their use in high-frequency electrical machines, therefore strategies are needed to reduce eddy currents. Additive manufacturing affords high part complexity and provides the opportunity for cross sectional patterns within the material to limit eddy current generation. This study investigates several designs, including a novel hexagonal pattern which is shown to have the lowest eddy current loss coefficient of 0.0005, less than 25\% of the bulk material which has an eddy current loss coefficient of 0.0021. Heat treatment is shown to increase the eddy current losses, demonstrating that for high-frequency machines, it may be beneficial to use the material in the as-built state. Physical samples were compared to their intended geometries, showing there are defects in these complex cross sections causing increased eddy currents when compared to simulations, but that geometrical accuracy can be improved by alternative design methodology which experimentally experiences smaller losses. These novel cross sectional designs may be implemented into an electric machine that has a 3D magnetic flux pathway enabled by additive manufacturing, affording more flexibility for electrical engineers to design new motor architectures in the pursuit of higher power density machines.},

In this paper, we propose a supervised machine learning framework powered by the distributed breeder genetic algorithm (DBGA) to train a charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP) for the multi-component Hf/Nb/Ta/Ti/Zr/O system. By combining the DBGA with extensive ab initio training data and a carefully designed objective function, a robust and extrapolative potential with massive internal parameters is effectively optimized. A cross-validation of the CTIP is rigorously performed to verify its accuracy in predicting energetic, structural and mechanical properties of metals, intermetallic compounds, alloys and oxides. Using the developed potential, we further study the atomic structure and its evolution in RHEA to reveal the deformation and oxidation mechanisms in response to mechanical loadings and oxygen atmospheres. The simulation results not only provide valuable atomistic information hardly accessible through experiments and thermodynamic calculations, but also display promising prospects for large-scale reactive simulations of the Hf/Nb/Ta/Ti/Zr/O complex-component system.},

  abstract     = {Fast and accurate analysis of orientations and deformation states from Kikuchi patterns is vital to understand the crystalline materials’ micro- and macro-mechanical behavior. Here, a pattern reconstruction-aided Siamese network is developed to extract the crystal orientations and deformation states from Kikuchi patterns. We demonstrate the pattern reconstruction technique is essential for accurate predictions at large-area EBSD scans since the remapping operation enables the Siamese network to consider changes in experimental setup parameters dynamically. Moreover, the reconstruction technique serves as a data augmentation method that expands 342,225 raw patterns to 5,475,600 reconstructed patterns. The resulting Siamese network achieves unprecedented accuracy and robustness over a wide range of experimental setup parameters including pattern center, camera elevation and exposure time. Compared to the cross-correlation based high-resolution EBSD (HR-EBSD) analysis, it shows improved robustness against large rotations and achieves accurate measurements even if the rotation angle is as large as 25°. Further investigation also indicates the Siamese network trained on pure aluminum can be generalized at copper, nickel and 316 stainless steel without retraining, suggesting broad and desirable applicability.},

Tensile tests show that the NiCr-based composites have a combination of high strength and ductility with the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and ductility as 449 MPa, 838 MPa and 20.5\%, respectively. The amorphous SiO 2 and crystalline Cr 3 C 2 particles exhibit plastic deformation and transgranular fracture, respectively, under tensile stress. Besides solid solution strengthening, the generation and annihilation behavior of dislocations at amorphous/crystalline interface and the strain hardening of the ceramic particles by hindering the movement of dislocations mutually contributes to the combination of excellent strength and ductility of our composites.},

  abstract     = {Lattice structures with bistability can maintain additional equilibrium states after external loads are removed. While conventional bistable structures typically realize compression and torsional bistabilities under compression and twisting loads, this paper introduces a new design of bistable structures that exhibit torsional bistability under uniaxial compression. The proposed structure is composed of two co-axis polygonal prisms connected by struts. Torsional bistability is achieved by opposite rotations of two co-axial polygonal prisms under compression, which result in snap-through instabilities in the connecting struts. An analytical model and numerical simulations demonstrate that dual-material design for the inclined and connecting struts is required to induce bistability. A parameter study is conducted to illustrate the effect of the volume fractions of soft material in struts and the modulus ratios between two materials on bistability characteristics. One such design is practically fabricated by multi-material 3D printing, and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the existence of the second equilibrium state. Furthermore, a lattice structure is designed by periodically arraying the unit structures, which exhibit multiple stable states due to existence a sequence of bistable states arising in a layer-by-layer manner. This compression-torsion bistability breaks the restriction on the direction of the bistable deformation and the applied load, and provides inspiration for novel functional designs in the areas of logic gates and deformation control.},

This work proposes an analytical approach to design stretching-dominated truss lattices with tailored elastic properties, including isotropic elasticity, tailored zero/negative Poisson’s ratios, tailored Young’s moduli ratios along specified directions. The transversely isotropic elasticity is adopted to represent the micro lase powder bed fusion (LPBF) process-induced anisotropy of base materials. The lattices are designed through combination of elementary bars with appropriate volume fractions. An analytical homogenization theory is established to determine elastic constants of combined lattices. An analytical design approach is proposed to obtain elastically isotropic truss lattices. A traversal searching is performed to determine ranges of Young’s moduli, Poisson’s ratios of combined lattices, and find most manufacturable ones with tailored Young’s moduli ratios and Poisson’s ratios. Finite element analysis reveals all designed lattices from anisotropic materials achieve better agreements to design targets than those designed from isotropic materials, thus validating the superiority of the proposed method. The lattices with isotropic elasticity, tailored zero/negative Poisson’s ratios are fabricated in stainless steel 316L via micro-LPBF, and quasi-static compression experiments are performed to further validate the proposed design approach.},

Substantially increasing interest over the last two decades in high-entropy alloys and metallic glasses motivated the search for phase selection rules that could support the designing of new alloys. These rules are most often based on phenomenological correlation between structure and topological-, thermodynamic- and/or electronic structure-related properties of alloy systems. The available phase selection criteria are, therefore, not scientifically derived, but rather statistically constructed from available experimental data. Thus, they contain potential pitfalls, hindering the rational interpretation of obtained results. With this in mind, this work discusses the importance of defining the influence of phase transformation kinetics and synthesis method on an alloy’s final structure, while highlighting the challenges of using phenomenological alloying guidelines. Furthermore, we show that the interpretation of available phase selection criteria without caution may lead to the designing and fabrication of alloys with undesired phases.},

Subsequently, molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations were utilized to explore the physicochemical interaction process between amorphous aluminum oxides and polymers and its role at aluminum alloy–polymer interface. It was demonstrated that amorphous aluminum oxides generate strong electrostatic interactions with polymer, and ionic and ionic–covalent bonds are the main chemisorption under low reaction energy barrier, which reveals the origin of the favorable infiltration and high reactivity of amorphous aluminum oxides.

The requirements for high-speed steels are, on the one hand, extremely high hardnesses of over 800–900 HV and, on the other hand, the thermal stability of the microstructure up to 500 °C. This combination is achieved by complex precipitation-hardenable iron-based alloys. Common heat treatment practices for high-speed steels use salt baths or vacuum ovens, which are energetically unfavorable and require subsequent cleaning. The study consists of short-time hardening and short-time tempering on a laboratory scale by means of dilatometry and thereupon an implementation in an industrial induction hardening machine. The laboratory scale experiments demonstrate the feasibility of bringing sufficient alloying elements into solution by means of several heat treatment cycles despite short holding times of 1 s and less. Combined tests of short time hardening and tempering show a hardness of up to 850 HV10 that are competitive with the conventional heat treatment route. First attempts to transfer the process to an industrial setup exhibit some peculiarities in the process control, but reveal promising results with a surface hardness of up to 750 HV10.},

The results exhibited that Al 2014 mixture with embedded and interlocked 2D-Gr np (2.517 g/cm 3 ) matched the density of the matrix metal (2.771 g/cm 3 ) that facilitated homogeneous dispersion of 2D-Gr np and solved the dispersion problems during stir casting. As a result, AA 2014 embedded with 2D-Gr np acted as a carrier to homogeneously disperse combined with the squeeze casting process leading to the production of homogeneously reinforced MMC. This can be considered as a potential fabrication route for the launch vehicle super lightweight fuel tank (SLWT) structural application. The final casted plate after T6 heat treatment with 0.5 wt\% 2D-Gr np exhibited an improved tensile strength of 361 MPa (52\% higher than the monolithic 2014 aluminium alloy) with total elongation of 21\% and improved hardness of 119 HRB (45.5\% increase).

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing, has attracted increased attention in producing metallic parts with complex geometries, but it has proved difficult to prepare equiaxed fine-grain parts because the high thermal gradient in solidification commonly conduces the formation of coarse columnar grains. This work shows a solution to fine-grain titanium aluminide (TiAl) alloys by designing a high-frequency thermal cycling to control the solid-state phase transformations in layer-by-layer AM. After solidification, the specially-designed high-frequency thermal cycling can significantly refine the microstructure by repeatedly inducing the nucleation of new grains and suppressing the growth of these newborn fine grains. Therefore, even if solidification leads to coarse columnar grains, equiaxed fine-grain microstructure can still be obtained by solid-state phase transformations. The resulting TiAl alloys have fine heteromorphic grains (∼50 μm) and a fully lamellar microstructure. These fine grains contribute to good strength-ductility balance at room temperature, and their irregular shape and fully lamellar microstructure restrict the flow and distortion of grains at high temperatures, which stands a chance to significantly increase the operating temperature of TiAl parts.},

While the effects of boundary conditions and thickness on their bistability were more studied, few investigations have been focused on the effect of the beam shape. We systematically created new geometries by adding a second sinusoidal term varying in amplitudes and wavelengths, onto the prebuckled bistable beam shape. Nonlinear large deformation finite element modeling showed effective tuning of the forward and backward forces, snapping energy, and the maximum strain, by the wavelength and amplitude. Decent improvements in the overall stability of their second stable state were observed. The enhancement of the relatively weak snap-through behavior of the single beams was demonstrated by pairing a large variety of curly beams into double-beam configurations. Experimental observations on the 3D printed polylactic acid unit cells strongly supported the simulation results, and demonstrated the possibility of building multistable structures. The design of bistable beams with consistent thickness and comparable overall shapes, yet differing mechanical behavior, has opened up new avenues for the development of bi- and multistable structures in programmable mechanical metamaterials, particularly with materials fabricated at the resolution limit of the respective techniques.},

To determine the more suitable type for biomimetic modeling, the inherent structure–property relationships of both nacres were explored via mechanical tests with theoretical and numerical analyses. It is found that sheet nacre exhibits an outstanding combination of high strength and high toughness compared to columnar nacre under both tensile and compressive stresses, attributing to its staggered stacking characteristic. Under tensile stress, its effect can be quantitatively characterized by the platelet overlap ratio, with a measurement of 0.11 for columnar nacre and 0.47 for sheet nacre, where the larger ratio contributes to a higher tensile strength. Analytical and numerical models reveal that a higher overlap ratio or staggered stacking can trigger the transition from chain-like to step-like failure modes, significantly contributing to improved toughness. Under compressive stress, compared with columnar nacre’s aligned stacking, sheet nacre’s staggered platelet arrangement effectively postpones kinking failure and enhances both compressive strength and toughness. Therefore, the staggered arrangement of platelets in sheet nacre produces the more balanced mechanical properties, offering beneficial references for designing high-performance nacre-inspired materials.},

A GP emulator was developed to regress the dataset generated by FE model, then used to optimise the forming process. Importantly the FE simulations can capture the formation of wrinkles during the process under different forming configurations and boundary conditions. Rigid blocks (risers) were introduced to the forming process to affect the defects generation by controlling the block positions. Several indices abstracted from FE output files were used to assess the wrinkle level of the forming simulations and compared, as the model output. A small dataset was generated by Latin hypercubic sampling (LHS) to train an initial GP surrogate model. Then, the prediction error of the model was reduced to an acceptable level (&lt;10\%) through a Bayesian active learning method. The trained surrogate model was then used to optimise a forming process using only tens of simulations, rather than hundreds or even thousands, as required by traditional optimisation methods.},

The grain&#39;s growth in the upper part of the bulk is similar to the planar cladding, and the area near the substrate has no obvious columnar grains due to the instability of the temperature gradient for multiple heat input. The EBSD results show that changes in grain size and dislocation density occurred in the additive interface. A periodic fine-grained band in the middle of the bulk appeared, the average hardness of the fine-grained band is 805Hv 0.025 , and the hardness of the larger equiaxed grain area is 770Hv 0.025 . Numerical simulation was utilized to obtain temperature field of the SULC laser heating process by introducing the protective airflow and boiling model. The maximum temperature in SULC is about 16\% lower than in-air laser cladding, and the boiling model will not affect the temperature distribution.

  abstract     = {This study introduces an approach to fabricating soft magnetic composites (SMCs) that effectively address core loss while maintaining high magnetic conductivity. During the sintering process in a water vapor environment, the CeO 2 insulation layer facilitates the selective oxidation of Si while simultaneously impeding the outward diffusion of Fe and Cr. Consequently, a CeO 2 ·SiO 2 composite insulation layer forms within the FeSiCr-based SMCs. The FeSiCr-based SMCs with the CeO 2 ·SiO 2 composite insulation layer achieve a saturation magnetization of 153.1 emu/g, which is 10.9\% lower than that of FeSi 3.7 Cr 4.5 compacts, and exhibits a deterioration rate lower than previously reported values. Moreover, the permeability of the FeSiCr-based SMCs remains highly stable, demonstrating outstanding insulation characteristics. The total core loss and core loss separation results further corroborate that incorporating a CeO 2 ·SiO 2 composite insulation layer leads to a more pronounced reduction in interparticle eddy current loss than using a CeO 2 insulating layer alone. This performance enhancement can be attributed to the selective oxidation of a rare metal oxide insulation layer on a ferromagnetic metal particle substrate, a technique applied to SMCs for the first time. These findings hold significant implications for the design of high-performance SMCs in miniaturized and lightweight electromagnetic devices.},

  abstract     = {Manipulating and detecting polarization states of light plays an important role in developing technology in various fields, such as remote sensing, medical phototherapy, and quantum information. However, polarization control in mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths, especially longer than 10 µm, is obstructed by the limitation of material properties. Searching for materials and designing structures that respond to polarized light in this spectral range is still challenging. In this work, triangular core–shell AlGaAs/GaAs nanowires are numerically studied using the finite difference method. The effects of the core shift and rotating angle on the absorption coefficients are concentrated. Highly anisotropic absorption of polarized light in the mid-IR range is found when the core shifts upward and downward. Our results show that this anisotropic property is influenced by the symmetries of electron quantum states confined in the system. Broadband absorption wavelengths from 9.7 to 17.5 µm are unexpectedly found in the structure with appropriate system size. Our finding indicates that triangular core–shell nanowires are a potential platform for next-generation photonic devices capable of manipulating polarized light in a wide range of mid-IR wavelengths.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial infection is a series of pathological changes caused by bacteria invading the host and interacting with the body. Nowadays, bacterial infection remains a major public health issue and a severe threat to human life and health. Traditional antibiotic therapy is less effective against biofilms and easily causes bacterial resistance, which has urged the development of a substitute antibacterial strategy. Recently, antibacterial nanomaterials have attracted much attention. However, traditional nanomaterials face some problems of insufficient drug concentration at infectious sites and the toxicity of extravasated drug causes damage to healthy tissues. On the contrary, nanomaterials based on advanced on-demand and precise strategies reduce biological toxicity effectively while improving germicidal efficacy, since these type of nanodrugs have higher spatiotemporal controllability. Currently, some smart stimuli-responsive nanomaterials and targeting nanomaterials have been successfully constructed to achieve on-demand and precise antibacterial therapies. This review focuses on the mechanisms, working principles and antimicrobial properties of diverse nanoparticles based on on-demand and precise strategies. Meanwhile, the strengths and inferiorities of different on-demand and precise strategies have been discussed. Finally, this review concludes with our opinions on the future development directions for exploiting next-generation on-demand and precise antibacterial therapies.},

HEA thin films show these favourable properties with lower material costs than their bulk counterparts. Studying the HEA film-substrate interface represents challenges but is of extreme importance for the understanding of growth mechanisms with important implications for film adhesion. However, most HEA films were deposited on monocrystalline silicon substrates with limited practical applicability. Further, where commercial stainless steel, aluminium or titanium alloy substrates were used, the microstructure and chemistry at the interface were neglected. Here, we deposited AlCrFeCoNiCu 0.5 HEA thin films on stainless steel 304 (SS304) substrates using cathodic arc deposition with different substrate biases. The crystallography and microstructure were investigated using an X-ray and electron-microscopy based chatacterization. A transition of an incoherent to semi-coherent interface was observed from 0 V to -50 V of the substrate bias. Energy dispersive spectroscopy demonstrated a transition of Cr 2 O 3 to aluminum oxide across the interface. The nanoindentation tests revealed the significant improvement of mechanical properties of SS304 with HEA coatings.

Direct joining of these two metals is difficult, primarily because pure Mg and pure Fe are immiscible. Although a variety of interlayer materials have been used to facilitate the dissimilar joining in the literature, it is not well understood how the interlayer material affects the joint properties. In this study, a newly developed process, ultrasonic interlayered resistance spot welding (Ulti-RSW), was used to join an Mg alloy to a dual phase high-strength steel with two different interlayer materials: austenitic stainless steel and pure nickel. The IMCs formed with the two interlayers were drastically different, and computational thermodynamics and diffusion simulations revealed that such different IMCs resulted from the peculiar difference in nickel dissolution governed by local chemical potential gradients and diffusion kinetics. The joint with austenitic stainless steel interlayer had an under one micron thick Al-Fe IMC layer and a joint efficiency superior than that with the nickel interlayer as well as other joining processes in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Gradient nanostructured materials are regarded as a promising class of architectures with tunable mechanical properties, primarily dependent on the optimization of well-controlled fabrication parameters. In this paper, a microvariable-based constitutive model is incorporated into an integrated finite analysis technique. This approach correlates the fabrication parameters of surface mechanical grinding treatment (SMGT) with the corresponding measured mechanical properties of gradient structured (GS) materials, quantifying the relationship between process parameters, microstructure, and mechanical properties. Through theoretical prediction and experimental verification, it is observed that grain refinement, mechanical strength, and surface hardness are enhanced by increasing processing times and reducing path spacing. The yield stress of the fabricated GS material ranges from 126.8 MPa to 162.2 MPa, an increase of above 2.5 times compared to the original material, with a slight decrease in uniform elongation by a factor of 25.8\%, indicative of an excellent strength-ductility trade-off. The underlying mechanism for improved strength-ductility synergy is discussed, focusing on the importance of the tunable spatial distribution of grain size. This work sheds light on the potential application of gradient nanograined structures at an industrial scale and advances the fundamental understanding of strengthening mechanisms in gradient nanostructures.},

Fatigue resistance is tested under uniaxial conditions on miniaturized specimens that mimic the lattice sub-unit elements: struts and nodes. The collected data is used as input for the optimization algorithm to determine the specimen orientation that maximizes fatigue life. The optimized specimens are manufactured, tested under three-point-bending conditions, and analysed using metrological x-ray computed tomography to verify the improvement. The proposed workflow is able to produce a 24\% increase in specimen fatigue life by simply adjusting the orientation on the printing plane.},

Here, we present a novel free-form optimization for designing the bending and torsional stiffness of tubular structures using the multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MBO) method. The initial dataset of hole shapes is generated using a non-parametric Bézier curve, and the corresponding mechanical properties are estimated via numerical analysis. The acquisition function suggests a new hole shape with higher performance metrics based on the dataset, and updates to the regression model are made with new data points to improve prediction accuracy. Compared to a conventional tube with rectangular holes, the optimized design improves key factor, a ratio of bending stiffness to torsional rigidity, and torsional stiffness by 32\% and 25\%, respectively, by expanding the existing design space.

Comprehensive analysis revealed that the nano-AlN particles resulted in a significant modification of eutectic Si by causing the poisoning of twin plane re-entrant edge growth of Si and restricting the growth of Si crystals. Correspondingly, the morphology of Si transformed from flaky to fibrous. Furthermore, the synergy of areas with and without particle clusters was emphasized to address their contributions to the simultaneous improvement of the strength and ductility. When inoculating the micro-nano-particle clusters into the Al–9Si–3Cu alloy, the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation were 138 MPa, 253 MPa, and 5.8\%, respectively, corresponding to increases of 23.2\%, 23.4\%, and 123.1\% compared with those of the uninoculated Al–9Si–3Cu base alloy (112 MPa, 205 MPa, and 2.6\%, respectively).

Such microstructural characteristics, including the Type Ⅰ microstructure characterized by a wavy interface between primary α phase (α p ) and heterogeneous β t , and the Type Ⅱ microstructure, featuring heterogeneous β t embedded in the surrounding homogeneous β t structures, exhibit an enhanced strength with an insignificant loss of ductility. The enhanced strength is attributed to the increased fraction of α/β phase boundaries and precipitated residual β (β r ) nanoparticles, whereas good ductility is obtained due to the soft α p , coherent β nanoparticles, and deformable β lamellae in the heterogeneous β t .

As the virus targets the lungs directly, causing shortness of breath, continuous respiratory monitoring is crucial for evaluating health status. Therefore, the need for a smart face mask (SFM) capable of wirelessly monitoring human respiration in real-time has gained enormous attention. However, some challenges in developing these devices should be solved to make practical use of them possible. One key issue is to design a wearable SFM that is biocompatible and has fast responsivity for non-invasive and real-time tracking of respiration signals. Herein, we present a cost-effective and straightforward solution to produce innovative SFMs by depositing graphene-based coatings over commercial surgical masks. In particular, graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are integrated into a polycaprolactone (PCL) polymeric matrix. The resulting SFMs are characterized morphologically, and their electrical, electromechanical, and sensing properties are fully assessed. The proposed SFM exhibits remarkable durability (greater than1000 cycles) and excellent fast response time (∼42 ms), providing simultaneously normal and abnormal breath signals with clear differentiation. Finally, a developed mobile application monitors the mask wearer&#39;s breathing pattern wirelessly and provides alerts without compromising user-friendliness and comfort.},

The random forest feature importance is used to select necessary and sufficient structural features.

Even when only the selected four parameters are used, the NN model maintains a high prediction performance, suggesting that the four parameters are sufficient for describing the heat transfer and pressure loss. Four parameters are used to discuss the design concept for lattice-structured heat sinks. An appropriately intricate lattice structure exhibits improved heat transfer and reduced pressure loss compared to a simple lattice structure. This study provides new insights into the design of lattice-structured heat sinks fabricated by AM.},

  abstract     = {By mimicking the structure of the infrared-sensing organs of the “fire-beetles” of genus Melanophilaacuminata, we herein designed and fabricated an all-soild “fire-beetles” inspired infrared sensor, the key components of which is composed of a stress-concentrated photothermal expansion dendrite structure made of polydopamine enabled polydimethylsiloxane nanocomposite elastomer and a highly-sensitive piezoresistive membrane processed by direct laser writing carbonization. Our sensor possesses bolometric and photomechanic dual sensing modes, with the optimal responsivity of −1.4 W −1 and 2.2 W −1 , the detection limit of 0.03 mW/√Hz and 0.23 mW/√Hz, as well as the response time of 3.8 s and 2.5 s, respectively. The two-step photothermal and solid mechanics FEA modeling was performed to help understanding its sensing behavior in both bolometric and photomechanic operation modes, which indicates the possibility for orders-of-magnitude improvement on the responsiveness of our “fire-beetles” inspired IR sensor when increasing the bonding strength between the photothermal dendrite tip and the piezoresistive sensing membrane. The all-solid nature and the piezoresistive read-out scheme as well as its good performance make our sensor valuable for low-cost IR sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Edge-sealing, which involves treating the edges of wood products, improves water resistance. This study investigated the feasibility of edge-sealed cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels to reduce capillary water uptake, thereby resisting mould formation. The water and vapour permeabilities of ten characteristically different single-layer sealant coating systems were systematically determined. Multi-modal assessment leveraged by computed tomography (CT) scanning methodology was used to enhance detection of material characteristics beyond the standard coating permeability assessment. Moisture content was observed to change during the specimens’ absorption and desorption depending on the sealant system applied. The results revealed different characteristics of coatings during the water absorption and desorption stages. Findings from this study were used to develop recommendations regarding the water resistance of coating systems, curing time, susceptibility to mould formation, and industrial applicability. Results suggest that edge-sealed CLT could minimise the risk of mould formation, which can occur at worksites with minimal weather protection. The method developed in this study provides a basis to evaluate new coating systems and determine which use case is the best for a particular coating type. This study also incorporates insights from industry to identify future research orientations, which may pave the way for new designs and assessment techniques.},

In this paper, an innovative star-shaped hybrid metamaterial structure is proposed. Based on Bloch&#39;s theorem and finite element method, a dynamic model of the proposed structure is established, the band gap characteristics of the proposed structure are analyzed, and the generation mechanism of band gap is discussed with the mode shape of specific frequency. Then, the propagation characteristics of elastic wave in the proposed structure are analyzed by using the dispersion surface and group velocity images, and the attenuation region of vibration transmission in the finite periodic structure is consistent with the frequency range of band gap. Finally, the relationship between band gap and structure parameters is explored. The results show that the proposed structure has good band gap characteristics in the frequency range of 1000 Hz, the lowest frequency of band gap reaches 60.207 Hz, and the total band gap width accounts for 54.463\%. This research opens up an ideological route for the design of low frequency metamaterial structures.},

In this work, the damage degree of freeze–thaw of ECC was systematically assessed by using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. In addition, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Relaxometry measurements were also performed to obtain pore structure parameters, and the uniaxial tensile tests were also carried out to analyse the tensile performance after freeze–thaw cycles. From the acquired results, it was demonstrated that the EIS behaviour of ECC varied with the freeze–thaw cycles. The diameter of the Nyquist curve in high-frequency was gradually reduced by increasing the freeze–thaw cycles. Furthermore, the volume resistance of ECC after freeze–thaw gradually decreased with the increase in the number of freeze–thaw cycles. The simplified microstructure and conductive paths were used to describe the freeze–thaw damage mechanism of ECC. An equivalent circuit model of ECC exposed to freeze–thaw cycles was proposed, and the parameters of the equivalent circuit model were thoroughly analysed. The experimental findings clearly indicate that the EIS method is an appropriate technique for evaluating the damage degree of freeze–thaw of ECC.},

The stress–strain relationship obtained from nano-indentation tests agrees well with the tensile stress–strain curves. The fracture surface of Fe 2.5 Ni 2.5 CrAl Fe2.5Ni2.5CrAl MPEAs indicates the ductile fracture. Cracks tend to form at the interfaces of the FCC/BCC phases and expand along the voids by plastic deformation. Both dislocations and deformation twinning were responsible for the excellent properties. Second phase strengthening resulted in the largest strength increment. MD simulations revealed the formation of the HCP structure and stacking faults. Shockley dislocations were the key factor in the deformation behavior.

The deformation behavior and microstructure evolution of the Mg-Gd-Y-(Sm)-Zr alloys during hot compression were investigated systematically. The effects of Sm element addition on the workability and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) behavior of the Mg-5.5Gd-3Y-0.5Zr (0Sm) alloy was revealed. Sm element will increase the thermal activation energy and reduce the discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) at 350 °C and 400 °C. The Mg 5 (Gd)-type phases are precipitated dynamically in the Mg matrix during low-temperature deformation process, and recrystallization occurs near the precipitated phase particles. At 450 °C and 500 °C, the continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) is more prone to occur in the 1Sm alloy due to the high accumulation of misorientation angles in the initial coarse grains, so the DRX fraction of 1Sm alloy is higher than that of the 0Sm alloy. Furthermore, it is found that Sm element can weaken the basal texture. The intensity of the basal texture of the DRX grains of 1Sm alloy is lower than that of the 0Sm alloy at any temperatures. Based on the processing map, the optimum hot forming parameters of the 1Sm alloy is defined as temperature range 450–500 °C and strain rate range 0.01–0.1 s −1 .},

Genipin introduction endowed the crosslinking of gelatin hydrogels with weak mechanical properties that were reinforced by BSA bridging to realize suitable mechanical properties for wound dressing, including excellent flexibility and appropriate rigidity. The bioactivity of NV released by the hydrogels resulted in efficient ROS scavenging and favorable immunomodulatory activity as well as promoted cell proliferation and migration of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells. Proteomic analysis confirmed that NV harbors a variety of growth factors that can promote wound healing. In vivo , the NV@BSA-GEL hydrogel had superior wound healing effects compared to BSA-GEL, including faster wound healing, stimulation of angiogenesis, contributing to an anti-inflammatory extracellular matrix, and promoting skin maturation, with no systemic toxicity. Thus, the combined merits of NV@BSA-GEL suggest that it has high potential as a new hydrogel dressing for the safe and efficient treatment of diabetic wounds.},

In this study, woven lattices were manufactured with stainless steel (SS) and copper (Cu) wires via a three-dimensional (3D) weaving process to form SS, Cu, and SS–Cu lattices. Following fabrication, selective bonding using Cusil® was applied to either one or both sides of the SS–Cu weaves to form single-sided bonded SS–Cu composite (B1C) lattices and double-sided bonded SS–Cu composite (B2C) lattices. Measurements of dynamic and quasi-static mechanical properties of both unbonded and bonded weaves demonstrate that all three unbonded lattices exhibit high loss factors with a relatively low normalized effective elastic modulus. In contrast, the bonded SS–Cu lattices exhibit lower loss factors but higher normalized effective elastic moduli. We attribute the high loss factors and relative low moduli to wire rearrangement during deformation in the form of wire sliding and rotation that becomes partially inhibited when we bond Cu wires on one or both sides of the SS–Cu weaves. We discuss sources for the observed variations in properties and demonstrate an ability to both tune and obtain exceptional damping and moderate stiffness in architected metallic lattices.},

The algorithms are evaluated using a simple nonlinear problem: minimizing the end displacement of a cantilever beam fixed on one side and loaded by gravity. The global optimum for a coarse mesh grid is computed by simulating nearly 60 million possible topology designs using a Brute-Force search. We use this benchmark to evaluate the computational cost and objective values of known and newly developed optimization methods. The known methods are binary-coded Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and Free Shape Optimization. The Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search (RVNS) has not yet been applied to topology optimization. We provide two implementations of RVNS: Breadth-First Search with a limited search depth (BFSL) and with an optional restriction for the size of the simultaneously modified area (TBFSL). According to the benchmark, TBFSL is the most efficient approach. For the optimization on a finer mesh grid, TBFSL is combined with a multi-grid approach to further increase efficiency.},

In this work, a high throughput microstructure-micromechanical correlative study is presented by combining high-resolution nanoindentation, site-specific microscopy, and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering. The investigated HEA has a heterogenous microstructure consisting of austenite and martensite phases. Comparison of elastoplastic and microstructural maps illustrate dependency of phase, crystal orientation, and interfacial constraints on the micromechanical response. The disproportionately high hardness found in martensite-rich area is attributed to its higher lattice stability to shear, creation of coherent twin boundaries, and copious dislocation activities in the twin interfaces formed in martensite phase during nanoindentation. The hierarchy in twinning behavior depends on the relative direction of loading with the c-axis of h.c.p. martensitic phase. Deformation in f.c.c. austenitic grains is slip-dominated and demonstrates orientation dependency during incipient plasticity and phase transformation. GMM based classification of hardness to modulus ratio intuitively correlates work-hardening with phase distribution due to the distinctive deformation micromechanical responses of austenite and martensite phases.},

The area reduction of the samples pre-deformed for 0\%, 10\%, 20\%, and 25\% are 0.25, 0.32, 0.37, and 0.35, respectively at a tensile temperature of 1150 ˚C. When the pre-deformation degree is within the range of 0–20\%, the deformation storage energy (DSE) gradually increases with the pre-deformation degree. The SRX amount at the high-temperature holding stage and the DRX amount in the high-temperature deformation stage significantly increases, and the grain size gradually decreases. As a result, crack initiation and propagation are inhibited, and thermoplasticity improves. However, when the pre-deformation degree is increased to 25\%, the grains grow abnormally during the high-temperature tensile deformation, and a large number of sigma phases are induced, which deteriorates the thermoplasticity of the SASS.},

  abstract     = {Progress toward developing next-generation biomaterials applied in complex bone defect is expected to effectively integrate osteogenic and anti-bacteria capability. However, current biomaterials often achieve the two functions separately. Inspired by photothermal effect, exogenous light-induced thermal variations can efficiently facilitate bone regeneration and bacteria eradication. Here, a bioactive hydrogel BMP-2@PNH-TA with simultaneously osteogenic and anti-bacterial capacities is presented, which is based on the near infrared (NIR) induced photothermal effect to perform integrated photothermal therapy (PTT). In detail, photothermal effect and photothermal-controlled release of osteogenic and anti-bacterial factors through sponge-like effect could exert integrated influence on bone regeneration under complex situation. The composite hydrogel can mediate pro-osteogenesis under mild temperature and controlled release of BMP-2 and tannin in response to NIR stimulation with low power, while efficiently eradicate bacteria via controlled release of O-HACC and thermal effect with high power. The customized PTT strategy significantly shortened the duration time of bone regeneration up to almost 50\% in rat cranial bone defect. It is anticipated that the concept of integrated PTT for bone regeneration will cast new insights into developing high-performance therapeutic strategy with combined biological functions.},

The in vitro drug elution characteristics of pharmaceuticals from electrospun nanofibers was estimated. The in vivo efficacies of PCL stent/biomolecules-biomolecule-eluting nanofibers for the therapy of treatment of tendon rupture were also evaluated on in a rabbit model with histological examinations. The experimental results showed that the PCL stents with diamond pores exhibited the best mechanical properties. Drug-loaded PLGA nanofibers provided sustained discharges of vancomycin and ceftazidime for 40 days and lidocaine for over 10 days in vitro . The in vivo outcomes suggested that the repaired tendon strengths in the no-stent group and stent-only group (without drugs) showed poorer strength than the control (normal tendons with no surgery). Furthermore, the stent/drug group exhibited a higher recovery rate than the stent-only group. The integration of the additively manufactured PCL tubular stent and electrospun drug-eluting PLGA nanofibrous membranes can effectively enhance tendon treatment in a rabbit model.},

The introduction of additional redox pseudocapacitance through oxygen-containing functional groups is a novel strategy to improve the specific capacity of carbon materials. Whereas the influence mechanism of oxygen-containing functional groups on carbon-based electrode materials needs to be explored in-depth. Here, we summarize the types, introductions and characterization methods of oxygen-containing functional groups in carbon materials, and emphatically explain the effect of oxygen-containing functional groups on the structure and physico-chemical properties of carbon-based electrode materials for supercapacitors at the mechanism level, which has not been reported in previous reviews. Different types or content differences of oxygen-containing functional groups can cause changes in the polarity, surface energy, adsorption energy, impedance, energy bands and other aspects of carbon materials, and even lead to defects affecting the structure and physicochemical properties. The mutual constraint relationship between high specific capacity and excellent conductivity caused by the content of oxygen-containing functional groups is also pointed out.

  abstract     = {This work describes a strategy to employ complex carbides for high-yield microalloyed 4Mn steels processed by quenching and reversion (Q&amp;R). The nano/microstructural details are investigated by using electron microscopy and atom probe. It is found that complex carbides are classified into two types and contribute to yield strength in different ways. First, coarse carbides (MC1), which are retained after austenization and quenching, provide the Zener pinning effect and contribute to strengthening by microstructure refinement and precipitation hardening. Second, nanoscale carbides (MC2), which precipitate in martensite during austenite reversion, provide precipitation hardening. Furthermore, the precipitation of MC1 accelerates austenite reversion due to the finer martensite microstructure. Hence, the strengthening effects and TRIP effect can be tuned by controlling the proportion of the two types of carbide. This concept is validated in Ti-Mo 4Mn steel, which exhibits a high yield strength of about 850 MPa, a high ultimate tensile strength of about 950 MPa, and excellent elongation of over 20\%. The complex carbide strategy is able to increase yield strength without sacrificing much ductility for Q&amp;R medium-Mn steels.},

In this paper, we challenge this misconception and study an anisotropic architectured material exhibiting shear-shear and shear-normal coupling from the standpoint of classical continuum mechanics. The material is non-regular tetrahedron lattice, a potential candidate for biomedical implants, but the lack of understanding about its anisotropic behavior and mechanical couplings has limited its application. We exploited the unit-cell definition with periodic boundary conditions and performed elastic and elastoplastic homogenizations. Non-zero coupling sub-matrices appeared in the homogenized elasticity matrix, which we further transformed into material’s natural coordinate system using elastic distance function. This allowed for anisotropy identification and determination of all the coupling parameters. Next, compression tests are conducted on laser powder bed fused Al-12Si (mass\%) lattice samples with different relative densities and spatial orientations. Employing test data, mechanical anisotropy and shear-normal couplings are experimentally characterized. Both numerical and experimental results confirmed the presence of mechanical couplings and predicted a similar anisotropic tendency in the material. Finally, the role of manufacturing defects in deterioration of as-designed mechanical properties is discussed.},

Superelastic materials working at high temperatures and with a wide temperature range are increasingly required for demanding applications. Until recently, high-temperature superelasticity has only been achievable with multicomponent alloys fabricated by complex processes. In this study, a novel framework of multi-scale models enabling texture and microstructure design is proposed for high-performance NiTi fabrication via laser powder bed fusion. Based on the developed framework, a Ni-lean Ni(49.4 at.\%)-Ti alloy is, for the first time, endowed with a 4\% high-temperature compressive superelasticity. A 001 001 texture, unfavorable for plastic slip, is created to realize enhanced functionality. The unprecedented superelasticity can be maintained up to 453 K, which is comparable with but has a wider superelastic temperature range (∼110 K) than rare earth alloyed NiTi alloys, previously only realizable with grain refinement, and other complicated post-processing operations. At the same time, its shape memory stability is also improved due to existing textured 100 100 martensite and intergranular precipitation of Ti 2 NiOx. This discovery reframes the way that we design superior performance NiTi based alloys through directly tailoring crystallographic orientations during additive manufacturing.},

A micromechanical finite element formulation provides values of 5 MPa for interfacial shear strength and 1 J/m 2 for interfacial fracture toughness. From the multiple cracking behavior of the clay coating, a clay strength ≈ 225 MPa is estimated by the Weibull strength parameter from fragmentation diagrams.

So far, experts design experiments to extract and select important microstructural features based on their experience and evidence from literature. These features often serve as indicator for interpretation of corresponding mechanical properties. But such approaches commonly capture only a few features while others remain hidden in the microstructure. This becomes evident for complex bainitic microstructures in contrast to other microstructures in steel. In this study, we use a machine learning approach to correlate the most important morphological features, retrieved from segmented Martensite-Austenite (M−A) islands in microscopy images of bainite, with the impact energy from mechanical testing. The used open-source framework selects the most important features and explains their global and individual contributions on the model output.

The macroscopic electromagnetic performances consisting of thrust-mass ratio and power dissipation are taken as the optimization objective, which improves the performance more directly and comprehensively than traditional optimization methods. A streamlined dual-loop optimization framework is constructed and proved to be able to reduce the computational consumption by tens of times compared to the initial conventional framework, authentically guaranteeing a smooth integrated optimization. At the outer loop of the optimization framework, this paper proposes an oriented strategy for the individuals of Genetic Algorithm (GA) to quickly meet the strict constraints. The integrated optimization method solves the parameter coupling problem between electromagnet and stiffness. Compared to existing optimized structure, the resulting structure improves the thrust-mass ratio by 7.7\%, power dissipation by 12.8\% and natural frequency by 16.6\%, respectively. Mechatronic experimental results in maglev planar motor systems show that the proposed integrated optimization can significantly improve the control bandwidth and reduce the current consumption, laying the foundation for better performance in practical applications.},

To represent the details of jointed rock masses, rock-like specimens containing inclined joint sets were generally prepared by three-dimensional (3D) printing using sand. Digital image correlation (DIC) was employed for full-field deformation measurement during loading. The results show that the sand 3D-printed specimen has distinct advantages in the preparation of jointed rock masses. DIC was extended to measure the displacement vector field around newly propagated cracks. Two types of cracks are recognized: tensile and shear cracks. Two different coalescence patterns are classified: step-path failure and planar failure. A covariance matrix-based multivariate measure, the rate of effective variance change (REVC), was proposed to quantify the dispersion of strain data. The variation in the strain dispersion measure was found to be closely related to the crack type. For the first occurrence of tensile and shear cracks, the rates of mutation (RMs) are within the ranges of 1.56–3.42 and 14.54–86.44, respectively, which can be considered a new crack identification criterion. A virtual extensometer method based on DIC was established to interpret the variation mechanism of the REVC associated with different crack types.},

This study explores whether MD models of bitumen that are conventionally assumed to be in equilibrium can still undergo significant phase separation over considerably long simulation times. It also aims to establish a more formal pathway to build and study models with highly heterogeneous arrangements of their molecules. Moreover, it aims to evaluate whether the presence of distinct morphologies have a significant impact in numerous physical properties of bitumen. The study shows that conventional and widely used models of bitumen exhibit significant molecular rearrangements over long times (&gt;360 ns). It also shows that building heterogeneous morphologies is possible and result in energetically favorable conformations. Moreover, it proves that studying properties regularly used to validate MD models of bitumen (e.g., density) are insufficient in assessing the impact of different morphologies; more thorough methods are required to evaluate them.},

  abstract     = {In squeezing ground tunnel construction, yielding elements must absorb the large tunnel deformation without damaging the tunnel lining. Various designs for these highly compressible structures exist. Still, they all share one commonality: they are complicated to manufacture, and it is difficult to alter their design to match desired compressive properties. A new yielding element design is presented here, consisting of corrugated metal plates embedded within fiber-reinforced concrete. As this yielding element is compressed, the corrugated plates are gradually flattened, increasing the plates’ stiffness. This mechanism enables the engineering of structures with monotonically increasing compressive stress–strain curves and matches the target compressive properties. When compared against alternate reinforcement schemes, including fiber reinforcement, flat plate reinforcement, and polymeric lattice reinforcement, compression results indicate that only the corrugated metal plate reinforcement produced monotonically increasing stress–strain curves while keeping stress levels below a prescribed limit. Additionally, the corrugated metal plate-reinforced specimens began densification at a strain 280\% larger than the strain at which the fiber-reinforced samples began densification, indicating that the corrugated metal plates extended the yield plateau. Fiber-reinforced concrete in conjunction with corrugated metal plates shows promise for use as a yielding element.},

  abstract     = {Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) is increasingly used for the manufacturing of complex metal parts. A major hurdle for L-PBF to manufacture critical parts is the lack of knowledge about the effects of inner material defects on the material properties. This paper presents a new method to manufacture specimens with inner lack of fusion (LOF) defects and to detect and localize them simultaneously by the in-process monitoring tool Optical Tomography (OT). The presence of defects at locations indicated by OT was verified through Computed Tomography analyses. Correlative metallographic preparation of the processed specimens showed LOF defects with their main extent within the build plane and sharp edges. Moreover, microstructural investigations revealed a fine globular grain structure and coarse dendritic segregations in the area, influenced by the defect. Correlations between the LOF defects analyzed in the microstructure and corresponding OT indications were established. Tensile tests and high cycle fatigue tests were performed on defective and non-defective material to evaluate the effects of LOF defects on the material properties of Hastelloy® X manufactured by L-PBF. While a minor influence of the LOF defects on static material properties was identified, the fatigue life of the defective specimens was significantly reduced.},

The appearance of pillar arrays extends the passivation range and increases the pitting potential of 316L in HNO 3 solution, while the corrosion current density decreases in NaNO 3 solution. The enhanced corrosion resistance was attributed to the coeffect of elimination of corrosion-sensitive features and hydrophobicity prompted by electrochemical etching.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the development of 3D mini-vascular networks has demonstrated their ability to facilitate self-healing in concrete structures. These 3D printed polylactide (PLA) hollow ligament tetrahedral shaped units (TETs) can heal multiple occurrences of damage by releasing a single-component healing agent stored within. To improve the healing efficacy of the concrete-TET system whilst overcoming the potentially short shelf life of single-component healing agents, the TETs design was modified. TETs with co-axial hollow ligaments (d-TETs) suitable for storing bi-component healing agents were manufactured. Different healing agents, including epoxy resin (i.e. cycloaliphatic epoxy resin plus hardener) and sodium silicate in isolation or in combination with either nanosilica or nanolime solution were explored. The d-TETs were effective in storing these bi-component healing agents without them undergoing premature mixing and curing. Moreover, the d-TETs successfully ruptured and released healing agents at a crack width of 0.35 mm. After one damage-healing cycle, significant strength and stiffness recovery was achieved: d-TETs hosting sodium silicate and nano-lime yielded the best strength recovery (25\%), whilst most other sodium silicate-based healing agent combinations demonstrated stiffness recoveries of approximately 40\%. This demonstrates the efficiency of the d-TETs concept as a system, which allows strength and stiffness recovery despite the limited volume of healing agent.},

Electrodeposited Fe-W alloy is considered a possible alternative, but its high coefficient of friction (COF), high wear rate owing to tribo-oxidation, and high corrosion rate hinder its practical application. In this study, we attempted to solve these problems by modifying the microstructure of Fe-W alloy by incorporating 2D-structured graphene. The effect of graphene incorporation on the structure of the Fe-W alloy and its properties, especially microhardness, wear, and corrosion resistance, were investigated. The results showed the graphene effectively modified the columnar structure of the Fe-W alloy by inhibiting the vertical growth of clusters during electrodeposition, leading to fragmentation of the vertical cluster boundaries. This improved the hardness by as much as 17\% up to 9.1 GPa, and the corrosion resistance by changing the corrosion mechanism from localized corrosion to uniform corrosion. In addition, the graphene reduced the COF and wear rate by reducing the Fe 2 O 3 formed by tribo-oxidation to a lower oxidation state. The structural modification of the plating by graphene incorporation thus provides an effective solution to improving the performance of Fe-W alloys.},

However, during these tests on ductile metals the necking phenomenon occurs, and the stress and strain states become triaxial and non-uniform. In the scientific literature several characterization methods have been proposed to properly address these aspects. The present work proposes an alternative strategy for identifying the plastic flow curve, focusing on temperature and strain-rate insensitive elasto-plastic materials. This is a hybrid methodology whereby a FE-based inverse method is combined with the 1D description of necking proposed by Audoly and Hutchinson. Indeed, the inverse method employs as target function the specimen profile, but to properly define it a relationship between the original and the deformed configuration of the tensile sample is required, and it is provided by this 1D model. The accuracy and the validity of the proposed strategy was verified on benchmark cases with ad-hoc experimental profiles obtained via numerical simulations. Finally, this method was applied to real case studies and the identified plastic flow curve was compared with the one obtained using a traditional FE-based inverse method having as target the force-stroke curve.},

  abstract     = {Tannin-furanic foams are a promising and biogenic alternative to oil-based porous materials. Their hydrophilic character, typically indicated by a contact angle to water of 70°, limits some potential applications (for instance outdoor thermal insulation). To overcome this, a post-synthetic surface modification step with different fluorine-free organosilanes at 323 K was investigated with a focus on the final, hydrophobic performance. On the one side, methyltrimethoxysilane, and 3-(chloropropyl)trimethoxysilane, which undergo self-condensation as well as bonding to the hydroxy groups of the tannin polymer, were applied. A modified surface structure and a 25 to 50\% weight increase, depending on the molecular weight of the silylation agent, were observed. Contrary, a mono-functional silane, precicely trimethylchlorosilane, shows only a slight increase in weight, yet also condenses onto the polymer surface without forming a protective surface coating layer. Contact angle measurements using water show an increase from 70° (unmodified) up to 145° for a silane-modified foam. Nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy show the formation of covalent bonds between the silane and the biogenic polymer matrix. The obtained material is less prone to absorb water from a humid atmosphere (reduction of 75\%) and is highly efficient for the removal of non-polar contaminants from water, featuring new possible applications in humid surrounds.},

  abstract     = {Metasurfaces, which are usually passive or non-radiating, have provided unprecedented degree of freedom especially for scattering manipulation. For the manipulating radiation, metasurfaces often serve as auxiliaries to radiators since they cannot radiate themselves. Thus, it is unfavorable for integration and miniaturization. In this work, we propose the concept of active–passive compound metasurface (APCM) and explore the possibility of utilizing meta -atoms as active radiators, so as to simultaneously achieve flexible radiation and scattering manipulations at the same time. To this end, a meta -atom structure with large reflection phase-span is delicately designed. In this way, the meta -atom can serve both as wideband radiator fed by a probe and reflection-phase modulator. Flexible scattering-pattern manipulation for one polarization state and high-efficiency radiation-pattern manipulation for the orthogonal polarization state can be simultaneously achieved within the same band from 8.0 to 12.0 GHz. As a proof of concept, two prototypes, one for scattering-cancellation and high-directive radiation while the other for deflected reflection and vortex-beam radiation, were designed, fabricated, and measured, respectively. Both the simulated and measured results verify the active–passive compound design. This work paves an alternative route to integrated multi-functional materials or interfaces and may find wide applications in next-generation communication, radar, smart skin, and others.},

Exfoliation of h-BNs had negligible effect on improvement of thermal properties, however, it caused 5.7 and 2.3 times enhancement in the electrical volume resistivity compared to the pristine SR and pure h-BN containing nanocomposite, respectively. Both of the BNNSs caused improvement in the heat dissipation performances of SR matrix, however, the exfoliated one with MEG showed better performances.

However, synthesis of large-sized CQDs that exhibit good stability and sensitivity for extended wavelength still remains a technological challenge. In this paper, a novel broadband photodetector based on small size PbS CQDs (with exciton absorption peak at 927 nm) and Bi 2 Te 3 (with wide spectral sensitivity and high absorption) was developed and studied. The device, which comprised of ITO/AZO/PbS CQDs/Bi 2 Te 3 /Al, provided an excellent band alignment that facilitated charge dissociation and transmission hence improving the device sensitivity. Furthermore, wavelength extension was also realized through the synergistic effect of these materials, thus demonstrating broadband photodetection with high sensitivity. The heterostructure photodetector demonstrated good performance in the visible and near infrared ranges, especially at a wavelength of 1050 nm exhibiting a high responsivity ( R ) and detectivity ( D* ) of 161 A/W and 3.2 × 10 13 Jones, respectively. In addition, the device exhibited excellent stability and reversibility after one month of storage without any encapsulation. This work lays a good foundation for the construction of the next generation of highly sensitive broadband CQDs photodetectors.},

  abstract     = {Reducing lipid uptake of macrophages and stimulating cholesterol efflux are two necessary steps for atherosclerotic plaque regression. In this study, a compound of curcumin nicotinate (CN) was synthesized from nicotinic acid which can raise raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and curcumin which can lower lipid. However, the shortcomings of CN, such as poor water solubility and low bioavailability, limit its clinical application. In this article, a CN loaded biomimetic nanosystem was constructed by using Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs) to improve its solubility, thereby changing its administration route. In addition, hyaluronic acid (HA) modification on the biomimetic PB NPs was adopted to prolong circulation time and improve the accumulation of drugs in the plaque region. Mechanism studies have shown that the constructed nanosystem could exert anti-AS effects through the pathway of Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9(PCSK9) /Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), ATP Binding Cassette Transporter A1(ABCA1) /Caveolin-1 /Liver X Receptor (LXR). These findings indicated that the designed nano-platform is expected to be used for prevention and targeted therapy of atherosclerosis.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes mellitus is common among patients undergoing stent implantation therapy. Although bioresorbable iron stents have good biocompatibility and mechanical performance, most supporting evidence has been obtained from studies conducted under normoglycemic conditions; thus, the reality in patients with diabetes is unknown. We introduced a hyperglycemic circulation device that measured iron stent degradation to address this issue. A hyperglycemia co-culture medium was used to evaluate biocompatibility after iron stent degradation. A diabetic rabbit model was established to confirm the results of in vitro assays. The significant findings were as follows: a) iron stent degradation increased under hyperglycemic conditions, affecting the mechanical supporting properties; b) iron stent degradation under hyperglycemic conditions inhibited endothelial cell viability and proliferation; c) iron stent degradation increased in diabetes, preventing re-endothelialization; and d) diabetes-induced iron stent degradation promoted inflammatory responses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the biological profile of iron stent degradation in diabetes, highlighting the different features of iron stent degradation in patients with hyperglycemia.},

In addition, elastic property mapping has indicated the presence of at least an order-of-magnitude larger length scales, of which the origin continues to remain unknown. Here we demonstrate the existence of an elastic decorrelation length of the order of 100 nm in a Zr-based bulk MG using spatially resolved elastic property mapping via nanoindentation. Since compositional modulations, sufficiently large to account for this elastic microstructure, were not resolved by analytical scanning-transmission electron microscopy, chemical phase separation such as spinodal decomposition cannot explain their presence. Instead, we argue that the revealed long-range elastic modulations stem from structural variations affecting the local density. These emerge during solidification and are strongly influenced by the cooling constraints imposed on bulk MGs during the casting process.},

Cotton dressings are widely used in clinical practice; however, few dressings can simultaneously achieve rapid hemostasis and high-efficacy antimicrobial. Herein, a versatile cotton dressing (GCQCNF-5) was masterly developed by sequentially deposition catechol modified quaternary chitosan (CQCS) and gelatin onto a cotton nonwoven fabric (NF) surface. Because of the presence of a gelatin sponge layer with suitable thickness and porosity on its surface, GCQCNF-5 exhibits a notably enhanced hemostatic effect compared to NF both in vitro and in vivo , which is even slightly superior to that of MHS (a commercial gelatin hemostatic sponge). Moreover, after exerting a rapid hemostasis effect, GCQCNF-5 can further exploit CQCS to exert excellent immediate antimicrobial and long-lasting bacteriostatic effects. In vivo wound healing experiments further indicated that GCQCNF-5 could significantly promote rapid healing of infected wounds by effectively sterilizing, absorbing exudates, and providing moist healing environments. This study clearly demonstrated that GCQCNF-5 is a versatile wound dressing that can achieve simultaneously rapid hemostasis, high-efficiency antimicrobial, and promote rapid healing of infected wounds, with great application potential for the treatment of severe bleeding wounds.},

  abstract     = {To aid the development of air filters with high-efficiency fine particulate matter (PM) capture properties, the electrospinnabilities of natural cellulose nanofibers , which considerably affect filter performance, were investigated via rheological behavior analysis. The cellulose nanofibers were prepared by mixing trifluoroacetic acid (to dissolve cellulose) and 1,2-dichloroethane (to improve electrospinnability) with various types of cellulose. The rheological behavior of the precursor solution was analyzed according to mixing time via large amplitude oscillatory shear studies. The electrospinnability of the cellulose precursor solution was investigated based on the flow-induced structural anisotropy characteristics and the storage-loss moduli plot obtained by varying the frequencies. The precursor solution with hardwood pulp (HP) exhibited the highest specific surface area and the lowest combined content of hemicellulose and lignin, and thus, the optimal electrospinnability. The electrospun HP nanofiber sample with an HP content of 1.5 wt\% displayed the optimal electrospinnability and the highest specific surface area of 1021 m 2 /g. It also exhibited high-efficiency PM capture characteristics, such as a PM 2.5 capture efficiency and quality factor and an air permeability of 98.99\%, 0.27, and 309 cm 3 /cm 2 s, respectively.

Here, it is demonstrated that high-density 9R phase with a columnar nanotwinned structure can be obtained through rational compositional design in a novel NiMnAlFeCr multi-principal element alloy. A combined density functional theory (DFT) study and molecular dynamics simulation (MD) was also performed to study the impact of alloy composition on the stability of 9R phase and its consequences on strength. The results showed that the energy barrier of formation of stacking fault can be obviously reduced by introduction of Fe or Cr in NiMn solid solution and its stability can be enhanced by simultaneously addition a certain range of Fe and Cr, which in favoring formation of high-density 9R phase.The experimental and simulation results demonstrate the substantial impact of 9R phase on the mechanical properties of the (Ni 50 Mn 30 Al 20 ) 100-x (FeCr) x alloys.

It was found that the TiC particle in all prepared coatings was ultrafine scale with a pure interface. Particularly, the TiC particle added by the external method was presented as a composite structure in which the ex-situ TiC was wrapped with the in-situ TiC. For the in-situ method, as the (Ti + C) content increased (5–15 wt.\%), the TiC particle changed from blocky to petal shape, and the wear volume was decreased and then increased. Compared with the adding of 10 wt.\% nano-TiC externally, the coating with adding 10 wt.\% (Ti + C) presented with greater wear resistant for its higher TiC content. The blocky TiC particles was beneficial to deflecting cracks and serving as wear-resistant skeletons due to the great interfacial bonding strength. This study provides a guidance for the preparation of high-performance Fe-based wear-resistant coatings for both newborn and remanufactured equipment parts.},

They are built up of ordered planar rod networks and exhibit higher non-crystallographic rotational symmetries. However, they lack the translational symmetry associated with periodic lattice metamaterials. We present schematics illustrating their development based on pattern-unique mathematical substitution rules and exploit a numerical framework from previous work to demonstrate that they exhibit fascinating near-isotropic properties. The lattice structures are compared to the well-known hexagonal lattice with respect to their elastic anisotropy measure and the proximity of their bulk and shear moduli to Hashin–Shtrikman-Walpole limits. The study lends insight into the cost-constrained benefits of introducing additional connectivities between aperiodically-ordered point sets. The results show that aperiodic lattices have the potential to yield superior mechanical properties to periodic ones subject to the mechanical rigidity of the underlying shapes that constitute the pattern. The inherent ‘near-isotropy’ associated with these aperiodic structures, even with uniform strut thicknesses and at low fractional densities, and the ordered and varied orientation of their lattice struts present them as promising mesoscale architecture for solving complex multi-axially loaded structural optimization problems, providing inspiration for this study.},

PFOA is uniformly coated on the Al NPs. The composition of MIC system was analyzed by FTIR and XRD. The combustion performance of MICs was tested by laser ignition, and the decomposition mechanism of PFOA-functionalized Al MICs was studied by DSC-TG. Results show that the exothermic process and activation energy of MICs are affected by the Preignition reactions (PIR) interface fuel-oxidizer ratios.

After ischemic stroke, the central nervous system (CNS) microenvironment at the site of injury is often inflammatory and inhibitory, which limits endogenous neurogenesis and regeneration. Current treatments fail to promote recovery in disabled survivors because of the poor regenerative capacity of the CNS, and thus there is an urgent need to develop biomaterials that create a microenvironment that is conducive to neurogenesis. Injectable hydrogels that mimic native properties hold great potential for tissue repair. Hydrogels alone or in combination with other therapeutics can remodel the hostile stroke microenvironment by modulating neuroinflammation to promote exogenous and endogenous regenerative repair processes. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology and current treatment approaches for brain repair and functional recovery in ischemic stroke, and then provide an overview of the potential of hydrogels in stroke treatment.

  abstract     = {Hydrogel adhesives are gaining popularity in tissue engineering and regeneration medicine. However, unsatisfactory anti-tension properties of traditional hydrogels limit their practical uses, particularly in sports medicine, which usually requires robust mechanical properties. Here, we design a tissue adhesive patch based on a bioadhesive hydrogel (HAMA-GelNB) and a tough elastomer (PDMS) that can atraumatically and rapidly repair tissue injuries such as meniscus tears. The strong and sutureless sealing capabilities of the hybrids are demonstrated using ex vivo porcine skin and stomach models. In vitro cell studies and in vivo subcutaneous implantation models are used and demonstrated the biocompatibility of the material. Finally, the efficiency of the tissue adhesive patch is demonstrated using a rabbit meniscus tear model which is challenging in clinic. The results of macroscopic images and histological analysis revealed that the surface of cartilage in the material-treated group was slightly worn, but the untreated group developed progressive cartilage degeneration. These findings demonstrate that the hydrogel-elastomer composite tissue adhesive could be an alternative to sutures for tissue repair and is promising in translational medicine.},

However, due to the lack of biological activity and high elastic modulus, its application scope and efficacy are greatly limited, such as in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures(OVCF). For this reason, new functional bone cement was synthesized and designed to address and improve those shortcomings. In this study, Tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) and Whitlockite (WH) were incorporated with PMMA cement to prepare a novel bone cement (TTCP/WH) and systemically evaluated its characteristics such as the operational working time and mechanical properties, etc. based on the International Standardization Organization standard (ISO 5833). Also, the biocompatibility and osteogenic activity of TTCP/WH bone cement were analyzed in vitro, and the rabbit ilium bone defect model was also used to evaluate osteoconduction and osseointegration with native bone tissue. Our results showed that TTCP/WH functional bone cement exhibited good osteoconductivity compared with bio-inert PMMA bone cement, facilitated new bone formation, and was histocompatible with surrounding bone tissue while maintaining its original purpose of supporting. So, TTCP/WH functional bone cement may be a promising alternative to overcome PMMA cement’s limitations in treating OVCF.},

Therefore, to test our hypothesis, polycaprolactone/nano-hydroxyapatite/collagen scaffolds with dual growth factors (BMP-2 and FGF-2) and various hydrogel patterns (positive, edge, and radial patterns) were fabricated at the same ratio and concentration of dual growth factors. Consequently, we revealed that the in vitro released concentrations of BMP-2 and FGF-2 were not affected by collagen patterns in the polycaprolactone/nano-hydroxyapatite scaffold. Furthermore, endogenous bone regeneration and angiogenesis in the polycaprolactone/nano-hydroxyapatite/collagen scaffold with a radial pattern were promoted compared with those in the polycaprolactone/nano-hydroxyapatite/collagen scaffolds with positive and edge patterns. Therefore, we demonstrated that a collagen design loaded with dual growth factors in the 3D-printed scaffold could affect endogenous bone regeneration and angiogenesis.},

To enhance the therapeutic efficiency of wound dressings, we extracted polydeoxyribonucleotides (PDRN) from Patiria pectinifera , and characterized using absorbance-based analysis, chemical composition analysis, and electrophoresis. We evaluated their cytotoxicity and wound healing activity on human dermal fibroblast (HDF) and human keratinocytes (HaCaT). Next, we used electrospinning to fabricate polycaprolactone (PCL)/gelatin (Gel)/PDRN nanofibers for wound dressing application. The average fiber diameters of PCL (P), PCL/Gel (PG), and PCL/Gel/PDRN (PGP) nanofibers were 582.88 ± 202.65, 435.65 ± 149.87, and 334.63 ± 98.09 nm, respectively. The biocompatibility of the nanofibers was assessed using MTT assay and FDA/PI staining on HDF and HaCaT, no cytotoxicity was observed. In vivo experiments with full-thickness skin defect mouse models confirmed that the PGP nanofiber accelerated the initial wound healing process, as shown by wound closure analysis and histological analysis. Our results suggest that the PGP nanofiber has potential as a biomaterial for wound dressing applications and skin tissue engineering.},

  abstract     = {Flexible wearable strain sensors based on hydrogels have become a research hotspot in recent years due to their advanced application in many fields. Currently, most hydrogel-based strain sensors exhibit poor mechanical properties and low sensitivity. In this work, a conductive hydrogel as a wearable strain sensor was developed based on dual crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) networks. The PVA was the main skeleton of the hydrogel and the water-soluble amino-polysiloxane (APSi) introduced into this hydrogel was the secondary network. The APSi and PVA were locked together by phytic acid (PA), which improved the microstructure and enhanced the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. This was mainly reflected in the higher tensile strength (1.27 MPa), elongation at break (425.5\%), electrical conductivity (0.975 S/m), linearity (R 2 = 0.999) and tensile strain sensitivity (gauge factor (GF) of 2.29). The tensile strength (0.166–1.270 MPa) and elongation (170.2–425.5\%) of the hydrogel can be regulated continuously by adjusting the amount of APSi. These silicone-enhanced PVA hydrogels have good biocompatibility and hence can be used as wearable strain sensors.},

It is quite an exciting and promising design, as the composite metamaterial not only inherits the advantages of the CFRP composite in mechanical performance but can also obtain on-demand microwave absorption properties rather than purely reflective as neat CFRP laminates. Here, several meta-CFRP samples have been prepared by a co-curing process. Near-perfect microwave absorption (i.e., S 11 ≤ -10 dB) has been achieved in a series of situations such as under normal incidence and a constant polarization angle, under oblique incidence and an arbitrary polarization angle, and for a relative broadband microwave absorption (11.28 GHz ∼ 12.52 GHz). Moreover, the mechanical properties of the fabricated meta-CFRP samples, including tension, compression, bending, and shear, have also been investigated, which showed an increase of more than 680\% compared with previous microwave absorbers. The present work provides a new idea for designing electromagnetic and mechanical dual functional materials, based on which many new materials, for example, strong materials with tunable microwave absorption, can be further developed in the future.},

  abstract     = {In the pursuit of designing fiber-reinforced composites with synergistic increased strength and toughness, a novel electric field-driven resin infiltration method is proposed. Specifically, during epoxy resin solidification, the void content of the composites is effectively reduced by 77.1\%, from 2.14\% to 0.49\%, and the tensile strength, interlaminar shear strength, and interlaminar fracture toughness of the composites increase from 539.9 MPa to 748.7 MPa (equivalent to 38.7\%), from 40.9 MPa to 57.3 MPa (equivalent to 40.1\%) and from 2.1 kJ/m 2 to 3.0 kJ/m 2 (equivalent to 42.9\%) under the applied electric field, respectively. The improvement of the mechanical properties is primarily ascribed to the fact that the electric field-induced Maxwell force drives the liquid resin to flow into intra-tows and inter-tows, thereby improving the wettability of the resin to the fiber tows and correspondingly reducing the void content of the composite, which is supported by the finite element simulation of the rheological behavior of the resin. Interestingly, the application of an electric field can reduce the curing temperature of the composites by nearly 10 °C compared to the baseline composites, while maintaining the same mechanical properties. Therefore, it is an economical, and promising approach to fabricating composites with excellent mechanical properties.},

In this work a water jet and a high strain rate nanoindenter are used to understand the effect of the strain rate (from 10 -3 to 10 8 s −1 ) on the behaviour of 8YSZ at a small scale. It is observed how, at extremely high strain rates (10 6 –10 8 s −1 ), the material suffers from a brittle-dominated failure which induces localized phase transformation. At lower strain rates (10 -3 −1 s −1 ), plasticity dominates, and phase transformation is not observed.},

There is thus little knowledge on the ability of these elements to avoid hot cracking. In the present work, a new Al-Cu alloy with Ti, Cr and Fe additions is put forward and the mechanisms impeding hot cracking formation are analyzed. (Al, Cr) 3 Ti_L1 2 precipitates are formed during the solidification process, promoting heterogenous nucleation and grain refinement. Cr not only contributes to solid solution strengthening but also supports the stabilization of the Al 3 Ti metastable cubic phase. The addition of near-eutectic Fe decreases the solidification range, further reducing the susceptibility for hot cracking. Nano-hardness mapping reveals the solidification path of the alloy, with higher values associated with the highly dense areas of precipitates forming at the melt pool boundaries. A novel printable alloy with hardness values exceeding those of existing Al alloys for LPBF was designed.},

We evaluate the validity of theory with experiments conducted on helical pipe specimens. The experimental results well agree with the theorical predictions. Also, it was found that a significant amount of compressive residual stress was achieved by the acoustic cavitation on the inner surface.

A dataset comprising 40,000 nanoindentation tests and 40,000 BSE micrographs was built by express nanoindentation test and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). A Residual Convolutional Neural Network (Res-Net) model, which differs from a typical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture by a shortcut connection, was employed and compared with a simple table model. The models were trained, tuned, and tested over a training, validation and testing set comprising 70\%, 15\% and 15\% of the 40,000 data pairs, respectively. The following conclusions were drawn: 1) Express nanoindentation tests can provide reliable information for cement paste. Deconvolution based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) can obtain almost invariant statistics for each phase; 2) Based on averaged greyscale values of each BSE image, a table model can predict the elastic modulus and hardness with R 2 of 0.80 and 0.83, respectively; 3) Based on the intensity of each pixel as well as their patterns in each BSE image, the Res-Net model can predict the elastic modulus and hardness with a R 2 of 0.85 and 0.88, respectively. Deconvolution of the Res-Net prediction obtains similar invariant statistics as derived by the nanoindentation tests, which gives strong evidence of the applicability of the Res-Net model.},

However, achieving simultaneous and dynamic manipulations of reflected and transmitted waves in a low-crosstalk and high-efficiency manner via a single metasurface still remains huge challenges in fact, especially for acoustic waves that lack of available vector degrees of freedom. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an acoustic full-space digital metasurface consisting of arrays of dual-channel elements with variable coding states, and the reflected and transmitted sound waves can be controlled independently and dynamically. Benefitting from the dual-frequency design and the mode suppression effect, the presented element not only attains high efficiency (up to 80\% in transmission mode, and nearly 100\% in reflection mode), but also enables decoupled modulations of the reflection and transmission coefficients. To illustrate the presented acoustic metasurface, tunable beam deflection and alterable wave focusing are experimentally validated without inter-modal crosstalk on both sides of the platform, respectively. This work opens an avenue to control sound waves in multiple dimensions, which may further promote the development of miniaturized acoustic devices with high integration and versatility.},

  abstract     = {A method to calculate element concentrations in Al alloy castings, based on the serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) measurement at nano-scale, was proposed. For the high vacuum die casting (HVDC) Al-10Si-0.4MgMn-0.6Cu alloy, it reveals that the solute fractions of the Si, Mg and Cu in the Al matrix reaches about 0.39 wt\%, 0.15 wt\%, and 0.10 wt\%, respectively, under the as-cast condition. After it was heat treated via T5 process, larger nano-scale precipitation phases with low density and non-uniform distribution were formed in the α-Al matrix. After T6-treated, the narrow neck regions of the seaweed-like α-Fe phase particles were fragmented as well, but could not dissolve into the α-Al matrix. The element concentrations of the Si, Mg and Cu in the α-Al matrix increases to 0.75 wt\%, 0.23 wt\%, and 0.43 wt\%, respectively. Hence, finer nano-scale precipitation phases with high density and uniform distribution are formed in the Al matrix. Consequently, the ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and elongation of the T6-treated alloy simultaneously increase of about 15\%, 52\% and 63\%, respectively. It presents that the solute solution during high pressure die casting solidification has decisive effect on the mechanical properties before and after heat treatment.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the effects of Ni content on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Al-5.0Cu-1Mn-based alloys were investigated. The results demonstrate that Ni alloying refines the grain size and enhances castability. At low Ni content, some of Ni atoms participate in forming Al 7 Cu 4 Ni at the grain boundaries. The rest Ni segregates to the interface between α-Al and AlCu 3 Mn 2 phase, which inhibits AlCu 3 Mn 2 growth. The amount of Ni-rich phase at grain boundaries increases significantly as Ni concentration increases at the expense of the decline precipitates. After T6 treatment, the lamellar Ni-rich phase spheroidized into discrete particles that were uniformly distributed along the grain boundaries. Ni-rich phase of particles can effectively pin grain boundaries and prevent grain rotation. The optimum mechanical property is achieved with 1\% Ni addition, predominantly due to the synergistic strengthening of eutectic strengthening and precipitation strengthening. The ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and elongation reach 505 MPa, 348 MPa and 16.5\% respectively, which far exceed the current commercial cast aluminium alloys. With increasing Ni concentration, the fracture mode of the alloy changes from ductile fracture to brittle-ductile mixed fracture, because the high amount of Ni-rich phase intermetallic compounds increase the sites for localized brittle fractures.},

However, the brittle α 2 phase is stable, and phase transformation is difficult to be introduced at a lower temperature. This seriously affects the mechanical properties of Ti 2 AlNb alloy. Here, we propose a new method to promote phase transformation in Ti 2 AlNb alloy by deformation-induced defects through laser shock peening (LSP). The results show that after LSP, high-density defects were observed in the α 2 phase, such as dislocations and stacking faults (SFs). After heat treatment at 600 ℃, the phase transformation from α 2 phase to O phase was observed in the Ti 2 AlNb alloy treated by LSP, forming twinned and chessboard-like morphologies with nanoscale grain size. High-density defects induced by LSP reduced the thermodynamic barrier of phase transformation from α 2 phase to O phase. LSP promoted the lattice distortion and Nb element diffusion in Ti 2 AlNb alloy at high temperatures. This work provides a new method to promote phase transformation in Ti 2 AlNb alloy, which may be used to improve other materials&#39; mechanical properties.},

Plates of W, W-0.3 at.\% Cr, W-5 at.\% Re, W-2.5 at.\% Mo and W-5 at.\% Ta alloys were irradiated at 1073 K with 6.4 MeV Fe ions to 0.26 dpa at the damage peak, where the binding energy of alloying element with W-SIA is in order of Cr &gt; Re &gt; Mo &gt; Ta. The formation of vacancy-type defects (vacancies and vacancy clusters) was studied by using positron lifetime measurement. The precipitation of alloying elements was studied by using atom probe tomography (APT) and the hardness changes in the irradiated volumes were measured by the nanoindentation technique. The formation of vacancy-type defects was strongly suppressed by the addition of Cr and Re, while Ta and Mo had no noticeable suppression effect. The APT measurements showed fine Cr- and Re-rich precipitates in W-0.3 at.\% Cr and W-5 at.\% Re alloys, respectively, where the density of precipitates in the latter was clearly lower than that in the former. The distributions of Mo and Ta were uniform even after irradiation. Irradiation hardening was observed for all materials but that of W-5 at.\% Re alloy was significantly smaller than the hardening of W, W-2.5 at.\% Mo and W-5 at.\% Ta alloys. These observations suggest that the irradiation hardening of W, W-2.5 at.\% Mo, and W-5 at.\% Ta alloys were mainly caused by vacancy-type defects.

The self-organized microstructure and corrosion behavior of immiscible coatings with different laser energy densities were investigated. When the different laser energy densities are adopted, many carbides (M 23 C 6 and M 12 C) are dispersed in the lower α-Fe layer and large amounts of α-Fe particles containing carbides are embedded in the upper ε-Cu layer due to liquid phase separation. With increasing laser energy density (LED), the α-Fe dendrites are coarser and the area of carbides decrease. The interface of coating and substrate experiences a transition from “poor bonding (gaps) to “good bonding” and “crack debonding”. Moreover, the corrosion characteristics of immiscible coatings also experience a transformation from “crevice corrosion” to “enhanced protection of passive films” and “reduced protection of passive films”. As a result, the corrosion resistance increases first then decreases and the immiscible coating deposited by the LED of 31.25 J/mm 2 exhibits the highest corrosion resistance.},

The compression of single crystal micro-pillars was performed at various strain rates in carefully selected grains, the crystallographic orientation of which facilitates deformation either via basal 0001 〈 11 2 ¯ 0 〉 0001〈112¯0〉 or prismatic 10 1 ¯ 0 〈 11 2 ¯ 0 〉 101¯0〈112¯0〉 slip.

Spacer fabrics-based composite dressings have been widely concerned because of their good hemostasis and protection in wound healing, but the poor liquid absorption and compression recovery properties hinder their utilization. Herein, we report a soluble hemostatic spacer dressing based on a braided yarn of PTFE (core yarn)/carboxymethylated viscose (shell yarn) as the skin contact layer, a wrapped yarn of nylon monofilament (core yarn)/Coolmax (shell yarn) as the spacer layer, and UHMWPE yarn as the waterproof layer for wound healing. Among these, carboxymethylated viscose can stop bleeding, while PTFE has low adhesion and ensures the structural integrity of the spacer fabric. Moreover, the nylon monofilament can endow the dressing with excellent comfortability, resilience, and fatigue resistance. Coolmax can absorb blood. The as-prepared spacer dressing shows excellent mechanical, comfortable, and hemostasis properties. F2 had a hemostasis time of 5.15 min, a low coagulation index of 7.96\%, a hemolysis rate of 0.98\%, and a blood absorption rate of 159.09\%.

  abstract     = {Elastic stiffness is one of the most fundamental properties of materials. Design of the microstructures with isotropic stiffness has been an attractive area in the field of metamaterials for over three decades. Despite many classes of isotropic microstructures, exploring novel isotropic microstructures based on innovative mechanics principles has attracted great and continuing interests. This paper presents a novel family of isotropic hierarchical microstructures (Iso-HMs). These hierarchical microstructures are modeled by replacing the solid parts of prescribed single-level microstructures with arrayed microstructures in the second level, where the key task is to identify the correct geometries of the second-level microstructures by conducting parameter space exploring. These Iso-HMs realize isotropic stiffness based on synergistic deformations of the members in the two levels, which is essentially different from existing isotropic microstructures replying on deformations of the members in a single level. Two categories of Iso-HMs with rectangular holes and Vidergauze-type struts are designed. Considering the large size difference in the designed Iso-HMs, additive manufacturing becomes a unique technique for manufacturing the designed Iso-HMs, where the size ratio between the 3D-printed specimens and the minimal features reaches 400:1. Both numerical and experimental results validate the isotropic stiffness of the designed Iso-HMs. Furthermore, the results of a microstructural instability analysis show that the designed Iso-HMs can gain improved buckling strength up to a hundred times higher than their single-level counterparts. The hierarchical design provides a new way to identify novel functional microstructures for applications, and the hierarchical configurations expand the space of the already-known families of isotropic microstructures.},

There is currently the need, therefore, to create systematic ways to design specimens for process and material qualification. This manuscript provides an approach to evaluate the effects on the as-built quality based on specific metrics for specimens produced by L-PBF. Surface quality, as well as micro- and sub-microstructures and defects are related to specific aspects of the L-PBF process. To accomplish this goal, a digital engineering approach was first developed to design geometries based on process simulations to account for mechanical and thermal process effects. A parametric AM fabrication plan was then chosen to produce statistically significant populations of AM parts. Moreover, on axis, melt-pool scale, in-situ monitoring data, collected during the AM process, was examined in conjunction with the formation of flaws. X-ray micro-computer tomography analysis was additionally used to characterize porosity levels. Finally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD), as well as surface profilometry were combined to correlate specific process parameters and conditions with microstructural and surface effects.},

  abstract     = {While the fabrication of graded materials by directed energy deposition (DED) has led to accelerated materials discovery, the ability to rapidly explore sufficiently large material composition spaces is limited due to the time-intensive nature of conventional materials characterization techniques. The present study investigates the viability of small punch test (SPT) protocols for rapidly evaluating DED-fabricated alloy mixtures of stainless steel 316L (316L) and Inconel 625 (IN625). The SPT protocols evaluated in this study include both the recently established two-step Bayesian estimation framework as well as the empirical relationships established in prior literature. It is shown that these protocols are capable of reliably and quantitatively tracking the changes in the mechanical properties of the alloy mixtures studied. Enhancement of mechanical properties was observed with the addition of IN625 to 316L, which is attributed to the austenite stabilization in the matrix and the formation of fine δ - Ni 3 Nb precipitates. It is shown that CALPHAD-based Scheil model simulations predicted the formation of different precipitate phases for each composition.

  abstract     = {Although there have been extensive studies on CoCrFeNi high entropy alloys (HEAs), they are still far from industrial applications due to their inferior strength. Based on the approach of interstitial atom strengthening which has been shown to be one of the effective ways to modify the properties of metallic materials, a series of (CoCrFeNi) 100-x N x (x = 0, 0.25 and 0.50 at.\%) HEAs were prepared in this study by selective laser melting (SLM). It was found that nitrogen addition in CoCrFeNi HEA can slightly refine the microstructure but did not change the preferred orientations after SLM. By increasing the nitrogen content in the matrix, the strength increases while the ductility is reduced. Also, the addition of nitrogen in CoCrFeNi HEA can decrease the stacking fault probability, leading to the increased stacking fault energy (SFE) in N-doped CoCrFeNi HEA. The increased strength in N-doped CoCrFeNi HEA samples mainly attributes to the solid solution strengthening of nitrogen, whereas the ductility loss results from the impediment on the formation of deformed twins induced by increased SFE. These results can provide a new strategy for designing high-strength N-doped HEAs.},

In this work, three-point bending performances of IFAFS under flatwise and edgewise bending conditions were investigated by experiment, in-situ micro X-ray tomography and digital volume correlation (DVC) calculation. The results showed that three-point bending performance was more stable under edgewise bending condition, and with the decrease of span length IFAFS presented three different failure modes of oblique core shear, asymmetric and symmetrical surface fracture. In addition, porosity mutation was a significant reason for crack initiation, and optimizing pore homogeneity was important to improve the performance and predictability of failure location. Different strengthening effect of sandwich structure anisotropy and different internal deformation evolutions caused by internal strain vortex were two main reasons which lead to performance difference of IFAFS with different solid panel directions. Connection of pre-existing micropores with dimple-like micropores generated during deformation process leads to the failure of IFAFS. The key factors to further optimize three-point bending performance and predictability of IFAFS was to homogenize the pore distribution of IFAFS.},

However, it is still challenging to design carbon fiber multifunctional composite due to lack of proper manufacturing methods. In this study, an integrated multifunctional design and fabrication approach is developed by combining a drop-on-demand additive manufacturing method with a multiphysics numerical model to guide the development of the new multifunctional composite. Through deposition with in-situ consolidation, the function and thickness of each carbon fiber layer as well as its fiber volume fraction are accurately controlled. Decreasing layer thickness improves flexural properties. The discharge capacity and energy density are initially improved by 47\% and 39\%, respectively, but then significantly reduced due to limited lithium transport within closely packed carbon fibers at higher volume fraction. An optimal fiber volume fraction of 35 vol\% exists for carbon fiber structural battery composite. A good agreement is found between prediction results and experimental measurements. Further investigations of lithium-ion concentration and stress distribution by the validated multiphysics model find that electrolyte conductivity more significantly affects discharge process than discharge rate. The multifunctional design and fabrication approach provides insights for future development of high-performance carbon fiber structural battery composite.},

In this study, we synthesized PTX-loaded calcium carbonate-coated degradable disulfide-doped MSNs to construct a pH/redox dual-responsive controlled-release nanosystem. A high PTX loading rate of 9.68 ± 0.21\% was measured with significantly accelerated release at low pH and in the presence of GSH. Moreover, surface decoration of the cell membrane was conducted to realize homologous targeted killing of tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells (PTX/ssMSN@CaCO 3 @TC), as confirmed by dynamic light scattering and gel electrophoresis analyses. Our nanocomposite material could be effectively taken up by Tca8113 cells but not by L929 and HeLa cells. Moreover, excellent tumor killing performance was measured both in vitro and in vivo . A total of 94.00 ± 1.66\% and 98.12 ± 0.28\% of Tca8113 cells were killed after culturing for 1 day and 3 days, respectively.

In recent years, 3D bioprinting technologies have been widely used in fabricating various 3D grafts for tissue repair and regeneration due to their shape customizability, simple manufacturing procedure, reproducibility, and precise multi-dimensional control. With the rapid development of 3D bioprinting technologies, bioprinting-based biofabrication strategies have been gradually applied in the construction of various vascularized tissues. Based on this background, our study aimed to review recent advances, challenges, and future perspectives in biofabrication strategies based on bioprinting for vascularized tissue repair and regeneration.

However, the elasticity of components, backlash, variability of nozzle and cartridge shapes, etc. can lead to unpredictable printing results, which is further complicated by the wide range of rheologically diverse materials and complex sample designs. To address this issue, we present an algorithmic approach to compensate for the discrepancies between piston motion and material extrusion in syringe-based extrusion systems. This approach relies on cyclical, iterative optimization through rapid piston movements, which are adjusted based on extrusion analysis. In this work we establish a general theoretical framework for extrusion and link the rheological properties of prepared hydrogels with shear rates in a typical bioprinting process. The determined properties are compared with the success of the developed algorithm to modify machine instructions for precise material deposition of short, interrupted lines, as well as multi-layered scaffold structures. Overall, our approach provides a means of improving the accuracy and precision of complex extrusion-based bioprinting systems, without prior knowledge of set-up or material properties, making it highly versatile and suitable for a wide range of applications, particularly when the combined set-up and material properties are too complex for solely predictive approaches.},

  abstract     = {Ionic polymer actuators have attracted attention in recent years due to their remarkably large strain under low-voltage stimulation. However, a key challenge for fabricating high-performance ionic polymer actuators is to develop a firm electrode with high electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance. Herein, inspired by the structure of zoysia grass, we proposed an efficient method to prepare the triple-layered multifunctional electrodes capable of low surface resistance (∼3.4 Ω/□), high adhesion (∼328 KPa) and good electrochemical performance for ionic polymer actuators. Through the spraying and impregnation-electroplating (IEP), three functional layers of multifunctional electrodes are obtained, including MWCNTs/Nafion interfacial layer, Ag NWs fixed layer and Ag NWs@Au layer, which respectively contribute to the charge storage in the electrode, high strength and the uniform and fast charge distribution. The synergic effect of these three functional layers maintains a high stability of multifunctional electrodes after being immersed in DI water for 7 days or 1500 bending cycles, and greatly enhances the actuation performance of ionic polymer actuators, resulting in an extreme bending deformation (increasing by 460\%). This work represents an important step towards ionic polymer actuators where the synergic effect in electrodes plays an important role in promoting electrochemical actuation performance.},

The Pt-Al bond coat was found to be almost negligible under low stresses at 760℃; however, the bond coat effect was detrimental at 900℃ or under high stresses at 760℃. At 760 °C with increasing high-amplitude stress, the tip cracks preferentially nucleated from defects within coat and propagated inwards, accelerating the fracture. The fatigue life of the coated alloys was considerably decreased at 900 °C, which was attributed to the damage accumulated in the bond coating via oxidation, crack-induced oxide cracking and interfacial microstructure degradation. An Elevated temperature led to the crack-induced oxides shifting from a small fan-shape to a large umbrella-shape, increasing the density of slip bands and quantity of secondary cracks in the substrate. Furthermore, more Ru diffused outwards at 900℃ than that at 760℃, which caused the disappearance of L-C dislocation locks and tertiary γ′ phases and aggravated TCP phases precipitation in the substrate at 900℃. Ultimately, to assess the degradation of the HCF life, an empirical life prediction method was developed, and the calculations results well matched the test results.},

To this purpose, pure Al and A356 Al alloy, with 40\%mass Sn, were produced by granulating process. They were composed by an Al (and other phases) matrix and a low melting Sn-rich phase that can store/release latent heat by its melting/solidification. Pure Al and A356 were produced as reference materials. Finite Element Analyses was used to estimate the cooling rate experienced by the alloys during granulation. Microstructural features of the produced materials were discussed as for C-PCM. Granules thermal characterization was performed with Differential Scanning Calorimetry and dilatometry tests. Results show that Sn addition delays the solidification and increase microstructural refinement. Phase transition of the Sn-rich phase occurs at about 230 °C in Al-Sn alloy and in the 200–230 °C range for A356-Sn alloy, as also assessed by CALPHAD modelling. The stability of the thermal response for all the systems, as well as the form stability, is achieved after the first cycle. Moreover, A356-Sn exhibits suitable microstructure for limiting the exudation of the Sn-rich phase, making this alloy very attractive for C-PCMs.},

The surrogate model is obtained by supervised machine learning, relying on feed-forward neural networks trained with data obtained from random loading of titanium specimens in uniaxial stress. Uniaxial tests are conducted in strain control, applying random histories of axial strain in the range [−0.04, 0.04], to prevent the occurrence of significant damage. The corresponding stress versus strain histories are subdivided into a finite number of increments, and machine learning is applied to predict the change in stress in each increment. A suitable architecture of the data-driven model, key to obtaining accurate predictions, is presented. The predictions of the surrogate model are validated by comparing to experiments not used in the training process, and compared to those of an established theoretical model. An excellent agreement is obtained between the measurements and the predictions of the data-driven surrogate model.},

  abstract     = {Refractory wounds are frequent and protracted diabetes or postoperative complications that greatly affect the quality of life and mental health of patients. As a result of repeated dressing replacements and local debridement of the existing therapeutic therapies, freshly formed granulation is once more infiltrated by inflammation and eliminated, which delays the healing process. Herein, the improved Fryetes&#39; method, which retained most of the active factors in the extracellular matrix, was developed to prepare injectable decellularized extracellular matrix hydrogels (dECMH) from human umbilical cord tissue. The physical, biochemical, in vivo and in vitro biological properties were analysed in detail. The results showed that the pre-gel exhibited good injectability and could form the hydrogel within 30 min. Biochemical analysis indicated that the prepared decellularized extracellular matrix retained abundant structural proteins and wound healing-related growth factors. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the excellent biocompatibility of dECMH and the extremely high migration and proliferation capacities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in the hydrogels. Thus, the injectability, gel-forming ability, and excellent biological characteristics of the hydrogel are highly compatible with refractory wounds with various irregular shapes, showing great potential for clinical application in wound repair.},

The dynamic response and protective effectiveness of the designed structure under air blast loading were studied through experimental and numerical simulations, and their relationships with wave propagation process, structural deformation mode, protection effectiveness, and energy absorption were analyzed. The impact of fluid filling configuration and blast distance on the structure was also investigated. The results showed that the designed multicell structure had five typical deformation modes, and that changes in fluid filling configuration affected the stiffness distribution and local constraints of the concave multicell structure, altering wave propagation process, deformation, and energy absorption. It was also found that an increase in fluid filling caused a fluctuating decline in protective effectiveness, with the front plate and front core being the main energy absorbing parts. An alternative arrangement of fluid-filled and unfilled cells, which created a compound load propagation path combining solid, liquid, and gas media in various directions, effectively reduced the loading intensity, induced the structure to undergo horizontal compatible deformation and horizontal compatible-bulging deformation, and improved its protection effectiveness.},

Transmission electron microscopy and selected area diffraction pattern analysis were used to analyse the intragranular substructure of the martensitic phase. Further, the effect of Si on the redistribution of C is investigated by atom probe tomography in combination with transmission Kikuchi diffraction measurements in order to obtain the local C distribution and correlate it with the crystallography. It was found that the Si addition forms a sigmoidal distribution at the phase boundary and functions as a barrier for C segregation, hence reduces C partitioning into the austenite, while a Si free alloy shows clear C partitioning. Further it was observed that stable C cluster formation occurs along fine twin boundaries in the martensite, inhibiting carbide formation and partitioning of the C into the austenite.},

In the present study, copper (Cu) coated n-Al composite particles were introduced into aluminized explosives, and Cu coated n-Al composite particles and ball-milled octogen (HMX) energetic microspheres were prepared via droplet microfluidic technology using binder. The morphology, crystal form, thermal properties, combustion, and mechanical sensitivity of the microspheres were studied using a variety of techniques. The prepared microspheres had regular spherical morphology and uniform particle size, with an even distribution of particles. Using microfluidic technology will not destroy the crystal form of each particle. The introduction of Cu promoted the thermal decomposition of HMX. The mechanical sensitivity of the prepared Cu/Al microspheres was lower than that of the microspheres only containing n-Al. The Cu/Al microsphere samples exhibited excellent and stable combustion performance, and that the addition of Cu increased the combustion speed compared to the microspheres only containing n-Al.

Therefore, the deformation mechanism of heterogeneous fibers and intergranular deformation compatibility mechanism are investigated for as-extruded Al–Cu–Li alloys with and fibers in this work. The results show that more slip systems are activated in the fiber, forming LAGBs through dislocations cross-slip and entanglement, thereby stimulating the CDRX. The number of slip systems that be activated in the fiber is relatively smaller, and the dislocations are dominated by single-slip and are easily pinned by the coarsening precipitate, thus activating the DDRX mechanism to force the grains to transform into the fiber. To coordinate the fiber deformation, the DDRX driven by dislocations from precipitate pinning is activated to relieve stress concentration. This study can provide theoretical guidance for rationally formulating the multi-stage thermomechanical processing regime of Al–Cu–Li alloys.},

The particle size of the prepared nano-SiO 2 modified microcapsules was ∼ 78–96 μm, and the average size was 88.16 μm. The average core content was 85.39\%, which exceeds the upper limit of 80\% of existing microcapsules. The nano-hardness and Young’s modulus were 0.33 and 2.63 GPa, respectively, improved by at least 1.4 times compared to existing microcapsules. The mass loss of microcapsules was 0.95\% at 182.73 °C, which is at least 2.9 times higher than the thermal stability of existing microcapsules.

In this work, a machine learning (ML) model for predicting the ZT value of M element doped-BiCuSeO (Bi 1- x M x CuSeO) has been established via the correlation analysis for descriptors and the comparison among different ML approaches. The results show that Gradient Boosting Regressor is the most appropriate approach for our ML model, which is well validated by comparing the predicted and experimental ZT values for the cases in the dataset. The ML model is also used to predict the ZT values of Bi 1- x M x CuSeO with unexplored and rarely explored doping element M , and the optimal doping elements as well as their doping contents are screened out. The results indicate that the ZT of Bi 0.86 Po 0.14 CuSeO (Po-doped) and Bi 0.88 Cs 0.12 CuSeO (Cs-doped) are higher than that of pure BiCuSeO, and are improved by 104\% and 98\% at the 923 K, respectively.

Hence, a new mixer-integrated printhead was developed, inspired by stirring-rod-assisted mixing processes. The as-designed mixing system was validated through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using input parameters including ink viscosity, density, and velocity vector and output parameters including material volume fraction, average fluid pressure, and shear force. Six-stir element mixer units were used to comprehensively analyze material mixing while considering the fluid volume fraction after flowing through the mixers. Printheads integrated with multiple discrete mixers with consistent spiral directions, performing well when introducing gaps, were used to reduce the cell pressure and shear force. The optimal mixer design, with two 1.62-mm gaps and six-stir element mixer units sharing the same spiral structure, reduced the average fluid pressure and shear force by 3.196e+4 Pa and 0.368e+2 Pa, respectively, compared with a commercial static mixer. Finally, a mixer-integrated printhead was manufactured, matching well with the original design.

Film-substrate bonding is usually weakened by harnessing natural van der Waals layers (e.g., graphene) on substrate surfaces, but this is difficult to achieve in non-layered materials. Here, we demonstrate van der Waals epitaxy of stress-free films of a non-layered material VO 2 on mica. The films exhibit out-of-plane 010 texture with three in-plane orientations inherited from the crystallographic domains of the substrate. The lattice parameters are invariant with film thickness, indicating weak film-substrate bonding and complete interfacial stress relaxation. The out-of-plane domain size scales monotonically with film thickness, but the in-plane domain size exhibits a minimum, indicating that the nucleation of large in-plane domains supports subsequent island growth. Complementary ab initio investigations suggest that VO 2 nucleation and van der Waals epitaxy involves subtle polarization effects around, and the active participation of, surface potassium atoms on the mica surface. The VO 2 films show a narrow domain-size-sensitive electrical-conductivity-temperature hysteresis. These results offer promise for tuning the properties of stress-free van der Waals epitaxial films of non-layered materials such as VO 2 through microstructure control.},

Therefore, we first analyzed the expected properties of peptide-based hydrogels in bone repair and methods to obtain these properties. Then, we focused on the applications in bone repair, especially the repair scheme based on peptide-based hydrogels for different types of bone defects. Peptide-based hydrogels can be used alone to fill bone defects, playing a role in bone conduction. The peptide-based hydrogels can also be used as a sustained-release carrier for cells, drugs, and the like, to improve the microenvironment of local bone regeneration and enhance the bone regeneration capacity.

  abstract     = {It is still of great challenge for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) treatment since ATC is an extremely destructive and lethal thyroid malignancy. Herein, a kind of multifunctional nanoplatform (denoted as PDA-dsCpG-DOX NP) has been prepared and applied for tri-modal ATC therapy including photothermal therapy (PTT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Polydopamine nanoparticle (PDA NP) serves as a photothermal agent to generate PTT, as well as a carrier of doxorubicin (DOX) and immunotherapeutic DNA (i.e., oligonucleotide comprising unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide (CpG ODN)). The high temperature induced by PTT results in the release of CpG ODNs for immunotherapy and the liberation of DOX for chemotherapy. PDA-dsCpG-DOX NPs exhibit a phenomenal collaborative therapy effect contrasted with a corresponding single therapy or dual-modal treatment. By use of mice bearing C643 thyroid tumors as a model, PDA-dsCpG-DOX NPs have been demonstrated to realize nearly complete tumor growth suppression with good biocompatibility . Hence, PDA-dsCpG-DOX NPs introduce a synergistic scheme for ATC treatment and foreground the congregate effects of tri-modal therapy.},

  abstract     = {Photothermal therapy (PTT) has been widely investigated as a regimen for superficial tumors. However, conventional PTT strategies usually require photothermal temperatures above 50 °C to achieve significant therapeutic efficacy, which in effect would lead to injury to adjacent normal tissues and meanwhile, the heat generated by the photothermal effect would induce inflammation owing to the damage to cytoplasmic components. In order to reduce the toxicity of photothermal therapy and increase the efficiency of photothermal tumor destruction, novel strategies are prerequisite for targeted regimen and surveillance of photothermal therapy in real time. In this paper, we reported a concave mesoporous polydopamine-targeting nanotherapeutic agent. We employed B-MPDA as the carrier and encapsulated CQ and ASP to yield B-MPDA/CQ/ASP which was loaded with autophagy inhibitors and anti-inflammatory agents and coated uniformly with MnO 2 Nanosheet. With HA functionalizing MnO 2 Nanosheet, B-MPDA/CQ/ASP@MnO 2 -HA was constituted. The yielded nanoparticles were identified to be advantageous for good biocompatibility, potent targeting and low toxicity. In anti-tumor regimens, the nanoparticles can be applied to hyaluronic acid targeting, mesoporous polydopamine thermotherapy, and autophagy inhibitor sensitization thermotherapy, and simultaneously eliminate the inflammatory effects induced by photothermal therapy. Furthermore, in combination with the anti-inflammatory effect of targeting tumor, this agent can effectively induce apoptosis of cancer cells and significantly improve the efficiency of mild photothermal killing of cancer cells, which provides insight into the development of nanoparticles and application to mild photothermal therapy in the clinical scenario.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional superhydrophobic materials are characterized by a low surface energy and extremely low strength, and hence require reinforcement for viable applications. An experimental study is presented of the processing and mechanical properties of a graphene-reinforced superhydrophobic siloxane, synthesized by a sol–gel approach integrating alkali activation of metakaolin, hydrolysis of alkoxysilane, dispersion of graphene into the precursor, and co-condensation. To promote uniform dispersion and distribution of graphene, three processing techniques were used: while ultrasonication was adopted to disperse graphene nanoplatelets, accelerated condensation at 50 and 75 °C and varying the precursor’s viscosity used to prevent graphene from floating and re-aggregation. Results of nanoindentation, porosimetry, and unconfined compression show that adding 0.9 wt\% graphene increases the strength of the superhydrophobic composites from ∼ 0 to 34 MPa. Slow condensation and curing at 25 °C allow graphene to re-aggregate and float upward in the sol, leading to its heterogeneous distribution. Despite its function in improving microscale dispersion, ultrasonication detrimentally decreases the composite’s strength due to acoustic cavitation. Similarly, curing at elevated temperatures accelerates co-condensation and results in a more uniform distribution of graphene, but induces thermal cavitation and bubble formation, because the threshold for acoustic and thermal cavitations is significantly reduced by superhydrophobicity.},

One of the most promising metamaterial families are auxetics, but these structures often exhibit anisotropy which limits their use. In this study, novel polygon celled 3D star structures were investigated and engineered to counteract design deficiencies. A new lattice design ontology was developed and used to carry out low cost optimisation with curved links. The resulting cells opened new forms of symmetry which were shown to reduce the anisotropy of the lattices by between 75\% 75\% and 90\% 90\% . The cubic and rhombic dodecahedral cells performed promisingly with Poisson’s ratios of −0.449 and −0.401 and anisotropic range of 0.022 and 0.085 respectively. Link thickness was parameterised and used to aid cell scaling and balance stiffness and metamaterial behaviour while ensuring cell manufacturability. The experiments demonstrated that the geometrical simplicity was beneficial to the cell properties and the success probability of the manufacturing process. The new optimisation method described in this study has been demonstrated to be sufficiently low cost to be applied at the cell level. It will pave the way to practical strain based design of graded structures which are vital for the practical growth of metamaterials.},

Herein, we demonstrate several phenylboronic acid-modified chitosan derivatives to screen out a self-assembly nano-system. The phenylboronic acid unit synthesized in chitosan skeleton (CS) afforded donor–acceptor coordination with amidogen of pirarubicin (THP) and aPD-1 [1] , [2] , [3] ,the drug loading content was increased from 18.2 ± 0.4\% to 37.0 ± 1.0\% compared with CS. Besides, the phenylboronic acid modification provided an additional transmucosal advantage for cationic CS via non-covalent binding with mucosal glycosaminoglycans and enhanced the penetration ability of drugs through the endocytosis, Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum and exocytosis pathway. Furthermore, the encapsulated agents can be selectively released in response to the high reactive oxygen species concentration in tumor tissues, which combined with enhanced transmucosal capacity extremely contribute to improving the therapeutic efficacy and biosafety of BCS@THP and BCS@aPD-1 NPs in bladder cancer perfusion therapy as well as lung cancer inhalation treatment. Even more exciting is that in addition to THP and aPD-1, our platform could be easily extended to other chemotherapeutics and bio-macromolecular agents with electron-donating groups, rendering a simple and robust strategy for enabling highly efficient mucosal administration-based cancer therapy.},

In this study, multilayer Ni/Al thin films were linearly heated at 25, 50, 100, and 200 K/s to over 700°C, showing two distinct peaks in resistance change with activation energies of 55 ± ± 4 and 74 ± ± 7 kJ/mol, respectively. Through Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX) analysis on cross sections taken ex situ from samples quenched before and after the peaks of interest, we find strong evidence that peak 1 corresponds to Ni diffusing through Al grain boundaries forming intermetallic phases that essentially block the highly conductive Al pathway.

Identification of the arresting effect of foamed concrete materials on overrunning aircraft is crucial for optimizing EMAS. By coupling the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the Virtual Prototype Method (VPM), the EMAS crushing process and the aircraft dynamics are simulated simultaneously. The material properties of different foamed concrete were firstly determined via experiments, and then adopted as input for DEM of EMAS. Subsequently, the VPM of A320 aircraft with various overrun speeds was established. The rationality of the DEM-VPM model was verified by the field test result. The sensitivity analysis on the arresting processes reveals that a 67\% increase in EMAS thickness and a 102\% increase in material strength can enhance the arresting performance by 96\% and 11.5\%, respectively. However, freeze–thaw has negative effect. In addition, higher overrun speeds of the aircraft can cause greater acceleration and drag forces, and thereby magnify the risk of damage to the aircraft.},

The 2 and 3 wt\% Cu contributed to inhibiting the generation of the HCP phase, whereas the inhibitory effect was quite limited at 4 wt\% Cu. Notably, 4 wt\% Cu led to the formation of Cr-enrich precipitates in the matrix, which was partially coherent with the Cu nanoparticle. The corrosion resistance of the CCM alloy was enhanced as the 2 and 3 wt\% Cu added into the CCM alloy, contrarily, which deteriorated when Cu content reached 4 wt\%. For the CCM-2Cu and CCM-3Cu, Cr-precipitates played a major role in enhancing the wear resistance, while the Cu lubrication effect working in coordination with Cr-precipitates determined that for the CCM-4Cu.

Such an approach offers a high controllability in the thickness of the ZIF-8 layer without any requirement of surface modifications on porphyrinic MOFs. Impressively, the acidic pH-response degradation of ZIF-8 promoted the release of DOX in the acidic tumor microenvironment.

  abstract     = {Current implant systems still lack the ability to combat implant-associated infections (IAI) and insufficient osseointegration to reduce the risk of implant failure. There’s an urgent need to develop an effective implant modification method to match the needs of different biological stages post-implantation, which requires anti-infection at the initial stage and osseointegration at the latter long-term stage. Here, we constructed a mussel-inspired layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly implant modification platform via tannic acid (TA), sequentially anchoring osteoanabolic drug (Abaloparatide, ABL) and antibacterial (Dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate, DMAHDM) to the Titanium (Ti) surface (Ti/ABL/DMAHDM). The Ti/ABL/DMAHDM exhibited outstanding antibacterial properties at the initial stage with an antibacterial rate of 100\% both in vitro (24 h) and in vivo (48 h). Moreover, it showed significant osteogenic induction ability at the latter long-term stage both in vitro (7 days and 14 days) and in vivo (4 weeks), accompanied by good biocompatibility. This TA-mediated self-assembly modification implants platform with staged regulation of anti-infection and osteoinduction offers potential clinical prospects for improving osseointegration after implantation.},

In this work, cell and surface architecture of sustainable hybrid cryogels of cellulose nanofibers, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and Ti 3 C 2 T X MXene was controlled to adjust their GHz and THz dielectric permittivity and EMI shielding performance. Temperature gradient freeze-drying was used to obtain aligned honeycomb and lamellar pore structures with specific surface layer designs. The millimeter wave permittivity varied relative to thickness direction as the side of cryogels that was directly exposed to cold gradient had systematically a higher permittivity. This anisotropy was caused by a thin, smooth outermost surface layer covering the open core structure. The surface designs of all cryogels dominated signal permittivity, and the effects of higher MXene dosages could be offset by the surface layer. Cryogels with dense surface layer containing 70 and 50 wt\% of MXene displayed very high average attenuation levels of 52.1 and 37.2 dB, respectively. Overall, the results show that the structural design of porous hybrid material can be used to adjust their EMI shielding performance at GHz and THz frequencies.},

A sensitivity coefficient describing the link between wire size and device adjustment precision in mPA-DED is proposed. The link between the sensitivity coefficient and the maximum meltable wire feeding speed and the threshold value of the maximum stable deposition speed was quantitatively analyzed, and the model was verified by cross-comparison experiments among the design wire size, arc size, and wire-arc position deviation. A well-formed 40-layer curved metal sample with a material area utilization ratio of 90.54\% was steadily deposited by using the proposed model and the optimized deposition parameters.

Synergistic role of C and B is found on solidification and heat affected zone (HAZ) liquation cracking susceptibility. High amount of C and B promote formation of eutectic constituents during final stages of solidification and promote crack healing by backfilling effect. When C and B are added in low amount the crack healing does not occur due to the absence of eutectic consituents therefore cracking extent increases. Thermodynamics simulations indicate C and B tie up to MC carbides and M 3 B 2 borides during solidification. Scanning Electron Microscopy and Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis reveal C and B to be present both in solid solution and in form of precipitates to Ti-Mo rich carbides and Mo rich borides, respectively. In HAZ, these phases promote liquation cracking where cracking extent correlates to the amount carbides and borides. Lower C and B is found to reduce the liquation cracking in the HAZ. Furthermore, a high temperature homogenization heat treatment at 1190 °C excarbates the cracking by dissolving the borides and releasing B to the grain boundaries.},

Aiming at the sparsity of X-ray images of space high temperature materials, a solid–liquid interface enhancement algorithm for X-ray in situ observation of space materials is proposed to solve low contrast and blurry interface of X-ray images. Compared with the existing methods, the algorithm enhances the contrast and provides a new idea for solving the material interface dynamics from the perspective of image. The enhanced image can accurately calculate the moving speed of the solid–liquid interface of the materials, and the interface dynamics of material growth can be effectively studied by combining the temperature measured in the experiment.

This work presents a paradigm for the design and fabrication of soft actuators with stiffness tunability and intrinsic self-sensing feedback through 4D printing method. The integration of 4D printed conductive composite into soft actuator body allows for stiffness adjustment within three orders of magnitude and ensures real-time stiffness-sensing, bending-sensing and pressure-sensing feedback. By constructing the theoretical deformation models and decoupling the resistance signals by machine learning methods, information on the stiffness, deformation and pressure of the material at different temperatures can be obtained. Cardiac-mimicking actuator and active therapeutic insoles are fabricated as proof-of-concept demonstrations, among which the active therapeutic insoles can perceive plantar pressure changes and conduct pressure-releasing actuation to ease the pain of patient at walk.

However, the easily generated defects due to the Sn 2+ oxidation and poor morphology originated from rapid crystallization are both barriers for tin-based devices in the enhancement of photovoltaic performance. Here, phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl) is introduced for post-treating FASnI 3 films, which plays dual roles in adjusting film topography and passivating defects in bulk and interface of films. First, the film morphology can be improved by eliminating SnF 2 impurities. In addition, a small amount of two-dimension perovskite can be formed in the films, inducing preferred orientation in secondary crystallization, well-matched energy level, and effective defect passivation. Finally, the FASnI 3 -based devices with PEACl treatment obtained a champion conversion efficiency of 11.63\% with an average value of 10.76\%, along with the obvious enhanced open circuit voltage and fill factor. In contrast, the pristine FASnI 3 devices range from 6.92\% to 9.40\% with an average value of 7.96\%. This work not only deepens our understanding of the suppression of defects in tin-based perovskites but also paves a facile way to ameliorate film morphology and interfaces to fabricate promising tin perovskites and devices.},

In this study, a biomimetic approach was used to construct a bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) integrated calcium phosphate (CaP) coating on the surface of porous titanium scaffolds. In vitro characterizations showed that the scaffolds had mechanical properties comparable to those of the human cortical bone. The biomimetic coating has a nano-scaled surface structure, which releases BMP-2 in a stable and effective manner. Bicortical bone defects were prepared in the bilateral mandibles of beagle dogs, and the coated and uncoated scaffolds were fixed in the bone defects for 8 weeks. Based on micro-CT and histological analysis results, the biomimetic coating significantly promoted bone formation in the titanium scaffold. The coated scaffold group had significantly higher bone volume fraction, bone area fraction, and bone-to-implant contact results than the uncoated scaffold group. Besides, hematological indexes and histopathology results of the visceral organs confirmed the scaffold and coating&#39;s biocompatibility. Accordingly, the current study demonstrates that BMP-2 integrated biomimetic CaP coating can significantly promote bone formation in porous titanium scaffolds and benefit the healing process of the bicortical mandibular defect in beagle dogs.},

Since solidification cracking is a major impediment in AM of alloys, especially high entropy alloys (HEAs), a detailed study on the cracking issue during AM is imperative. Keeping this in mind, a customized laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) setup is utilized to fabricate a compositionally graded Al x CoCrFeNi ( x = 0.04–0.75) HEA, using the equiatomic AlCoCrFeNi and CoCrFeNi powders as feedstock, to examine the compositional range that enables crack-free fabrication. Experimental results show that when x ≤ 0.7, crack-free fabrication is possible. This compositional range exceeds the threshold reported in the recent literature. Microstructural characterization reveals a constant dual phase structure throughout the gradient, which is induced by the chemical segregation. Further analysis shows that both utilizing AlCoCrFeNi powder as Al source and the segregation contribute to the enhanced printability. The results suggest that the dual phase structure introduced by chemical segregation can effectively inhibit the initiation and propagation of hot tearing problem in metal additive manufacturing.},

To mitigate against the wettability and spreadability of such molten deposits on TBCs, dual-scale structured (Gd 0.9 Yb 0.1 ) 2 Zr 2 O 7 TBCs with “lotus leaf” like surface morphology were fabricated using novel PS-PVD technology, which revealed an enhanced resistance to the wetting of molten silicate but experienced some degradation at high temperatures. By the ultrafast laser direct writing technology, the surface of the PS-PVD TBC was re-constructed, obtaining a triple-scale structure, consisting of conical micro-pillars, cauliflower-like domed micro-protuberances and nanoparticles. The contact angle of molten deposits at 1200 °C on this TBC was measured to be ∼ 127.2°, and after exposure to 1300 °C for 10 h, the TBC is still silicophobic (i.e., contact angle of ∼ 124.7°). This superior silicate phobicity is largely attributed to the increased surface roughness of the triple-scale structure. Further, the reaction layer appears to resist effectively further melt penetration. We thus propose that PS-PVD technology together with ultrafast laser direct writing may have great potential for the fabrication of molten silicophobic TBCs for turbine engines.},

However, this materials couple is vulnerable to severe embrittlement due to the development of excessive intermetallic compounds (IMCs), namely Ti 2 Ni. Pd-free and Pd-interlayered NiTi-Ti6Al4V laser joints were evaluated for their microstructure, compositional changes, thermodynamic mechanism, and mechanical properties. The presence of Pd constrained the formation of Ti 2 Ni IMC, and NiTi-Ti6Al4V joints with excellent mechanical properties demonstrating superelastic behavior were achieved for the first time. The tensile strength and rupture strain of the Pd-added NiTi-Ti6Al4V joint improved more than twofold, reaching 520 MPa and 5.6\%, respectively. During cyclic tensile testing, the Pd-added joint demonstrated superelasticity and a comparable irrecoverable strain to NiTi (1 versus 0.65\%). Multiscale characterization revealed that the fraction of Ti 2 Ni decreased from 83 to 10\% near the NiTi boundary and 24 to 6\% at the weld center compared to the Pd-free joint. The superior thermodynamic formation tendency of Ti-Pd compounds over Ti 2 Ni IMC favored their development, and thus Ti-Pd and NiTi compounds dominated the fusion zone (FZ) at the expense of Ti 2 Ni IMC, explaining the improved mechanical performance of the Pd-added joint.},

  abstract     = {Studies of single crystal artificial superlattices (SLs) of transition-metal (TM) diborides, which is instrumental to understand hardening mechanisms at nanoscale, is lacking. Here, CrB x /TiB y (0001) diboride SLs [x,y ∈ 1.7–3.3] are grown epitaxially on Al 2 O 3 (0001) substrates by direct-current magnetron sputter epitaxy. Growth conditions for obtaining well-defined SLs with good interface quality are found at 4 mTorr Ar pressure and 600 °C. 1-µm-thick SL films deposited with modulation periods Λ between 1 and 10 nm, and Λ = 6 nm SLs with TiB y -to-Λ layer thickness ratios Γ ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 are studied. SLs with Λ = 6 nm and Γ in the range of 0.2–0.4, with a near stoichiometric B/TM ratio, exhibit the highest structural quality. The effects of Γ and stoichiometries (B/TM ratio) on the distribution of B in the SL structures are discussed. By increasing the relative thickness of TiB y , the crystalline quality of SLs starts to deteriorate due to B segregation in over-stoichiometric TiB y , resulting in narrow epitaxial SL columnar growth with structurally-distorted B-rich boundaries. Moreover, increasing the relative thickness of under-stoichiometric CrB x enhances the SL quality and hinders formation of B-rich boundaries. The SLs are found to exhibit hardness values in the range of 29–34 GPa.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the microstructure evolution and crack formation mechanism of the X30CrMoN15-1 high-nitrogen steel under warm deformation (700 ℃ and 800 ℃) have been investigated. The microstructure observation indicates that the warm deformation (both at 700 °C and 800 ℃) facilitates the ferrite transition and the carbonitrides precipitation, which leads to the reduction of retained austenite by 40\% in the specimen deformed 700 °C and 18\% for the specimen deformed 800 °C. In addition, cracks are likely to generate under the low strain rates of 0.005 s −1 . In the specimen deformed at 700 °C, the lamellar carbonitrides are precipitated along the interface between ferrite and M/A islands, while the spherical carbonitrides are precipitated inside the ferrite. The volume expansion generated by ferrite transformation and the growth of recrystallized grain are hindered by carbonitrides, resulting in the significant stress concentration and even crack initiation. For the specimen deformed at 800 ℃, the spherical carbonitrides are mostly precipitated from the recrystallized ferrite grain boundary. The significant dislocation aggregation around the austenite /ferrite interface and strength mismatch between ferrite and austenite together result in the interfacial debonding and even cracks propagation at phase boundary.},

Some high-entropy steels (HESs) show potentials as cryogenic materials, but their deformation behaviors and mechanical properties at 4.2 K have been rarely investigated. Moreover, the aging-induced embrittlement of HESs also severely restricts their applications. In this work, the Fe-Mn-Al-C HESs with different Al contents (0, 4, 10 or 15 at.\%) and grain sizes were fabricated, and their deformation behaviors and mechanical properties at 4.2 K were systematically studied. With increasing the Al content, (Fe,Mn) 23 C 6 carbides are effectively inhibited in 10\%Al HES after aging at 923 K for 10 days. Therefore, the premature fracture of 10\%Al HES is avoided, leading to the excellent combination of high strength (∼1.5 GPa) and high fracture toughness (255 MPa·m 1/2 ) at 4.2 K. The deformation mechanisms shift from the extensive twinning and deformation bands in 0Al HES to the lesser twinning, Taylor lattices and deformation bands in 10\%Al HES, which contribute to the high strength and ductility of the 10\%Al HES. Furthermore, the 10\%Al HES with larger grains displays a much higher fracture toughness at 4.2 K, and this inverse size effect on the cryogenic toughness was elaborately revealed.},

  abstract     = {Substantial mucosa defects in gastrointestinal tracts are difficult to repair, causing high mortality. Existing artificial mucosa studies overlooked the natural surface texture and the paracrine action between epithelial cells and fibroblasts, leading to an incomplete repair of the mucosa. Here, a Janus film with an exterior surface having a ridge-like texture and an interior flat surface to mimic the anatomical pattern of natural mucosa in digestive tracts is obtained through cryogenic electrospinning (e-spinning). Inspired by the natural mucosa surface textures, biopolymer nanofiber assemblies are employed to replicate the micro-ridges of the exterior layer of mucosa, while the flat surface mimics the morphology of the inferior layer. Hence, the exterior surface of Janus film bolsters epithelial cells&#39; proliferation through the macro pores between fiber assemblies and the nanopores on fibers. In addition, the Janus film realizes a bilayer epithelium/lamina propria reconstruction by culturing epithelial cells and fibroblasts on different sides of the Janus film. Moreover, the Janus film assists the paracrine action between epithelial cells and fibroblasts while insulating their direct contact, an essential mimicry of the natural counterpart. In summary, it is proved that the Janus film will be a promising repair solution for mucosa defects in digestive tracts.},

  abstract     = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising noninvasive treatment for cancer. Researchers have focused on improving the therapeutic effects of PDT in recent years. Subcellular organelles are the building blocks of cells, and their destruction can lead to cell dysfunction or even death. Photosensitizers (PSs) with precise organelle targeting capacity can not only kill cancer cells effectively but also help reduce PS dose, minimize side effects, and avoid drug resistance. Herein, four homologous luminogens with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics through acceptor substitution engineering are designed and synthesized to specifically anchor to mitochondria, cell membrane and lysosome through slight structural tweaks, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are efficiently produced under light irradiation, which significantly enhance the therapy efficacy of PDT. Notably, biological studies have shown that membrane-targeted PS, TBVP exhibits more powerful therapeutic effects than other three PSs ( TBPy , TBPy-Bu and TBPy-TA ) at the same concentration. The highly effective anti-tumor activity of TBVP was evaluated successfully in vitro and in vivo . In addition, TBVP can promote cell autophagy to induce cell death. We thus believe the anchoring organelles approach described here represents an attractive therapeutic approach in photodynamic therapy.},

This study investigates structurally graded and multi-material lattices consisting of plate-based octet unit cells, under quasi-static compression, to assess their energy absorption ability. Variations in the structure and material compositions of the plate-lattice structures are achieved through changing the plate thickness and through changing the filament material along the lattice in the direction of applied compressive force. The compressive stress–strain behavior reveals a near 10\% increase of specific energy absorption (SEA) in the plate thickness graded designs at higher strain compared to the baseline octet lattices. The multi-material arrangements significantly modified onset location of the structure collapse. Finite element models of the structures were developed, and good agreements with experimental results were observed. Effects of varying each of the unit cell geometric parameters were analyzed, and the high sensitivity to the plate inclination angle, which resulted in greater changes to the maximum stress values and control of the overall SEA, was identified. The results demonstrate the capacity to adapt the octet lattice structure design through additive manufacturing to better suit the expected load and application.},

The prepared EP@SH-SiO 2 coating exhibits hierarchical micro/nanostructures and is capable of maintaining a contact angle of more than 150° after 1000 cm of abrasion length and 80 tape-peeling repetitions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanics calculations show that the improved mechanical resistance is attributed to the enhanced interfacial interaction between the EP@SH-SiO 2 coating and the underlying substrate induced by the epoxy adhesive. Electrochemical measurements in 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution show the corrosion inhibition efficiency of the EP@SH-SiO 2 coating reaches up to 99.99\%, and even after 8 days of immersion, the low frequency impedance modulus of the EP@SH-SiO 2 sample is still ∼1 order of magnitude higher than that bare aluminum, demonstrating excellent long-term corrosion protection. The diffusion behavior of the corrosive medium in the EP@SH-SiO 2 coating was revealed by MD simulation to support the experimental results. Additionally, the EP@SH-SiO 2 coating exhibits good chemical stability and hydrophobic repair properties.

In this study, the effects of constant load, geometrical parameters and multi-pitting on stress corrosion in sea mud simulated solution were explored by establishing a 3D multi-physical finite element model to reveal the mechanism of SRB promoting stress corrosion. The results show that micron-sized pitting can cause significant local stress concentration. Pitting with similar geometries has little effect on maximum anodic current density. When the multiple pits are vertically distributed, the corrosion in the middle area of the two pitting increases. SRB-induced pitting causes stress concentration and tiny galvanic corrosion with the action of mechano-electrochemical effect, which make the pitting more likely to develop into micro-cracks in depth direction.},

In this specific case, the objectives are low density and cost, along with good strength, ductility, and aqueous corrosion resistance. The present strategy has produced a two-phase material, having a ductile FCC matrix and a L2 1 intermetallic reinforcing phase. A machine learning algorithm has been trained using attributes of binary phase diagrams as inputs and the existing experimentally informed CCA database as output values, which efficiently predicts the phases which will result from combinations of selected elements. Corrosion resistance is achieved through tailoring the composition such that solute partitioning promotes passivity of both phases. Surprising results of composition optimization, such as preferred levels of Mn and Mo in an Al-Cr-Fe-Mo-Mn-Ni-Ti alloy are presented. While raw material cost, density, corrosion resistance, and stiffness are strong functions of alloy chemistry, the strength and ductility are highly sensitive to microstructure as well. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize a crystal plasticity-based prediction of toughness, defined as the product of ultimate tensile strength and uniform elongation, by varying microstructural attributes. Surprising dependencies of this toughness on the microstructure inputs are highlighted. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.},

The low-dimensional representations enable us to capture key features of the dataset rapidly, such as the similarity among SAXS patterns and the structural evolution trends. The preprocessing of the dataset points out the further direction of data analysis so that researchers can focus on the most valued regions in the dataset. Then, we develop a hybrid VAE-multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network to realize the processing-structure mapping of iPP films. The robustness of the hybrid VAE-MLP network is verified. Finally, SAXS patterns in the temperature-strain space are generated, which allows us to explore the processing parameter space not involved by previous experiments. These capabilities indicate that the developed machine-learning methods are valuable artificial intelligence toolset to assist in the preprocessing of large-scale SAXS datasets and the establishment of comprehensive processing-structure relationship of hard-elastic iPP films.},

  abstract     = {This work aims to reveal the compatibility mechanism of different plasticizers with the base asphalt using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. For this purpose, four kinds of plasticizers were chosen, namely dioctyl phthalate (DOP), dioctyl adipate (DOA), acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC), and trioctyl trimellitate (TOTM). The compatibility between those plasticizers and the asphalt was evaluated by various MD simulation parameters, including electric dipole moment, solubility parameters, and binding energy, and the simulation results were verified using macroscopic tests. The results show that the four plasticizers are effectively miscible with asphalt within the temperature range of 130 °C to 170 °C. The optimal temperatures for DOP, DOA, ATBC, and TOTM in modified asphalt preparation are 140 °C, 130 °C, 140 °C, and 150 °C respectively. The saturate component is more miscible with weak polar plasticizers, while the other three asphalt components are more miscible with strong polar plasticizers. TOTM has the best stability in combination with asphalt and ATBC has the worst. Aromatics and saturates have better torsional and bending deformation ability, and are more likely to form stable blending systems with strong polar plasticizers. Asphaltenes and resins have more stable benzene ring structures, they have greater binding energy with DOA, which is chain-variable and weakly polarized.},

  abstract     = {Viscoelastic materials are used extensively in energy dissipation applications to mitigate large lateral displacements and attenuate vibrations. One way of exploiting the capabilities of viscoelastic materials is using shear-damping mechanisms such as seismic damping devices. This study utilizes the freedom of design offered by additive manufacturing to produce 3D- printed thermoplastic parts that act as the viscoelastic layer in an energy damping device. A mechanically interlocked damping device with a bio-inspired jigsaw-like interlocking mechanism was designed and manufactured. The damping device is composed of a hard and soft phase. The hard phase is made of steel, while the soft phase is 3D-printed thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The mechanically interlocked damper was cyclically tested under different amplitudes and frequencies. TPU was mechanically characterized using uniaxial cyclic tension tests under different rates and different printing processing parameters. Stress relaxation tests were also conducted to obtain the viscoelastic behavior of the TPU material. Material characterization of TPU was used to develop a finite element (FE) model that is used to simulate the mechanically interlocked damper. The FE model was validated with the experimental observations and was then used to examine the significance of damper geometry on the efficiency of energy dissipation.},

Different approaches are followed, based on various mechanisms – from ferroelectric switching to structural phase changes, from magnetic tunnel junctions to metal filament formation. Here we analyze an alternative strategy based on an unconventional electrical response arising from percolative charge transport and charge trapping in discrete random networks of oxide nanostructures in a dielectric matrix. After an analysis of the mechanisms which can potentially be a source of a plastic response in this class of systems, we report evidence of this behavior in a system comprising an alkali-germanosilicate amorphous matrix with incorporated Ga-oxide nanostructures. The active material – consisting in a film 70 nm thick interfaced to p-type Si and Au electrodes – gives a responsive behavior to pulsed bias which is accompanied by bias dependent electric conduction, with resistivity changes of an order of magnitude by applying 2 V, as well as a dielectric response with hysteretic features, as expected by the model. The results represent a first proof of concept of an unexplored strategy for the design of responsive systems.},

Its controllability is elusive due to the complexity of the content, which has led to slow progress in the study of their electronic structure. Here, we investigated the deformation mechanism of (Co, Fe, Ni) 3 Ti-type multicomponent intermetallics using first principles. Thermodynamic parameters, energy and electronic structure suggest that Fe favors a lower γ SPF γSPF while Ni favors a higher γ SPF γSPF , which is caused by the difference in the chemical bonding they contribute. The stable outermost electron orbital achieved by Ni-Ti contributes to the good mechanical properties, while the excess lone pair electrons provided by Fe would make the contribution of metallic bonding more significant. Adjustment of the intermetallics-favoring/alloys-favoring element ratio is an effective method to overcome the strength-ductility trade-off. This work provides electronic-level understanding and practical insights to better design and utilize the multicomponent intermetallics enhanced high entropy alloys.},

  abstract     = {Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) has proved to be an efficient tool for understanding the process-structure–property relationships and helping us to design materials. For instance, in cemented carbides manufacturing, one of the most critical parameters is the C-window. It is defined as the C content range for which phases detrimental to the mechanical properties are avoided. This processing window has been traditionally defined using applied thermodynamics methods. However, the deviation between equilibrium calculations and real manufacturing conditions requires big additional empirical efforts to precisely define the C-window. In this work, an ICME-based approach is proposed to redefine the processability limits of cemented carbides taking the cooling rate and the material’s initial powder size into consideration. The method relies on the interactive coupling of several adapted models and tools, to not only set the processability boundaries, but also to study the complex mechanisms interplay happening along microstructural evolution. A better understanding of these underlaying mechanisms leads to new inputs that can be used in the design of cemented carbides. In this regard, it is observed that faster cooling rates or coarser WC grades could be effectively used to prevent nucleation of the detrimental phases enlarging the C-window towards lower C contents.},

The effect of pore size and unit cell types on the compressive stress and elastic modulus were investigated, and regulating pore size led to the compressive stress and elastic modulus ranging from 3.7 to 467 MPa and from 2.6 to 36.3 GPa, respectively. The in vitro results demonstrated that the ability to support the osteogenesis and angiogenesis was for the most part similar between the FCC-65, OCT-65, and HCP-65 scaffolds (porosity of 65\%). After implantation in goats for 12 weeks, the FCC-65, OCT-65, and HCP-65 scaffolds showed sufficient results for guiding bone ingrowth, indicating good biocompatibility and osteointegration; interestingly, the scaffold with OCT unit cell structure offered the strongest ability to accelerate bone mineralization compared with the FCC-65, HCP-65 scaffold, possibly due to mechanical-adapted properties.

  abstract     = {Twinned dendrites have attracted worldwide attention in the past half century due to their unusual orientation and crystallographic symmetry. Successive research has established a basic understanding of them in relatively steady processes like direct chill casting and directional solidification. This work, for the first time, investigated the growth behaviors of twinned dendrites in the wire arc directed energy deposition. The crystallographic characteristics, formation, and evolution laws of the twinned dendrites in the unsteady localized solidification condition are explored via experiments and numerical simulations. Results show that stacking faults are vital in the longitudinal growth of twinned dendrites by adjusting intermittent twin boundaries. During deposition, Mg, Zn, and Cu, which have low stacking fault energy, can promote the growth of twinned dendrites. The molten pool tail has large temperature gradients, crystallization velocities, and sufficient convection, providing advantageous growth conditions for twinned dendrites. Competitive relationships form between twinned and regular dendrites at the molten pool center. However, the twinned dendrites also cooperate with regular dendrites in epitaxial growth via their 〈1 0 0〉 lateral branch. With the remelting depth increasing, the twinned dendrite morphology changes from lamellar to isolated unilateral feather shape, then to unchained islands, and finally disappear.},

Biodegradable metallic Zn alloys are promising materials candidates; however, mechanical performance, corrosion behaviour, and biological response should be controlled in order to inhibit the risk of inflammation and bacterial infection. To this end, a Zn-2Ag (2 wt\% Ag) alloy was processed by ECAP to evaluate the concurrent combined effect of grain refinement and Ag alloying on biodegradation and antibacterial activity. Two ECAP cycles were successfully applied to a Zn-2Ag alloy obtaining a homogeneous ultra-fine-grained structure in which nanoindentation maps suggested isotropic mechanical properties. Lower UTS and YS with higher elongation was reported after ECAP with similar corrosion rates as before processing. ECAP processed samples showed a homogeneous Ag + release below the minimum inhibitory concentration for S. Aureus and no antibacterial effect was observed by diffusion. As expected, the presence of Ag in Zn-Ag alloys reduced bacterial attachment. Nevertheless, ECAP processed Zn-2Ag provided an excellent antibacterial activity after 3 h probably caused by the uniformly degraded and thus, non– stable, surface observed after bacterial adhesion.},

In this investigation, a novel PM configuration composed of multi-materials is proposed to facilitate the designing and fabrication of PM devices. The novel multiphase PM configuration contains three parts: honeycomb-corrugation latticed microstructures, mass adjusting weights and interconnecting phases. The mass adjusting weights are bond to metallic latticed structure via interconnecting materials, while metallic lattices are fabricated by stamping forming technique. Simulated Annealing algorithm integrated with numerical homogenization method is developed for optimization of PM designing. A water impedance matching multiphase PM device based on this novel configuration was designed and verified in this study, and it was revealed from both numerical simulation and experiments that the designed multiphase PM device mimicked the acoustic properties of water below 25 kHz. The results indicate that the multiphase PM configuration exhibits superior performance on many aspects such as withstanding much higher hydrostatic pressure, cutting down manufacturing cost by 90\% and reducing construction period by 98\% compared with conventional techniques.},

  abstract     = {Hollow charges play essential roles in the warhead design, detonation wave control, and lethality tuning. The superficial structure difference with solid charges prevents the direct application of Gurney&#39;s formula to determine fragment velocity. Tools are demanded in the design of hollow charges. Apart from checking the actual detonation driving behavior, a variety of different methods were used to solve this problem. And when developing these methods, 2 times the aspect ratio is often believed to be sufficient to treat detonation driving as a plane strain model (removing the influence of rarefaction waves). This study, however, reaches different conclusions about these aspects. Based on the discovered linear velocity distribution of the detonation products, a new formula was developed for the theoretical maximum fragment velocity of hollow charges. The formula applies to the non-plane strain state caused by end-face initiations. Furthermore, new fragment velocity distribution formulae based on results of a broad range of aspect ratios have been developed, the first time for the central line or hollow surface initiation. Based on numerical modeling and experiments, the entire formula system was verified to be precise and more applicable.

  abstract     = {MXene based aerogels with efficient thermal insulation, excellent electrical conductivity, reversible compressibility, and high durability hold great potential for various applications, ranging from wearable electronics to multifunctional scaffolds. How to balance various performance to adapt to more application scenarios is an urgent problem to be solved. In the present work, honeycomb AuCu alloy nanoparticles decorated Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene/RGO aerogels (MXene/RGO/AuCu NPs aerogels) were prepared by a simple reduction and directional freeze-drying method. The optimized MXene/RGO/AuCu NPs aerogels have low density (0.023 g/cm 3 ), flame retardant, robust mechanical properties (longitudinal and transverse compressive modulus of 450.9 kPa and 79.9 kPa at 90\% strain, respectively) and 80\% compressive elasticity. The deformable porous structure enables it to respond to pressure, which has been proved to be applied to pulse and human respiration monitoring. The ordered pore structure and the LSPR effect of MXene and AuCu particles make aerogels have heat resistance, flame retardancy, good electrothermal (can rise to 245.2 °C in 6 s at 7 V drive voltage) and photothermal properties (109 °C in 10 s at 1sun sunlight intensity). The excellent thermal management capability and pressure sensing characteristics make it a prospect application in wearable flexible heaters and artificial skin.},

However, there was no PLSs formed, in terms of a novel Fe – Cr – Si – B cast steel with B content much higher. The interfacial reaction between borides contained in this novel Fe – Cr – Si – B cast steel with 8.5 wt\% B content and Al at 750 °C was studied using hot dip aluminizing, thermal diffusion treatment, and subsequent SEM, TEM, and 3DAP of the obtained specimens. The PLSs were formed in situ after a long period of incubation because of the high chemical stability induced by the overstoichiometric (Cr, Fe) 2 B. The formation of PLSs proceeded through an intermediate state which involved transformation from disordered particles to ordered Cr – Al – B intermetallic compound. Owing to the formation of the localized melt of FeAl 3 – Al eutectics, the understoichiometric Cr–Al–B intermetallic compound gradually drifted to agglomerate and grew under the effects of the driving force of the lamellar growth of MAB phase and the thermal flux, along with the drag of the overstoichiometric Cr–Al–B intermetallic compound due to the interlaced structure.},

  abstract     = {Biomimetics -using nature to inspire innovation- has resulted in the development of many novel materials. Wood, nature’s light-weight structural material, defies mimicry at multiple scales, but its design features have been abstracted and used to develop honeycomb composites of limited geometric complexity. In this paper we demonstrate how it is possible to more completely biomimic wood, capture its exquisite mesoscale features and reproduce its mechanical properties. We utilised micro computed tomography (XCT) to image willow wood and used a novel cross-correlation reconstruction algorithm to mimic its 3D microstructure using minimal information. The mechanical properties of the simulated wood were compared with those derived from parent XCT data using finite-element simulations and testing of 3D printed samples of both wood types. The porosity and connectivity of both sample types was also compared. Our reconstruction algorithm was able to capture critical structural elements of willow wood with a high degree of fidelity, while mechanical properties of both wood types were closely matched. We conclude that our image-based stochastic modelling biomimetics offers a unique approach to capturing the mesoscale complexity of wood and will lead to new opportunities for designing novel materials inspired by xylotomy and powered by fast and high-performance computation.},

While most nanoenzymes can catalyze the breakdown of ROS present in the brain, they cannot eradicate the source of ROS production attributed to damaged mitochondria. Herein, we introduce a Co-doped Prussian blue (PB/Co) nanozyme that demonstrates multi-enzyme-like coordinated activity for scavenging present ROS and triggers mitophagy to remove damaged mitochondria. To further augment the brain entry efficiency of PB/Co nanozyme, we encapsulated it in 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) and 2,3-bis (palmitoyloxy)propyl-2-(trimethylammonio)ethylphosphate (DPPC) cationic liposomes and developed a non-invasive inhalable nanospray ((PB/Co)@DD) that permeates the brain via the olfactory bulb. In the PD mice model, (PB/Co)@DD nanospray induced mitophagy in the striatum to eliminate the ROS production source, preventing excessive ROS-induced sustained damage to dopaminergic neurons and averting the buildup of α-synuclein deposits, thereby ultimately restoring motor function in PD mice. Our research lays the foundation for catalytic therapy to eliminate abnormal mitochondria via the induction of mitophagy in PD mice models and highlights the potential of inhalable nanoenzymes as a non-invasive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.},

A micro-scale integrated simulation model is designed and constructed based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM), the Finite Element Method (FEM), and Calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) method in the work. The equation of the methods are introduced. By defining the parameters such as composition inhomogeneity ω ω , the forming performance of LPBF in-situ alloying FeCoCrNi medium entropy alloys are predicted. The calculation results show that the hysteresis diffusion effect makes the mixing powders more challenging to be in-situ alloyed than conventional main component alloys. For the mixed powder beds consisting of 15–53 μm particles with equal mass ratio, the composition deviation on the micro-scale is within 2.5\%, and the composition homogeneity reaches 98.9\%. Under a laser power of 150 W and a scanning speed of 500 mm/s, several laser remelting process are indispensable to eliminate unmelted elements. Experiments are carried out to verify the accuracy of the integrated simulation model, and the high-efficiency preparation experiment of non-equiatomic ratio medium entropy alloy was carried out by using the technology.},

Monotonic tensile and uniaxial fatigue experiments compared three specimen types: AA5083-H131 Wrought control, AA5083 AFSD-Recycled, and AA5083 AFSD-Solid bar. Tensile and fatigue results demonstrated comparable performance between the recycled material and wrought control. Experimental results indicate the thermo-mechanical processing of AFSD resulted in an exchange of strengthening mechanisms – replacing the strength of wrought material from strain-hardening to grain boundary strengthening from a refined as-deposited microstructure. Although strengthening mechanisms evolved in AA5083, the mechanical performance of the AFSD-Recycled material including improved fatigue performance over the wrought control samples illustrates the potential use of the AFSD process to reclaim waste machine chips into components or repairs while maintaining high mechanical performance requirements.},

The plastic part, created by extrusion shear printing (ESP), provides the driving force for shape morphing upon thermal annealing, whereas the elastomer part provides a base to mount membrane-type electronic devices and allows a comparably large degree of deformation. To ensure reliable interfacial adhesion in the plastic-elastomer framework, the ABS lines are treated with an allyl-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM) for chemical bonding to the Ecoflex layer. To determine control parameters for reliable shape morphing, the annealing conditions (e.g., temperature and time), the printing conditions (e.g., shear rate and pitch), and relative thicknesses of the ABS/Ecoflex are examined. Based on these findings, various 3D structures, including bent, cone, saddle, and dome shapes, can be generated from planar forms using ABS-Ecoflex frameworks, which are also predicted by a mechanical finite element method (FEM) simulation. Furthermore, a metal electrode and a membrane-type indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) transistor array are successfully mounted on ABS-Ecoflex frameworks and transformed into curvilinear structures without electrical failure.},

In order to identify appropriate process parameters, the feedstock is first characterized to estimate the printable temperature processing window. Initially, the best printable extrusion values were estimated in terms of green part density and dimensional accuracy. Afterwards, different nozzle diameters and layer heights are investigated to further improve the green part density and shape accuracy. An extrusion multiplier of 0.14, nozzle diameter of 0.4 mm and a layer height of 0.1 mm were found to be the optimum process parameters to achieve highly dense green parts with a density of 2.791 ± 0.001 g/cm 3 .

However, related mass transfer theories especially under confined conditions (such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration) lack the understanding of common mass transfer mechanisms and control methods, thereby seriously restricting the design and development of related membrane materials. This article reviews the research progress of separation membranes with confined mass transfer effects in recent years and analyzes the challenges faced by classical mass transfer models under confined mass transfer conditions. The confined mass transfer mechanism, influencing factors, construction methods, and types of preparation materials are summarized. Furthermore, the development of confined mass transfer separation membranes and the problems to be solved are prospected. Nanomaterial-modified membranes with confined mass transfer function are most likely to break through the trade-off effect of high flux and high selectivity. The confined mass transfer mechanism and preparation strategies of separation membranes are rarely reviewed. Hence, this review can provide guidance for new entrants and existing researchers in the field of membrane separation and has certain reference value for the development of confined mass transfer membranes in the future.},

  abstract     = {The grade 91 ferritic/martensitic steel is considered a promising structural or cladding material for various nuclear reactor applications. Here, grade 91 was fabricated via the Directed Energy Deposition Laser technique. This alternative manufacturing process potentially enables tailoring of the mechanical properties through increased control of the product’s microstructure. Aimed at linking fabrication to performance via defining the process-structure–property relationships, the current research includes macro and up to nano-scale mechanical testing using microhardness, tensile, and in-situ nanoindentation hardness, coupled with electron diffraction-based microstructure characterization. Mapping of the product structure and properties was conducted by testing miniature-sized samples, parallel to the built direction (‘Z’ direction) and perpendicular (‘X’ direction) at constant distances. We found the majority of the microstructure consists of fine and coarsened-size lath-type martensite grains, with up to 15\% δ-phase, preferentially observed at the melt pool boundaries. Most intriguing was the gradual decrease found in observed metallurgical pores alongside softening at farthest distances from the cold build platform. Here, these changes were successfully explained in terms of phase composition, ‘grain-like’ size effects of the lath-type martensite, and geometry necessary dislocation density. In finalizing this work, several competing strengthening mechanisms were addressed, and their activity was considered owing to fabrication-related mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogels are ubiquitous in nature and technology. Controlling their mechanical properties and under-standing their complex microstructure is critical e.g. for 3D bioprinting or tissue engineering applications. Here a generic design concept for tuning the elasticity of extrudable gels at given polymer or particle concentration is presented. Targeted micro-phase separation leading to micro-heterogeneities (1–100 µm) yields high gel strength allowing for extrusion of uniform filaments with high shape accuracy as long as the heterogeneity length scale is small compared to the extruded filament diameter (&gt;500 μm). Micro-mechanical and structural heterogeneity was enhanced in alginate hydrogels by accelerating crosslinking kinetics, corresponding to gel elasticity variation of more than two orders of magnitude (17 Pa to 2300 Pa), enabling filament extrusion (1046 µm) with high shape fidelity. Introducing poly(vinylalcohol) into gelatin gels resulted in more heterogeneous materials with a 2-fold increase in elasticity (951 Pa to 1993 Pa) and thinner filaments (908 µm to 590 µm). Higher ionic strength in Laponite-based hydrogels induced nanoparticle aggregation, leading to higher elasticity (857 Pa to 2316 Pa) enabling smooth filament extrusion. Eliminating the often tacitly assumed hydrogel uniformity on the microscale provides additional degrees of freedom to achieve high gel strength without increasing polymer, particle or crosslinker concentration.},

  abstract     = {Non-contact remote optical thermometers as a significant technique have been extensively developed. However, it is still a challenge to design new Bismuth-doped phosphor materials with tunable spectra for high-sensitive optical temperature sensors. Herein, a novel Y x Lu 1-x NbO 4 :Bi 3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) phosphor is constructed by the isomorphic end components LuNbO 4 and YNbO 4 . Owing to the modification of crystal field strength around Bi 3+ ions, the emission positions controllably shifted from 475 to 462 nm with the increase of Y 3+ ions concentrations. Besides, systematic luminescence modifying from blue to red across the white light region could be achieved via the design of Bi 3+ →Eu 3+ energy transfer (ET). Intriguingly, an anti-thermal-quenching behavior of Eu 3+ ion originating from the ET is found in Y 0.8 Lu 0.2 NbO 4 :Bi 3+ , Eu 3+ (YLNO:Bi 3+ , Eu 3+ ) phosphors, while Bi 3+ ion presents a great emission intensity loss with only retaining 46.8\% at 383 K. Based on the disparate thermal responses, the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of Eu 3+ to Bi 3+ demonstrates excellent thermometry properties from 303 to 503 K. The maximum absolute sensitivity ( S a ) and relative sensitivity ( S r ) reach 0.318 K −1 (@328 K) and 1.62\%K −1 (@393 K). In addition, the thermochromic performance of the resultant phosphors could be applied to qualitatively estimate the surrounding temperature. The spectral adjustability and high-sensitive of the developed phosphors highlight their multiplicity of applications in non-contact temperature measurement and white LED.},

Through doping engineering, the near infrared photothermal conversion of Nd doped nanosheets was boosted by 52\%, which is higher than many previous works. Besides, the prepared nanomaterials can realize infrared and in vivo computed X-ray tomography bioimaging, due to the rich optical-magnetic properties of Nd atoms. The in vitro and vivo experiments with mice display that the Nd doped nanosheets have low toxicity and high biocompatibility. More importantly, the nanomaterials can efficiently achieve photothermal tumor ablation. It is suggested that designed and developed nanosheets have promising applications for biomedicine.},

  abstract     = {Interlocking metasurfaces (ILMs) are a new class of structural metamaterials consisting of autogenous latching features. ILMs offer non-permanent joints that are an alternative to fasteners, welds, or adhesives. The mechanical properties of ILMs, including strength and stiffness, are governed by both the shape of the individual latching unit cells and the interaction between unit cells. These cross-cell interactions provide a synergistic effect that distinguish ILMs from ordinary isolated latching features: specifically, as the number of interacting unit cells increase, the strength of the ILM also increases. Remarkably, in the present study, ILMs demonstrated interfacial tensile strengths that were as much as four times stronger, and stiffer, than the equivalent isolated latching components. Computational analysis and experimental measurements confirmed the cross-cell interactions associated with ILMs. Both finite element analysis and digital image correlation strain field mapping reveal that unit cells near the edge of the ILM have different load-limiting deformation and failure mechanisms than those away from the edge: unconstrained edge unit cells bend out of the way, thus allowing the interlocking features to move past one another whereas interior unit cells do not. Due to their synergistic strengthening, ILMs show promise as a novel joining technology.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen has been known as an effective strengthening element in titanium (Ti) and its alloys. However, an over-dose of oxygen can also lead to embrittlement of Ti alloys. To precisely control and push the limit of oxygen in Ti and its alloys, we studied the decomposition process of Ti oxides in pure α-Ti matrix using an in-situ high-temperature scanning electron microscope. The experimental results revealed that TiO particles decomposed in α-Ti at elevated temperatures and the oxygen atoms gradually diffused into the matrix, following the Fick’s second law. Then, the samples with different oxygen contents were produced using the aforementioned strategy, for which the oxygen content, microstructure, and mechanical properties were measured. The results revealed that the oxygen content can be precisely controlled, which can achieve an ultra-high tensile strength of close to 1100 MPa, at no expense of elongation-to-failure, with incorporating 0.87 wt\% oxygen. An analysis showed that the strength contribution from oxygen follows the Labusch law. These findings offer a novel approach to design high-performance Ti alloys with non-toxic and cheap elements.},

  abstract     = {As a novel reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated therapeutic modality, sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has recently received enormous attention due to the unique benefits of deep tissue penetration and insignificant side effects. However, the hypoxic microenvironment increases the tumor resistance to SDT, hindering its therapeutic efficacy. In this work, an ingenious nanoplatform was designed via a facile self-assembled strategy of human serum albumin (HSA, a biocompatible carrier), IR780 iodide (IR780, a sonosensitizer and an imaging probe), and piceatannol (PIC, an effective HIF-1 α inhibitor and a chemotherapeutic drug), to achieve combined therapy of enhanced SDT and chemotherapy. Under ultrasound irradiation, the as-formed HSA/IR780/PIC nanoparticles (HIP NPs) effectively generated ROS and accelerated the release of PIC from HIP NPs. In addition, the released PIC played a chemotherapeutic effect and effectively reduced hypoxia-mediated SDT resistance by downregulating the expression of HIF-1 α . Furthermore, compared to IR780, HIP NPs exhibited higher tumor accumulation, better imaging performance and lower systematic toxicity, ultimately achieving combined SDT and chemotherapeutic effects. Together, these findings demonstrate a promising nanoplatform to combat hypoxia-mediated SDT resistance and enhance the SDT efficacy. In addition, this proof-of-concept design of the nanoplatform may furnish a facile and effective strategy to construct a multifunctional nanoplatform for acquiring precise cancer theranostics.},

However, the liquid breakup behaviors in high-speed gas flow during GA remains unclear, especially the primary breakup in the near field and the secondary breakup in the far field. Great difficulty exists in in-situ observation of the interactions between high-speed gas and high-temperature molten metal because of the limitations of the enclosed environment. Here, we built a new GA simulation system with a close-coupled atomizer utilizing liquids with low melting temperature, such as water, glycerin, etc. We use a high-speed camera to capture the evolution of liquid behaviors at various parameters. We first reveal that four primary breakup modes and four secondary breakup modes exist in the GA process, and these breakup modes significantly influence the particle size distribution (PSD) and the defects of the powder. Besides, the breakup modes are clarified by the dimensionless analysis. This manuscript provides an effective experimental platform to understand the breakup behaviors of the liquid jet in GA and suggests the optimal breakup mode for powder production.},

Recently, it has become a new idea to use photothermal effect and Fenton/Fenton-like reaction to treat tumors or enhance the killing effect of chemotherapy drugs. We developed an iron-containing nanomaterial SiO 2 @PDA/Fe 3+ -FA (PDA: polydopamine; FA: folate) to treat chemotherapy-insensitive osteosarcoma. The nanomaterial has been proven to have: (1) high drug delivery efficiency (doxorubicin and cisplatin: 21.25\% and 23.80\% respectively), (2) precise release of drugs in pH response, (3) good biocompatibility, (4) effective tumor targeting (8 h after injection), and (5) satisfactory photothermal efficiency (photothermal conversion efficiency: 57.63\%). Of note, nanomaterial containing Fe 3+ ions can activate the Fenton-like reaction to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce apoptosis of drug-insensitive osteosarcoma cells. In addition, nanomaterial can also enhance the killing effect of cisplatin on drug-insensitive osteosarcoma. The activation of Fenton-like reaction and the recovery of cisplatin function by nanomaterials are significantly enhanced under low temperature photothermal conditions. The in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that SiO 2 @PDA/Fe 3+ -FA could be loaded with appropriate chemotherapy drugs and could be used as an effective means of synergistic therapy for drug-resistant tumors in combination with near infrared ray (NIR) irradiation.},

The microstructure’s material properties, including the electrical resistivity, are of decisive importance for a wide range of applications in microelectronics, high-frequency communication, and biomedical engineering. In this work, we present a room-temperature process for µAM of gold structures based on local electrodeposition. We demonstrate control of the electrodeposition process by regulating the precursor species supply rate through air pressure and by regulating the reaction rate through the electrodeposition potential. We 3D printed complex gold microscale structures and characterized the resistivity of the printed gold by developing hybrid devices with integrated four-point probe measurement capability. Additionally, we printed copper microwires, building on a previously shown copper µAM process, and characterized the copper resistivity. We demonstrate near-bulk resistivity values of 65 nΩ·m (about 2.5 times higher than bulk) and 19 nΩ·m (only 10\% higher than bulk) for the gold and copper wires, respectively, without post-treatment. Microstructural analysis of the gold wires revealed a dense metal deposit free of voids. Finally, we printed gold structures on a pre-patterned substrate, paving the way to hybrid devices in which additive micromanufacturing is combined with existing micromanufacturing techniques.},

  abstract     = {A carbon–containing CrMnFeCoNi high–entropy alloy (C–HEA) nanocomposite was additively manufactured via a laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process combined with subsequent heat treatment. Exposure of the LPBF C–HEA to this additional heat–treatment step not only resulted in heterogeneous–structured grains of which the substructure is decorated with a dislocation network, but also uniformly distributed nanosized carbide precipitates at the grain and substructure boundaries. A multistep creep test conducted on the LPBF C–HEA at 873 K enabled the stress exponent, n , to be obtained with values of 3.03 in the low stress region (175–250 MPa) and 6.99 in the high stress region (250–325 MPa). The LPBF C–HEA alloy exhibited superior high–temperature creep resistance (i.e., the creep rate and threshold stress were minimized) compared to other CrMnFeCoNi HEAs. The mechanism underlying the creep resistance and unique creep deformation behavior of the LPBF C–HEA alloy is discussed on the basis of electron channeling contrast imaging and electron backscatter diffraction analyses.},

  abstract     = {Various approaches for detecting glucose concentration in real time are emerging at a breakneck pace. Glucose metabolism is closely linked to severe pathological events, which would either cause or predispose many progressive diseases in human. Herein, hydrophilic upconversion nanoprobes NaGdF 4 : Yb 3+ , Er 3+ @Ag anchored with glucose oxidase (GOx) for glucose detection with lower detection limits have been efficaciously constructed. In the upconversion nanoprobes, NaGdF 4 : Yb 3+ , Er 3+ cores, and Ag layers act as energy donors and effective quenchers, respectively, through energy transfer. Moreover, the layer of Ag may disintegrate by H 2 O 2 in the presence of glucose when glucose oxidase anchoring on the exterior of NaGdF 4 : Yb 3+ , Er 3+ @Ag nanoprobes, which leads to the phenomenon of upconverting emission recovery. Additionally, NaGdF 4 : Yb 3+ , Er 3+ @Ag-GOx has an ultralow detection limit of 1.77 μmol L −1 on glucose detection, and it can achieve optical bioimaging to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. As a result, the NaGdF 4 : Yb 3+ , Er 3+ @Ag nanoprobes could be expanded to detect diverse H 2 O 2 -involved analytes. Overall, this nanoprobe has promising potential to be a compelling tool for the biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {As a typical representative of group III-VI two-dimensional (2D) layered semiconductors, α-In 2 Se 3 with layer-dependent direct bandgap (1.39–1.45 eV) has attracted great attention in optoelectronics. At present, various α-In 2 Se 3 based photodetectors have been developed, which show ultrahigh responsivity and detectivity at visible (VIS) wavelengths. However, despite the high sensitivity, the response time is quite long, and the realization of broadband detection from VIS to infra-red (IR) wavelengths is also challenging for these α-In 2 Se 3 photodetectors. In this paper, we introduced a narrow and direct bandgap 2D semiconductor Ta 2 NiSe 5 and made an α-In 2 Se 3 /Ta 2 NiSe 5 heterojunction photodetector, which achieved a wide response wavelength of 405–1550 nm with high performance. Originating from the n -type nature of the two semiconductors and the particular type-I energy band alignment, the potential barriers of holes at the α-In 2 Se 3 /Ta 2 NiSe 5 interface is much higher than that of electrons, which leads to an ultra-high responsivity. At 520 nm illumination, the photoresponsivity is 12 A/W and 533 A/W under a self-driven state and a slight bias voltage of 0.1 V, respectively. The highest detectivity is over 8.2 × 10 13 Jones. Furthermore, the rise and fall time is shortly at 25 and 423 μs, respectively. We believe that the high-sensitive, broadband, and fast photodetector has great potential in the emerging field of 2D optoelectronics.},

Low density lattice structures for lightweight construction are one such example. However, there currently are no well-developed guidelines for designing and reliably manufacturing these structures. Literature on the topic is fragmented and usually only covers a limited aspect of the complex relations between process parameters, microstructure, lattice geometry and mechanical properties. This work covers the edge case of small diameter struts manufactured from AlSi10Mg via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) using the single contour exposure strategy, which is necessary to ensure sufficient geometric accuracy. Various cubic strut-based lattice geometries are manufactured using four laser parameter combinations corresponding to different area energy densities and beam offsets. The influence of process parameters and heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties is investigated. Results show that the microstructure of filigree lattice struts can be tailored by the selection of process parameters, resulting in either uniform or core–shell structures depending on the laser power, while the macroscopic mechanical properties are mainly determined by the lattice geometry and relative density.},

  abstract     = {Fabrication of high-performance titanium (Ti) alloys containing high-melting-point elements is challenging via blended elemental powder metallurgy (BEPM), because of the inevitable high porosity induced during pressing and sintering processes. Herein, we propose a novel master-alloy pre-hydrogenation (MAPH) method to fabricate sintered TC16 (Ti-3Al-5Mo-4.5 V) alloy, which possess a nearly full-density (99.2\%) and good mechanical properties, i.e., an UTS of ∼ 1004.6 MPa, a YS of ∼934.2 MPa and an EL of ∼15.8\%. The pre-hydrogenated 7.5Ti-3Al-5Mo-4.5V-H x (7.5TiMA-H x ) powder particles show a morphology of sharp corners. Therefore, the 7.5TiMA-H x and TiH 2 particles can get interlocked compactly during compaction and shrink simultaneously during the dehydrogenation process, which minimizes the difference in volume mismatch and ensures the overall uniformity after sintering. Besides, the interlocking compact structure makes the element diffusion easier between the 7.5TiMA-H x and TiH 2 matrix particles, which promotes the healing of porosity. The low porosity can reduce the tendency for propagation of cracks along the grain boundaries of the α layer, leading to a good balance between the strength and ductility of the sintered TC16-7.5TiMA-H x alloy.},

In our previous work, decellularized matrix of adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ADMSCs), named as DMA, presented excellent conjunctival repair capacity with proper suture resistance and immune modulatory characteristics. Thus, we intended to investigate their potential application in facilitating corneal repair after alkali burn. Owing to the transparent characteristic of DMA, DMA could be applied as novel ocular bandages with nutritious function. In this study we found that cornea treated with DMA showed accelerated recovery compared with those received amniotic membrane (AM) treatment by fluorescein staining, slip-lamp examination, OCT and corneal nerve immunostaining. Further, in order to find key components responsible for the faster recovery, high-throughput proteomic analyses were conducted and more than 2000 proteins, including associated signaling pathways, were identified in DMA. Intriguingly, progranulin (PGRN), one of enriched proteins identified in DMA, was firstly recognized for its neurotrophic role in alleviation of corneal damage. To sum up, DMA exhibited a potent clinical application with a cocktail of key therapeutic factors, in which PGRN was a crucial factor in promoting neurite outgrowth and re-establishing homeostasis of the cornea.},

This study focuses on the deformation and fracture processes in this material using in situ X-ray micro-computed tomography (XCT) at room temperature (RT) and 1200 °C in an inert gas environment in a C-ring compression loading configuration. Prior to testing, local properties and residual stresses were characterised using nanoindentation and Raman spectroscopy since they can impact the mechanical behaviour of the material. The 3D strain distribution, crack formation and propagation processes including the toughening mechanisms ( e.g. , crack deflection, micro-cracking, crack bridging and bifurcation) are investigated in the coating and underlying composites at RT and 1200 °C. There is no particular sequence which toughening mechanism occurs first – this is very different from the conventional toughening theory in ceramic-matrix composites under uniaxial tension loading. Indeed, no evidence of fibre pull-out or fibre fracture was observed in this SiC f -SiC m nuclear cladding material in the current C-ring compression configuration.

  abstract     = {High-value applications, such as adsorbents, have drawn attention to geopolymers. In several of those applications, having the geopolymer as porous spherical particles is beneficial. This study presents a novel process for fabricating porous metakaolin-based geopolymer granules using a combination of direct foaming, one-part alkali activation, and granulation. In short, the precursor (e.g., metakaolin) and solid activator (e.g., sodium silicate) are loaded in a granulator, in which an aqueous blowing agent (e.g., H 2 O 2 ) is added while the granulator is running, and the obtained granules are cured at 60 °C. Characterization of the granules for physico-chemical and morphological properties indicated an increase in overall porosity, especially in the µm-scale pores. Also specific surface area (+50\%) and nanoscale pore volume (+102\%) increased when using more concentrated H 2 O 2 (20 or 30\%) compared to nonporous granules. The use of porous granules was also demonstrated in dynamic adsorption experiments for ammonium (NH 4 + ) uptake, which showed up to ∼126\% increase in cumulative adsorption amount compared to nonporous granules. The highest NH 4 + uptake was obtained with 10\% H 2 O 2 solution as the granulation fluid. The results confirmed the feasibility of the method for introducing porosity to geopolymer granules, which enhances the adsorption properties of the granules.},

  abstract     = {Composite materials are increasingly inescapable in engineered systems in various industrial fields, given their high strength to weight ratio for increasing autonomy, reducing energy consumption and enhancing mechanical strength of high added value products. However, their out-of-plane resistance could be improved by multimaterial assembly for structural hybridization. The purpose of this study is to explore the possibility of upgrading the shock resistance of UHMWPE Tensylon® by alumina coating. Thermal spraying was used for alumina deposition on UHMWPE and bond strength assessment of the obtained assembly was performed by Laser Adhesion Test (LASAT). During experiments, free surface velocities of specimens were recorded by the use of Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) allowing relevant observations complementary to optical observations. From the PDV analysis and cross section observations by microscopy, a diagnostic of the decohesion of the interface is proposed. The study shows the possibility of assembling alumina on UHMWPE to strengthen its shock resistance and makes now possible the improvement of the study of deposition process parameters thanks to LASAT evaluations.},

Wound dressing loaded with antibacterial or anti-inflammatory drugs/molecules is one of the feasible routes in clinical applications. Nonetheless, effective and controllable drug release remains challenging. Herein, by electrospinning polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polylactic acid-glycolic acid (PLGA) with copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuS NPs) and two model drugs, namely antibacterial drugs (mupirocin, M) and anti-inflammatory drugs (valsartan, V), an operable wound-healing patch consist of amphiphilic Janus nanofiber membrane (PLGAV-CuS/PVAM) was prepared which was used to controllable gradient drug release in wound healing. Janus nanofiber membrane shows typical amphiphilic characteristics, with low biological toxicity and good biocompatibility. In vitro experiments showed that the nanofiber membrane could slowly and continuously release mupirocin in a hydrophilic environment for antibacterial purposes. In addition, the excellent photothermal effect of PLGAV CuS/PVAM can regulate the release rate of the anti-inflammatory drug valsartan, effectively reduce the inflammatory reaction in the wound healing process, and also show enhanced bacteriostasis efficiency (96.3\% of Escherichia coli and 97.8\% of Staphylococcus aureus). The prepared patches exhibited excellent antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and sustained-release effects, which is of great significance for board the avenue of nanofiber in the biomedical field.},

  abstract     = {Although radiotherapy has become indispensable for tumor treatment in recent years, the inevitable side effects of high-dose radiation on the normal tissue and deficiency of appropriate radiosensitizers without long-term body retention that do not cause potential toxicity limit further clinical applications to a certain extent. Herein, we rationally synthesized BiOI nanodots coated with M1 macrophage membrane (BiOI@M) by utilizing their coordination interaction. With two high-atomic-number elements and ultrasmall size, the prepared BiOI nanodots not only enhanced radiosensitivity by reactive oxygen species under X-ray irradiation in vitro , but also could be excreted quickly by kidneys. Meanwhile, the M1 macrophage membrane functioned as a highly desirable carrier with long-circulating and tumor-targeting capability. As a result, treatment with as-prepared BiOI@M could improve the therapeutic outcome of radiotherapy in a xenograft mouse model and reduce the potential toxicity of nanoparticles. Simultaneously, BiOI nanodots exhibited excellent CT imaging ability as contrast agents to visualize biodistribution in vivo and to monitor tumor growth. Therefore, our work demonstrated the preparation of a tumor targeting and renal clearable radiosensitizer and offered a potential approach to enhance the radiotherapy efficacy of hepatocellular carcinoma.},

This study presents a novel load path methodology for designing and optimizing functionally graded lattice structures composed of anisotropic unit cells with directional reinforcement struts. Firstly, the optimal density distribution of the lattice structure is obtained by solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) topology optimization. Secondly, pointing stress vectors of the structure are calculated to determine the orientations of the unit cells. Lastly, the lattice model is constructed using tapered beams for a smooth transition between struts with different radii. Two examples of a simply supported beam and a 3-dimensional base support structure are provided. The experimental validation showcases that the proposed design improves the specific stiffness by 75\% compared to the uniform body-centered cubic design. Furthermore, the strength-to-weight ratio is increased by 232\% due to a more desirable stress distribution.},

This paper implements the adjustable-ring mode (ARM) laser and studies the impact of the core/ring power ratio to explore the impact on intermetallic phase formation and mechanical properties during remote laser welding of IF steel to 1050 aluminium. It was found that in conduction mode, the core/ring power ratio of 0.2 provided a larger surface area for bonding at the weld interface, and this was translated through the maximum lap-shear strength of 97.6 N/mm 2 (joint efficiency 71\%). Furthermore, this significantly reduced the Fe 2 Al 5 intermetallic compound (IMC) thickness by 62\% and total IMC thickness by 40\% in contrast to a core-dominant beam (power ratio greater than one). In keyhole mode, cracking and lower lap-shear strengths were observed compared to the conduction mode. Notably, with a core/ring power ratio of 0.5 a significant grain refinement in the steel side of the weld was observed.},

  abstract     = {Predicting stress–strain curves is key to facilitate the design of polymer materials and their products with tailored mechanical response. However, due to their structural complexity, polymeric solids generally feature complex stress–strain curves, which renders it challenging to model their stress–strain behaviors. Here, using the categorized knowledge of stress–strain curves, a “Classification-Embedded Dual Neural Network (CDNN)” framework is introduced to accurately predict the mechanical evolution of polymeric solids, by taking the example of injection-molded isotactic polypropylene. Upon built, the dual model is a parallel coupling of a “curve type classifier” and a “curve feature predictor” that predict, respectively, the stress–strain curve categories and their feature points that dictate the extent of similarity between two arbitrary curves in the same category, regardless of the curve complexity. Importantly, with the aid of curve-categorized knowledge, the CDNN strategy offers an update-to-date best balance in model accuracy (20\% curve error in maximum) and simplicity (300 neurons in total), which greatly enhances the model’s extrapolability and interpretability and, in turn, mitigates the demanding data requirement (27 samplings from a 4D space, that is, a material design space consisting of 4 design dimensions to tune the structure). Overall, this work establishes a simple, robust methodology in predicting polymeric solids’ stress–strain curves and is potentially generic to a variety of materials.},

  abstract     = {Localised laser treatments enable the creation of sophisticated austenite/martensite mesostructures in Fe–Ni–C steel with the potential of achieving enhanced mechanical performance. The control of phase topology is essential to modify the properties of these structures on demand and requires a profound understanding of the effect of the processing parameters on the development of the different phases upon the application of laser treatment. In this work, the microstructure evolution under exceptional gradients in temperature and heating rates is thoroughly investigated. The extent of the laser-affected zone and the heat input were tailored by varying laser parameters and specimen thickness, based on a model that considers transient material properties and the coupling between temperature and microstructure. The predicted temperature fields resulted in a complex interplay between martensite to austenite phase transformation and martensite tempering. Considering the high heating rates of up to 25000 K/s and the observed microstructures, it is suggested that austenite was formed by a pseudo-displacive mechanism and subsequently fully recrystallised in the zones most directly affected by the laser heat source. A smooth strength transition from austenite to martensite, affected by the laser parameters, could be exploited for more effective deformation mechanisms and improved material mechanical properties.},

We investigated the effect of the USP duration on the microstructure of the DP-HEA Fe 50 Mn 30 Co 10 Cr 10 by the advanced materials characterization methods, e.g. Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We found that the microstructure of the USPed DP-HEA Fe 50 Mn 30 Co 10 Cr 10 can be refined into several nanometers. Additionally, the FCC γ phase is transferred into the HCP ε phase during the USP process of the DP-HEA Fe 50 Mn 30 Co 10 Cr 10 and the portion of the HCP ε phase increases gradually with the increase of the USP duration. Nanoindentation tests indicate that the nanohardness of the nanostructured DP-HEA Fe 50 Mn 30 Co 10 Cr 10 can reach as high as 7.49 GPa, suggesting a yield strength of 2.49 GPa, which is 10 times higher than that of the coarse-grained materials. Additionally, nanocrystallization of the DP-HEA Fe 50 Mn 30 Co 10 Cr 10 can be triggered with a short peening duration and the transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effect can benefit the formation of a thick gradient nano-grained layer during USP.

In this study, core–shell SU-8 nanocomposites were fabricated via vapor-phase infiltration of nanoscale amorphous aluminum oxides into SU-8 nanopillars and performed transmission electron microscopy, nanomechanical testing, analytical modeling, and atomistic simulations to gain a fundamental insight into the ultrahigh modulus of resilience much higher than that of most high-strength materials. This study shows that the ultrahigh modulus of resilience results from: the low aspect ratio of amorphous aluminum oxide nano-particulates; the particulate size thicker than the free volume size; and the thin aluminum oxide interconnecting links within nano-particulates. These unique microstructural features produce the unusual combination of low specific Young’s modulus ( E ), 4 MPa/(kg/m 3 ), and high specific yield strength ( σ y σy ), 0.2 MPa/(kg/m 3 ), leading to the specific modulus of resilience, 5.21 ± 0.39 kJ/kg ( σ y 2 / ( 2 E ) σy2/(2E) ) about ten times higher than materials with the similar yield strength.

This work has fabricated a triple-phase core–shell micro-nanostructure in a biomedical Ti6Al4V5Cu alloy with the ultrafine grained α phase stabilized by the nanoscale conjugated β/Ti 2 Cu shells, of which results in a high fatigue resistance. The results show that the average grain size of the α, β, and Ti 2 Cu phases are 585 nm, 421 nm and 135 nm, respectively. The soft β phases in the conjugated β/Ti 2 Cu shells can produce a plastic zone at the crack tip to hinder the propagation of fatigue cracks. The fatigue strength of the core–shell structured Ti6Al4V5Cu alloy is 750 MPa under the experimental condition of R = -1 and N f Nf = 10 7 , which is 36.3\% higher than the widely used Ti6Al4V alloy.

The results show that the thermal stability of the alloy is more closely correlated with thermal exposure temperature than with exposure duration. Excellent thermal stability in strength is obtained below 150 °C, which can be linked to the diameter and number density of T1 (Al 2 CuLi) precipitates continually increasing with a thickness less than 2 nm. However, the widened precipitation-free zones (PFZs) associated with continuous grain boundary precipitates (GBPs) benefit intergranular fracture, contributing to a decrease in toughness and elongation. In the window of 175–200 °C, T1 precipitates tend to thicken and are gradually substituted by coarse θ′-Al 2 Cu and S-Al 2 CuMg with elevating temperature. Simultaneously, the continuous GBPs transverse to discrete circle-like shapes, and thus intergranular ductile fracture becomes dominant. Therefore, the related hardness and strength decrease, while the electrical conductivity and toughness are the opposite. At temperatures over 250 °C, thermal exposure can reduce the dislocation density and dissolve T1 phases to form T2-Al 6 Cu(Li, Mg) 3 and cubic C phases, leading to a dramatic decrease in strength and toughness.},

In early-ageing, the formation of disk-like Mg-Cu and Mg-Ag nano(co–)clusters can be quantitatively examined by Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), respectively. In the prolonged ageing of the 0A samples, the thickening in the disk-like θ-precipitates leads to a lower aspect ratio. For S-precipitates, the change in the total surface area and the single-particle surface area indicates that the coalescence mechanism is prevalent from peak-ageing to over-ageing, and then after over-ageing, the precipitate coarsening dominates. The coarsening in S and θ precipitates presumably leads to a lower mechanical strength. Alternatively, in the aged 7A sample, the SAXS technique in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) quantitatively reveals Ω-precipitates possessing a nearly constant thickness but an increase in diameter with ageing time. Additionally, the stable behaviors of the total surface and size of S-precipitates illuminate that the coalescence/coarsening mechanisms are significantly slowed down. The concurrently-existing precipitation kinetics of Ω and S have provided an in-depth understanding of the higher strength of the aged 7A sample.},

The abundance of this organic polymer makes it an excellent candidate for developing renewable materials such as lignin-based biocomposites. The mechanical properties of lignin, as well as the dependence on the extraction process and feedstock, are, however, still unknown and hamper its utilization. Therefore, five hot-pressed lignins, extracted by different processes from different feedstocks, are tested by means of grid nanoindentation at indentation depths ranging from 150 nm to 1200 nm. Statistical and microstructure-guided evaluation based on microscopy images of the indented areas allows for retrieving reliable indentation properties of the porous lignin, free of indentation size effects. The sought mechanical properties of the solid (pore-free) lignin are back-identified from the strong correlation between the property and the porosity using micromechanics homogenization theory. This correlation reveals that the solid lignin in all tested samples is mechanically similar, despite different chemical structures, with a virtually intrinsic Young’s modulus of 7.1 GPa.},

In this study, a new approach is proposed to create a large area of metallurgical bonding at the coating-substrate interface by the design of Al-Si based gradient coating on A383 alloy cylinder bore. The internal coating comprises hypereutectic Al-Si-Cu-Fe top layer, near-eutectic Al-Si bond layer, and transition layers, which were fabricated by an advanced internal rotating plasma spraying technology. The tensile adhesive and interfacial indentation tests were conducted to investigate the adhesion properties of the coating. The crystallographic relationship of the bond layer-substrate interface was further investigated using the focused ion beam and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Results show that the Al-Si based gradient coating presents both desirable surface hardness (385.1 ± 46.6 HV 0.025 ) and bonding strength (46.4–58.1 MPa). The tensile failure mode is the fracture at the subsurface of the top layer, without fracture at the coating-substrate interface. The superior bonding strength results from the formation of chemical interdiffusion (estimated thickness of 700–1500 nm) and homo-epitaxial growth at the interface. This study provides a framework for forming a reliable metallurgical bonding interface of internal thermal-sprayed coating.},

A novel 0.04Nb-0.04 V (wt\%) PHS (22MnB5NbV) was developed based on 22MnB5. The constant-strain bending test shows the duration of no-cracking for 22MnB5NbV in 0.5 mol/L HCl is &gt; 300 h even though the pre-bending stress is 1500–1600 MPa, and that for 22MnB5 is 12 h. The prior austenite grain size and martensite lath width in 22MnB5NbV decrease from 13.4 to 8.2 μm and from 0.35 to 0.15 μm due to Nb-V microalloying, respectively, resulting in the hydrogen trapped in reversible hydrogen traps increases by 2.09 times according to thermal desorption spectrometry analysis. The leaching experiment presents that 88\% Nb and 25\% V exist in the form of precipitates rather than in solution in 22MnB5NbV. The nano-precipitates (&lt; 10 nm) are mainly (Nb, Ti, V)C, in which Nb-bearing precipitates account for the largest proportion and supply the heterogeneous nucleation sites for V-bearing precipitates, this is confirmed by atom probe tomography (APT). APT confirms that the hydrogen is mainly trapped at the interface of Fe matrix/carbide. The dispersed nano-carbide and refined microstructure resulting from the Nb-V microalloying are the key factors improving the HE of 22MnB5NbV.},

  abstract     = {In this study, two types of polymeric periodic hybrid (PPH) structures with hexagonal and re-entrant cells were proposed and manufactured by 3D printing using polylactic acid (PLA). PVC foam was adopted as filler material. The mechanical characteristics of PPH structures under uniaxial compression were experimentally and numerically investigated. Experimental results show that PPH structures with foam filling in re-entrant cells exhibit higher elastic modulus and peak stress than those with foam filling in hexagonal cells, which is due to the bi-directional compression of the foam filler in re-entrant cells. Moreover, their deformation processes are more stable, benefiting from compatible deformation between hexagonal and re-entrant cells. With the increase in foam filling volume fraction, the plateau stress and specific energy absorption of PPH structures increase. Numerical results reveal that the enhancement efficiency of foam filling gets improved by suitably increasing the cell wall thickness. The fully foam-filled PPH structures exhibit significantly higher yield strength than the fully foam-filled hexagonal honeycomb structures, and also possess excellent stable deformation characteristics compared with fully foam-filled re-entrant honeycomb structures. The PPH structures proposed in this study show superior comprehensive mechanical performance, thus offering potential application prospects in structural protection fields.},

In this study, a deep learning fusion model is developed for the first time to predict the material properties of carbon fiber monofilament using textual (macroscopic properties of composites and matrix) and visual (two-point statistics of microstructures) data. For this, 1200 stochastic microstructures are generated using the greedy-based generation (GBG) algorithm. Then, the statistical representations of microstructures are determined using two-point statistics and the macroscopic properties are calculated based on a micro-scale finite element (FE) simulation. Finally, the visual and textual data are fed into the convolutional neural network (CNN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) fusion model for predicting the mechanical properties of carbon fibers. The developed hybrid CNN-MLP fusion model achieves encouraging average testing R 2 of longitudinal modulus, transverse modulus, in-plane shear modulus, major Poisson’s ratio, and out-of-plane shear modulus of carbon fibers with values of 0.991, 0.969, 0.984, 0.903, and 0.955, respectively. Thus, the proposed strategy provides a promising framework for predicting material properties via multisource heterogeneous data and is expected to accelerate the smart design and optimization of materials.},

It was found that the water pressure, abrasive flow rate, and focusing tube traverse speed changed the slope of the kerf wall without changing the kerf width. However, the standoff distance (SOD) changes the kerf width, whereas the slope of the kerf wall induces minor changes. Furthermore, based on the first-order derivation of the extracted kerf profile, the relationship between jet energy, cutting depth, and kerf width was analyzed. The experimental results revealed that: 1) the relationship between the reduction in the jet energy distribution and cutting depth is non-linear; 2) the jet energy distribution is smallest at the kerf top edge and bottom section. The predictive cutting depth model and jet energy distribution will enable the subsequent optimization of process parameters in the AWJ process.},

Current treatments using vancomycin usually result in high side effects with low treatment efficacy because of strong drug toxicity and weak targeting specificity. It is emergently needed to develop a novel antimicrobial agent and target drug delivery system. Herein, we developed anti-infection nanoparticles (LMM NPs) with autonomous targeting ability, loading low-molecular-weight fucoidan (LMWF) and coated by neutrophil membranes, and used for the therapy of MRSA-infected wounds. The LMWF molecules possess similar anti-MRSA effects as vancomycin but lower nephrotoxicity. Nanoparticles coated with the neutrophil membrane can escape immune recognition due to the retained cell membrane components and accumulate in the infection site. Furthermore, the MRSA-infected wound model confirms that the LMM NPs accumulate efficiently in MRSA-infected tissues and have good biocompatibility and excellent antibacterial ability in MRSA-infected wounds, which promote MRSA-accompanied wound healing. These novel infection-targeted LMWF-loaded NPs could be applied as a useful strategy for the targeted treatment of infection therapy. This will provide a meaningful reference to extend clinical treatment in MRSA infection of deep tissues.},

  abstract     = {The manufacturing of metal parts via powder-bed fusion is often still facing quality issues due to microstructural porosity. Minimizing this porosity remains a priority and requires the optimization of printing process parameters. While the analysis of printed parts using X-ray computed tomography can localize and identify the pore types (e.g. keyhole or lack-of-fusion pores), these pore types can be difficult to identify across printer settings and print materials. Therefore, there is a need for a material and process agnostic approach. This work presents such an approach by considering a set of geometric pore features that do not differ considerably across print scenarios. These features are then leveraged for supervised pore type classification. The distributions of pore features were analyzed in different materials and under varying laser parameters, showing that they behave in a generic way. For classification, it is observed that they outperform other features leveraged in the state-of-the-art for pore classification in a single material, reaching up to 93.0\% accuracy. Additionally, accuracies up to 90.2\% for cross-material classification were observed by training on pores of one material and validating on another. These results pave the way to a general-purpose pore classification method usable across materials and process conditions.},

While ripple formations in the welding literature have been studied extensively, they have not received much attention in the DED process. They are often wrongly conflated with the melt pool geometry. The experiments consisted of printing 10 mm cubic components on a hybrid machine tool (MTS 500 from Optomec) under nine different combinations of laser power, scan speed and dwell time. The ripple formations and the microstructure on the scan surface were subsequently observed and statistically characterized at four different magnifications on an optical microscope. The study establishes that the ripple traces are a main determinant of the dendritic structures, as well as the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the microstructure formations in DED-printed 316 components. The statistical characterization also highlights the limitations of the ripple waveform descriptors employed commonly in the welding literature and introduces spectral quantifiers to adequately capture the complex waveform patterns of ripples in DED.},

Besides the development of experimental techniques, computational modelling is another important way to study the AM mechanisms in detail. However, currently there is still lack of a modelling platform that integrates all the necessary physics involved in the AM process. In the present study, we develop a modelling framework that integrates a phase field method for microstructure evolution, a lattice Boltzmann method for melt pool dynamics, a modified ray-tracing method for laser-material interaction, and a minimum gravity energy algorithm for powder bed generation to simulate the single-track, powder bed fusion (PBF) process of NiTi shape memory alloy. Our simulation shows that different from keyhole depth, melt pool size does not obey the scaling law with line energy density, the keyhole depth and the overlapping ratio of laser spot vs. keyhole opening together determine the laser absorptivity. Based on the simulation finding, we also develop a self-consistent analytical model to predict the keyhole depth and the absorptivity for given scanning parameters. The present work lays a solid foundation towards quantitative understanding of multi-layer AM process.},

  abstract     = {Decreasing the growth temperature to lower energy consumption and enable deposition on temperature-sensitive substrates during thin film growth by magnetron sputtering is crucial for sustainable development. High-mass metal ion irradiation of the growing film surface with ion energy controlled by metal-ion-synchronized biasing, allows to replace conventionally-used resistive heating, as was recently demonstrated in experiments involving a hybrid high-power impulse and dc magnetron co-sputtering (HiPIMS/DCMS) setup and stationary substrates. Here, we report the extension of the method to industrial scale conditions. As a model-case towards understanding the role of one-fold substrate rotation on Ti 0.50 Al 0.50 N film growth employing W + irradiation, we investigate the effect of two parameters: W ion energy (controlled in the range 45 ≤ E W+ ≤ 630 eV by the amplitude of synchronized substrate bias voltage) and W ion dose per deposited metal atom (determined by the target power). We show that the efficient densification of coatings grown without external heating can be achieved by minimizing the thickness of DCMS-deposited Ti 0.50 Al 0.50 N layer that is exposed to an W + ion flux, or by increasing E W + EW+ at a given Ti 0.50 Al 0.50 N thickness.},

  abstract     = {Because of the excellent thermal conductivity and increased strength, finned special-shaped tube (FSST) is frequently utilized in a variety of industrial applications. However, duo to the complex section structure of FSST, the elastic–plastic evolution of the FSST section is more complex than that of circular and rectangular tubes, when FSST is subjected to various coupling effects of bending moment and torque. Moreover, until now, no literature has studied the bending-torsional-coupled deformation of FSST. In this study, based on the power-law stress–strain curve model and the Henky-Ilyushin equations, an analytical model that can precisely characterize the bending-torsional-coupled deformation of the FSST section is established by using the stress method. According to the boundary conditions divided by the geometric characteristics of FSST, the stress and strain distribution, elastic–plastic evolution, and the coupling relationship between the base circle and fins under different bending radii and unit torsion angles are discussed in detail. Besides, the relationship between bending radius and unit torsion angle and bending moment and torque on the section is presented based on the concept of section moment superposition. Finally, the rationality and accuracy of the proposed analytical model are verified by simplified finite element model (FEM), FEM, and practical tests.},

Such model is based on a new design of the polymeric base of the FDP, realised via additive manufacturing (AM) - a solution that conveys at the same time quick manufacturability, low cost, custom-ability, and design freedom. By means of this new model, the load-bearing capability of three-units monolithic FDPs has been thoroughly tested; in particular, three different analyses were performed: (i) analytical with a beam-like model, (ii) numerical, using non-linear three-dimensional Finite Elements (FE) models and (iii) experimental, by static bending test. The FDPs considered in this work were manufactured using a fourth-generation zirconia, namely 4Y-TZP. The findings demonstrated the undoubted advantages of the new base configuration, which minimized the effect of the base (which as a matter of fact is absent in in-vivo conditions) on the stress state of the connectors in the FDPs, and increased the repeatability and reliability of the experimental bending tests, able to determine the load bearing capability of the 4Y-TZP FDPs.},

A variety of strategies to alleviate the ITM have been investigated. Direct regulation of lactate metabolism in the tumor microenvironment (TME) holds promise for ITM modulation. Herein, we fabricated a glutathione-responsive PEGylated hollow mesoporous organosilicon (HMOP), with monocarboxylate transporter 1/4 inhibitor (diclofenac, DC) and lactate oxidase (LOX) loaded in/onto the HMOP (denoted as DC-HMOP-LOX). DC-HMOP-LOX could spontaneously be biodegraded in the TME due to the disulfide bonds, and then DC/LOX could be released to exhaust intra/extracellular lactate. DC-HMOP-LOX hindered the transmission of lactate effectively and oxidized lactate directly. Therefore, DC-HMOP-LOX collaboratively depleted lactate in the TME, which induced an immunocompetent TME by activating immune-promoting cells (dendritic cell, T cells, natural killer cells, and M1-macrophage), inactivating immunosuppressive cells (M2-macrophage and bone marrow-derived suppressor cells), and regulating the levels of immune cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-12). The immunocompetent TME ultimately strengthened the antitumor effect of anti-PD1-based immunotherapy.},

Here, using bio-inert polyetheretherketone (PEEK) as the representative and polyvinyl butyral (PVB) as a coating medium, a repeated soaking-drying method was developed to decorate PEEK with porous treatment (SPEEK) in PVB solution containing enoxacin (ENX). PVB and ENX were painted on SPEEK to form SPEEK/PVB-ENX*3 according to the controlled preparation strategy. SPEEK/PVB-ENX*3 exhibited porous morphology with immobilized ENX, hydrophilicity, and kept mechanical properties. SPEEK/PVB-ENX*3 showed antibacterial activity of successive 6 days and cytocompatibility. Moreover, SPEEK/PVB-ENX*3 maintained antibacterial stability and cell activity for 4 months. SPEEK/PVB-ENX*3 inhibited osteoclasts but promoted osteogenesis in mineralization. The in vivo drug monitoring of implanted SPEEK/PVB-ENX*3 showed that ENX could be fully released and metabolized in 7 days, eliminating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) caused by residual antibiotics. The in vivo experiments of micro-CT, immunohistochemistry, and histological staining at 6 weeks after surgery on osteoporotic rats showed that SPEEK/PVB-ENX*3 had antibacterial activity, inhibition of osteoclast, promoted osteogenesis and safety. This study develops an effective method for the biofabrication of implants needed for the clinical treatment of osteoporosis from clinical considerations.},

Compared with straight vessels, the complex morphology of aortic arch imposes strict requirements on stent-graft properties. This study designed and verified an aortic stent-graft by optimizing a specially constructed commercial descending stent-graft. The main structural parameters including strut height, strut number, strut radius, wire diameter, and graft thickness were set as the design variables. The essential mechanical properties (flexibility and radial support force) of stent-grafts relevant to the mentioned variables were selected as objective functions. Surrogate model and multi-objective genetic algorithms were adopted to implement the optimization process. Finally, the optimized stent-graft was virtually implanted into an ideal aortic arch to verify its suitability. The optimization was completed after 16 iterations, demonstrating that the optimization method used in this study was efficient. The results showed that the flexibility of the near-optimal stent-graft improved over 50\% and the radial support force was extremely close to that of the original design. Compared with the original design, the sealing effect of the optimized stent-graft was significantly improved. The results of this study provide guidelines and a feasible method for designing aortic arch stent-grafts.},

In this paper, we present a numerical study of a high-quality resonant permittivity-asymmetric metasurface that offers tunability in the mid-infrared range by employing the phase change property of Germanium Antimony Telluride, Ge 3 Sb 2 Te 6 (GST326). In this approach, we used dissimilar materials of ellipse-shaped nanopillars, and shifted the nanopillars from their center positions to break the symmetry-protected bound state and generate a high-Q resonance sufficient for detecting trace amounts of analytes. The peak location of the resonance can be controlled by tuning the crystallization state of GST326 for broadband retrieval of analyte signatures. We performed a grid search to optimize the design parameters to obtain a tuning range that matches the absorption band of amide I and II groups. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate sensing of a thin protein layer using the proposed metasurface and we show how our structure is sensitive to the imaginary part of the analyte refractive index and how the permittivity-asymmetry resonance is robust against crystallization losses. We also propose a layout for a practical device that can be used for biomarker detection applications.},

A series of voxel-wise microstructure samples with various characteristics are generated. Their effective thermal conductivities are evaluated using a diffuse-interface-based computational homogenization method. A voxel-based algorithm is employed to identify the potential percolation paths in the structures. The homogenization results show particularly significant effects of the percolation path in composite samples with higher aspect ratios and interface resistances. The importance of different thermal and geometric features to the effective thermal conductivity is analyzed using a data-driven sensitivity study. The analysis also demonstrates that the particle volume fraction and interface thermal resistance are the most influential characteristics for determining the effective thermal conductivity.

  abstract     = {Acoustic emission (AE) is a well-established technique for in-situ damage analysis of composite materials. The main challenge, however, is to be able to correlate the measured AE signals with their respective damage mechanism sources. Hence, an innovative approach to classify AE signals based on supervised machine learning is presented in this work. At first, the constituents of a composite (fiber, matrix and interface) are characterized separately and fingerprint information regarding the characteristic AE features of each damage mechanism is gathered. This dataset is then used to train a model based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Model accuracy is calculated to be 88\%. Subsequently, AE signals measured during tensile tests of commercial composites are classified by the trained model. The analysis provides important information regarding location, time, frequency and intensity of each damage mechanism. Matrix cracking and fiber debonding are the most frequent damage mechanisms representing around 40\% and 20\% of the measured AE hits. Nevertheless, fiber breakage is the mechanism that dissipates the most AE energy (40\%) for the studied composite. Furthermore, the presented method can also be applied together with other techniques like computer tomography, delivering a powerful approach to understand different multi-phase materials.},

This unique characteristic of proposed LSPI is enabled by pre-taking LSP process to improve the yield of following LSI process through significantly decreasing the surface roughness of aluminum foil. LSPI also reduces the aluminum residue inside the silicon mold, which improves the integrity of resultant nanostructure and facilitates the reuse of the mold. The working mechanism of LSPI are also investigated to reveal its fundamental fabrication principle, which may inspire other low-cost and efficient batch fabrication method for metallic nanostructures manufacturing in the future.},

The research results on the mechanical properties of non-pneumatic tyres are recapitulated in terms of vertical mechanical, longitudinal mechanical, lateral mechanical, grounding, vibration, and fatigue characteristics. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of non-pneumatic tyres are analysed. Three prevailing forming technologies and tyre performance tests are discussed.

  abstract     = {This work presents X-ray computed tomography (XCT) as a dimensional quality assurance technique for micro-injection moulded polymeric test objects for the establishment of predictive quality models and quantifying soft-tool deformation. The results are compared against an industry standard laser-scanning-confocal microscope (LSCM) for the evaluation of XCT’s capability. The work demonstrates; (i) the exploitation of a XCT equipment for dimensional characterisation of micro-injection moulded products made out of polymers with adequate acquisition times, (ii) that acquired XCT data from the 3D visualisation of the micromouldings perform on par with a laser-scanning-confocal microscope in a quality prediction model, (iii) that the deformation occurring in an additively manufactured soft-tool can be quantified using XCT. The technique was particularly superior in volumetric data acquisition compared to LSCM in the filling prediction of the micromouldings. Better accuracy and repeatability in predicting the quality of the mouldings up to 92\% achieved with XCT, in conjunction with an in-line collected soft-tool surface temperature data as an indirect quality assurance method. Given the capability of the XCT for the 3D data acquisition of polymeric miniature components, the approach described here has great potential in high-value micro-manufacturing process quality modelling for in-line quality assessment of miniature and added value products in data-rich contexts.

Herein, we propose a photosensitive cyclosiloxane-containing resins through thiol-ene click reaction. The UV cured cyclosiloxane-containing resins showed high-temperature resistance (5\% weight loss ≈ 400 °C), tunable mechanical properties, low temperature derived ceramics etc. With photosensitive characteristics of the developed systems proven by the photo-rheology studies, printing parameters were calculated by Beer-Lambert&#39;s law to achieve precise control of the 3D printed constructs with complex geometries. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of ceramicization of the 3D printed parts and the incorporation of nano-functional materials (MXene, invisible ink) for functional device preparation.},

Stainless steels and nickel alloys are attractive materials considered for WPA plant construction since they are mechanically and chemically robust to withstand the aggressive environment encountered. This review first describes the WPA process emphasizing on the aggressiveness of the environment to plant construction materials. Then, principles behind design and fabrication of stainless steels and nickel alloys with properties tailored to withstand this aggressive environment are described. To withstand corrosion conditions encountered during the WPA process alloys should contain sufficient chromium (Cr), with some molybdenum (Mo) and nickel (Ni) contents and should possess a homogeneous microstructure. Wear resistance in a specific section of the plant is ensured by adjusting the carbon content and carbide formers contents to obtain adequate carbides for protection from abrasion. Reported data on deterioration rates and failure mechanisms of commonly used alloys is first presented before discussing selection and performance of these alloys in different sections of the WPA plant. Future challenges and opportunities in selection of suitable materials and development of novel materials are finally outlined.},

  abstract     = {The Airy beam has intrigued long-held research interests and developed various striking applications attributed to the unprecedented diffraction-free, self-bending and self-healing properties. Metasurfaces with superior design freedom and small structure size open a fire-new avenue for generating efficient and broadband Airy beam. Nevertheless, most existing Airy beam generators can only respond to one polarization state of electromagnetic waves and produce the single Airy beam, which immensely limit the serviceability and utilization of the Airy beam generators. Herein, an inspiring strategy of multichannel Airy beam generator based on the multichannel amplitude and phase controlled metasurface is proposed to independently generate the Airy beams for linear polarized waves in 20–24 GHz and orthogonal circular polarized waves in 12–14 GHz and 15–17 GHz. Notably, an appealing paradigm of multichannel beam focusing can be realized by the integrated multichannel Airy beam generator, which possesses strong ability to circumvent the obstacle owing to the self-healing feature of the Airy beam. A proof-of-concept prototype is constructed to verify the feasibility of our methodology, and multitudinous simulations and experiments are in excellent accordance with our theoretical predictions. This novel design of multichannel Airy beam generator will have tremendous application potential in sensing, communication and other multifunctional metadevices.},

This study aims to bridge the gap via controlling the material distribution before printing. Here a new approach for preparing structured inks for E3DP is proposed. The feasibility is verified through ink preparation and process parameter optimization. These inks are fabricated by the integrated technology of casting and 3D printing. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is employed to simulate the ink flow through the channels of printheads. The geometric parameters of these inks are determined by analyzing the cross section of the extruded fibers. Inks with core–shell cross section are investigated to clarify the effect mechanism of structured inks on printed fibers. Inks with symmetric cross section are exemplified to show the diverse printable structures. Finally, a novel workflow to the design and fabrication of structured printing materials for E3DP is presented. This approach may enrich E3DP while facilitating the fabrication of heterogeneous tissue structures.},

In addition, it ensures a high spatial resolution, low surface roughness (without polishing treatment), high optical transparency, and guarantees accuracy in terms of small-scale characteristics. Whilst the development of AM technology in glass manufacturing is relatively slower than in polymer, metal, and ceramics manufacturing, it has made considerable progress in the fabrication of functional glass devices, including gradient refractive index optics, microlenses, colour converters, microfluidics, and micro-toroid optical resonators. Great potential has been exhibited on multi-material, multi-scale, multi-functionality (M 3 ), and hybrid additive manufacturing, it will definitely be the future trend on transparent glass components fabrication. This review provides a systematic summary of different AM techniques, with an emphasis on the printing strategies, resolution, multi-material capability, and property evaluation of glass.

In this study, six types of cells with different volume fractions are designed, and mainly undergo bending and tensile deformation. According to the load characteristics during a three-point bending test, five kinds of graded lattice structures are designed. Moreover, a skin-lattice structure and uniform lattice structure are designed, and plain cement mortar is set to comprehensively evaluate the bending mechanical properties of graded lattice-reinforced cementitious composites. The crack evolution and failure mode of these composites under three-point bending load are studied using digital image correlation (DIC). The results show that compared with the uniform lattice, the graded lattice can improve the maximum bending capacity of cement-based materials, improve their cracking characteristics and failure modes during the bending process, and enhance their toughness while reducing the amount of required material. Compared with the plain cement mortar specimen, the graded lattice-reinforced specimen with the largest bending peak load is found to have a 175\% increase in the bending peak load and a significant increase in the bending bearing capacity.},

In this work, PTT and tissue engineering scaffold were rationally integrated to construct a Ti 3 C 2 MXene, collagen, silk fibroin and quercetin composite scaffold (M-CSQ scaffold), a 3D printed biomaterial that simultaneously kill OSCC cells and promote the regeneration of the mucosal defects. The M-CSQ scaffolds were prepared by cryogenic 3D printing and freeze-drying techniques with sufficient pores that allow an abundant cell migration and provide a proliferation space. Ti 3 C 2 MXene has excellent photothermal conversion ability and stability. Quercetin targeted HSP70 to decrease its expression in OSCC cells, consequently weakening their resistance to high temperature and enhancing the effect of PTT. The M-CSQ scaffold effectively killed OSCC cells in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo . In addition, the M-CSQ scaffold provided adhesion sites for Sprague-Dawley rat (SD rat) buccal mucosal fibroblasts and promoted the repair of buccal mucosal wounds.},

However, the relatively compact pores in the interior often inhibit the growth and differentiation of containing cells. Additionally, the impact of the pore structure on the differentiation of cells remains to be unknown. In this work, porous hydrogel scaffolds with medium pore sizes (100–1000 μm) were prepared using 3D printing technology, and the hydrogel scaffolds without pores and non-printed hydrogel scaffolds were designed as control to investigate the effect of 3D printed porous structures on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs within hydrogel scaffolds, both in vitro and in vivo . The pore structure of 3D printed structured porous scaffold was explicitly inspected by SEM. The water content and expansion rate of hydrogel did not change, despite its porous structure. The BMSCs were evenly distributed across the porous scaffold and maintained high activity, thus benefiting from the sufficient circulation and diffusion of oxygen and nutrients due to the regular pores. In vitro , the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in the structured porous hydrogels was more prominent compared to the non-porous groups. Moreover, the mineralization of the hydrogel scaffolds was also enhanced. After ectopic implantation in the posterior gluteal muscle punch, the structured porous hydrogel exhibited relatively good mineralization and ectopic osteogenesis by the three-dimensional reconstruction of micro-CT, collagen staining, and immunological analysis. The 3D printing-based approach provides a facile strategy for the preparation of hydrogels with intermediate pore structures. This can promote the viability and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in hydrogel scaffolds.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on improving the flexural behavior of steel fiber-reinforced beams with continuously graded structure. Successive vibrating after casting is assumed to be a feasible way to produce graded fiber-reinforced beams (GFRBs), resulting in fibers purposefully distributed in the tensile region. The fiber orientation and distribution are quantified through X-ray computed tomography (XCT). The porosity and pore size distribution are evaluated on the basis of XCT images and mercury intrusion porosimetry . Influences of fiber re-arrangement and microstructure on the compressive strength , the first-cracking strength, the ultimate flexural strength and the flexural toughness index are then investigated. The results show that: (1) the fibers deflect towards the longest side of the beam, and distribute more concentrated at the beam bottom, i.e. more fibers are available to withstand tension, due to the successive vibrating treatment; (2) the high vibration time does not induce a negative influence on the mortar matrix, but rather refines its microstructure with lower porosity and smaller pore size; (3) the flexural behavior is enhanced for fiber re-arrangement and microstructure improvement, revealing that the designed GFRB is capable of sustaining higher flexural strength and energy absorption capacity than the typically vibrated beam with the same fiber content.},

  abstract     = {Postoperative adhesions are one of the most common complications post intraperitoneal surgery. Even after the adhesiolysis, the recurrence of adhesions is as high as 85\%. Although zwitterionic-based materials have been reported for the application, unlike the conventional zwitterionic hydrogel, a series of poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) grafted dextran derivatives (Dex-g-PSBMA) were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) reaction, making it fined controllable copolymer by its living polymerization property. Intriguingly, the Dex-g-PSBMA copolymer can self-assemble into a physical hydrogel under physiological conditions. When injected at the site of the lesions, it can immediately cover the wound area, and as the ion concentration increases, the chemical bonds dissociate and the hydrogel may degrade completely. In the abdominal wall-cecum injury adhesion model in rats, Dex-g-PSBMA hydrogel showed excellent anti-adhesion ability, effectively preventing postoperative abdominal wall-cecum adhesion. The mechanism exploration revealed that Dex-g-PSBMA hydrogel can take an effect on the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, which can inhibit the Smad3 and activate the Smad7 pathway, thereby reducing the probability of tissue fibrosis, reducing fibrin deposition, and resisting fibroblast adhesions. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that this Dex-g-PSBMA physical hydrogel is a promising candidate for completely preventing post-surgical adhesions.},

  abstract     = {Fallopian tube blockage-related diseases are the main cause of female infertility. Diagnosis of tubal patency and accurate determination of tubal obstruction lesions is of great value for infertility treatment. Conventionally, the common used hysterosalpingogram (HSG) has the disadvantages of radioactive hazard and high false positive rate. Thus, the development of a safe and accurate method which can replace traditional HSG for tubal patency diagnosis is urgently needed. Recently, fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared region (NIR-II) was widely used in in-vivo imaging research due to its excellent tissue penetration and signal-to noise ratio. With the aid of fluorescence agents, NIR-II imaging has the potential to diagnose tubal patency, which, unfortunately, has not been explored. Herein, a kind of rare-earth Erbium-based nanoprobe (Er-RENPs) with outstanding NIR-II fluorescence property was synthesized. Based on the Er-RENPs, the potential of NIR-II fluorescence imaging was explored. Results show that the outline of fallopian tubes can be clearly visualized with the help of Er-RENPs. And the stenotic, occlusive fallopian tubes and hydrosalpinx can be diagnosed. Additionally, the Er-RENPs exhibit good biocompatibility. In this study, we reported that NIR-II rare-earth fluorescent nanoprobe can serve as a promising fluorescent agent, and exhibits considerable potential application for tubal diagnosis.},

The effect of three different laser intensity profiles (beam shapes) on the shape of the melt pool and the resulting microstructure was studied. To this end, thermal gradients and growth rates, derived from measured melt pool emissions, are compared to characteristics of the microstructure in the deposited tracks. These characteristics are obtained using Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD). It was found that the shape of the laser beam strongly affects the melt pool morphology. Therefore it affects also the solidification characteristics and thus the resulting microstucture. Correlations are found between the thermal gradient - growth rate ratios and the grain shapes and amount of texture. Hence, the beam profile is a tool to steer the microstructure of deposited parts during L-DED.},

  abstract     = {To improve current design approaches for composite structures, it is required to further investigate the damage interaction effects of composite materials under multiple out-of-plane concentrated loads. It is first necessary to comprehend the dependence of the effective delamination threshold, which describes whether a delamination grows on pre-existing delamination damage in composite laminates. A combined experimental and numerical study is presented, in which two sequential out-of-plane quasi-static indentations are applied to fully clamped composite laminated panels, with changing distances between the two indentation locations changing. The results show that the second indentation delamination is more likely to propagate, particularly in the straight-line direction from the second indentation site to the first one, which can be interpreted as a decrease in the effective delamination threshold associated with microcracks ahead of the delamination front. The relevant percentage reduction is 37\% and is independent of the imposed indentation load. As a crucial take-away, designers should be mindful that the damage interaction effects could result in greater damage than the sum of the individual cases.},

During isothermal oxidation treatments in ambient air at 900 °C (for up to 25 h), Ti 0.44 Al 0.44 Ta 0.12 N allows for a parabolic scale growth rate constant k p of 6.039 × 10 -5 µm 2 /s.

The oxide scale growth kinetics for the latter can be even better described by a logarithmic or cubic law. In the as-deposited state the CeSi 2 and CeSi 2 + LaB 6 alloyed (Ti,Al,Ta)N are single-phase fcc structured providing an indentation hardness of 32.6 ± 1.5 and 37.8 ± 1.5 GPa, combined with an indentation modulus of 496 ± 22 and 496 ± 14 GPa, respectively. After vacuum-annealing at 1000 °C, their hardness is still 33.0 ± 1.6 and 34.8 ± 1.1 GPa, and noticeable formation of hexagonal AlN and TaN x phases can only be detected by X-ray diffraction when annealed at temperatures above 1200 °C.

  abstract     = {Slow crack growth (SCG) is a time-dependent quasi-brittle type of failure that polyethylene (PE) materials exhibit under low stress levels. The interplay between the crack and its plastic zone dictates complex damage behavior of continuous and discontinuous SCG. Under a continuum mechanics approach, SCG can even remain a commonality in PE mechano-chemical degradation (MCD). Therefore, a deep understanding of SCG is critical since it’s the controlling mechanism for most field failures and consequently the formalism of PE lifetime prediction models. In this work, a comprehensive review of the recent advances on PE SCG modeling is presented. PE SCG and MCD macro and micro mechanisms are explained. The evaluation test methods of SCG are discussed. Owing to PE continuous and discontinuous SCG modes, using the parameters of conventional Fracture Mechanics, e.g., stress intensity factor, J-integral, or crack opening displacement, may be considered only within their applicable range. The crack-layer (CL) theory was found capable in accounting for PE SCG kinetics and thermodynamics including its two fracture modes. The theory framework along with several applications are demonstrated. Hence, the main objective of the manuscript is to provide a thorough review of SCG in PE materials to give a direction to making reliability assessments more predictive.},

It is clarified that the high density of dislocations, stacking fault networks, Lomer-Cottrell (L-C) locks and nano-precipitates in the worm-rolled austenite play important roles for the ultrahigh yield strength. The spacing of the stacking faults gradually decreases and the density of L-C locks increases simultaneously during the tensile deformation, resulting in the dynamic refinement of stacking fault networks, which can effectively hinder the movement of dislocations. Thus, the continuous work-hardening ability and excellent total elongation at the ultrahigh yield strength are caused by the combined contribution from the dynamic Hall-Petch effect of stacking fault networks, the dispersed nano-precipitates and the partial TRIP effect. Our results open the way for designing stacking fault- and precipitation-strengthened medium manganese steel with advanced strength, ductility and work-hardening combination.},

In order to achieve insights into the whole printing process, statistical tools such as Designs Of Experiment (DoE) are usually applied. In this study, we examined the additive manufacturing of AlSi10Mg, a well-studied aluminium alloy used for L-PBF, and the modelling of its printing process by applying machine learning. The influences of different printing parameters (i.e. laser power, laser spot size, hatching distance, layer height and scanning speed) on the mechanical properties (i.e. density, tensile strength and hardness) were examined by generating different machine learning models based on data obtained with DoE and additional experiments. The best performing models were evaluated regarding the printing process and the respective testing procedures used to measure the mechanical properties. Mean coefficients of determination ranging from 56.44\% to 98.54\% were achieved. Finally, a processing window for producing dense samples with high tensile strengths and high hardness values was found.},

  abstract     = {Direct printing of complex 3D structures at the nano- and microscale is a promising technique for MEMS devices, small-scale sensors, and actuators. So far, most studies have been focused on printing copper (Cu) structures due to the high Coulombic efficiency compared to other conductive metals such as platinum. However, Cu suffers from low material strength, low modulus, and high strain-rate sensitivity. This work introduces a unique Cu-Ni core–shell structure for improved strength. A 3D additive-micromanufacturing technique based on localized electrodeposition was utilized to fabricate dog-bone-shaped Cu micropillars with submicron resolution. These pillars were subsequently coated with Ni by pulse-reverse electrodeposition. A combination of in-situ micropillar compression at various strain rates (0.001–500 s −1 ) and finite element simulations revealed remarkable strengthening in the Ni-coated Cu micropillar. Data obtained from both experiments and simulations were in good agreement, suggesting the strengthening was dominated by interface characteristics, stress redistribution, and geometrical effects. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that shape and dimension of the 3D-printed objects can be retained while increasing their strength drastically. These findings can be extended to other material systems and provide a pathway to develop strong and tough composites and metamaterials at multiple length scales for future applications.},

Hydrothermal aging crucially influences the durability of TBF-wound composites. The effects of hydrothermal aging on the microstructure, hygroscopic properties, and mechanical properties of TBF Naval Ordnance Laboratory (TBF-NOL) composites were examined in this study to elucidate the hydrothermal aging mechanisms of TBF-NOL composites and predict their service life. The moisture absorption behavior of the TBF-NOL composites conformed to Fick’s second law. After a 30 d water immersion test at 70 °C, the TBF-NOL composites exhibited a high moisture content, leading to a significant decrease in the tensile, bending, and shear properties. Hydrothermal aging significantly deteriorated the TBF/epoxy resin interface in the TBF-NOL composites. The effect of temperature on the hydrothermal aging of the TBF-NOL composites was more pronounced than that of humidity. This study predicts that the bending properties of TBF-NOL composites could be maintained at the 40–50\% level for 5–10 years, depending on the degree of exposure to hydrothermal environments. The service-life prediction results can guide the practical application of TBF-wound composites.},

A high-temperature/high-pressure permeation cell was designed based on the “closed-volume/variable pressure” standard test method. The identified gas transport properties using the time lag method yielded significant error particularly for PVDF and PK, which was ascribed to the sole reliance on the accumulated pressure-rate in steady-state. This error was minimized using the Non-Linear Regression (NLR) by utilizing the full range of measured data including the transient state. The coefficient of determination between the measured and modeled data using NLR was quantified above 0.99 for all the polymers at the entire examined temperature range. The 1.4\% higher degree of crystallinity and 28.5\% smaller spherulite size caused 13.3\% higher diffusivity and 8.6\% lower solubility in PE-RT when compared with HDPE at 82 82 °C. As a result of this trade-off, PE-RT exhibited only 3.5\% higher permeability than HDPE. The developed generalized temperature-dependent model provided the essential data for design optimization of gas barrier performance in multilayer high-temperature pressure-vessels.},

  abstract     = {Highly sensitive detection of melanoma-derived exosomal PD-L1 plays a key role in non-invasive diagnosis of melanoma. Here, we proposed a self-calibrated magnetic aptamer sensor (sCMAS) for sensitive detection of melanoma exosomal PD-L1, using the dual lanthanide-assisted luminescence as well as the ratiometric fluorescent probe strategy to overcome limitations caused by systematic or environmental factors, thereby providing a more stable and liable detection output. Generally, the sCMAS employs the Tb-based nanoparticles (TbNps), which were immobilized on magnetic Fe 3 O 4 microparticles, for stable luminescent reference signal report and the BHHCT-Eu 3+ complex for detection signal report of the specific exosomal PD-L1 recognition. Particularly, the dual time-resolved luminescent elements were bridged through the PD-L1-responsive aptamer and its complementary DNA hybridization chain. Recognition of exosomes with the aptamer expelled the detection signal (BHHCT-Eu 3+ ) only, leading to an exosome concentration-dependent liner increase of reference signal/detection signal ratio value in a broad concentration range (1.05 × 10 5 –1.05 × 10 10 particles/mL), and an extremely low calculated detection limitation of 1.88 × 10 2 particles/mL. Further, sCMAS allowed a rapid and efficient differentiation of the health samples from melanoma samples, even those early metastatic melanoma cases. Promisingly, this sCMAS developed in this work would provide a vast opportunity for future evaluation of tumor markers (exosomes, cells, proteins, etc.), and will provide a powerful tool in liquid biopsies.},

To address this challenge, we developed chitosan polymer membrane (CM) to directly deliver solamarine (Sol) for targeting reactive oxygen species (ROS)-enriched microenvironment. The Sol-loaded CM (Sol-CM) inhibits the excessive recruitment of inflammatory cells, and polarizes macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype “M2″ to inhibit excessive inflammatory response. Therefore, the Sol-CM can help maintain immune homoeostasis, which contributes to the pathogenesis of wound. The Sol-CM demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating wound. In addition, Sol-CM significantly attenuates focal inflammation and fibrosis level, thus potentially leading to a highly innovative and translational approach to treat diabetic wound efficiently and safely.},

  abstract     = {The cochlea has long been the subject of investigation in various research fields due to its intriguing spiral architecture and unique sensing characteristics. One of its most interesting features is tonotopy, the ability to sense acoustic waves at different spatial locations based on their frequency content. In this work, we propose a novel design for a tonotopic resonator, based on a cochlea-inspired spiral, which can discriminate the frequency content of elastic waves without the use of sub-wavelength resonators. The structure is the result of an optimization process to obtain a uniform distribution of displacement maxima along its centreline for frequencies spanning nearly two-decades, while maintaining a compact design. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the concept and experimental measurements to validate it on a 3D printed structure. The resulting frequency-dependent distribution is also shown to be a viable means to discriminate signals with various frequency components. We also show that for appropriate parameter ranges, the tonotopic behaviour can be inverted, i.e., lower frequencies can be made to concentrate in narrower regions, as happens in the real cochlea. The harnessed tonotopic features can be used as a fundamental principle to design structures with applications in areas such as non-destructive testing and vibration attenuation.},

In this work, material parameters of the Lemaitre-Chaboche model were fitted for electrodeposited copper foils. By using nanoindentation and microstructural characterisation, good agreement with literature was achieved.

In this work, a facile laser surface remelting technique with rapid cooling rate was successfully developed to fabricate a ∼ 100 μm-thick gradient nanostructured layer accompanied by phase decomposition on a TiZrHfTaNb 0.2 high-entropy alloy, where a ∼ 5 μm-thick crystalline-amorphous nanostructured top surface layer with an average grain size of ∼ 7 nm was obtained. Such crystalline-amorphous nanostructured layer shows an ultrahigh yield strength of ∼ 6.0 GPa and a compression strain of ∼ 25\% during the localized micro-pillar compression tests. The atomic observations reveal that co-deformation cooperative mechanisms include the well-retained dislocation activities in nanograins but crystallization in amorphous grain boundaries, which subsequently lead to the grain coarsening via grain boundary-mediated plasticity. This study sheds light on the development of high-performance high-entropy alloys with novel crystalline-amorphous nanostructures and provides significant insight into their plastic deformation mechanisms.},

Considering LWHEAs composed of five principal elements including light atoms such as Li, Mg and Al, we identify 40 optimal atomic compositions for single-phase solid solutions in body-centered-cubic structure. Combined with DFT calculations, it is demonstrated that the valence electron concentration plays an important role in determining elastic moduli and that the identified LWHEAs are ductile as is evidenced by the satisfied Pugh criteria and positive Cauchy pressure. In cases of shear modulus and yield strength, pd -hybridization between Al and transition metal atoms is shown to make a significant contribution through forming strong directional bonds. Together with an observation that the inclusion of Li and Mg atoms is instrumental in reducing the overall density, the present results provide a valuable guidance to develop novel, low-density high-entropy alloys.},

Fenestrated capillaries are microvessels that have surface pores of 80 to 100 nm in diameter. These capillaries are essential for many organs, such as small intestines, endocrine glands, and kidneys. In this paper, we presented a wet coaxial electrospinning technique for the rapid fabrication of porous microtubes as artificial fenestrated capillaries using polycaprolactone and polyethylene oxide. We characterized the effects of process parameters on the morphological features of these microtubes by regression modeling. Our study shows that the flow rate ratio of the core/sheath solutions and the viscosity of the sheath solution play a significant role in the outside diameter, wall thickness, and hollow area of the microtubes. In addition, the formation of surface pores is dominated by the humidity during the electrospinning. At the same humidity level, the size of the surface pores is positively correlated with the viscosity of the sheath solution and the outside diameter of the microtubes. Overall, this study established the process-property relationship for wet coaxial electrospinning of artificial fenestrated capillaries.},

A cylindrical fibrin scaffold with the desired pattern and dimensions was fabricated by photolithography, thermal reflow, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) casting, and fibrin injection. Vasculogenesis resembling “scaffold-wrapping” was achieved by culturing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on a cylindrical fibrin scaffold until all branches of the scaffold were completely wrapped by HUVECs. The scaffold was encapsulated in the collagen gel followed by plasmin treatment to form a perfusable vascular lumen. The vascular endothelial markers CD31 and VE-cadherin still expressed in the HUVECs after degradation of the fibrin scaffold. The perfusability of the vascular network was also demonstrated by injecting and imaging red fluorescent beads into the networks. This customized capillary network allowed us to control its dimensions down to the micrometer level to mimic tissue-specific microvascular properties.},

However, these NIR-II nanoprobes often encounter high passive accumulation in reticuloendothelial system (RES) organs that attenuates signal to background ratio (SBR), resulting in the impediment of their application for accurate tumor outline delineation. Herein, a hollow-structured CaCO 3 and polydopamine co-packed shell has been co-cladded on the Nd-doped down-shifting nanocrystals (DSNCs@hPCa). After conjugating folic acid molecules on the hollowed surface (DSNCs@hPCa-FA), this fascinating NIR-II contrast nanoagent can further specifically enhance tumor targeting capacity and gratifyingly restrain the NIR-II fluorescence in the “OFF” state. It sensitively responds to the weak acid tumor microenvironment , consequently, the hybrid nanoshell is degraded and the NIR-II fluorescence is efficiently turn “ON”. Robust fluorescent imaging with the augmented SBR has been demonstrated to accurately identify tumor borderlines from normal tissue. Tumors were thoroughly removed under the navigation of this novel pH stimuli-responsive NIR-II fluorescence imaging with ignorable in situ recurrence or metastases after 28 days post-surgery.

  abstract     = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) as emerging phototherapy has attracted extensive attention in cancer therapy. However, the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) and hypoxic conditions of the tumor microenvironment (TME) sevely limit the therapeutic efficiency of PDT. Herein, we design a multifunctional nanoplatform (CBDM) for cancer therapy consisting of photosensitizer (Ce6), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and polydopamine-manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) nanocomplex, which is simultaneously modified by nucleolin-targeting AS1411 aptamer. This MnO 2 -based nanoplatform ameliorates tumor hypoxia and promotes oxygen production via the reaction between MnO 2 and endogenous H 2 O 2 and acid H + in the TME. Besides, this biocompatibility nanoplatform exhibits an augmented PDT effect and high photothermal conversion efficiency under 808 nm laser irradiation . Importantly, the MnO 2 -based nanoplatform achieves a significant in vivo synergistic therapeutic effect and fights against liver metastasis of breast cancer. As a result, the excellent biocompatibility, especially the superior anticancer efficacy, and suppression of tumor metastasis make the MnO 2 -based nanoplatform a promising candidate for cancer therapy.},

The pH-responsive fibers of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) -epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) have been constructed. The fibers were able to swell (pH &gt; 7.4) /shrink (pH &lt; 6.5) reversibly with changes in wound pH, controlling the rate of drug release and thus dynamically modulating the complex inflammatory environment of the wound. At the phase of bacterial infection (pH = 7–9), the polycarboxylic acid groups in the network ionized, and the dynamic hydrogen bond between EGCG and PVA and PAA was broke, triggered an increased release of EGCG (87.4\%). Thereafter, the EGCG cleared excess ROS (greater than80.0\%) from the wound and showed significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus (98\%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (96.7\%), inhibited biofilm formation (74\%). At the proliferative phase, the wound switched to acidic (pH ∼ 6.5). Fibers swelled less and tended to shrink. The release of EGCG was slowed down (45.8\%) to promote macrophage polarization and remodel the wound microenvironment.},

Using unconventional ‘cyclical’ heat treatment profiles, it is possible to achieve a bimodal microstructure as opposed to a more typical lamellar microstructure achieved using conventional heat treatment profiles. In the present research, the effect of cyclical heat treatment parameters (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, number of cycles and cooling regime) on the grain morphology, phase composition and mechanical performance (static and dynamic) has been evaluated.

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is known for versatile fabrication of complex parts, while also allowing the synthesis of materials with desired microstructures and resulting properties. These benefits come at a cost: process control to manufacture parts within given specifications is very challenging due to the relevance of a large number of processing parameters. Efficient predictive machine learning (ML) models trained on small datasets, can minimize this cost. They also allow to assess the quality of the dataset inclusive of uncertainty. This is important in order for additively manufactured parts to meet property specifications not only on average, but also within a given variance or uncertainty. Here, we demonstrate this strategy by developing a heteroscedastic Gaussian process (HGP) model, from a dataset based on laser powder bed fusion of a glass-forming alloy at varying processing parameters. Using amorphicity as the microstructural descriptor, we train the model on our Zr 52.5 Cu 17.9 Ni 14.6 Al 10 Ti 5 (at.\%) alloy dataset. The HGP model not only accurately predicts the mean value of amorphicity, but also provides the respective uncertainty. The quantification of the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty contributions allows to assess intrinsic inaccuracies of the dataset, as well as identify underlying physical phenomena. This HGP model approach enables to systematically improve ML-driven AM processes.},

Notably, printing extreme-size structures is challenging, and the selection of printing parameters was currently highly reliant on repeatable trial-and-error experiments. In this work, a theoretical model for curing depth prediction was established by observing the effect of light intensity. A correction factor n was introduced to optimize the relationship among the critical curing energy, exposure time, and light intensity. Forming experiments verified the accuracy of the proposed theoretical curing depth prediction model, and a correction factor n equal to 0.75 was obtained. Optical rheological characterization experiments and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) supported the quantitative characterization of the DLP printing process while revealing a stepwise transition during photocuring. Finally, a guidance for quick selection of the optimal curing time for 3D structure was obtained and applied to the high-precision microstructure printing process. High-fidelity microneedle arrays with 12 μm details were printed. This method of rapid selection of printing parameters and printing microstructures with high-precision details can potentially be used in the field of 3D bioprinting.},

To allow for high-throughput parameter exploration, an efficient prediction method is necessary. To enhance the prediction quality of the mechanical properties, this paper proposes that the information collected from flying spatter particles, which are dominant in selective laser melting phenomena, can be used as feature values. Flying particles were dynamically observed using pulsed laser illumination and high-speed microscopy. Image treatment was used to detect both powder and droplet spatter, and it was possible to differentiate these two by assessing particle size—63 μm—which enables the quantification of each type. This approach was used at various laser powers and scanning speeds to characterize the single-bead shapes, porosity, and Vickers hardness for each parameter. The correlation between the counted amount of spatter and mechanical properties was investigated using regression analysis. The prediction accuracy of Vickers hardness using the volumetric energy density was observed to improve, with the coefficient of determination increasing from 0.172 to 0.539 when adding the amounts of powder and droplet spatter.},

Despite the progress in all-solid-state batteries, the behavior of densification and coarsening has not yet been investigated on cathode. Herein, we investigated the strategies how to manipulate Li-ion diffusion at the different dimensions of micro- to macro level, facilitating the diffusion as tailoring the multi-scale path from densification to coarsening. First, the influence of microstructure on tortuosity and diffusivity was studied to understand the effect of sintering. Increased sintering time was expected to deteriorate electrochemical properties owing to lower diffusivity, and higher tortuosity. Second, the grain growth and densification behavior were studied in conjunction with the critical temperature for multi-scale tailoring without significant thermal degradation. At longer sintering times, densification was sluggish and had a monotonous increment of 2.5\%/h. However, the grain sizes greatly increased to 8.37 μm, leading isolated pores breaking. Finally, the tailored diffusivity and tortuosity were compared with the calculated results to understand intra- and inter-diffusion. Our finding provides clues to facilitate the diffusion of Li-ion by controlled densification and coarsening behavior in highly densified electrode.},

  abstract     = {Gaining access to the parent microstructural information is of great significance to explore transformation mechanism and mechanical properties. As a powerful route, existing automatic reconstruction techniques still have two unsolved issues for lath martensitic steels. The first one is to reconstruct annealing twin boundaries in prior austenite accurately, avoiding the distorted twin boundaries caused by orientation-shared variants on both sides. As for the second one, i.e. , reconstruction of ultrafine grained prior austenite, no attempt has been succeeded, simply because the number of martensitic variants inside is insufficient for all current algorithms by now. In this paper, two novel approaches are proposed to overcome these difficulties respectively. For the first one, a three-step algorithm combined with parallel computing is developed to implement the basic reconstruction with much higher efficiency, then a physics-based method using phase field simulation is established to resolve the fake twinning morphology. The second one named as Bi-Adjacent-Block method aims at exploring morphologies ( i.e. , size and shape) of the ultrafine prior austenite grains (PAGs) but not intending to determine their orientations. To identify the PAG boundaries with higher accuracy, an approximate analytic determination of orientation relationship by using only two adjacent variants is developed for the first time.},

Crystal structure, particle size, and ionic conductivity are analyzed using a combination of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Dry room annealing increases the presence of impurities in the sample but also increases the Li + ionic conductivity up to 1.03 mS cm −1 . Additional pulsed-field gradient and relaxation time NMR measurements were performed to understand the lithium diffusion in the LIC samples. Two-dimensional diffusion – T 2 relaxation correlation and T 2 relaxation exchange measurements showed that there are multiple unique Li atomic motion sites, which are correlated to different rates of diffusive, micrometer-scale motion.

This affects the kinetics of Fe-Zn interaction during further galvannealing. A key role here belongs to the inhibition layer at the steel/coating interface. Applying mutually-reinforcing TEM techniques, we traced the evolution of Zn-Fe phases in low- and high-Si steels during galvannealing. It has been shown that conventional room temperature Ga FIB for TEM sample preparation is applicable only to annealed low-Si steel, a coating of which comprises equilibrium Zn-Fe compounds. The phases were validated via electron microscopy and diffraction methods. In contrast, even relatively long annealing of the high-Si steel was not sufficient to form stable Zn-Fe phases pointing to a hampering of the interphase reactions. As-galvanized and annealed high-Si specimens contain almost pure Zn and are affected by Ga via a eutectic reaction during FIB preparation. Thus, low-temperature FIB has been applied for reliable Zn-coated steel preparation. We refined with HRTEM the inhibition layer structures specific for low- and high-Si steel grades. While the typical Fe 2 Al 5-x Zn x interface layer has been found in the low-Si samples, for high-Si ones the formation of a quite stable Si-Mn mixed oxide membrane, which drastically hinders Fe-Al reaction, has been disclosed.},

The metal powder composition of the FGM was gradually changed from fully low-carbon steel to austenite steel along the building direction. A convolutional neural network model was employed to classify the austenite, martensite, and ferrite phases in the FGM. The volume fraction of the phases was calculated using X-ray diffraction Rietveld refinement and compared with that predicted by the thermodynamic model and that determined from electron-backscattered-diffraction maps. The volume fraction of the bcc phase gradually increased, and the grain size decreased from top to bottom. Nanostructural investigations confirmed the absence of carbide and twin structures due to the relatively low carbon concentration in the upper layers and the presence of a hexagonal ω-Fe phase with twin structures in the interlayers. Furthermore, electron channeling contrast images and kernel average misorientation maps revealed the activation of the deformation twinning and strain-induced transformation of the retained austenite to martensite, which increased the strain-hardening rate. This study can guide the selection of a tailored manufacturing strategy and process parameters to obtain the required material distribution.},

It was found that the bioactive nanoglass ions (BNGI) with 3 × and 6 × dilution demonstrated the significant anti-inflammation ability (the inhibition of Tnf-α and IL1β ), macrophage polarization function (the decrease of CD86 + cells), antioxidant and angiogenic capacities (the increased node number, branching length and CD31 expression). 1 × diluted BNGI-derived Pluronic F127 and gelatin methacryloyl hydrogels could significantly enhance the MRSA-infected wound healing and attenuate the RA progression through stimulating the secretion of antiinflammation exosomes from macrophage (3-fold upregulation compared with 3M TM dressing) and proper angiogenesis based on the important role of silicon (about 150 mg/L in vivo and 25.4 to 48.1 mg/L in vitro ) in BNGI. Our findings revealed the therapeutic function and potential mechanism of BNGI in inflammatory diseases and tissue engineering.},

  abstract     = {The plasticity of metals involves various complicated phenomena that have not been fully discovered or explained by existing theories. The data-driven method provides a new avenue that is different from the traditional methodology and extends the existing understanding of the constitutive behavior of metals. This study proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) model informed by mechanistic features to discover anisotropic path-dependent plasticity. The proposed framework imposed physical and numerical constraints of the constitutive law on a neural network with good interpretability and reliability. The modified return-mapping algorithm was combined with the ANN using an automatic differential technique, where a sub-fully connected neural network was employed to predict the elastoplastic tangent stiffness to ensure the stability of the plastic flow. Moreover, a yield function constructed using a fully connected neural network was adopted for anisotropic and path-dependent yields. The influence of the number of hidden layers and neurons on the final accuracy was also investigated. A metamaterial representative volume element was created to produce sufficient stress–strain response data for the learning purpose of the neural network. After proper training, the proposed method successfully revealed its hidden anisotropic yield and hardening behavior. A comparison with the traditional yield function was also performed using finite element simulations.},

The results show that the eutectic Si and reinforcing particles distribute in a network configuration in the cast Al–Si–Mg alloy with globular grains. In addition, the distribution of the eutectic Si and reinforcing particles is streamlined along the extrusion direction after hot extrusion. The streamlined distribution of eutectic Si and reinforcing particles is beneficial to the ductility of the alloy, the elongation of which is almost twice that of the Al–Si–Mg alloy with a network configuration that possesses higher strength. The reinforcing phase with a network configuration can better withstand the stress and prevent the deformation of the matrix, thus improving the strength of the alloy. By contrast, the reinforcing phase with a streamlined configuration provides conditions for the plastic deformation of the matrix and hinders the contact of microcracks in the matrix, which increases the elongation of the alloy.},

  abstract     = {The delta (δ) processing strategy is an efficient heat treatment to refine and homogenize the grain microstructure of Inconel 718 superalloy (IN718). However, the microstructure becomes complicated by the effect of pre-precipitated δ phases, due to the coupling of precipitations, high temperature, and loading stress. The present study aims to clarify the effect of δ phases on the microstructure evolution of IN718, especially the promoting effect on deformation twins (DTs) and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) behavior. The results show that the promoting effect of δ phases on the formation of DTs was attributed to the lower stacking fault energy (SFE) caused by the precipitation of δ phases and the local stress concentration caused by the distribution of δ phases. The area fraction of DRX grains in the compressed δ-containing specimen was 21\% higher than that in the compressed δ-free specimen, which was associated with the discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) nucleation stimulated by the single δ phase and the continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) nucleation promoted by the distribution of δ phases. Furthermore, a novel heteroepitaxial recrystallization (HERX) mechanism was found based on inverse precipitation from the undissolved δ phase to γ matrix phase grains with a crystallographic orientation relationship of (0_10)[1 0 2] δ //(__111)[0 1 1] HERX .},

Herein, we propose an eco-friendly strategy by using ns-laser treatment followed by simple hygrothermal treatment (95\%RH @ 80 °C), and this strategy is applicable to facilely preparing superhydrophobicity for various metals. Immediately after ns-laser treatment, ultra-porous nano-fibers composed of amorphous Al-Al 2 O 3 mixture were produced, and rendered aluminum surface superhydrophilic via local capillary forces. Counterintuitively, subsequent hydrothermal treatment accelerated wettability transition to superhydrophobicity, and comparative analysis and theoretical modelling strongly suggest that the mechanism of accelerated transition is deeply dominated by nanostructure transformation. A roughened but compact surface layer of spherical AlOOH nanocrystals was reconstructed to enable water droplet in Wenzel wetting state. Our results shed new insights into the origin of wettability evolution commonly reported at various processing/service stages, and demonstrate a novel method to construct superhydrophobic metallic surfaces.},

The study is focused on simple lattices structures fabricated from Ti5553 using a laser powder bed fusion process (LBPF). Solid and lattice samples are measured to determine RUS estimates for the elastic properties of the bulk material and the effective elastic properties of the lattice structure. The estimated elastic properties are then incorporated into 3d finite element models using a continuum approximation of the physical AM parts. Comparisons show good agreement between the experimentally measured eigen frequencies of the Ti5553 LBPF parts and the eigen frequencies calculated using the continuum approximations based on the effective RUS elastic properties. The current results suggest there is additional physics and geometrical effects that are accounted for in the RUS continuum approximation of the lattice that are not captured in the full 3d finite element model of the parts utilizing only the base material properties.},

The flexural strength and Young’s modulus increased by a maximum of approximately 10\%. The increase was ascribed to crystallisation development during annealing, as confirmed by thermal and morphology characterisations. Hence, this effect was only observed with semi-crystalline materials. On the other hand, all the annealed parts expanded in the thickness direction and shrank in the perpendicular plane. The maximum linear strain reached 20\%, while the volume strain was negligible. These morphology changes after annealing reversed the strain-hardening of the strand and led to inferior strand performance against local tensile deformation. The degradation can outweigh the benefits of crystallinity development. For amorphous parts, the degradation reached approximately 25\% in both the flexural strength and the modulus.},

The results demonstrate a strong linear relationship between the spatial distribution of stress with the property values of interlaminar shear strengths and compressive strengths.

Although various flexible humidity sensors have already been demonstrated, most of them rely on large external power sources to operate, and still suffer from slow response, poor selectivity in environmental stimuli, and expensive and complicated procedures. Here, we realize a self-powered humidity sensor with ultrafast response and recovery time of less than 0.3 s by flexible GO film. Importantly, of all state-of-the-art humidity sensors, this is the fastest response for humidity sensor. Moreover, the sensor has a high sensitivity within a wide range of RH from 33\% to 98\%, and an excellent selective response to humidity under multiple environmental stimuli, due to its moist-induced generator. Theoretical computations reveal that protons generated spontaneously from oxygen-containing groups and water molecules, have a fast diffusion behavior as Grotthuss hopping. In particular, we build four real-time measurement systems capable of respiration monitoring of human, smart leaf surface humidity sensor, and energy harvesting. Our work provides a simple way to fabricate next-generation self-powered sensor using GO film with outstanding humidity sensor performance.},

In a nutshell, UCNPs core are linked with cancer-killing TPP via condensation reaction to form UCNP-TPP, subsequently, UCNP-TPP-GOx is fabricated through glucose oxidase (GOx) decoration on the surface of the UCNP-TPP. Additionally, UCNP-TPP-GOx possesses characteristic photophysical property and it is highly suitable for optical detection. Furthermore, UCNP-TPP-GOx shows excellent selectivity toward glucose after only 3-min coincubation and the limit of detection (LOD) for the glucose is calculated as low as 0.86 μg mL −1 . Moreover, the differentiation between cancer and normal cells through in vitro confocal imaging is achieved due to the large differences of glucose level in them. More importantly, the significant inhibition on carcinoma cell growth is realized by simply switching to the specific excitation wavelength, followed by the generation of toxic singlet oxygen from TPP moiety.

Most importantly, HEC 0.89 exhibited low wear rate (lower than an order of 10 -6 mm 3 /Nm) under vacuum environments from room temperature (RT) to high temperatures. Moreover, the lowest friction coefficient (0.31 ± 0.01) was obtained at 900 °C, which is attributed to the transferring of films consisting of low hardness oxidation products.

During subsequent annealing, these crystallites induced the recrystallized nuclei and {1 1 1} 〈1 1 2〉 nuclei consumed preferentially the adjacent matrixes, generating the γ-fiber recrystallization texture having the main component of {1 1 1} 〈1 1 2〉. With increasing total cold rolling reduction, the γ-fiber recrystallization textures were gradually intensified and band-like grain colonies having approximate r -value and those having variant with ε 23 of same sign became more obvious and their distribution more uneven, the average r -value and ridging resistance exhibited a monotonous upward and downward trend, respectively, and the planar anisotropy of r -value first deteriorated and then improved and reached lowest value at 90\%. Considering acceptable ridging resistance in practical application, the excellent deep drawability can be acquired at the total reduction of 90\%.},

  abstract     = {Severe plastic deformation of commercially pure titanium, leading to ultrafine-grained microstructure, can be used as an alternative to alloying to obtain better mechanical properties without the reduction of biocompatibility and corrosion resistance. However, the strong texture, induced by plastic deformation, results in anisotropy of mechanical properties, understanding of which is crucial to design and model perspective structural parts and devices. In this work, ultrafine-grained grade 2 Ti, obtained by equal channel angular pressing, is investigated. A detailed study of the texture and the elastic anisotropy of the material, heat-treated at several annealing temperatures, is conducted, complemented by ex-situ and indirect in-situ thermal experiments, which shed light on the stability and evolution of microstructure and material properties. The results show that the elastic properties only slightly evolve during annealing in contrast to other properties, such as thermal expansion, internal friction or hardness. The elastic anisotropy is directly linked to the (0001) texture, thus outlining the importance and possibilities of texture-based design and tailoring of mechanical properties.},

Recent findings suggest a great potential for typical plasticizers being used as rejuvenators to recycle oxidized paving asphalts. This study investigated the rejuvenating effectiveness of two plasticizers via rheological evaluation and explored the underlying mechanism by analytical characterizations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A conventional plasticizer dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and an environmentally friendly tributyl citrate (TBC) were selected given the discrepancies in their molecular structures. Both plasticizers were effective in restoring the rheological performance of the aged asphalt; TBC was relatively more efficient which was attributed to its higher molecular polarity and the formation of hydrogen bonds with the oxidized asphalt molecules. Analyses based on the gel permeation chromatography and differential scanning calorimetry suggested the capability of the plasticizers in dissociating the oxidized asphalt molecules and improving the molecular mobility. The improved molecular mobility was considered responsible for the reversing effect of the plasticizers, as compared to aging, in terms of widening the relaxation spectrum and broadening the glass transition region. The plasticizers’ dissociating effect was confirmed and visualized in the simulations by inspecting their impacts on the spatial arrangement and distribution of the asphaltenes.},

Herein, a polyoxometalate-based heterojunction (GdP 5 W 30 @WS 2 ) with shifting or mixed redox states (W 6+ /W 5+ ) is devised to achieve boosted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by near-infrared (NIR) laser-facilitated W 6+ /W 5+ redox cycling for accelerated bacteria-infected wound healing. On the one hand, under the exposure to NIR laser, WS 2 as electron donor could be stimulated to transfer electrons to GdP 5 W 30 , which promotes the reduction from W 6+ to W 5+ active sites on the surface of the GdP 5 W 30 . Consequently, the regenerated W 5+ active sites could catalyze endogenous overexpressed H 2 O 2 to persistently generate ROS, which displays enhanced POD-like catalytic activity for chemodynamic therapy (CDT) by NIR-driven photocatalytic W 6+ /W 5+ redox cycling. Moreover, GdP 5 W 30 @WS 2 also displays favorable glutathione (GSH)-activated photothermal performance by W 6+ -triggered GSH exhaustion for sufficient ROS generation, thereby facilitating the synergistic therapeutic efficiency of photothermal therapy (PTT) and CDT. We expect that the present work will promote the development of the heterojunction with shifting or mixed redox states for biofilm elimination based on NIR-facilitated enzyme-like catalytic activity, which may act as a candidate for BME-activated synergistic therapy.},

Exosomes are reported to have multiple complicated biological functions. It has been shown that M2 macrophages-derived exosomes (M2D-Exo) can influence the course of certain diseases, but their effect on the repair of cartilage defects has not been reported. The aim of this study was to verify whether M2D-Exo could enhance the repair of acellular cartilage extracellular matrix (ACECM) scaffolds. Here, we characterized the ACECM scaffolds and identified the M2D-Exo by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Western blotting (WB), and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). In vitro, the results showed that M2D-Exo could promote the migration, proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). It was also found that M2D-Exo could reduce the expression of proinflammatory factors and promote M2 polarization, which ultimately protected chondrocytes and inhibited chondrocyte apoptosis. In vivo results confirmed that M2D-Exo could promote the repair effect of ACECM scaffolds, promote osteochondral regeneration and regulate the joint cavity inflammatory microenvironment. In conclusion, this study confirms that M2D-Exo can be used as a new therapeutic strategy for osteochondral regenerative repair.},

Our study aimed to fabricate bioactive calcium silicate nanowires reinforced poly (ε-caprolactone) (CS-PCL) composite electrospun fibrous membranes (EFMs) to promote bone regeneration. To prepare CS-PCL composite electrospun fibrous membranes, firstly, hydrothermal treatment was applied to prepare CS nanowires. Secondly, CS were added into PCL solution to fabricate CS-PCL EFMs. The results indicated that the addition of CS into PCL can improve the mechanical properties and hydrophilicity of EFMs. In addition, cell adhesion, proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the expression of osteogenic genes were also improved via FAK/JNK/p38 signaling pathways. Lastly, according to the bone regeneration results in skull defect areas, the bone healing effect was significantly enhanced after the addition of CS nanowires. In conclusion, the fabricated CS-PCL EFMs can be a great candidate for bone regeneration.},

Biological experiments demonstrated that NIR-assisted PL-2 has excellent antibacterial and biofilm ablation activity with good biocompatibility.

Here, we examine the near-surface and grain boundary cavity swelling depth profiles in neutron- and ion-irradiated simple metals (Cu, Ni, and Fe-Cr) and investigate diffusional broadening of implanted Ni ions in Fe-Cr alloys. Vacancy migration energies and radiation-enhanced diffusion were experimentally estimated. Cavity denuded zone widths near planar sinks are shown to be dependent on temperature, damage rate, balance of point defects and sinks, and vacancy migration energies. An enhanced cavity swelling zone adjacent to the void-denuded zone was observed in specimens with low to moderate sink strength and interpreted as evidence of 1D gliding interstitial clusters. Radiation-enhanced diffusional broadening of implanted Ni ions (at 400–550 °C) in Fe and Fe-Cr was up to 250 nm toward the surface, which leads to a much broader near-peak-damage region where cavity swelling is suppressed. Diffusional broadening of implanted ions is calculated to be similarly pronounced for self-ion irradiations, particularly near the peak and higher swelling temperature regimes. Adequately high ion energies (∼8–15 MeV) are recommended for ion-irradiation studies to provide a sufficiently broad midrange safe analysis region with minimized surface and injected ion effects.},

Particles oxidation is known to increase with repeated powder recycling and can be a good indicator of powder degradation. The characterization of powders oxygen content is time-consuming, expensive, and usually carried out ex-situ on non-reusable quantities that are not necessarily representative of the entire feedstock . In this work, a new methodology was developed to measure the oxygen content of powders by in-line scanning of powder bed layers. The method takes advantage of stainless steel particles coloration related to their oxidation level in order to assess their oxygen concentration as a function of Red, Green and Blue channel values of image scans. The calibration procedure once carried out, several recycled powder samples were scanned and analyzed, and the determined powder beds oxygen contents were demonstrated to be in accordance with ex-situ measurements. The results highlight a new opportunity to monitor and evaluate powder degradation in-situ on powder bed layers by image analysis.},

However, nanoscale stretching may cause nanofiller separation, negatively impacting their properties. In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) nanofiller was introduced into a carbon nanofibre/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (CNF/PVDF) nanocomposite system to improve the nanoscale confined-space stretching effect. As a result, the degree of in-film orientation of the CNFs was significantly improved. Based on this effect, boron nitride was used as a 2D dielectric nanofiller to improve the degree of in-plane orientation of CNFs and to prepare 3D nanocomposite films with improved dielectric properties (improved by 54.3\%). Furthermore, 2D conductive nanofiller graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were employed to improve the degree of in-film orientation of CNFs for the preparation of CNF/GNP/PVDF nanocomposite foams with improved electrical conductivity and EMI shielding performance (increased by 89.4\%, from 18.8 to 35.6 dB·g −1 ·cm 3 at 10 GHz).

  abstract     = {Owing to the hierarchical structure, easy multi-functionalization and favorable mechanical properties, wood could harvest electricity from mechanical energy through piezoelectric behavior. In this work, a scalable method to synthesize wood/ZnO composite with multilayered ZnO morphologies is reported for efficient mechanical energy conversion. The synthesis includes charged wood template fabrication, precursor infiltration, and ZnO hydrothermal growth, resulting in controlled ZnO morphologies and distributions while maintaining the hierarchical structure of the wood. Stereo-digital image correlation (stereo-DIC) investigated the relationship between deformation and piezoelectric performance, which revealed the homogeneous distribution of multilayered ZnO enhance piezoelectric performance. The output voltage of wood/ZnO was 1.5 V under periodic mechanical compression (8–10 N) for 300 cycles, while the output current was 2.91 nA. The scalable synthesis strategy and piezoelectric performance are significant for the design of advanced wood nanocomposites for sustainable and efficient energy conversion systems.},

Hence, aiming at the flammability of EP, a new triazine based metal organic framework (R1-MOF) was successfully synthesized by solvothermal method to reduce the fire resistance of EP. The single crystal structure of MOF was determined by X-ray single crystal diffraction, and the regular hexahedral structure of the crystal was determined by scanning electron microscope. The peak heat release rate, smoke generation rate, CO generation and CO 2 generation of EP composite loaded with 9 per 100 parts of matrix resin (phr) of R1-MOFs were decreased by 51.3, 41.5, 45.3, and 39.1\%, respectively, showing high flame retardancy and smoke suppression performance, and significantly reducing the toxicity of EP. It mainly benefited from the flame retardant N element in MOF ligand and the synergistic effect between ligand and metal ions. In this study, a new type of MOF flame retardant was proposed, which provided a new way to design efficient flame retardants, smoke suppressants and detoxification flame retardants.},

In this study, novel microwave-induced capsules on millimeter length scale with responsiveness in water-free environment, consisting of paraffin shell and the supportive skeleton fibers were designed and prepared. The detailed microwave-induced releasing behaviors, together with the morphology, loading capacity of capsules were systematically investigated. Non-instantaneous releasing behavior consisted of microwave heating, shell melting and core releasing was observed, and was supported by numerical simulations. The key role of paraffin shell with different thickness was confirmed in the kinetics of releasing.

The starting materials were cheap, and the new strategy for fabrication of self-biodegradable poly(aspartic acid) based hydrogel was facile, efficient, mild and environmentally friendly, which is consistent with the concept of green chemistry. The hydrogel possesses the comprehensive merits of injectability, self-biodegradability, shape-adaptability, transparence, biocompatibility, and adhesion, and shows specific autolytic biodegradation. The hydrogel was generated by in-situ gelation of poly(aspartic acid) (PASP) and poly(aspartyl hydrazide) (PAHy) polymers based on dual chemical (amide bond) and physical (hydrogen bond and ionic bond) crosslinks. The acceleration of wound healing could be observed in a rat skin full-thickness wound model for repairing skin tissue defects via hydrogel injection and autolytic biodegradation, highlighting great potential applications in wound dressing for the irregular dermal lesions without secondary skin damage. The injectable and self-biodegradable hydrogel augments formation of blood vessels and mature granulation tissue, thus enabling faster skin tissue restoration outcomes.},

However, in the past six years, very few or no systematic and complete reviews have been conducted in this research domain. This review intends to comprehensively summarize MMAM systems and the working principles of its fundamental processes. Herein, the Multi-material combinations and their design, modeling, and analysis strategies have been reviewed systematically. In particular, the focus is on applications and opportunities for using MMAM for several industries and postprocessing MMAM fabricated parts. Furthermore, this review identified the limitations and challenges of existing software packages, MMAM processes, materials, and joining mechanisms, especially at the multi-material interfaces.

Motivated by this, the study designs a novel piezoelectrically actuated (PA) cutting system for fabricating this kind of micro/nanostructure array. First, the mechanical structure of the PA cutting system is designed based on the circular flexure hinge. Then, a finite element model is established to analyze its resonant frequencies and mode shapes. Next, to determine the working performances of the PA cutting system, a performance test platform is built. Finally, various micro/nanostructure arrays with two features of the high-aspect-ratio and the multilayer are fabricated, demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility of the PA cutting system. Besides, the function of machined micro/nanostructure arrays about the corrosion property was investigated. This study provides a new approach for fabricating high-aspect-ratio and hierarchical micro/nanostructure arrays, which can be applied in industrial manufacturing and corrosion protection fields.},

The test results showed that the porous CaCO 3 microspheres possessed higher specific surface areas and porosities, and the weight ratio of the rejuvenator loaded on the CaCO 3 microspheres was up to15\%. Frequency sweep test results showed that the complex modulus of the asphalt binder added with rejuvenator-loaded CaCO 3 microspheres decreased after aging. When the content of the CaCO 3 microspheres added in asphalt binder reached 70\%, the complex modulus is even less than that of neat asphalt. Additionally, the slow-release mechanism of the CaCO 3 microspheres loaded with rejuvenator was studied based on molecular dynamics simulations. The simulation results also showed that the composition and structure of the molecule played an important role in the diffusion ability.

  abstract     = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have gained increasing attention from the industrial and scientific communities due to their extraordinary thermo-physical properties. Introducing the laser additive manufacturing (LAM) technique as a viable fabrication process of HEAs provides many advantages over traditional methods. One of the main challenges facing widespread industrial utilization of LAM is the limited ability to monitor and predict various types of defects during the printing process. Several operando (in-situ) monitoring techniques have been developed to detect failure when printing commonly used LAM alloys, such as stainless steel, titanium, and nickel alloys. The adaptability and effectiveness of these techniques to LAM of HEAs have neither been reviewed nor established. In this work, we highlight the unique properties of HEAs, discuss current traditional fabrication methods of HEAs, and present recent advances in LAM of HEAs and the advantages over traditional techniques. In addition, we present a comprehensive review of the current in-situ monitoring techniques applied in LAM for commonly used alloys, followed by a critical assessment of the adaptability of these techniques to the LAM of HEAs. Since HEAs are composed of multiple constituents in varying proportions with a variable size distribution, morphology, and melting temperature, the heat distribution at the laser-material regime fluctuates, resulting in a complex thermal gradient with a non-uniform melt pool morphology and the generation of corresponding defects. Existing in-situ techniques are not explicitly designed to handle such a complex thermal distribution, and their effectiveness can be compromised. Therefore, conducting this critical review and assessment is urgently needed. Besides, a novel in-situ monitoring technique design has been proposed based on the difficulties identified during literature analysis.},

This material is characterised by high strength and good ductility. In this study, we analysed the fatigue performance of HS materials by modifying our previous multiscale model to extend its applicability from only homogeneous materials to HS materials. A novel method was proposed to characterise the microstructural features of HS materials considering the distributions of CG and UFG. A microstructure model was developed to reproduce grain maps using these characterised microstructures. The multiscale model was successfully validated by experimental results for two types of austenitic stainless steels. The model was used to elucidate the governing microstructural factors of fatigue performance in HS materials through systematic simulations. Consequently, a higher UFG area fraction was confirmed to improve fatigue life, and a UFG area fraction of approximately 40\% is suggested for optimal microstructural design to balance fatigue performance and fabricating costs. This study presents the first step in the qualitative design of the fatigue performance of HS materials to replace the expensive and inefficient experimental analyses used in previous studies.},

Ti 3 C 2 nanosheets with high photothermal conversion efficiency were considered as a promising therapeutic nanoplatform for tumor therapy. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a common anti-tumor drug. Herein, a novel DOX/Ti 3 C 2 /Apt-M therapeutic nanoplatform was successfully fabricated, which could specifically target MCF-7 tumor cells.

Encouragingly, the MCF-7 cell viability of DOX/Ti 3 C 2 /Apt-M with laser irradiation was only 26.9\%. The tumor surface temperature of MCF-7 xenograft mice in the DOX/Ti 3 C 2 /Apt-M + Laser group rose to about 58.3 °C, which was significantly higher than other laser irradiation groups.

Interestingly, Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) is a procoagulant and has anti-inflammatory properties to promote wound healing, which has great research value for scarless wound healing. Herein, we developed a transdermal drug delivery system of BSP/chitosan (CS) composite bilayer dissolvable microneedles (CS-AS-BSP MNs) containing asiaticoside (AS) based on a centrifugation method with a polydimethylsiloxane mould that fulfilled the requirements of wound healing and achieved a scar-free effect. The drug release results showed that this system improved the solubility of AS and maintained the stable release of the drug for a long time. Further experiments indicated that CS-AS-BSP MNs had a good antibacterial effect and reduced the proliferation of human scar fibroblasts. The wound healing effect of CS-AS-BSP MNs was evaluated in an experimental full-thickness-wound rat model, which demonstrated that the covered wound healed completely without scars within 3 weeks. Furthermore, CS-AS-BSP MNs downregulated TGF-β1 and COL Ⅰ, which are fibrosis-related genes, to inhibit scarring. In brief, this study provides a new strategy for meeting the clinical requirements of effective scarless wound dressings.},

Enamel matrix proteins (EMPs) are believed to play a key role in amelogenesis to regulate the growth and organization of enamel. Three “key events” of amelogenesis indicated the co-assembly of EMPs composed of amyloid amelogenin (templating protein) and non-amelogenin (non-templating protein) with amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), followed by the transformation into the crystalline phase with the help of proteolytic enzymes. Herein, a biomimetic microenvironment is constructed, adhesive phase-transited lysozyme fibrils (PTL fibrils) mimicking amelogenin template through amyloid-like lysozyme aggregation, acid carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) mimicking non-amelogenin and proteolytic enzymes, respectively. Based on the synchronous self-assembly and mineralization, the full process of the three “key events” of biomineralization were reverted in vitro by slowly raising the pH of the system through dialysis, in-situ regenerating enamel-like crystals with properly oriented structure and mechanical properties that are close to natural enamel independent of additional mineral ions. Especially, the present study proposed the crucial role of the amyloid conformation transition of amelogenin and supported a promising biomimetic strategy for enamel repair.},

  abstract     = {CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods (DRs) tailored by chiral biomolecules are promising candidates for biological theranostics. The authors of this study synthesised chiral CdSe/CdS DRs with different sizes using the post-ligand-exchange method. Their high-resolution imaging and cytotoxicity performances were investigated, respectively. The results suggested that the chiral cysteine coverage strategy could significantly enhance the biocompatibility of CdSe/CdS DRs in bioimaging and bioimaging-guided therapies. Numerous photodynamic and chemodynamic therapy studies for brain glioma cells demonstrated enantioselective efficacy, wherein chiral DRs could exhibit improved oxygen species and hydroxyl radical generations under corresponding circularly polarised light radiation. d -DRs with right-handed circularly polarised light activation could generally present 3.14/1.5 times higher efficacy than left-handed or linearly polarised light irradiated samples. Wound-healing assay/migration and invasion assays asserted that the applications of chiral DRs could suppress the infiltrative growth and metastasis of glioma cells by reducing the migration and invasion ability by nearly 50\%. In vivo experiments also confirmed that d -DRs exerted more substantial enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects in the tumour tissue, leading to better bioimaging ability and efficient tumour ablation. Such adjuvant approaches would be a viable alternative to cancer treatments with a high possibility of recurrence and poor prognosis.},

In electrospun fibers, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and cellulose acetate were used as a polymer matrix and ketoprofen was used as a model drug. Morphologies and inner structures were respectively investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Physical states and compatibilities of materials were detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Water contact angle (WCA) tests were conducted to determine the difference between wettability and wetting time among assorted fiber membranes. Results showed that the wettability gradient could drive water movement and wetting, which resulted in the rapid decrease of the WCA, to prepare Janus and chimeric Janus fiber membranes compared with uniaxial fiber membranes. Otherwise, in vitro drug release experiments were carried out and four fitting models were applied in matching release profiles. The results showed that electrospun fiber membranes belonged to sustained-release systems and such membranes were influenced by drug diffusion and backbone corrosion effects. In this study, whether electrospun multilayer Janus fibers could affect wettability and drug release was investigated.},

After optimizing the machining parameters, the length dimension error of the double curved conical ribbon micro-helical robot could be further reduced to less than 1\%. Furthermore, a conical rotating three-dimensional uniform magnetic field was established to drive the microrobots.

It is proved that the micro-helical robot driven by the conical rotating three-dimensional uniform magnetic field can achieve high stability and no swing swimming in the low-frequency spiral propulsion state.

  abstract     = {A radar absorbing material named waffle structured composite (WSC) was proposed based on the periodic structure element formed by one-step double-sided knitting process with the advantage of continuous manufacture. The unique waffle structured pattern shaped by the knitted loops achieved the integration of structure and function. By realizing the collaborative mechanisms of absorption and scattering, the radar cross section (RCS) below −10 dB was achieved in the range of 6–8 GHz and 12–18 GHz towards the wale and course directions, respectively, and RCS reduction peak reaches to −30 dB. Through the S-parameter analysis and electromagnetic simulation, it can be revealed that the low-frequency RCS reduction in the wale direction was mainly dominated by the absorption mechanism, and the high-frequency RCS reduction in the course direction was led by the scattering mechanism. Furthermore, to further explore the scattering and absorption mechanism, phase difference, dielectric loss and magnetic loss were investigated in details. It was verified that the absorption of WSC is mainly originated from dielectric loss with slight magnetic loss, and Debye relaxation plays the important role in dielectric loss. The WSC proposed in this paper is equipped with characteristics of good RCS reduction and continuous large-scale manufacture, which is promising in practical engineering application of radar stealth.},

  abstract     = {Structures with adaptive stiffness characteristics present an opportunity to meet competing design requirements, thus achieving greater efficiency by the reconfiguration of their topology. Here, the potential of using changes in the topology of planar lattice structures is explored to achieve this desired adaptivity and observe that lattice structures with rectangle-like unit-cells may undergo elastic buckling or bending of cell walls when subject to longitudinal compression. Under sufficient load intensity, cell walls can deform and contact neighbouring cells. This self-contact is harnessed to change the topology of the structure to that of a kagome-like lattice, thereby establishing new load paths, thus enabling enhancement, in a tailored manner, of the effective compressive and shear stiffness of the lattice. Whilst this phenomenon is independent of characteristic length scale, we focus on macroscopic behaviour (lattices of scale ≈ ≈ 200 mm). Experimentally observed responses of 3D-printed lattices correlate excellently with finite element analysis and analytical stiffness predictions for pre- and post-contact topologies. The role of key geometric and stiffness parameters in critical regions of the design space is explored through a parametric study. The non-linear responses demonstrated by this topology morphing lattice structure may offer designers a new route to tailor elastic characteristics.},

Functional materials such as shape memory polymers (SMPs) open a promisingly emerging venue for improving the performance of chiral metamaterials from the material perspective. Here, the graphene-reinforced shape memorable chiral metamaterials (GR-SMCM) with self-adaptive thermomechanical response under thermal excitations are reported. Theoretical models are developed to consider the chiral metamaterials designed in the planar and tubular structures using the graphene-reinforced SMPs (GR-SMPs). The modified phase evolution-based constitutive model is expanded for the material influence of GR-SMPs, and the chiral compatibility is analyzed to examinate the structural influence of chiral metamaterials. Experiments and numerical simulations are conducted to validate the proposed theoretical models and great agreements are obtained. Parametric studies are carried out to investigate the tunability of the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, rotation angle of the hexagonal cells and temperature sensitivity. The reported GR-SMCM provide an efficacious approach to obtain self-adaptive performance with excellent controllability, which can be used to design advanced thermomechanical devices such as temperature sensing devices.},

By applying ramp heating and 400 °C isothermal aging, a significant dispersion-strengthening effect through the formation of various types of dispersoids was achieved. Detailed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed the precipitation behaviors of nanoscale Mn-rich dispersoids and Al 3 Zr nanoparticles during heat treatments. As a result, an increment of 48 MPa in yield strength was obtained compared with the reference 5182 alloy. Meanwhile, the modified alloy shows a good heat resistance at 400 °C with little loss of yield strength until 200 h of heating. This has been attributed to the further precipitation of Al 3 Zr particles which counteracts the coarsening of Mn-rich dispersoids. Moreover, the addition of peritectic element Cr was found to significantly promote the precipitation of Al 6 (Mn,Fe,Cr) in dendritic center regions, thus improving their global distribution across dendrite arms. The presence of dense dispersoids can also improve the recrystallization resistance of the deformed alloy during annealing, thus retaining the deformation fiber structure and significantly retarding the recrystallization behavior. This research demonstrates an effective strategy to develop high-performance 5xxx series alloys strengthened via dispersoids.},

  abstract     = {Solid solution phases dominate the thermodynamic competition with intermetallic phases in high-entropy alloys (HEAs), known as the high-entropy effect. However, owing to inevitable local substitutions in multi-component intermetallics (MCIMs), imposed thermodynamic changes are often overlooked. This study investigated a partially disordered MCIM, C 14 C14 Laves phase, in a dual-phase CrHfNbTaTi refractory HEA. The chemical formula and site preferences were determined based on the observation of spatial atomic arrangement. Furthermore, a parameter k dis kdis was proposed to describe the disorder degree of MCIMs. As k dis kdis increased from 0 to 0.2 due to local substitutions, the formation enthalpy of the C 14 C14 Laves phase significantly increased, resulting in higher energy and lower stability. Therefore, when feasible composition regulation and site occupancy design are adopted to manipulate the k dis kdis of the potential MCIM, the high-entropy solid solution is able to be superior to the MCIM even at intermediate temperatures. The study provides insights into the high-entropy effect by considering MCIM enthalpies, providing a valuable phase-regulation strategy for future design of HEAs.},

The microstructure of Zr-containing alloy was remarkably refined and accompanied by high dislocation density, which was associated with the resistance of recrystallization by the introduction of Zr-rich IMCs. The Invar alloy displayed a sufficiently low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in the temperature interval of 20 °C ∼ 100 °C and 20 °C ∼ 200 °C after Zr treatment, with a CTE constant of 0.66 × 10 -6 /°C and 2.07 × 10 -6 /°C, respectively. The existence of residual stress and refinement of grain were responsible for an obvious decrease in CTE. Meanwhile, the yield strength increased from 256 MPa to 401 MPa after Zr treatment.

Many literatures reported that Mg alloy surface with DCPD coating served as a barrier against the corrosion environment. However, the corrosion rate increased due to the surface coating destroyed. In this article we investigated the corrosion behavior in inter-granular powder boundary with Ca-P coating which fabricated with the DCPD-coated Mg-Zn-Ca powder using sequential hot pressing. Corrosion behavior was evaluated with hydrogen release, immersion test in DI water and liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Liquid cell TEM was used to observe the time-dependent composition and crystalline changes in immersion test.

The experimental results show distinct energy absorption mechanism and effectiveness of the design which are subsequently used to validate the finite element simulation.

This work presents comprehensive research on the mechanical performance of fused filament fabricated three-dimensional lightweight cellular solids, including open-cell and closed-cell lattice designs and triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), with different cell sizes and infill densities. The aim of this work is to determine the range and limits of the achievable mechanical behavior by employing different cell designs made from a single material and manufacturing technique. Experimental results obtained with cell designs fabricated with a high-performance polymer (PEI Ultem) showed wide ranges of effective stiffnesses from 1 to 293 MPa, strengths from 0.1 to 18.1 MPa, and densities from 0.066 to 0.541 g/cm 3 . Furthermore, two validated numerical approaches are provided to simulate their mechanical performance accurately. Moreover, a novel and robust index to quantify the isotropy of additively manufactured cellular solids based on the graphical representation of the homogenized stiffness tensor is proposed.

  abstract     = {Tungsten carbide reinforced amorphous carbon (WC/a-C) films exhibit significantly lower coefficient of friction (COF) than typical a-C films in the atmospheric environment; thus, they are promising candidates for use as solid lubricants. However, the low friction mechanism of WC/a-C films remains poorly understood. Here, we revealed that the friction-induced formation of WO 3 -rich transfer film changed the real sliding interface between the initial friction pair materials into an interface between a WO 3 -rich transfer film and carbon-rich worn film surface (WO 3 /C interface). First-principles calculations indicated that the WO 3 /C interface showed weaker interactions than the C/C interface of the a-C film under the same conditions, particularly when the dangling carbon bonds at the sliding interface were not completely passivated. This resulted in a reduced COF of the WO 3 /C interface. Thus, friction-induced reconstruction of the sliding interface to an intrinsically weak-interacting interface is proposed as a new path to further improve the tribological performance of a-C-based films.},

Strain reversible behavior of martensitically transforming shape memory alloys (SMA) is additionally characterized by cyclic stress–strain and strain-temperature curves limited to temperatures and stresses, at which the recorded strain responses are reversible in closed loop cycles. In this work focussing coupled martensitic transformation and plastic deformation of NiTi, we deformed nanocrystalline NiTi SMA wire in isothermal and isostress tensile tests beyond the temperature and stress limits stemming from the requirement on the strain reversibility in closed loop cyclic tests. Stress–strain-temperature responses of NiTi wire in such tests were recorded and analysed. To detect and characterize deformation mechanisms activated in performed thermomechanical loads, electric resistance and dynamic elastic modulus of the wire were evaluated in-situ during tensile tests. Martensite variant microstructures and lattice defects in austenite evolving upon heating deformed NiTi wire under 750 MPa stress were analyzed by post mortem transmission electron microscopy. Stress-temperature diagram showing critical stress–temperature conditions for activation of 5 different deformation/transformation processes in thermomechanically loaded NiTi was constructed from the results of isothermal and isostress tests and the recorded stress–strain-temperature responses were discussed based on this diagram},

A high diffusible hydrogen content is recognized as one of the critical reasons behind the reduction in the reliability of underwater wet welded joints. In this study, the entry route of hydrogen during underwater wet flux-cored arc welding of 304 stainless steel at a depth of 0.5 m was first confirmed experimentally using an in-situ X-ray imaging system. The hydrogen charging was deemed to dominantly occur when pendant droplets were formed due to the extremely high temperature of molten metal and the absence of slag coverage. This resulted in 13.51 mL/100 g of diffusible hydrogen remaining in the droplet and 9.42 mL/100 g in the deposited metal. To prevent hydrogen charging, an unprecedented molten-slag-covering droplet transfer mode was developed by reducing the CaF 2 content and maintaining the CaF 2 /TiO 2 to an appropriate ratio in the flux, through which the molten slag spontaneously covered the droplet, electric arc and molten pool completely during the entire welding process and the entry of hydrogen was successfully blocked and the diffusible hydrogen content was reduced to the same level as that achieved via onshore welding (3.26 mL/100 g).},

Herein, we propose the first model for quantitatively predicting the influence of 3D polycrystalline morphology on Coble creep deformation. This model was developed using a representative volume element (RVE). Two grain growth mechanisms, namely, grain boundary migration and grain boundary diffusion, were formulated considering the 3D data structure of a polycrystal and then superposed to simulate RVE deformation. The model was validated by comparison with the theoretical solution for Coble creep deformation under uniaxial loading conditions. The proposed model accurately reproduced the influences of grain size, applied stress, and temperature, thus demonstrating its validity. In addition, the influence of polycrystalline morphology was investigated by performing systematic numerical simulations. The model directly provided quantitative predictions of the performance of materials with arbitrary polycrystalline morphologies under any loading or temperature condition. Consequently, the proposed RVE model has the potential to serve as a basis for designing novel materials with resistance against high-temperature creep.},

While the alloy is relatively soft and formable in the solution heat treated and quenched state (W temper), rapid onset of natural ageing increases hardness and decreases ductility within few hours, creating a logistical challenge for the fabrication of frames by roll forming and bending, or other sheet metal forming operations. Here we investigate pre-ageing heat treatments of AA2024 with the aim of creating more stable and formable material conditions. The progression of materials properties after heat treatment is compared to natural ageing by extensive tensile test time series. An inhibition of secondary natural ageing by pre-ageing is demonstrated and a possible microstructural explanation is presented based on transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry: S-phase is present in the pre-aged temper, and we suggest that the formation of Mg/Cu-clusters is suppressed. Formability is assessed by forming limit curves and finite element simulation of three-roll-push bending of frame profiles. We found improved processability of the pre-aged temper compared to a one week naturally aged condition: The forming limits are increased, and wrinkling in the bending simulations is reduced.},

Through the trained random-forest regression models, the Quantitative Maps were constructed, and the dynamic compression strength σ D , critical fracture strain ε f , as well as impact absorption energy E D , were effectively predicted, with the accuracy rates all over 86.11\%. Accordingly, the zone of excellent dynamic performance and corresponding quasi-static tensile properties in Maps can be rapidly screened. Furthermore, combined with microstructure observation, it was found that nano-scale acicular secondary α-phase significantly increased σ D , micro-scale secondary α-phase resulted in excellent dynamic strength and plasticity, while the equiaxed, bimodal and mixture microstructure without secondary α-phase corresponded to the high value of ε f . Meanwhile, both nano-scale and micro-scale secondary α-phase contributed to the high value of E D . Finally, the generalization capabilities of models were validated. By comparing predicted values with experimental values, it was found the models realized the relatively accurate prediction of dynamic compression performance on other titanium alloys.},

Nanoindentation and micropillar compression experiments highlight a constrained plasticity of Al nanolayers, which endows Ni/Al nanolaminates with a strain hardened behavior. Plasticity of Ni/Al nanolaminate begins with yielding of Al, and the Al yield strength depends on the individual layer thickness. Based on an inverse methodology, the Al yield strength as a function of Al grain size is determined. The results evidence a significant strengthening in the Al nanolayers. Specially, when Al layer thickness decreases from ≈110 nm to ≈16 nm, its yield strength is increased for ≈68\%, from ≈0.69 GPa to ≈1.16 GPa. The strengthening rule follows a confined layer slip model that is developed based on confining of single dislocation loops in nanolayers. Both the dislocation strengthening and the constraint effects in the Al layers contribute to a more sensitivity of Ni/Al strength with the variation of Al layer thickness, instead of Ni layer thickness. The work may forward the fundamental understanding in the strengthening mechanism and mechanical behavior of metallic nanolaminates with large elastoplastic mismatch.},

The indirect cavitation erosion tests (ASTM G32–10 standard) were fulfilled at a frequency of 20 kHz in deionized water which was maintained at room temperature and ambient pressure for a predetermined time. The results show significant decrease in the mass loss for all samples that had underg1 AMF treatment. The eroded samples were characterised by means of scanning electron microscopy, while microhardness measurements showed an increase in the surface hardness as a result of the AFM treatment. The results of X-ray diffraction indicated formation of more compressive residual stresses following treatment, while examination by transmission electron microscopy showed evidence of dislocation movement away from grain boundaries. In the case of the NAB and 20014-T6 alloys, there was evidence of new precipitation.

In metastable austenitic stainless steels, a phase transformation from the austenitic to the martensitic phase can occur even at room temperature. In this work, machine hammer peening (MHP) is used to selectively introduce the activation energy required for martensite formation on discrete areas of the surface. The phase transformation is confirmed by electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) and micrographs. A correlation between the energy input by MHP, magnetic properties, and surface hardness is established. Using this approach, characterization of the surface integrity by measuring magnetic properties can be achieved. In addition, a novel solution to code and encode information with high information density onto metastable austenitic materials is proposed.},

The dynamic angle of repose decreased and bulk powder density increased compared to the uncoated state from 49 ° and 4.67 g/cm 3 to 29 ° and 4.81 g/cm 3 with dry-coating of TiN, respectively. UV/Vis spectroscopy showed negligible alterations by TiN additions on the powder light absorption. The powder modifications strongly affected their corresponding processability in L-PBF and reduced the melt pool signatures of the in situ detected confocal single-color pyrometer signal as well as ex situ measured melt pool depth and width. With increasing flowability, a significant decrease in thermal emission and melt pool size was observed. The results demonstrate the impact of powder flowability and bulk powder density on the quality of L-PBF parts when particle interactions are actively modified.},

  abstract     = {Design and process optimization are key aspects of manufacturing engineering. This contribution details a machine learning (ML) methodology capable of learning from simulation results, experimental data, or sensor signals, and able to predict and optimize specific user-defined process and design parameters. The prediction-optimization algorithm is based on an enhanced Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm, highly responsive and accurate even for large datasets and complex variable interactions. Once the XGB function is trained, the optimization is carried out by a metaheuristic search algorithm defined according to the Differential Evolution (DE) architecture, allowing for the definition of the combination of independent variables that grant the minimization, or maximization, of the user’s defined objective function. The prediction and optimization capabilities have been assessed by applying the XGB-DE algorithm to a previously published authors&#39; dataset and experimental results relevant for the radial-axial ring rolling (RARR) process, showing a prediction accuracy and optimization capability equal to 2.33\% and 27.4\%, respectively, with respect to authors’ previous finite element and experimental results. The XGB-DE methodology showed a remarkable capability in catching the trend and global minimum of a multi-variable and complex objective function, such as the one involved in complex thermo-mechanical forming processes.},

  abstract     = {Silicon is regarded as one of the most promising anode candidates for next-generation Li-ion batteries because of its high theoretical capacity (4200 mAh g −1 ). However, the main challenge for the practical application of Si anodes is the huge volume change during (de)alloying with lithium, which leads to the pulverization of the active material and severe loss of electrical contact after cycling. Here, we develop hollow porous silicon nanospheres with three-dimensional carbon coating and SiC transition interlayer (C@SiC@Si@SiC@C) via a simple and straightforward polymer-directed strategy in order to tackle the challenges met with Si anodes. The accordingly synthesized C@SiC@Si@SiC@C anode shows high utilization of the active substance, high measured capacity (3200 mAh g −1 ) with almost 100\% Coulombic efficiency and stable cycling performance (0.7‰ per cycle decay rate at 0.2C). Such superior performances are related to the uniquely designed structure. Firstly, the 3D carbon coating provides high electronic conductivity, and extremely small size of silicon shortens the diffusion distance for Li ions and electrons. Secondly, the stable cyclability originates from the nanoscale silicon particles reinforced by a SiC transition interlayer which effectively prevents fracture and provides robust outer layers, respectively.},

In this paper, a comprehensive theory has been constructed for quantitatively analyzing the electromechanical properties involving coupled torsional rotation and linear deformation of the close packed and non-close packed electrically conductive helices with the aid of the concept of Cosserat curve. The distributed force in our model can be used to describe the resultant electromagnetic force and the internal pressure on the current carrying helices, which agree well with the experimental results. It is revealed that if the designers intend to realize the mechanical actuation of coupled rotational inversion and large axial contraction, they can choose the close packed conductive micro-/nano-helices; while if they want the much larger torsional stroke of unwinding during the contraction process, the non-close packed ones will be a good choice. The currents make both kinds of helices stronger, and decreasing helix angle is an additional option for the non-close packed ones. The present study supplies a reliable theoretical reference for further experimental research on the applications of conductive helices in micro-/nanoelectromechanical systems.},

  abstract     = {Numerical modelling is an effective tool to investigate the rapid temperature cycling in laser powder bed fusion. However, the high computational cost limits the modelling of part-scale components due to the significantly different scales between the highly local energy input region and the global field response region. This study presents a macroscale finite element thermal simulation strategy with a track-scale resolution by combining the recently developed characteristic time-based heat input (CTI) model with a currently proposed adaptive mesh re-mapping method. Due to the uniformly distributed power density along the scan direction in the CTI model, the optimized mesh strategy allows one element to capture the temperature solutions over the majority of a scan track except at the two ends. The adaptive mesh re-mapping method is used to map simulated results from a previous scan track model to a current scan track model with a new mesh configuration. This strategy has been implemented for a Ti-6Al-4V part with the dimensions of 20 × 40 × 3 m m 3 . The predicted temperature histories agree well with the in-situ measurements at the points in both the printed part and powder bed. Three case studies demonstrate that our strategy can improve computational efficiency between 6 and 30 times.},

  abstract     = {The influences of pre-rolling deformation (0–20\%) on the creep behavior, mechanical properties, corrosion behavior, and microstructures of solid solution AA2050 alloys were investigated during creep aging. The results show that the pre-rolling induced a large number of dislocations, which decreased the primary creep rate but increased the steady creep rate. As the pre-rolling strain increased from 0\% to 20\%, the peak-aged time of creep-aged alloys decreased from 40 h to 16 h, improving both yield strength (YS, from 474 MPa to 554 MPa) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS, from 522 MPa to 590 MPa). The elongation (EL) decreased from 11.2\% to 7.8\%. The strength enhancement originated from inhibited oriented precipitation effect, dislocation density increment, and dense T 1 phases precipitation. Meanwhile, the area fraction of corrosion pits (f pits ), intergranular corrosion (IGC) depth and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) susceptibility index (I SSRT ) decreased from 7.13\%, 176 μm, and 6.1\% to 5.11\%, 33 μm, and 1.5\%, respectively. The increased resistances of pitting corrosion/IGC/SCC were attributed to the coarsening and Cu enrichment of grain boundary precipitates (GBPs), the formation of precipitation-free zones (PFZs) and low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), and the precipitation of T 1 phases along dispersoids.},

As the crystallinity of cellulose increases, the restriction from crystallinity on nanoparticles increases, leading to homogeneous distribution, a decrease in size, and structural changes of TiO 2 from crystalline to amorphous. The carboxyl groups grafted on the periodically arranged hydroxyl groups of crystalline cellulose, which act as anchor sites for metal oxide precursor, restrict the distribution, growth and crystallization of TiO 2 nanoparticles. The amorphous TiO 2 nanoparticles on the cellulose with the highest degree of crystallinity (72.40\%) give the highest adsorption capacity toward tetracycline hydrochloride (152.89 mg/g), which is the state of art among the supported TiO 2 . The high adsorption capacity is proposed to be the oxygen defects caused by the Ti 3+ species, originating from the amorphous TiO 2 nanoparticles.},

The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method is performed to detect the molecular-level diffusion characteristics of rejuvenators and predict their diffusion coefficient (D) parameters. At an atomic scale, the mutual but partial interfacial diffusion feature between rejuvenators and aged bitumen molecules is observed. Moreover, Fick&#39;s Second Law well fits the concentration distribution of rejuvenator molecules in aged bitumen. The magnitude for D values of four rejuvenators varies from 10 -11 to 10 -10 m 2 /s, and the diffusive capacity order is BO &gt; EO &gt; NO &gt; AO. Meanwhile, diffusion tests and dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) characterizations are employed to validate the MD simulation outputs. The experimental results in magnitude and order of D values agree well with MD simulation outputs. Lastly, the increased aging degree of bitumen exhibits a negative impact on the molecular diffusivity of BO, EO, and NO rejuvenators, while the D value of AO molecules enlarges as the aging level deepens. The underlying mechanism may be composed of the free volume fraction in aged bitumen and the intermolecular force between rejuvenator and aged bitumen molecules, which differs remarkably for various rejuvenators.},

Due to its facile implementation, solvent-free process, and high tunability, functionalized MEW-enabled 3D structured materials are widely used to mimic the extracellular matrix, thereby providing a provisional structure for 3D tissue culture. This review firstly describes the state-of-art material design strategies that leverage the unique versatility of MEW to attribute 3D structured materials with tailored fiber diameter , macro-geometry, and micropattern, which is enabled by tuning different process parameters, customizing the collector shape, and designing the programmed toolpath, respectively. Secondly, advances in improving the quality of the MEW-enabled 3D structured materials, including the fiber uniformity and fiber placement accuracy, are comprehensively summarized. The common thread weaving through these advances is the observation that optimizing printing stability requires a synergistic tuning of various design and process parameters. To accomplish this, recent efforts have been made to quantify the fluctuation of the Taylor Cone , jet lag, and fiber diameter to clarify their correlations. The deterioration of fiber placement accuracy represented by the different fiber deviation modes is also systematically reviewed herein. Lastly, the unresolved challenges and prospective outlook in these aspects are also articulated.},

Deformation processes related to martensitic transformation and plastic deformation were characterized by temperature resolved stress–strain responses, deformation work, released heat, volume fraction of martensite. Deformation-induced microstructure changes were analyzed post-mortem using Electron Backscatter Diffraction and x-ray diffraction. Except the least recovered microstructure, the samples did not follow linear temperature trends according to Clausius-Clapeyron. With increasing temperature, the plateau stress of localized martensitic transformation stabilized at a constant stress while volume fraction of martensite decreased down to zero. Localized strains induced by martensitic transformation and ductility evolved non-monotonously with temperature, reaching maxima at temperatures that decreased with increasing microstructure recovery or recrystallization. Large ductility was positively correlated with occurrence of austenite deformation twins in deformed microstructure.},

  abstract     = {The novel reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steel Eurofer 97 is employed by many concept designs for the plasma-facing first wall of the EU DEMO fusion reactor. These designs feature precision joints between Eurofer 97 coolant piping, for which an advanced laser-keyhole welding technique is proposed. In this work the microstructure of these novel laser-keyhole Eurofer 97 welds is modelled by combining finite element thermal analysis with precipitate kinetics modelling. Microanalysis of a representative specimen via scanning electron and high-speed atomic force microscopy techniques is also conducted, complimented by electron backscatter diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and nanoindentation hardness testing. Models of the weld microstructure agree well with the results of microanalysis although the precipitate diameters predicted are slightly underestimated. Several large void defects were discovered within the weld fusion zone, the cause of which is suspected to arise from the evaporation of cerium-rich oxide inclusions present in the as-cast Eurofer 97 during welding.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC), a malignancy with a relatively high fatality rate, still poses a growing global public health challenge due to the lack of well-established and effective treatment strategies. Brigatinib, an ALK inhibitor approved for the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC, has been repurposed to suppress the growth of ALK-negative CRC cells via sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Moreover, the photosensitizer Chlorine e6 (Ce6) exhibits a high singlet oxygen quantum yield, which promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to exacerbate ER stress and function synergistically with chemotherapeutics. However, the clinical application of both brigatinib and Ce6 is limited by their poor water solubility. Therefore, a repurposed chemo-photodynamic therapy nanoplatform (BCT NPs) utilizing d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) as a nanocarrier for the codelivery of the chemotherapeutics brigatinib and photosensitizer Ce6 is developed, which is capable of disrupting redox homeostasis and enhancing ER stress against CRC. The developed nanoplatform successfully addressed therapeutic drug solubility, improved brigatinib biocompatibility with a lower hemolysis rate, and demonstrated satisfactory CRC suppression effects in vitro and in vivo . Overall, BCT NPs provide a promising strategy to construct repurposed and versatile nanoplatforms against CRC.},

  abstract     = {Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is the most common and radical treatment for end-stage hip disease. Prosthesis loosening and periprosthetic infection are the most serious complications after THA, which may lead to prosthetic dysfunction. The early prevention of infection and the promotion of fast osseointegration between the prosthesis and host bone are essential to the success of THA. However, Ti6Al4V does not have biological function, such as promoting osseointegration and antibacterial properties, which limits its widespread use. Therefore, it is necessary to design a functional hip prosthesis to simultaneously reduce the incidence of loosening and periprosthetic infection. In this study, we developed a novel functionalized coating via micro-arc oxidation modification combined with vancomycin to treat a prosthetic surface for the early postoperative period to resist bacterial infection and promote osseointegration. The functionalized coating simultaneously prevents periprosthetic infections and promotes osseointegration at the prosthesis–host bone interface. We successfully constructed a prosthetic coating with the dual function of promoting osseointegration and preventing infection, which provides a practical and effective method for the treatment of periprosthetic infection and prosthetic loosening after THA.},

In this work, to realize targeted chemotherapy, an APE1 and magnetic dual-responsive nanocarrier was designed.

The chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded onto the AP-DNA to form the theranostic nanosystem (FS@DNA-DOX). As the AP-DNA was parted under the hydrolysis of APE1 in cancer cells, DOX was released to inhibit tumor growth. In vitro experiment results indicated that the nanosystem possesses a high specificity to APE1 and effectively release DOX in MCF-7 cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the targeted delivery of the nanosystem to the tumor site was successfully achieved and that strong tumor suppressor effects were observed.

The green (70\% moisture content) bamboo strips were hot compressed in the radial direction at 3.0 MPa pressure, and at 170 °C or 190 °C heat for 20 min. After compression, arcs became rectangular with low (&lt;10\%) moisture content and significant enhancement of mechanical properties. The bending strength, bending modulus, compressive strength, and shear strength of bamboo were improved by 128.1\%, 91.6\%, 58.2\%, and 74.5\%, respectively. Increased density and fiber bundle fraction, altered failure modes and chemical characteristics, increased cellulose crystallinity and crystalline size, and increased nanoscale mechanical properties were observed as contributing factors to tissue strength enhancement.

Whether polydopamine (PDA) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) cross-linked coatings could improve osteointegration of PEEK remains unclear. Here, we fabricated a series of PDA and EGCG cross-linked coatings (PE coatings: P2E0.1, P2E0.5, P2E1, and P2E2 coatings) to enhance osteointegration of PEEK. The material characteristics of coatings were studied using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, micro-BCA tests, and static water contact angle tests. We evaluated the cytotoxicity, cell adhesion, and osteogenic effects of the coatings in vitro . Furthermore, the P2E0.5 coating was selected to coat porous PEEK scaffold to observe osteointegration using micro-computed tomography and histology in a rabbit. The results show that the PE coatings provide phenolic hydroxyl and amino groups and enhanced hydrophilicity of PEEK, especially in the P2E0.5 coating. Several lines of cellular evidence suggest that P2E0.5 coatings exhibit a noncytotoxic and excellent osteogenic effect. Compared with PEEK, the P2E0.5-coated PEEK shows higher values of bone volume, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness. This study suggests that the PE coating is a promising candidate for surface modification of PEEK and may lay the foundation for further application of PE coatings in clinical practice.},

However, the further application of CDs is hindered due to their inherent poor targeting and controlled release properties. In this study, CD-supramolecular nanoparticles (HA-CsT@RH) were developed based on the structural characteristics of CDs (e.g., multi-group modifiability and hydrophobic cavity) to encapsulate rhein (RH) for oral delivery against UC. The HA-CsT@RH showed an average size of 154.70 ± 1.80 nm and exhibited high encapsulation efficiency (95.55 ± 2.37\%). When incubated in simulated gastric fluid for 2 h, HA-CsT@RH only released 20.3 ± 0.47\% RH due to the protection of supramolecular effects of CDs. However, RH was rapidly released from HA-CsT@RH (released 66.3 ± 2.50\%) after H 2 O 2 was treated with the assistance of the ROS-sensitive properties. Moreover, HA-CsT@RH were taken up by macrophages in 1.5 times higher amounts than preparations which did not have CD44-targeted effects. Notably, the results showed that HA-CsT@RH with an accurate on-demand drug release strategy achieved the best anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and they are expected to be a promising carrier in the UC treatment.},

This challenge is even more prominent in critical-sized bone defects, where the bone cannot heal independently. Here we present a novel workflow for such cases. First, a multidisciplinary team conducted the surgical plan, including the design of an intraoperative patient-specific instrument. Then, a Ti-6Al-4V implant was created to exactly fit the resected tumor&#39;s bone gap. An ambitious bone regenerative approach was taken in designing the implants with a porous-lattice body acting as a scaffold for new bone formation, reinforced with standard orthopedic instruments for adequate mechanical support. To prevent future failure of the implant, a finite element analysis was used to evaluate stress distribution simulation according to the multi-axis forces and moments applied on the bone during walking. Our results demonstrate the potential for Ti-6Al-4V implants to become the best practice for reconstructing significant bone defects. This proof-of-concept may enhance clinical care and catalyze new frontiers in patient-specific medicine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe in detail the design and fabrication of this method.},

The alloy was prepared by mixing 3 wt\% Zr and 0.5 wt\% TiC powder to standard pre-alloyed 7017 grade aluminium powder. This made printing of the alloys possible avoiding solidification cracking in the bulk and achieving high relative density (99.8\%). Such advanced alloys have significantly higher Young’s modulus (&gt;80 GPa) than conventional Al-alloys (70–75 GPa), thus making them attractive for applications requiring high stiffness. The resulting microstructure in as-printed condition was rich in particles originating from admixed powders and primary precipitates/inclusions originating from the PBF-LB process. After performing a T6-like heat treatment designed for the PBF-LB process, the microstructure changed: Zr-nanoparticles and Fe- or Mg/Zn- containing precipitates formed thus providing 75\% increase in yield strength (from 254 MPa to 444 MPa) at the cost of decreasing ductility (∼20\% to ∼9\%). In-situ tensile testing combined with SXCT, and ex-situ tensile testing combined with fracture analysis confirmed that the fracture initiation in both conditions is highly dependent on defects originated during printing. However, cracks are deflected from decohesion around Zr-containing inclusions/precipitates embedded in the Al-matrix. This deflection is seen to improve the ductility of the material.},

Effective Young’s moduli and Poisson’s ratios are obtained from the representative volume elements and are compared with those obtained from analytical homogenization through the Voigt, Reuss and Voigt-Reuss-Hill schemes. The volume fraction of the β -Nial phase in CoNiCrAlY is varied and the force–displacement responses of representative volume elements are contrasted with those from small punch test finite element models, through comparison of ratios of discrete fréchet distances. The results of the study estimated Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio to be 178.56 ± 7.65GPa and 0.249 ± 0.037 respectively, and for an increasing β -Nial phase volume fraction, the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio decrease.

  abstract     = {Shear thickening fluids (STFs) can effectively enhance the ballistic performance of Kevlar . Considering that the unique shear thickening effect of STF is the key factor to enhance the impact resistance of fabrics, this study sought to reveal the impact resistance mechanism of STF-Kevlar and guide its further design by using a numerical simulation method of fluid–structure interaction. The ballistic limits of neat Kevlar and STF-Kevlar in the ballistic tests were 55.14 m/s and 72.40 m/s, respectively, and the simulation predictions were 55.58 m/s and 70.40 m/s, which indicated that the established finite element model has high accuracy for predicting the ballistic performance curve of the fabric. The results of numerical simulation showed that STF-Kevlar has smaller deformation during the impact process than neat Kevlar. Due to the strengthening effect of STF, the resistance of STF-Kevlar to the elastomer was greater than that of neat fabric. With the increase of the impact velocity, the STF-Kevlar increasingly relied on STF to absorb energy. In engineering practice, through the fluid–structure interaction numerical simulation method, the prediction of the ballistic performance of the composite fabric can be realized in the early stage of manufacture, and guide further design and optimization.},

  abstract     = {Prototyping of three-dimensional mechanical metamaterials that exhibit negative Poisson’s ratio is usually performed through additive manufacturing. Although this technique has a huge potential, its use to engineer mechanical metamaterials for consumer products is still challenging. In this work, a novel design method is being proposed where 3D auxetic metamaterials can be produced by introducing continuous voids of constant cross-sectional area. Such voids would be inserted at strategic positions in different perpendicular planes of a solid block to obtain a continuous three-dimensional mechanical metamaterial that can exhibit the desired mechanical characteristics. The use of continuous voids to design the 3D meatamaterial makes it possible to use additive manufacturing, subtractive manufacturing as well as casting to produce these systems. The proposed design method is explained by using continuous voids having a diamond shaped cross-sectional area. The resulting group of structures can be described as connected polygons and were found to exhibit a negative or zero Poisson’s ratio. The analysed systems were also found to have a strain independent Poisson’s ratio up to at least 7\% strain. The proposed design method can thus facilitate the availability of three dimensional auxetic metamaterials in the consumer market which to date is conspicuous by their absence.},

The three-dimensional (3D) continuous Al 2 O 3 ceramic matrix containing Cr 2 O 3 particles was fabricated, and the influencing mechanisms of compositions and structures on the anti-wear and friction-reducing performance of composites at high temperature were revealed. Results show that the enrichment degree of Cr 2 O 3 in the composites can be significantly improved based on the 3D continuous structure design compared with Al 2 O 3 /Cr 2 O 3 composite containing uniform compositions. Under friction conditions, the Cr 2 O 3 phase with large enrichment degree can preferentially contact with the micro-asperities on the friction pair surface under the action of grain refinement at high temperature, so that the softened Cr 2 O 3 is easy to be sheared and dragged to the worn surfaces of the friction couples to form the friction film and transfer film. Meanwhile, under the favorable effect of the high load-carrying capacity of continuous Al 2 O 3 matrix, Al 2 O 3 /Cr 2 O 3 composites show excellent tribological properties at high temperature. The friction coefficient and wear rate of Al 2 O 3 /Cr 2 O 3 composites with 3D continuous structure sliding against Al 2 O 3 pin can be reduced to 0.35 and 2.2 × 10 -6 mm 3 ·N -1 m −1 at 800 °C, and it still presents excellent friction-reducing and anti-wear properties at 1000 °C.},

However, knowledge of the mechanism of carrier detrapping owing to mechanical forces remains elusive as it may include one or more complicated processes. Several attempts to develop calibration models for converting the light emitted by ML sensors into mechanical stress have been reported, but few studies have tested the ML response under static or quasi-static loading rates. In this study, we built a real-time measurement system to evaluate the constitutive strain-luminescence relationship of ML sensors. The ML response was investigated at loading rates as low as 5 µm/s (i.e., strain rates as low as 16.2 μst/s). The results showed that the light of ML sensors was still excited under quasi-static loading rates. A double-exponential function was applied to describe nonlinear changes in light intensity over time. We used this function to modify the previous model and predict the ML responses under variable loading rate conditions. The results predicted by the model proposed in this paper are in good agreement with the experimental results.},

  abstract     = {Chemotherapy (CT) can convert tumor cells into “tumor vaccines” through immunogenic cell death (ICD). However, the antitumor immunity elicited by CT-induced tumor vaccines is weak. Therefore, developing efficient CT-induced tumor vaccines is a challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy to induce CT with a strong immunogenic effect. Targeted tetrahedral DNA nanostructures modified by AS1411 and immune adjuvant CpG (abbreviation: ACT) were used to achieve a multi-drug co-loading system of DOX and methylene blue (MB, photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy), ACT-loaded DOX and MB (ACT@DM), for multi-mode and combined chemo-photo-immune therapy. ACT@DM effectively generated reactive oxygen species and promoted cellular uptake through photochemical internalization, showing an excellent antitumor effect. Furthermore, ACT@DM induced a significant ICD effect under light irradiation, activated immune cells, and promoted the maturation of dendritic cells and secretion of related cytokines, thereby resulting in the activation and infiltration of T lymphocytes. The combination of CT-photo-immune therapy significantly enhanced the proportions of cytotoxic T cells (CD8 + CTL) and CD8 + CTL/regulatory T cells, indicating effective activation of T cells and improvement of immunosuppression, which cooperatively inhibited tumor growth. This study provides a simple but effective strategy for exploring antitumor immunotherapy, achieving high-efficiency T cell activation, and multimodal combination therapy.},

  abstract     = {A panoptic view of architectured planar lattices based on star-polygon tilings was developed. Four star-polygon-based lattice sub-families, formed of systematically arranged triangles, squares, or hexagons, were investigated numerically and experimentally. Finite-element-based homogenization allowed computation of Poisson’s ratio, elastic modulus, shear modulus, and planar bulk modulus. A comprehensive understanding of the range of properties and micromechanical deformation mechanisms was developed. Adjusting the star-polygon angle achieved an over 250-fold range in elastic modulus, over a 10-fold range in density, and a range of - 0.919 -0.919 to + 0.988 +0.988 for Poisson’s ratio. Additively manufactured lattices, achieved by novel printing strategies, showed good agreement in properties. Parametric additive manufacturing procedures for all lattices are available on www.fullcontrol.xyz/#/models/1d3528. Three of the four sub-families exhibited in-plane elastic isotropy. One showed high stiffness with auxeticity at low density and a primarily axial deformation mode as opposed to bending deformation for the other three lattices. The range of achievable properties, demonstrated with property maps, proves the extension of the conventional material-property space. Lattice metamaterials with Triangle-Triangle, Kagome, Hexagonal, Square, Truncated Archimedean, Triangular, and Truncated Hexagonal topologies have been studied in the literature individually. Here, it is shown that these structures belong to the presented overarching lattice family.},

In addition, element content test results exhibited a higher oxygen content in the additive parts with high laser heat input. Electron probe X-ray microanalysis indicated that the oxygen was distributed uniformly in the additive parts. Corresponding molecular dynamics simulation results revealed that an increase in oxygen content led to a decrease in the tensile strength of the additive parts. Two methods of argon-filled environment l -DED experiments and low-oxygen CoCrNi feeding power (argon gas atomization) were used. Results showed that the number and size of cracks were significantly reduced in the additive parts obtained by a high heat input process when the l -DED was conducted in an argon-filled atmosphere and when powders with lower oxygen content were used. For the crack-free additive parts, the ultimate tensile strengths reached 625 MPa with high laser heat input. Three crack suppression strategies could be proposed from this study, namely, reducing the heat input, performing additive experiments under argon-filled environment, and decreasing the oxygen content of the powder.},

Analytical models and numerical simulations of wooden boards are able to represent varying material orientation e.g. with local fiber directions from laser scanning as input for the prediction of strength. Current Finite Element Models reconstructed the grain orientation by means of computationally demanding fluid analysis around obstacles like knots; whereas the available fiber pattern, captured by means of laser scanning, was passed solely into the detection of knots, but not directly processed for the inclusion of material fiber orientation. Therefore, the goal of this paper was the development of a numerical approach to directly include locally varying measured fiber orientation with orthotropic material properties and to predict the tensile strength of boards with reduced computational effort. Therefore, the stiffness was transformed element-wise according to the measured fiber deviations and the local fiber stress components were computed for the specific tensile load case. For the virtual strength prediction, numerical maximum stress values were compared to experimental tensile strength. Good agreements were observed with reduced computational effort compared to existing approaches between numerical and experimental results.},

Shell-based and strut-based triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMSs), which respectively act as secondary phase and matrix phase, are coupled together by referencing natural systems. Multi-scale investigation on the linear, surface and chiral strengthening TPMS-FGLMs substantiates the highly tunable mechanical performance. The mechanical performance spatiotemporal asynchrony caused by predetermined secondary phase significantly alters the post-yielding and failure behavior, further restricts the failure band propagation and catastrophic collapse. Secondary phase distributed in cross-like pattern provides balanced mechanical strength and energy absorption efficiency.

The application of reactive multilayers represents an advanced joining method for flexible and low-distortion joining of dissimilar joining partners by means of a short-term and localized application of thermal energy. In the context of this publication, the joining process between semi-crystalline polyamide 6 and austenitic stainless steel X5CrNi18–10 (EN 1.4301 / AlSI 304) based on reactive Al/Ni multilayers is investigated. In addition to evaluation of resulting joint strength, the focus of the work is in particular the characterization of the resulting failure behavior at the fracture interface under tensile load and the deriving binding mechanisms in the joint. From the results obtained, it is estimated that a direct bond can be generated between plastic and metal despite the presence of a residual reacted foil in the joining area. The structures present in the metal surface have a particularly positive influence on crack initiation and the resulting increased bond strength.},

Machine learning technique provides another powerful tool for the design of multi-functional elastic metasurfaces because of its excellent capability in building nonlinear mapping relation between high-dimensional input data and output data. In this paper, a machine learning network is introduced to extract the complex relation between high-dimensional geometrical parameters of the metasurface unit and its high-dimensional dynamic properties. Based on a big dataset, the well-trained network can play the role of a surrogate model in the inverse design of a multi-functional elastic metasurface to significantly shorten the time for the design. Such method can be conveniently extended to design other multi-functional metasurfaces for the manipulation of optical, acoustical or mechanical waves.},

The FCC microstructure of the welds is investigated using scanning electron microscopy assisted by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron-backscattered diffraction. The impact of the weld on the microstructure is discussed. The heat-affected zone is negligible for the annealed condition of both medium and high entropy alloys since there is no driving force for recrystallisation and the exposure time to high temperature is insufficient for grain coarsening. The texture formed in the fusion zone is also discussed and compared to the texture in the base metal and the heat-affected zone. Although the grain growth along the 〈1 0 0〉 crystallographic direction is preferential in all cases, the crystallographic texture type differs from each weld.

  abstract     = {In this study, we narrowly define the fidelity of additive manufacturing (AM) as the reliability of the morphology and mechanical properties of the fabricated structure. The structural design and fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) printed scaffolds produced using an extrusion technique for bone regeneration are actively studied with respect to their fidelity. However, fabricating an ideal design using an extrusion technique is difficult because of its intrinsic limitations in tissue engineering, such as those regarding resolution, manufacturing error, and printability. Among them, manufacturing errors and printability are partially or totally determined by the design complexity. Therefore, in extrusion-type AM, the design should be established considering the abovementioned limitations. In this study, the AM fidelity of a 3D Kagome scaffold was improved using design for additive manufacturing (DfAM). Consequently, the compressive stiffness was enhanced compared to that achieved in our previous study. Specifically, the compressive stiffness was improved to 95.2\% of the computational analysis result, which is the maximum ideal value. In addition, the DfAM did not affect cell proliferation, showing that it can ensure the fabrication fidelity of 3D Kagome scaffolds without losing cell culturing characteristics.},

Thin-film Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 absorber layers do not suffer from edge recombination enabling miniaturization to the micrometer size, which allows for considerable material saving. Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 micro solar cells have achieved excellent efficiencies under concentrated light, when fabricated by materially-wasteful lithography processes. However, for commercial consideration, material-efficient synthesis approaches are required. In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach to produce arrays of Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 micro absorber layers through a two-step process, where a Cu-In-Ga precursor layer is sputtered onto a photolithographically structured resist, followed by lift-off and selenization. Our investigation shows a detrimental contamination of the Cu-In-Ga micro-dots by the photoresist. Therefore, we introduce an additional annealing step in inert-gas atmosphere prior to the selenization step, which leads to the formation of electroactive Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 micro absorbers. We report the synthesis and characterization of working micro solar cells with an efficiency of 1.2\% under 1 Sun. This proof of principle opens up a new material-efficient synthesis route for the direct fabrication of arrays of micro solar cells and puts forward the potential to achieve higher power conversion efficiencies upon further process optimization.},

  abstract     = {Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMSs) are common in energy, aerospace, optics, and medical fields. Although many works focus on substantially tuning the anisotropy for a hybrid lattice with various TPMS types, tuning the anisotropy for a single TPMS type has not been sufficiently investigated. This study proposes a skew transformation (ST) to distort TPMS lattices at the design stage, to modify their mechanical anisotropies and tailor their deformations under uniaxial loading. The ST method enables a standard TPMS lattice to increase the direction-dependent modulus without changing the lattice’s volume fraction, which is 38\% higher than the theoretical Hashin–Shtrikman upper (HSU) bound for a sheet lattice. Accordingly, three-dimensional (3D) modulus surfaces were generated for ST lattices with different ST angles. Shear deformation under uniaxial compression was generated to obtain a nominal negative Poisson’s ratio of −0.66 with the combination of ST and hole design. Furthermore, the ST method was used to texture the local deformation, stress distribution, and failure form by constructing a cellular mechanical metamaterial, by combining ST and standard unit cells in a targeted texture pattern. This design concept is not limited to TPMS lattices and can be applied to other types of strut- and sheet-based lattices.},

This paper aims to assess the possibility of including a substrate in a component by investigating the mechanical performances of the interface between a wrought plate and WAAM deposit. Four substrates alloys and 2319 WAAM alloy were investigated. Inter-layer rolling and heat treatment, process steps known for improving the properties of WAAM deposit, were implemented. Each interface was examined using microhardness profiles, tensile tests, post rupture fractography and microstructural analysis. The WAAM deposit hardness was lower than that of the substrate in the as-deposited condition. Although the interface had no impact when using the same alloy for both substrate and wire, the weakest point of the combination was at the interface in dissimilar alloy combination. Heat treatment reduced the properties difference between the substrate and WAAM deposit. Inter-pass rolling strengthen the WAAM deposit without impacting the substrate and eliminated the micro crack that occasionally formed in the fusion zone in the as-deposited condition.},

It displays a decent uniform elongation of ∼ 20\% and an exceptional strain energy density limit up to ∼ 240 mJ/mm 3 at the strength level of ∼ 1.2 GPa, which is unattainable by its homogeneous as well as clustered heterogeneous counterparts. Grain size-dependent heterogeneous deformation evokes inter-zone interactions, which induce strain partitioning, activate additional mechanical twinning and promote developments of dislocation gradient and long-range internal stress near zone boundary sequentially, imparting a multistage work hardening with extraordinary strain hardening rate up-turn followed by slow attenuation. Dispersed heterostructure provides a higher density of zone boundary, ensuring more extensive inter-zone interaction and thus maximizing the extraordinary strain hardening to improve ductility.},

Skeletal muscle has a robust capacity for regeneration following injury. However, few if any effective therapeutic options for volumetric muscle loss are available. Poor repair of muscle injury will lead to skeletal muscle dysfunction, resulting in physical pain and even seriously compromising daily life. As a new technology of biomedicine, 3D bioprinting is widely used in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to its enormous advantages. 3D bioprinting creates biological structures similar to that of protists by precisely constructing a specified geometric shape at micro/nano levels, thus addressing the unmet needs in tissue replacement and organ transplantation. With the further application of bioprinting in various tissue repairs, more and more researchers utilized 3D bioprinting in skeletal muscle regeneration. Various bioinks, such as alginate, gelatin, fibrin hydrogels, and extracellular matrix (ECM), loaded with functional seed cells or growth factors have been applied to fabricating 3D bioprinted constructs with complicated inner structures for skeletal muscle regeneration. Therefore, we conducted this review to report the skeletal muscle regeneration process, the development status of bioprinting technology, and the mechanism of promoting skeletal muscle repair. In addition, the current challenges and further perspectives of skeletal muscle regeneration by bioprinting are also discussed in this study.},

In this work, PTT combined reactive oxygen species oxidative therapy (ROT) was conducted via mesoporous polydopamine nanosphere with nanoceria doping (MPDA-Ce). After surface anchoring with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) molecules, the dispersive stability and tumor targeting of this innovative nanoplatform were substantially boosted. In vitro studies revealed that the unique nanotherapeutics had satisfactory photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 51.41\%), continuous nanoceria release in cytoplasm of tumor cells after acid microenvironment (pH = 5.5) induced biodegradation. Significantly, hyperthermia amplified the abundant reactive oxygen species generation under 808 nm laser irradiation that potent ROT was realized with only 27.1\% cells alive. Strikingly, Indocyanine green (ICG) loaded MPDA-Ce with RGD modification shows robust tumor targeting capability in breast carcinoma bearing Balb/C mice under fluorescent imaging in the second near-infrared window. The combined treatments resulted in complete tumor cells eradication under 808 nm laser illumination both in vitro and in vivo . This work highlights the promising application of MPDA-Ce as a powerful nanoplatform for ROT and PTT combined treatment in clinical.},

  abstract     = {Mechanoluminescence (ML) materials, which directly convert mechanical energy into light emission, have emerged as an emerging class of light-emitting materials with various applications. Although significant progress has been made in the development of new ML materials and devices, their practical application is limited by their low intensity and homogenously structured host structures. Thus, multiple-structured host ML materials with high ML intensity and reproducibility are needed, particularly for wearable and printable ML light sources with high brightness. In this study, various Mn-doped ternary heterojunction ML materials, CaZnOS-ZnS-SrZnOS, are synthesised by high-temperature solid-phase reactions, and their luminescence properties are systematically tested. The result indicates that the ternary heterojunction materials have a higher ML intensity over 60 times stronger than the state-of-art SrZnOS: Mn 2+ , which is currently the brightest sample we have obtained. ML linearly depends on the magnitude of the applied force. Based on the synthesised ternary ML heterojunctions, repetitive self-driving luminescence of the zipper is achieved for the first time through powder modification and inlay; the clothes composed of our prepared zippers are pulled and bent when worn on the body to emit bright visible light. Additionally, a Velcro that can achieve light emission is developed; it provides a new idea for the development of wearable flexible self-luminous devices in the future. Simultaneously, movement-driven stress luminous printable objects that can be printed on the surface of various commodities or their packaging are demonstrated. The preparation of self-driven, battery-free, and electrode-free stress luminescence wearable low light sources has an important application trend, which can avoid the interference of the circuit and improve the stability of the devices, thus promising a wide range of applications in smart wear, energy-saving displays, safety and rescue, robotic skin, and information security.},

We observed that additional functionalization of acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO), as the main component of the biopolymer matrix, with additional methacrylate groups (mAESO), increased the strength and elastic modulus of extruded nanocomposites by more than three times, as well as doubled the glass transition temperature due to an increased degree of crosslinking in the functionalized matrices. The mAESO-based nanocomposite filaments demonstrated a strength safety factor of 1.5 against the minimum required standard mechanical properties for bone cement according to ISO standard5833. While heat treatment of nHA reduced the frequency of larger agglomerations, no significant difference in mechanical properties was observed.

Obtaining more absorption peaks requires further sacrifice of the number of sub-resonators. More importantly, these two design methods are difficult to control or adjust the number of absorption peaks without changing the number of sub-resonators. Therefore, new scheme using simplified structure without increasing any design complexity to realize multiple-frequency-band absorption with adjustable resonance features is urgently needed. In this paper, a multiple-frequency-band terahertz metamaterial absorber using surface structure of toothed resonator is demonstrated, it has the ability to control (increase or decrease) the number of absorption peaks without increasing its design complexity, which is different from previous works that need to sacrifice the design complexity of metamaterials. Furthermore, the introduction of temperature-controlled vanadium dioxide into the surface structure of multiple-frequency-band absorber can dynamically tune its resonance performance. It is proved that when vanadium dioxide changes from metallic state to insulating state, its absorption peaks can be actively adjusted from dual- to triple-, quad- and even penta-frequency-band absorption. These efforts could provide meaningful guidance for the design of multiple-frequency-band metamaterial absorbers, and could have broad application prospects in terahertz technology-related areas.},

The manufactured structures were within 5\% of the targeted porosity. However, numerical simulations overestimated the experimental apparent (effective) stiffness and strength of the structures by an average of 25\%, likely due to the presence in them of manufacturing defects, especially in the higher porosity lattices. Experimental and numerical results showed that the structures have quasi-identical mechanical properties in compression and in tension. However, a comparison of the torsion and axial results indicated that conventional bulk material failure theories such as the von Mises limitation criterion do not apply to the apparent properties of lattice structures.

What&#39;s more, Zn/ZnO-3 coating maintains superhydrophobicity after suffering from strong acid/alkali, tape peeling, water drop impact and sandpaper abrasion tests. Compared with carbon steel and hydrophobic Zn coating, the corrosion current density of superhydrophobic Zn/ZnO-3 coating is decreased by approximately 4 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively. The superior mechanochemical stability and anti-corrosion performance of superhydrophobic Zn/ZnO-3 coating is ascribed to its pine needle-like structure. Overall, this work provides a novel strategy to design hierarchical structured superhydrophobic surfaces with excellent mechanochemical stability and corrosion resistance, holding great prospects in metallic corrosion protection.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between electrospinning nanomaterials and stem cells to repair damaged tissue mainly focus on manipulating cell viability, proliferation, or paracrine by the materials and their specific topology. In particular, the paracrine products of stem cells influence the behavior of those repairable cells ( i.e. , epidermal cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells) to speed up the repair progress. In this study, a series of nanofiber-based meshes were fabricated by electrospinning and light-welding technology to investigate their impacts on the paracrine behaviors of adipose stem cells (ADSCs) and their performance in accelerating wound healing. We found that the nanofiber-based meshes with varied grid sizes and modified with gelatin nanofibers could regulate the paracrine of ADSCs. As a result, the migration of fibroblasts and endothelial cells as well as angiogenesis was all influenced in vitro . In vivo investigation using rat skin wound healing models also indicated that the nanofiber-based meshes could accelerate wound healing rate, increase the thickness of the regenerated epidermis, and promote type I collagen production and CD31-positive vessel formation in the dermis layer. Taken together, such nanofiber-based meshes provide effective and promising alternatives to design tissue-repair scaffolds involving manipulating stem cell paracrine and wound closure.},

The morphology, microstructure, microhardness, and tribological properties of the Mo 2 FeB 2 /WC self-lubricating composite coatings were investigated. The results indicated that the addition of WS 2 , MoS 2 , and h-BN increased the bonding properties between the coating and substrate. Sulfides and nitrides were found in the self-lubricating composite coatings; the Mo 2 FeB 2 /WC/h-BN coating exhibited a fine dendritic structure. The microhardnesses of the Mo 2 FeB 2 /WC, Mo 2 FeB 2 /WC/WS 2 , Mo 2 FeB 2 /WC/MoS 2 , and Mo 2 FeB 2 /WC/h-BN coatings were 1591.3 HV 0.5 , 1345.6 HV 0.5 , 1378.9 HV 0.5 , and 1415.3 HV 0.5 , respectively. After the addition of WS 2 , MoS 2 , and h-BN, the coefficients of friction decreased by 9.09\%, 15.15\%, and 30.30\%, respectively; the corresponding wear rates decreased by 10.80\%, 19.03\%, and 30.97\%, respectively. The self-lubricating phases significantly improved the tribological properties of the Mo 2 FeB 2 /WC coating. The main wear mechanisms of the Mo 2 FeB 2 /WC coating were adhesive and mild oxidative wear; the wear mechanisms after the addition of WS 2 , MoS 2 , and h-BN were abrasive and oxidative wear. The wear debris was powder-like for the Mo 2 FeB 2 /WC/WS 2 and Mo 2 FeB 2 /WC/MoS 2 coatings and flake-like for the Mo 2 FeB 2 /WC/h-BN coating.

  abstract     = {To prevent premature triggering of the healing reaction in Mo-Si containing self-healing thermal barrier coating system, an oxygen impenetrable shell (α-Al 2 O 3 ) around the sacrificial healing particles (MoSi 2 ) is desired. Here an encapsulation method is presented through selective oxidation of Al in Mo(Al x Si 1- x ) 2 particles. Healing particles of Mo(Al x Si 1- x ) 2 is designed in terms of alumina shell thickness, particle size and fraction Al dissolved. By replacing Si by Al in MoSi 2 up to the maximum solubility ( x = 0.65) a strong crack healing ability is maintained (relative volume expansion ≥ 40\%). The formed exclusive α-Al 2 O 3 , featuring a two-layered structure, results from a counter-diffusion process along the grain boundaries, and its oxidation kinetics fits well with the 3D diffusion-Jander model. After 16 h exposure in gaseous ambient with a p O 2 of 5 × 10 -10 atm. at 1100 °C, a closed and dense shell of α-Al 2 O 3 is formed with a thickness of about 1.3 µm. The oxide shell produced under this condition provided healing particles with significantly improved stability upon exposure to high p O 2 of 0.2 atm. at 1100 °C for 50 h. The particles after exposure feature an inner core of MoSi 2 with Al completely consumed and an oxide shell of α-Al 2 O 3 .},

In this work, the fusiform SnO 2 nanocrystals film in situ grown on flexible carbon fiber cloth is rationally designed and fabricated through combining air calcination and hydrothermal synthesis. X-ray photoelectron spectrum confirms fusiform SnO 2 nanocrystals film and carbon fiber cloth are effectively integrated with strong chemical bonds of C O Sn. The as-prepared composite exhibits strong reflection loss of −49.1 dB (2.6 GHz) and wide effective absorption bandwidth of 5.8 GHz (11.6–17.4 GHz) with a thin matched thickness of 1.6 mm, surpassing to pure carbon fiber cloth and many SnO 2 /carbon-based microwave absorbers. The efficient performance originates from well-matched characteristic impedance and multifarious electromagnetic attenuation mechanisms, i.g. , dipole orientation polarization, interfacial polarization relaxation, conductive loss, and multiple reflections/scatterings. Especially, differential charge density calculation reveals the uneven charge distribution at SnO 2 /C interface, which is believed to remarkably enhance interfacial polarization relaxation and contribute to microwave absorption. Our results illustrate that the ingenious integration of nanomaterials on carbon fiber cloth promises a way to achieve efficient and flexible microwave absorbers.},

In this work, we show that a typical face-centered cubic crystalline phase CoCrFeNiMn HEA can be readily transformed into the amorphous phase under the ultrasonic vibration treatment (UVT) at a frequency of 20000 Hz. The nanoscale hierarchical features include twins, stacking faults bands, hexagonal-close packed phase bands and even amorphous bands can be obviously identified in samples treated by different UVT energies. The dominant mechanism of ultrasonic vibration-induced amorphization is that the grain refinement promotes the formation of amorphous phases when the defect density at the grain boundaries reaches a critical level. In addition, the mechanical instability is easily induced by ultrasonic vibration at high strain rate to generate amorphous phase inside the grains. As a consequence of UVT, the HEA samples revealed significant mechanical performance improvement owing to the microstructure evolution especially the generation of amorphous phase, such as yielding strength and hardness. This rapid amorphization process provides not only a candidate strengthening mechanism for HEA, but also a novel approach to unveil the pending crystal-amorphous transition problem.},

A 3.3 mm-thick plate obtained from the deposition containing four different regions in the vicinity of the interface (substrate/HAZ/dilution layers/feed material) was subjected to uniaxial tensile deformation parallel to the interface. The strength of the layered structure exceeded the theoretical strength calculated through the rule of mixture, while elongation to failure was almost the same as the carbon steel and yield point phenomena disappeared. The synergetic heterostructure effect of the layered structure was attributed to the formation of strain gradient and back stress strengthening effect due to the mechanical incompatibility between each region in the layered structure. Applying 220 °C preheating reduced the layered structure&#39;s elongation by assigning different strengths and residual stresses to each layer. The current result suggested that the mechanical incompatibility between domains in the interface region, including the residual stress field distribution, should be carefully controlled to improve the mechanical behavior of the interface region.},

  abstract     = {Multi-principal elemental alloys (MPEAs) exhibit unusual mechanical properties and irradiation resistance. It has been reported that the irradiation tolerance of MPEAs originates from the long-term defect evolution stage rather than the ballistic collision phase. However, understanding the long-term evolution of MPEAs is exceptionally challenging due to intrinsic chemical disorder. In this work, we apply atomistically-informed cluster dynamics to study defect evolution in MPEAs for the first time, which enables us to elucidate the critical features responsible for the irradiation performance of MPEAs. With suitable irradiation parameters, our obtained cluster size distributions are in good agreement with experiments. We further discuss the influences of defect migration energy heterogeneity, cluster geometry, and temperature on the produced defect cluster forms. Our results suggest that the small clusters during the collision phase in MPEAs suppress the formation of large-sized defect clusters in the long term. Contrary to the common belief, a broader migration energy distribution due to chemical disorder cannot reduce the maximal defect cluster size but increase the proportion of small clusters. Our results thus reveal that the major role of chemical complexity in MPEAs is to modify the growth mechanism of clusters by promoting small cluster formation and suppressing overall defect diffusivities.},

Here we report that the formation of MROs is accompanied by the redistribution of constituent elements, and the subtle chemical composition fluctuations could by directly probed and quantified by using a state-of-the-art aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope. The presence of such MROs contributes to an appreciable increase in yield strength (∼40 MPa) with a higher work hardening rate, originating from the strong dislocation interactions with MROs at the incipient plastic deformation. These findings demonstrate that MROs have a significant impact on reducing the mean free path of full/partial dislocations along a specific slipping plane, offering a new avenue for strengthening of equiatomic element alloys by tuning local composition and atomic configurations.},

Interstitial carbon has usually been introduced to enhance mechanical properties of HEAs. To achieve addition of high carbon, this work designed a dual-phase Al 10 (FeNiCoMn) 90 HEA without strong carbide-forming elements. The results showed that adding 3 at.\% carbon did not cause the precipitation of carbides in this HEA, and its yield strength and plasticity increased by 237 MPa and 26.2\%, respectively, which was due to the increase of fcc phase fraction, the distribution change of bcc phase and interstitial strengthening. Addition of 4 at.\% carbon only caused the precipitation of nano-scale carbides in the matrix and the yield strength and plasticity increased by 455 MPa and 5.5\%, respectively, resulted from phase modulation , interstitial strengthening and precipitation strengthening. Simultaneously, the transition from wavy slip to planar slip and the formation of microbands after carbon addition, which also led to an increase of plasticity. This work provides a promising method that if coarse carbides can be avoided, high carbon addition enhances both strength and plasticity in a dual-phase HEA by multi-effects including phase modulation, interstitial strengthening, precipitation strengthening and deformation mechanism transition.},

  abstract     = {Improving the strength of the commercial ZK60 alloys plays a key role in promoting their wide applications. In this work, a ZK60 alloy was prepared by conventional direct extrusion at an obviously reduced temperature of 180 °C. Compared with ZK60 alloys directly extruded at high temperatures (&gt;300 °C), the studied alloy has finer dynamic recrystallized (DRXed) grains with the average size of ∼1.7 μm, stronger typical fiber texture and more profuse lath-like sub-grains. In addition, the ultra-low extrusion temperature increased dynamic precipitates (rod-like Mg 4 Zn 7 and MgZn 2 ) in DRXed grains. After aging, a great many of nanosized precipitates formed in both DRXed grains and non-recrystallized grains, and relatively coarse MgZn 2 particles precipitated on sub-grain boundaries. As a result, the aged ZK60 alloy exhibit significantly high ultimate compressive strength of ∼675 MPa on the basis of high yield strength of ∼310 MPa, indicating a significant strain hardening capability. Meanwhile, it has excellent strength-ductility balance and a weakened tension-compression yield strength asymmetry under owning a high TYS in order of ∼400 MPa.},

  abstract     = {The effects of yttrium (Y) addition on the microstructure and high-temperature mechanical properties of Inconel 718 have been investigated. Alloys containing a range of Y (0–0.58 wt\%) were fabricated using selective laser melting, followed by solution and aging heat treatment. The mechanical properties were evaluated by high-temperature (650 °C) tensile and creep tests. The results showed that Y addition up to 0.07 wt\% enhanced both tensile and creep ductility. Ductility was the highest in the 0.07 wt\% Y-added specimen; further increases in Y content reduced both tensile and creep ductility. The ductility improvement by the small addition of Y was attributable to the grain boundary segregation of Y, which led to the morphological change of the δ phase precipitates and the stabilization of oxygen by forming Y 2 O 3 at grain boundaries. However, the beneficial effect of Y on ductility was suppressed when Y content exceeded 0.07 wt\%, owing to the precipitation of Y-rich Ni 5 Y and NbC phases at intergranular and interdendritic regions. On the other hand, the specimens with high Y contents were mechanically strengthened by the solid solution of Y and by the precipitation of Ni 5 Y and NbC phases.},

Printed parts of A20X alloy are usually post-processed with a long T7 heat treatment for improved mechanical properties with respect to its as-built counterparts. However, in the present investigation, it was demonstrated that T7 might not be the best suitable heat treatment available for A20X alloy. A detailed microstructural characterization of A20X samples processed with laser powder bed fusion and post-processed with T7 was carried out. Microstructural features were analysed in terms of grain size, precipitate size, phase quantification, dislocation density and width of the precipitate free zones. After the analysis, a simple and rapid heat treatment was proposed which significantly improved the mechanical properties. The yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation to fracture (e) for the T7 heat treatment were 370 ± 9 MPa, 435 ± 13 MPa and 7.3 ± 0.3\% respectively. With the proposed heat treatment, an increment of 7.1\% in YS, 6.3\% in UTS and 45\% in e was witnessed. This exceptional improvement in the mechanical behaviour has been associated with the absence of grain boundary cracking in the proposed heat treatment.},

By introducing the semi-metallic Si into the FeCrMnV high-entropy alloy (HEA) to control the ratio of metallic and covalent bonding, we obtained a FeCrMnVSi x HEAs with high strength and favorable ductility from the perspective of interatomic bonding. First-principles calculation was employed to calculate the structural model, electronic environment, and mechanical properties. The theoretical calculations demonstrated that the covalent bonding had been obtained in the FeCrMnV HEA consisting of metallic bonding due to the addition of Si. Under the guidance of theoretical calculation, FeCrMnVSi x HEAs were successfully prepared by laser cladding on 1Cr13 steel substrate. The nanoindentation, Vickers microhardness, and tensile tests were performed, and the results indicated that the strength of HEA was enhanced without sacrificing ductility. In addition, the as-prepared Si-containing HEA coatings exhibited excellent tribological properties. The mechanism of simultaneous formation of metallic and covalent bonds on the mechanical properties was analyzed. The enhanced strength without sacrificing ductility in FeCrMnVSi x HEAs is attributed to the proper combination of metallic and covalent bonding, the metallic bonding facilitates favorable ductility while the covalent bonding contributes to excellent strength.},

This paper proposed practical SMA constitutive models for accurate engineering calculation, which apply to both the single loading-unloading process and the multiple loading-unloading cycles. The more accurate SMA theoretical tensile curve and temperature-stress phase transformation diagram is introduced to derive the constitutive model. The more accurate calculation method of elastic modulus, phase transformation modulus, and critical phase transformation stress is proposed in this paper. The proposed constitutive model considers the incomplete phase transformation phenomenon and the variation of critical phase transformation stress under multiple loading and unloading conditions. It can accurately evaluate the critical phase transformation stress and stress-strain relationships at various temperatures. Tensile tests under various working conditions were conducted. The results demonstrated that the proposed constitutive model could well simulate the SMA’s macroscopic mechanical behavior at various temperatures, loads, and multiple loading-unloading cycles with accuracy, practicality, and efficiency.},

The λ, which denotes the minimum value of misorientations between 12 α variants of β nBOR and α GB , is introduced to quantitatively evaluate morphology of α GB .

  abstract     = {Titanium alloys fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) often suffer from limited ductility because of the inherent acicular α ′ α′ martensite embedded in the columnar parent phase grains (prior- β β grains). The post-built heat treatment at a relatively high temperature (∼1075 K) necessary for decomposing martensite results in improved ductility at the cost of strength. It, however, remains difficult to achieve balances between strength and ductility in as-printed conditions due to the huge range of possible compositions of printing process variables. Herein, using LPBF-processed Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64) alloy as an example, we demonstrate that machine learning (ML) is capable of accelerating the discovery of the proper sets of processing parameters resulting in a superior synergy of strength and ductility (i.e., yield strength, Ys 0.2 = 1044 ± 10 MPa, uniform elongation, UEL = 10.5 ± 1.2\% and total elongation = 15 ± 1.5\%). Such property improvement is found to be enabled by an unique refined prior- β β grains decorated by confined α ′ α′ -colony precipitates. In particular, the uniform deformation ability of α ′ α′ martensite is improved due to the enhanced microstructure uniformity achieved by weakening variant selection. ML-based processing parameter optimization approach is thus well-positioned to accelerate the qualification of a wide range of l -PBF manufactured alloys beyond Ti-alloys.},

Despite the advancements in RT, high doses of radiation can disrupt the oral cavity homeostasis and result in undesired reactions. Thus, intraoral stents (IOSs) are utilized for patients during RT to prevent unnecessary irradiation to surrounding tissues. However, no studies have compared commonly used IOS materials and their potential toxicity. Therefore, the objective of this study is to perform a detailed assessment of ten IOS materials in order to select the top-ranked material for HNC patients undergoing RT. Thus, beam attenuation measurements, and Raman spectroscopy and mechanical testing were conducted pre- and post-artificial saliva, RT, and artificial saliva and RT exposure. Finally, through a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis using Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), our study demonstrated that Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) was the top-ranked material. The saliva samples were also tested via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which showed no leaching of irradiated materials. Taken together, these data suggest that EVA is an appropriate IOS material that can be utilized during RT to reduce significant morbidity for HNC patients and improve their quality of life.},

Multiple adverse factors contribute to the non-healing state. Without effective treatment, diabetic wounds can lead to serious systemic complications. The current clinical treatments of enhanced glycemic control and anti-infection are unable to meet the needs of diabetic wound management. Here, we constructed a nanoparticle with catalase-like functionality (EGAP) and encapsulated it in a thermosensitive hydrogel to yield a versatile hydrogel formulation (EGAP@HG). The drug can form a protective physical barrier over the wound and create a moist environment. First, the EGAP converts H 2 O 2 to O 2 at the wound site, thereby alleviating local hypoxia. Then, the released EGF can promote the proliferation of epidermal cells. Furthermore, the gallic acid released from the outer layer of EGAP can exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Finally, the silver ions released from the inner templates (APs) can kill bacteria. In vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that our treatment system can promote wound healing from multiple perspectives. This strategy by improving the local microenvironment of diabetic wounds provides a new theoretical basis and practical directions for chronic diabetic wound repair.},

However, the relatively large-size through-type diffusion channels commonly appear in the corroded layers as TMNs coatings subjected to corrosive environments. These channels can serve as short-circuit-diffusion paths for corrosive ions and worsen the corrosion-resistance ability, eventually, yielding unpredictable failure due to the heterogeneous growth of corrosion products. Obviously, comparing with the large-size through-type diffusion channels, the biomimetic multi-forked root-like capillary channels can significantly extend the diffusion distance and retard the transportation of corrosive ions by continuously deflecting and refining the diffusion paths. Herein, the nano-laminated TaN/Zr 3 N 4 architecture, consisting of alternating 10 nm-thickness c-TaN nanolayers and 2 nm-thickness N -rich o-Zr 3 N 4 nanolayers, has been fabricated by magnetron sputtering technology; it exhibits the characteristic of c-TaN/c-Zr 3 N 4 local coherent growth. Such TaN/Zr 3 N 4 nanomultilayered structure contributes to the self-adaptive assembly of TaO 2 @ZrO 2 core–shell nanostructure in the corroded layer, thereby yielding appearance of uniformly root-like capillary diffusion channels instead of the typical through-type diffusion channels in the constitute monolayers; finally, it achieves superior corrosion-resistance with homogeneously general corrosion rate and avoids the uncontrollable failures.},

  abstract     = {In the present work, we selected (CoCrFeNiMn) 90 Hf 10 amorphous high-entropy alloys (AHEAs) as the added particle into pure Ni powder and prepared novel Ni-based composites by spark plasma sintering (SPS). Three kinds of in-situ nanoscale reinforcements with face-centered cubic structure are obtained by phase separation and crystallization of AHEA in the Ni matrix during SPS, possessing different formation mechanisms, distribution sizes, and existing regions. It allows the formation of hierarchical nanoprecipitates through the interaction of Ni matrix and appropriately added AHEA, bringing about reinforcement unit formation with core–shell types embedded in the matrix. Accordingly, a significant enhancement in the strength and ductility synergy compared to SPS-ed pure Ni bulk is achieved. The 20 vol\% AHEA/Ni-based composite achieves the optimal yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation of 358 MPa, 561 MPa, and 24.1\%, respectively. The different types of in-situ hierarchical nanoscale precipitates in the Ni matrix manifest unique pinning behaviors for various defect forms. The disordered interfacial nanolayer obtained along the grain boundary between matrix and nanoprecipitate verifies the large tensile ductility. Moreover, the hierarchical dimples exhibiting a uniform distribution involving in reinforcement unit and Ni matrix also decipher the basis of the strength-ductility trade-off.},

The hybrid process allows the manipulation of the cladding layers&#39; internal and external mechanical properties to the desired surface and bulk properties. To verify the usefulness of this method, the wear resistance test of the Inconel-718 cladding layer at high temperatures of 200 and 400 °C was performed, and it was confirmed that the wear resistance was improved to 25.4\% and 14.4\%, respectively. This work analyzes the wear-resistant characteristics with and without UNSM treatment in the DED process. The proposed method is a promising way to change the internal mechanical properties of the cladding layer with high controllability and repeatability.},

To address the current difficulties in treating biofilm infections, we fabricate a functional strontium doped bioactive glass nanoparticles (Sr-BGNs)-instructed orthopedic implant composed of PEEK, Sr-BGNs and polydopamine (PDA). In addition to destroying the permeability and integrity of MRSA biofilm, PDA also endowed PEEK substrate with effective antibacterial ability when exposing to near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. The NIR mediated photothermal disruption of biofilms contributed to the advanced antibacterial therapy, which has been validated by the efficient eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains ( MRSA ) biofilm in vitro and in vivo . Notably, the engineered implants exhibit satisfactory cytocompatibility. In addition, Sr ions released from Sr-BGNs inhibited the expression of inflammatory genes, thereby providing a superior environment for tissue repair after infection clearance. The synergistic effect of photothermal effect and immunomodulatory property might have promising applications for preventing perioperative infection and tissue repair after infection.},

  abstract     = {The dimensions, particularly the depths, of glued laminated timber (GLT) beams are continuously increasing to realize, e.g., wide-span hall constructions or flexible office buildings. However, experimental investigations of large beams are unavailable because of the tremendous effort involved. Numerical simulation campaigns represent an alternative, but their results are heavily influenced by the modeling strategy, and therefore, a different influence of the beam depths on the bending strength was obtained. To predict this influence, also called size effect, we carried out a simulation program covering 8840 GLT beams ranging from 165 mm to 3300 mm in depth, using advanced modeling concepts including discrete cracking and plasticity. We observed a decreasing characteristic bending strength with increasing beam depths and an almost constant mean modulus of elasticity for both considered strength classes. Additionally, the influence of the beam length on the bending strength is analyzed, and it is shown that this influence can be described reasonably well with a simple analytical model based on Weibull’s strength theory. In conclusion, the effective material behavior of GLT is affected by its dimensions. For large beams, this influence is difficult to obtain experimentally; however, numerical simulation campaigns seem to be a promising way to accomplish this.},

To further improve the self-healing effect of fiber concrete, a new strategy of fiber modification for self-healing is proposed herein. In this study, polypropylene (PP) fibers were coated with nano calcium carbonate as nano seedings and ethyl cellulose film as a protective layer. The protective layer can inhibit the interactions of coated nano seedings with cement matrix before cracking. While after mortar mixing and cracking, the protective layer was gradually removed due to shear stress in mixing and friction during fiber pull-out in cracking processes, respectively. With the elimination of the protective layer, the remaining nano calcium carbonate coating at around 5.6\% of fiber mass could be exposed to cracks, thereby accelerating healing product generations by hydration and calcium carbonate precipitation, which was verified by scanning electron microscopic observations, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetry analysis. Owing to the effects of modified fibers, closure of 300–500 μm wide cracks was enhanced and 100\% recovery of water tightness was subsequently achieved.},

At present, exploring the complex voltage decay mechanism of LRM is the main task to promote its commercialization. Herein, the structural evolution and transition metal valence state change of LRM during different reaction stages under different temperatures are discussed, and the mechanism of voltage decay is finally determined based on the electrochemical properties. The results show the evolution of irreversible thermodynamic structure is the fundamental cause leading to voltage decay of LRM cathode, and it worsens with increasing temperature. The early activation of inert Mn, multiple phase transitions, migration of transition metals to the surface, anisotropy of internal valence states caused by partial valence failure and severe interfacial reactions are all strong proofs of the above views. In summary, the reason for voltage decay is revealed by investigating the sensitivity of the LRM cathode materials to temperature. This work not only provides strong evidence for the mechanism of the voltage decay, but also points out the direction to modification design for achieving future commercialization of LRM cathode materials.},

Additionally, the metallocene-based CMOPPs possess a specific surface area (SSA) value as high as 716.3 m 2 g −1 , abundant micropores, high heterogeneous catalysis and redox activity. The pyrolyzed derivatives at high temperatures consist of Fe 3 C/C and Fe/C nanostructures, and possess characteristic ferromagnetism. Generally, constructing of stable MOPMs is realized by strong covalent bond bridging.

We demonstrated that the genipin (GP), an aglycone of geniposide (GE) transformed by β -glucosidase, can react with methylamine (MA), a harmful metabolite in the gut, to produce gardenia blue in vivo , which leads to a significant decrease of MA. The gardenia blue is supramolecular assemblies (SA), which can alleviate the interference with intestinal bacteria. Moreover, the formation mechanism of SA was revealed, in which genimethylamine reacted from GP and MA, was covalently polymerized into dimers and then non-covalently self-assembled into the SA. This study provides evidence that the supramolecular pigments can be formed in vivo during the metabolism of Chinese medicine through simultaneously covalent and non-covalent assembly, which may play key roles in their pharmacological activity.},

In this work, Ni alloy 625 produced using different AM techniques was comparatively analyzed in terms of process-related defects, microstructure and corrosion behavior. Specimens manufactured via MEX, laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB), and directed energy deposition (DED-LB) were investigated. The MEX-produced samples showed micropores and periodically-arranged elongated macro-defects. These were analyzed in terms of image analysis and micro computed tomography. The resulting void 3D structure was mainly constituted by a grid of hollow channels, mimicking the ± 45° scanning strategy adopted. The microstructure was mainly constituted by Mo-, Nb- and Si-rich precipitates in a Ni matrix. The second phases had a blocky morphology in the core part of the material. Conversely, an elongated shape following the grain boundaries was detected in the contour. These microstructural variations impacted on the response of the alloy in an aggressive environment (ASTM G28-A). In fact, the core underwent a localized attack, whilst the contour part was characterized by a negligible effect, as assessed in the PBF-LB and DED-LB-processed specimens.},

In this study, we designed a customized porous scaffold rabbit radius based on a body-centered cubic unit. Borate bioactive glass/polycaprolactone (BBG/PCL) composite scaffolds with different BBG contents (0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 20\%, and 40\%) were fabricated using selective laser sintering. The pore geometry, porosity, mechanical strength, hydrophilicity, protein absorption, degradation behavior, in vitro cytocompatibility, and osteogenesis differentiation of the composite scaffolds were systematically characterized. The in vivo biological properties of the BBG/PCL composite scaffold for CSBD repair were assessed using a rabbit foreleg radius defect model. The results indicate that the BBG/PCL composite scaffold with 20\% BBG content effectively promoted the proliferation of osteoblasts and repaired the rabbit radius defects. The mechanical strength of the scaffold was sufficient to maintain the integrity of the scaffold structure during a relatively long CSBD repair. Our results indicate that the BBG/PCL composite scaffold can be anticipated to be a promising biomaterial for CSBD repair.},

Therefore, intra-articular injection of rapamycin, a classical mTORC1 inhibitor, may show great potential for alleviating synovitis and delaying cartilage destruction in osteoarthritis (OA). However, the durable retention of drugs in the joint cavity is still a critical issue to be addressed. Herein, we crosslinked the Poloxamer 407 and hyaluronic acid (P-HA) to prepare an injectable and thermo-responsive drug delivery system to durably retain rapamycin and dramatically magnify their therapeutic effects in OA management. The prepared P-HA hydrogel showed excellent biocompatibility with chondrocytes and fibroblasts, as well as possessed sustained rapamycin release profiles for 14 days. Intra-articular injection of this rapamycin-incorporated P-HA hydrogel indicated a positively effect on inducing the polarization of synovial macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype and reducing synovial inflammation in OA. This strategy significantly decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines ( e.g. , TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine ( e.g. , IL-10) expression in the synovial tissues and synovial fluid. As a result, intra-articular injection of rapamycin-incorporated P-HA hydrogel significantly prevented cartilage destruction by inducing cartilage matrix formation, which suggesting a great potential for the management of OA.},

  abstract     = {Pain management plays an essential role in medical care. Previous studies showed that pain is a dynamic process involving multiple mechanisms, which inspired the concept of multimodal analgesia. Therefore, a drug delivery system loaded with a single analgesic may be insufficient for pain control. In this study, an implantable thermogel/electrospun fiber (Gel/Fiber) system loaded with bupivacaine hydrochloride (BUP-HCl) and acetaminophen (APAP) was synthesized. In the composite, BUP-HCl was preferentially released from the hydrophilic thermogel to relieve nociceptive pain, followed by the release of APAP in a more sustained manner from hydrophobic fibers to reduce the inflammatory reaction. Pain behavioral study and activation assay of spinal glial cells in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model demonstrated the superior analgesic efficacy and chronic pain prevention property of the Gel/Fiber system. Furthermore, the composite exhibited satisfactory biocompatibility, as shown by histological and pharmacokinetic analysis. These results indicate that the successful sequential BUP-HCl/APAP release by a Gel/Fiber system alleviates chronic pain with good biocompatibility.Our study may pave the way for the future application of extended-delivery systems.},

Herein, an injectable Fmoc-Phe3 hydrogel (FPH) with ceria nanoparticle (CNP) and erythropoietin (EPO) was prepared (EPO/CNP@FPH) for local drug delivery into the irregular periodontal pocket. The release of EPO and CNP was 61.33\% and 69.67\% respectively within the first 3 days and the release of CNP was faster than that of EPO during the process, which is the prerequisite for regeneration. The composite hydrogel enabled the switch in macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2 polarization by scavenging redundant ROS. It further increased the ability of angiogenesis and osteogensis. The EPO/CNP@FPH composite hydrogel exerted a remarkable therapeutic effects enabling irregular alveolar bone regeneration in rat model of periodontitis. Taken together, the hydrogel loaded with EPO and CNP showed a great potential for reducing inflammation and promoting periodontal regeneration in irregular regions, which may be a promising candidate for periodontitis treatment.},

  abstract     = {Plant-derived preservatives exhibit excellent antifungal effects. However, their antifungal active ingredients can easily leach out. A properly designed functional response system can help realize the responsive release of preservatives and reduce leaching. Herein, the pH-responsive preservatives delivery system was designed and synthesized. The preservative (Forsythia) was encapsulated with hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (HMONs), and carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were employed as mesoporous plugging agents. Forsythia’s release was achieved by grafting pH-sensitive chemical bonds on the surface of the carrier. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and antifungal results showed that the pH-responsive switch was successfully broken. After 12 weeks of soil-jar incubation, the weight loss rate of treated wood was 2\% ± 0.5\%. The leaching of Forsythia–HMON–CQDs was lower than that of Forsythia under the same concentration. The design of the system reduced the leaching of Forsythia and extended the service life of wood. In addition, the system was also applicable to ammoniacal copper quat (ACQ). Forsythia–HMON–CQDs showed an outstanding fixation effect and antifungal ability, and its fluorescence can be used to track distribution in wood. This system can be extensively employed in protecting antifungal active ingredients and demonstrates an effective strategy for developing potential bio-based wood preservatives.},

An increase in Co content promoted the precipitation of the B2 phase from the body-centered cubic (BCC) matrix, and the content of the B2 phase was greater than that of the BCC phase at x = 4, thus replacing the BCC phase as the matrix, which contributed to the optimization of the soft magnetic properties of the AlCoFeCr HEA. The SMPC composed of the BCC single phase exhibits the lowest eddy current loss ( P e ) of 55.1 mW/cm 3 (@100 kHz, 50 mT), excellent direct current (DC) bias performance of 80.6\% at 100 Oe, and high stable effective permeability ( μ e ) of 49.9 up to 1 MHz. The association of magnetic domains, grain size, and particle size with H c variation was analyzed, providing guidelines for subsequent studies to obtain HEAs with good soft magnetic properties. By comprehensively and systematically comparing the microstructural differences of diverse matrix-phase HEAs and SMPCs, the specific application of this HEA system under high-temperature conditions can be expanded.},

Three substrates with different coefficients of thermal expansion and electrical conductivity were used. To investigate the microstructure, phase composition, residual stress state, and mechanical properties, ex-situ and in situ synchrotron experiments were conducted accompanied by electron microscopy and nanoindentation. As-deposited Cr-Al-C coatings consisted of amorphous and crystalline areas, with the ratio highly dependent on the deposition process and substrate. The crystalline phase was identified as metastable (Cr,Al) 2 C. The highest crystallinity was determined for DCMS coatings. Increasing temperature and decreasing bias voltage increased coating crystallinity for HPPMS coatings. The influence of the deposition process and bias voltage was highly reduced for the substrate with low electrical conductivity. In-situ investigations of the stress state of amorphous areas revealed, that those were acting as a residual stress buffer. The hardness and Young’s modulus of the coatings were found to increase with crystallinity and were slightly increased for crystalline HPPMS coatings compared to DCMS coatings.},

A novel image processing method and spatters feature extraction algorithm were used to obtain the spatter number, the total spatter area, the spattering angle and the spattering velocity of 8 scenarios. With the comparative analysis, scan direction against the gas flow (SD-A) is proved to produce fewer droplet spatters than scan direction with the gas flow (SD-W), and the quantitative relationship between the gas flow parameters and the droplet spatter behavior is established for the first time. The maximum spattering velocity increases to 12.8 m/s as the gas flow velocity rise to 2.5 m/s. Finally, the mechanisms of the droplet spatter behavior influenced by gas flow parameters are discussed.

Hemostatic sponges made of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose make up the top and bottom layers. An anti-adhesion fibrous membrane with poly-lactic- co -glycolic acid and polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid block copolymer made up the intermediate layer. As a physical barrier, the intermediate layer preserved the morphological integrity for more than a week. Following hemostasis, the layers of the sponges and the blood clot may degrade quickly, reducing the inflammation and fibrin deposition around the wound.

Herein, a new organic CP compound (Ppordpp) with the donor-acceptor structure of porphyrin and diketopyrrolopyrrole was synthesized, which showed efficient absorption extending in NIR-II and spontaneously self-assembled into NPs (∼190 nm), leading to emission quenching and facilitating nonradiative thermal generation.

Uncompressed mycelium-bound composites have typically weak mechanical properties, similar to that of expanded polystyrene. In this paper, mycelium is grown onto porous woodpile struts structures to increase the final mechanical properties. The hypothesis is that increase in porosity can increase oxygen diffusion throughout the material and increase the development of dense mycelium network. Mycelium-bound composites grown from P. ostreatus onto bamboo microfibers substrates were studied to test this hypothesis. Constructing porous woodpile structures and monitoring the growth and the mechanical properties under compression, it was found that the porosity obtained through the design was able to increase dense fungal mycelium skin formation. As a result, the stiffness of the porous structures was multiplied by 6 after 28 days of growth. The specific modulus was in turned multiplied by 4 with the addition of 30\% macroscopic porosity. Despite the modest mechanical properties (stiffness about 0.5 MPa), the approach proposed illustrates how appropriate structural design can efficiently increase the properties of grown bio-based materials.},

But the natural microstructures for fluid transportation are usually difficult to manufacture and adjust. Here we find that some fibers (the diameters &lt; 10 μm) deposited by electrohydrodynamic direct-writing(EDW) can be directly used for micro/nanofluidic transportation due to the geometries of fibers. The liquid paraffin (its minimum width &lt; 100 nm) can transport along the circular fiber because of the wedge microcavities formed by circular fiber and substrate. Ultrafast directional water transport (about 22 mm/s) has been achieved by oblique elliptic fiber array which has been placed at a distance of 300 μm above the substrate. Moreover, we found that the contact angles of the test liquids on the substrates and on the fiber materials also play a crucial role in this structure. So electrowetting has been used to change the contact angles of water on the substrate to fast switch (response time &lt; 0.4 s) direction of water transport. We think electrohydrodynamic direct-writing the fibers with various geometries opens up new low-cost, high efficiency, fast and accurate pathways to realize fabric-based wearable microfluidic device.},

However, in actual manufacturing, there is still a lack of theoretical guidance; hence, rebound defects are commonly observed. In this paper, a bending angle distribution function with an optimized segmented boundary combination is proposed to improve the forming quality and reduce the rebound defects in multi-pass roll forming. For cap-shaped sheets, COPRA, a roll-bending simulation software, is used to investigate the bending angle distribution to optimize the process of cap-shaped roll-bending. Furthermore, the stress and strain distributions in the sheets after each forming pass is analyzed using finite element simulation. The influence law of different bending angle parameters on the quality of sheets is obtained. The finite element simulation is verified by comparing the experimental results of the change law of rebound defects of cap-shaped parts under different bending angle distribution conditions. Based on the segmented boundary combination of bending angle optimization functions, the stress and strain distributions in the sheets during roll-bending forming of the cap-shaped parts are improved, the rebound defects in the bending area are smaller, and the forming quality is better than the other bending angle distribution methods.},

  abstract     = {The present study focused on the investigation of the resorption behavior of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treated bone allografts in vitro by analyzing the differentiation and activity of osteoclast precursors. HHP is known to be an efficient method for devitalization of bone grafts and a gentle alternative compared to conventional processing. While bone resorption is part of the physiological fracture healing, highly processed allografts are prone to excessive degradation, which ultimately leads to graft failure. The influence of HHP treatment on the extent of resorption was analyzed in bone blocks cultivated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Data on gene and protein expression as well as histological alterations were obtained. The present study showed that an application of 500 MPa led to significant osteoclastic differentiation and activity which was observed already after 8 h of incubation. Whereas a treatment of 250 MPa resulted also in the differentiation of PBMCs, osteoclastic activity was similar to the untreated control. Thus, the pressure level of HHP is crucial for the extent of degradation processes. Based on our results a treatment with 500 MPa might not be suitable for allografts intended for subsequent clinical applications. This study provides a basis for further experiments including in vivo studies which should focus on the equilibrium of bone formation and bone resorption.},

This study focused on the precipitation features of WAAM-produced high-nitrogen Cr-Mn steel containing 0.7 wt\% nitrogen. When the isothermal post-heat treatment was conducted at approximately 900 °C, the σ phase dominated the original inter-dendritic ferrite (Inter-F) region. And, there were some secondary austenite precipitates (γ 2 ) along with a small amount of Cr 2 N. The oxide inclusions (especially the MnO particles) provided excellent nucleation sites for the σ phase in the Inter-F region or at the Inter-F and γ matrix interface due to the high interface energy and lattice matching index. Further, when aging above 1000 °C, no σ phase was found, and the decomposition of the Inter-F to γ matrix was dominated by element diffusion. With the precipitation of the σ phase, a typical brittle fracture was observed in the samples aged at low temperatures of 800 °C and 900 °C.},

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and rheological properties tests showed that SF-HPCMA bioink had suitable porosity, pore size, more β-sheets, and excellent rheological properties. The mechanical property measurement results showed that the compression modulus of SF-HPCMA scaffolds reached that of normal cartilage. In vitro experiments demonstrated that SF-HPCMA scaffolds were highly biocompatible and could effectively promote the proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and that the cartilage tissue produced by in vitro culture was of higher quality. At 12 weeks after implantation of SF-HPCMA scaffolds into the rabbit knee cartilage defects, the SF-HPCMA scaffolds could effectively repair the articular cartilage defects.

Herein, an epoxy additive (ETP) was prepared by grafting phosphorus-containing molecules into the skeleton of silicone resin through silicon hydrogen addition reaction. Through such a design, the obtained ETP imparted Bisphenol A epoxy resin (DGEBA) with excellent flexibility, fire safety, hydrophobicity and dielectrical property. When only 6 wt\% of ETP was introduced into the DGEBA system, the resulting product (ETP-6) passed the V-0 level in the UL-94 test with a high limiting oxygen index of 29.8\%, which could be ascribed to the presence of phosphorus and silicon element. Meanwhile, compared with neat DGEBA, the peak heat releases and smoke emissions of ETP-6 were reduced by 32.7\% and 37.8\% during the combustion. Additionally, ETP also imparted the cured product with excellent hydrophobic and dielectric properties, as well as superior toughness (114.5\% increase in impact strength) due to its “rigid and flexible” silicone skeleton and good dispersion. This work opens up a new strategy for developing high-performance and multifunctional epoxy resin additives with potential versatile applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the evolutionary characteristics of microstructural hydration and chloride migration in ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC). The physicochemical interactions of constituents are simulated in conjunction with a random walk algorithm. When the hydration of cementitious pastes proceeds, accompanied by the evolution of hardening, the quantity of silicates becomes larger alongside irregularly dispersed byproducts (calcium silica hydrate, C-S-H, and calcium hydroxide, CH). Owing to the formation of pozzolanic C-S-H consuming CH, the silicate reactions of UHPC are less than the reactions of the ordinary concrete. The implications of tricalcium silicate (C 3 S) are notable for the early-age strength gain of UHPC in comparison with its dicalcium silicate (C 2 S) counterpart. The matured pozzolanic reactions and invariable packing density of UHPC are responsible for preserving the proportion of silica fume in the mixtures. Relative to UHPC, the ordinary concrete releases more heat caused by exothermic reactions that are a function of saturated pores and silica fume with the contribution of C 3 S. Regarding corrosion durability, the chloride contents of a bridge deck cast with the ordinary concrete exceed the content of a deck with UHPC. As part of technology transfer, the notion of performance-based design applies and practice guidelines are suggested.},

However, the existing polymer foams still have some performance limitations and cannot meet the application demands in a wider range of situations. Accordingly, herein, an innovative strategy based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) melt blending and CO 2 microcellular foaming was proposed for the fabrication of lightweight high-performance polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) foams for heat insulation, and ultralight, tough, and hydrophobic foams with outstanding heat insulation and shape memory performances were successfully prepared. Because of the plasticization of PVDF and nucleation of PVDF microcrystals, the foaming temperature window of PMMA substantially descended, and the cellular structure of PMMA became refined. Blend foams with expansion ratios of 36.2, cell sizes of 15.8 μm, and foam densities of 0.0357 g∙cm −3 were obtained at 130 °C. Due to higher porosity and strong infrared absorption ability of PMMA, the resulting foams exhibited thermal conductivities of less than 32 mW∙m −1 ∙K −1 . Owing to the hydrophobicity and incombustibility of PVDF and its microcrystals, the blend foams demonstrated better hydrophobicities, shape memory properties, and flame retardancies. This study provides an effective way for the green and mass production of high-performance polymer foams with appropriate thermal insulation performances.},

Carrier motions on the bedplate were traced by mathematical functions, where corresponding yarn spatial paths within a representative volume element (RVE) were explored. A parametric finite element model (FEM) of 3D rotary-four-directional (3DR4d) braided composites was established considering realistic yarn cross-sections. A progressive damage model was used to predict the mechanical performance of the composites. Experiments were conducted to verify the proposed model. The results show that the ideal yarn topology of the rotary braided composites is similar to the lattice structure. In addition, the longitudinal tensile modulus and strength of 3DR4d braided composites increase with the decreased braiding angles, while increasing with the increased fiber volume fractions. According to damage analysis, longitudinal tension and transverse shear are the dominant failure modes of 3DR4d composites with small and large braiding angles, respectively.},

But the simultaneous improvement of both homogeneity and ionic crosslinking density remains as a challenge for toughing DN hydrogels. Herein, an in situ inhibition method is proposed to solve this problem. In this method, inhibitor is generated in situ to form a physical barrier around the ionic crosslinker, thereby decreasing the ionic crosslinking rate and further toughening DN hydrogels in a controllable manner. The chemical structure, micromorphology and mechanical properties were investigated, and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to reveal the inhibition mechanism. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirm the formation of inhibitors. It is revealed that the introduction of inhibitor can decrease ionic crosslinking rate, leading to an improvement in homogeneity and mechanical properties. The fracture energy of alginate-Ca 2+ /polyacrylamide (PAAm) DN hydrogels is up to 19,638 ± 947 J/m 2 , which is notably larger than the previously reported values (9000–16,000 J/m 2 ). The inhibitor does not affect the chemical structures, thermal stability and micromorphology. This in situ inhibition method has significant potential to become a general method to toughen DN hydrogels containing ionically crosslinked networks, which will greatly promote the usage of hydrogels in diverse engineering applications.},

To bridge the gap in the wider application of these materials, the role of plant root structure and an agar-agar matrix are explored in relation to the mechanical properties of the EPRMs. Tensile tests were performed on five root configurations, ranging from single roots to grids of varying sizes. Heterogeneities in each configuration suggest poor load distribution throughout the structure. Agar-agar was introduced as a biopolymer matrix to improve load distribution and tensile properties. Digital microscopy at the intersection of grid cells suggests a correlation between cell size, root tip density, and material strength.

The effects of tool pin length and FSLW times on the microstructure and mechanical properties of dissimilar joints were fully investigated by means of Optical Microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), and mechanical testing. The results show that as pin length increased, joint strength tended to increase and then decrease, and the tensile failure partially occurred at aluminium base metal. However, with additional number of FSLW, joint strength would be reduced, which was attributed to attenuated dislocation density and strain concertation in dissimilar joint. The research outcomes will provide a new welding method to obtain sound Al-Fe dissimilar metal joint, and benefit to a better understanding of Al-Fe joining mechanism.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, solidification and growth features were systematically studied during fibre laser welding 304 stainless steel to T2 copper. Via orientation-composition combination detection, Cr-rich ferrite (δ), Ni-rich austenite (γ) and pure Cu phases were precisely clarified. Close to the fusion line on the steel side, strict epitaxial growth from γ substrate grains produced continuous and uniform crystalline orientations for both γ and Cu phases. In the vicinity of α/ε junctures, similar orientation identities of γ and Cu were maintained until the presence of δ. Morphologically, δ presented globular and dendritic forms in the ε structure with dispersive γ spheres and Cu grains. These outcomes indicated that δ particles produced direct or immediate interruptions, thus leading to localized refined γ and Cu grains. By metallurgical analyses, such refinement was primarily attributed to initial δ dispersion and its subsequent chemical or mechanical blocking-up on γ and Cu by forming K-S, N -W and G-T relationship orientations. Additionally, solidified γ also exerted accordant growth of Cu. In summary, the substantial method to obtain identical refinements of δ, γ and Cu grains depended naturally on the dispersed and uniform precipitation of priorly precipitated δ.},

A phase separation based one-step microfluidic preparation process was demonstrated to generate triple-phase Janus microparticles with different degradation properties in each phase. In this system, particles with a series of complicated structures were generated, and programmed degradation behaviors according to the structures were achieved. Partial degradation of the particles and cargo release triggered by change of ambient temperature or pH could be realized as well. Further, graphene nanosheets and silica nanospheres were modified in the microparticles by using the principle of Pickering emulsion to enrich the functions of the particles. To reveal the potential of the particles in drug delivery applications, doxorubicin and curcumin were co-loaded in triple-phase microparticles, and zonal drug loading was achieved. In vitro drug release profiles and tumor cell apoptosis study indicated that the particles provided programmed release behavior as well as enhanced tumor inhibition efficacy compared with free drug administration and monophasic particles. This study proposed a facile and one-step fabrication method of multiphasic particles possessing programmed and triggered drug release kinetics, and may be the first attempt to generate triple-phase particles with phase separation method in a droplet microfluidic chip.},

An in situ quasi-static tensile test on a miniature dog bone sample is performed under an electron microscope up to 6.4\% true strain. A commercial digital image correlation program, VEDDAC, is used to process micrographs obtained at incremental strains to calculate the evolution of the local experimental strain distribution. The initial experimental micrograph was transformed into a geometry file for simulation model. In two different simulation models, the ceramic/matrix interface is assumed once to be perfect, and secondly, the interface is modeled using cohesive elements. The results showed that the stress concentration sites of the cohesive model continuously change along the interface because of the effect of debonding, while it maintains its position in the non-cohesive model. At 6.4\% global strain, the relative error of the strain between the DIC and the cohesive model is only 6\%. The numerical model with cohesive interface accurately predicts local stress and strain, as well as the position and evolution of damage accidents, and can therefore be reliably used by other researchers.},

We previously observed that the products of self-propagating formation reactions in Al/Zr/C nanolaminates differ dramatically from those obtained after heating slowly to any temperatures up to 1450 °C. Here we explore this heating-rate dependent phase formation in Al/Zr/C reactive nanolaminates through a combination of nanocalorimetry coupled with in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, as well as a suite of ex situ analyses. Specifically, we show that forming a cermet of ZrC + Al requires either a sufficiently high heating rate (such as is present during a self-propagating reaction) or quenching from high temperatures ( ≈ ≈ 1600 °C), demonstrating the utility of high heating rates to produce desirable phases.},

We identified a set of key feature combinations closely related to T p , by exploiting Pearson correlation selection, univariate feature selection, and forward feature elimination. The established ML model was then used to estimate the T p of three newly synthesized alloys, with their prediction relative errors of less than 3\% in comparison with the experimental measurements. The behaviors of our ML model were interpreted by the Shapley Additive exPlainations (SHAP) approach, demonstrating the crucial role of CV22 (Allred Rochow electronegativity) in the prediction of T p . In addition, the ML model in combination with our designed interpretation strategy was further used to investigate the effects of alloying elements on the T p , which showed that the TiZrHfNiCoCu HESMAs with 9 ≦ Co (mol\%) ≤ 10 and 15 ≦ Cu (mol\%) ≤ 17 have pronounced positive effects on T p .},

Mimicking such behavior would enable the design of biologically inspired functions. Hydrogel actuators are promising candidate materials capable of stimuli-responsive movements via water uptake and release. Here, for the first time, the adaptive-like movement of reprogrammable hydrogel actuators is demonstrated by integrating two independent functions: a temperature-triggered actuation and a medium- and pH-based modulated swelling, into one multiphase network. Reversible crystallization of poly( ε -caprolactone) (PCL) provided bending movements up to 71° (realized by temperature changes between 5 °C and 40 °C). Changing solvent from water to ethanol increased swellability up to 240 vol\%. Bending angles decreased by 32° as some PCL fractions are dissolved in ethanol and cannot participate in the crystallization-induced elongation guiding the movement. When the actuators were modified with acrylic acid moieties, a modulated swelling between 270 vol\% at pH = 13 and 130 vol\% at pH = 1 was achieved. The resulting swelling/deswelling response induced reversible bending movements up to 54°. In consequence, the coupled functionalities (actuation and modulated swelling) resulted in conditioned actuation behavior as an intermediate feature between stimuli-sensitivity and adaptivity.},

Numerous studies have been performed on polymer and fibre component modifications, yet utilising fillers in epoxy is a promising way to improve interface toughness. Here, a molecularly designed core–shell particle (CSP) is introduced into the epoxy polymer to generate a strong interface through an epoxy coupling agent acrylate shell and styrene-butadiene rubber core. The nanocomposite material, in particular, has an excellent tensile strength of 166\% and exceptional elongation of 245\%; these properties further improve the interlaminar shear strength of 225\% in carbon fibre-reinforced polymer composite. Moreover, CSP gives better shear effects and stress transferability to the fibre–matrix interface region. It was clarified systematically by developing a 3D micro- and macro-mechanical model from field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and surface fracture analysis. Meanwhile, results suggest that effective toughness is achieved by well-dispersed and void growth, filler-epoxy interaction and strong matrix-fibre interfaces. With these features, this study emphasises a way to analyse composite structures and fibre laminates which can help engineering design strategies for various applications.},

In the past decade, considerable efforts have been made to attenuate Rayleigh waves using EMMs. However, the complex nonlinear behaviour of soil renders the realisation of existing EMMs challenging in practical engineering. To overcome this limitation, we present a new seismic metamaterial surface (SMMS) to isolate Rayleigh waves over a broad frequency range of 3.2–19.2 Hz. First, we discuss the propagation velocity of Rayleigh waves in EMMs and determine a reasonable design range for the effective dynamic material properties of the SMMS for seismic surface wave attenuation. Then, we construct a unit cell and demonstrate that these properties, both in band gaps and negative bands, lie within this specified design range. The negative bands are initially introduced into Rayleigh wave mitigation. Finally, a new type of SMMS is presented and validated using numerical results and scaled experiments. The results show that the vertical deformation on the surface can be decreased by more than 96\%. The findings reported here open new avenues for protecting engineering structures from low-frequency seismic vibrations.},

To investigate the refinement of coarse grains, multi-directional isothermal forging (MDIF) was carried out on samples cut from an ingot weighing about three tons. The results showed that the alloy can be refined by MDIF after 4 passes with 40\% reduction per compression at 1200℃, while it cannot be refined even after 10 passes with 30\% reduction per compression at 1200℃ or with 40\% reduction per compression at 1050℃. The investigation showed that, as an intermetallics with low strain hardening rate, the material is very difficult to be refined by recrystallization if only increasing the total strain. The special refinement mechanism, i.e. , grain thinning and shearing (GTS) induced recrystallization, is proposed. The reduction per compression is crucial to refine the coarse grains of this alloy. Coarse grains should be firstly squashed and thinned by large reduction, and then bent and bowed to form shear bands in the following perpendicular compressions. Coarse grains are truncated by repeated shearing, and the truncation increases interfaces within the coarse grains and contributes to the local misorientation accumulation, which in turn promotes the completion of recrystallization.},

Highly orientated conductive pathways are achieved in the sample by selecting appropriate printing parameters. Scanning electron microscopy and tunnelling atomic force microscopy confirm that the conductive traces are essentially composed of aligned CNTs. The printing process determines an increase in the electrical conductivity from 6.88 × 10 -2 (spooled filament) to 11.9 S/m (printed filament). The orientation of the spatial domains from the macro- to nanoscale is responsible for a decrease in the electrical resistance from 7782 (90° raster angle sample) tο 478 Ω (0° raster angle sample). Appropriate selection of the configuration and dimensions of electrical contacts confers the ability to selectively heat the part when subjected to an electric source. Temperature differences up to 55 °C were obtained in samples printed with a double-angle raster combination by changing the applied voltage from 20 to 40 V.

However, these features are typically entangled, and a feasible strategy for independently manipulating the microwave absorption and mechanical resistance is still lacking. Herein, a double high-impedance surface-loaded honeycomb (DHHC) is proposed, based on a theoretical analysis, and fabricated using a 3D printing technique. The impedance and surface current distribution of the DHHC were analyzed and investigated to achieve broadband microwave absorption characteristics. The structural parameters and resistances of the high-impedance surface were investigated and optimized to regulate the absorbing bandwidth and reflectivity intensity. Our experimental results indicated that a 4.25 mm thick DHHC metastructure can achieve a –10 dB absorbing bandwidth at a frequency range of 6.73–18 GHz, as well as a –15 dB absorbing band at 8.42–14.75 GHz. Moreover, the structural parameters of the honeycombs were investigated for the adjustment of stress distributions during the compression and flexural processes. Load-bearing tests indicated that the DHHC possessed a mechanical resistance with an equivalent areal density of 2.32 kg/m 2 . This study provides a promising route for achieving independently manipulated compatibility between microwave absorption and mechanical resistance for practical applications.},

This study characterized the strength distribution of selected thermoplastic matrix composites as a function of printing via fused filament fabrication (FFF). Experimental and commercial composite filaments of continuous carbon or Kevlar fibers were printed with volume fraction (V f ) ranging from approximately 28 to 56\%. The strength was evaluated under uniaxial tension after specific stages of printing and Weibull statistics were applied to characterize the strength distribution. There was a significant reduction in strength of the printed material with respect to the unprinted condition, regardless of reinforcement type, fiber volume fraction or printer used. Damage introduced by feed extrusion of the filament, and fiber failures induced at material deposition were most detrimental. For carbon fiber filaments, the reduction ranged from approximately 10\% for an experimental material to over 60\% for a commercial filament. There was no correlation in the strength degradation or variability with V f . The prevention of process-related fiber damage is key to advancing AM for continuous fiber composite and application to designs intended for stress-critical applications.},

The correlation between slip traces in the vicinity of nanoindents and crystallographic orientation data allowed us to gain statistical data on the activated slip and crack planes for 10 different crystallographic orientations. Slip on {1 1 1} and {1 1 2} planes was found to be most favourable for all orientations, whereas cracks predominantly occurred on {1 1 2} planes. A constant hardness of 4.9 ± 0.7 GPa and an indentation modulus of 85.5 ± 4.0 GPa for all investigated orientations for a constant strain rate and a strain rate sensitivity of 0.028 ± 0.019 were measured.

The experimental results indicated that the tensile behavior and flow stress are sensitive to temperature. The brittle to ductile transition temperature of Ti-45Al-8Nb alloy additively manufactured by electron beam melting is between 700 and 750 ℃. Below this temperature, the fracture was predominantly trans -granular, resulting in brittle failure. In addition, the brittle failure behavior is related to the localization of deformation within the grains and stress concentrations owing to plastic incompatibility at the interface of the α 2 + γ α2+γ phases. However, above this temperature, the fracture transformed from the trans -granular type to the mixed mode of trans -granular and ductile dimples. Dynamic recovery and recrystallization are the primary processes leading to softening behavior. The flow behavior at elevated temperatures results from the competition between work hardening and softening. Furthermore, the Chaboche model was used to describe the tensile inelastic behavior at different temperatures.},

In offensive and defensive confrontations, laser weapons pose a serious threat to the survival of stealth equipment. However, the interaction mechanism between the metamaterials and laser and the effect of laser ablation on microwave absorption performance are still unclear. In this work, we firstly irradiated the double arc-shaped Cu-atom array/FR-4 matrix metamaterials by using a high-energy continuous-wave laser and studied the interaction and response mechanism between them. The high temperature caused by laser irradiation leads to the melting of the metal atoms and the pyrolysis of the resin matrix. By simulating and testing the reflection loss of the metamaterials before and after irradiation, we found that the resin pyrolysis products strongly affect the impedance matching characteristics and reduce the microwave absorption properties significantly in extreme cases. Our findings help deeply understand the interaction between the metamaterials and the laser and will show guidance in the applications involving laser-metamaterial interactions.},

The design method of geometric parameters of stable superhydrophobic silica glass surface structures with a periodic micropillar array is studied based on the drag reduction mechanism of superhydrophobic surfaces. Combined with the plasma deposition process, the drag-reducing superhydrophobic silica glass surface is successfully prepared by femtosecond laser technology. The prepared drag-reducing superhydrophobic silica glass surface shows good composite wetting state stability under different test conditions. The drag-reducing superhydrophobic functional structure with a micropillar array is prepared at the bottom of the silica glass microchannels by femtosecond laser direct writing technology. Moreover, the effective integration of the silica glass microchannel structure and the drag-reducing functional structure is achieved. The preparation and flow performance test of microfluidic devices demonstrates that drag-reduction microchannels of silica glass can significantly reduce microfluidic flow resistance. The proposed method effectively improves the functional characteristics of ultrafast laser processing surface microchannels in silica glass and has broad application prospects in fluid flow and control.},

  abstract     = {The effects of non-affine thermal strain on the structure, defect activation and magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have been investigated in Gd 55 Co 20 Al 24.5 Si 0.5 metallic glass (MG). Maxwell-Voigt models are utilized to analyze the impact of cryogenic thermal cycling (CTC) on the evolution of heterogeneous structure in term of the activated defects during creep deformation. Two kinds of flow defects with different relaxation times are observed from the relaxation spectrum, which show different responses to CTC. A power law between the maximum magnetic entropy change and its peak temperature is uncovered for Gd-based MGs above 85 K, which breaks down below 85 K for the low Gd content MGs including the high-entropy MGs. Through adjusting the CTC number, the maximum magnetic entropy of the present MG is improved to 10.7 JKg -1 K −1 under 5 T, which is the largest among the Gd-based MGs with Curie temperature above 85 K. The enhancement of MCE is related to the increased fraction of solid-like zones in the amorphous matrix and nanocrystallization rendered by CTC treatment. This work sheds new insights into the correlation of MCE and nanoscale creep deformation with structural heterogeneity of MGs.},

Support structures are required in SLM to remove heat away from the process and reduce geometrical distortions. However, traditional support structure generation methods have some problems, such as low generation efficiency, difficulty in the removal and not meeting the fabrication requirements of lattice parts. Therefore, this article proposes a grid-tree composite support structure generation algorithm for lattice parts. First, optimize the build orientation of the lattice parts considering the surface quality of functional features and the processability of lattice structures. Then, identify the frame’s overhang area and the point overhang of lattice structures. Finally, generate the grid-tree composite support structure for lattice parts. We conducted experiments to verify our approach and compare our method with three supports of Magics RP. Experimental results reveal that our method is effective in reducing support volume and warpage deformation.},

Nanoskiving methodology has been confirmed as a feasible approach to preparing multidimensional nanostructures simply and efficiently utilizing ultramicrotome. However, the morphology, dimension, and microstructure of the nanowires will be altered by the tool geometry under extrusion and shearing during the nanoskiving process. Herein, a molecular dynamics simulation and experiments of cutting polycrystalline Au utilizing nanoskiving were performed, and the nanowire formation behavior caused by the variation of the tool geometry was analyzed. Smaller rake angle and larger tool cutting edge radius favor thicker chip thickness, larger high-stress areas, increased machining forces, as well as a shift in cutting formation mechanism from shear to extrusion shear. The reduction in the clearance angle only increases the high-stress areas and machining forces. The stress state and dislocation density within the chip and plastic deformation zone were closely related to the tool topography. The conclusions provide a thorough technical analysis of the mechanism of polycrystalline Au nanowire formation as well as theoretical guidance for the design and selection of tools for nanoskiving processes.},

Significant differences are observed between the force responses of TMPs with flat-foldable and load-bearing motions. Moreover, no initial peaks of force responses and plateau forces are observed in the long-stroke range by breaking load-bearing motions. In other words, the TMPs exhibit suitable properties for energy absorption. In addition, the force responses against dynamic loading are measured by projecting an impactor with a mass of over 100 kg, where the TMP with load-bearing motion completely absorbs high-impact energy. In conclusion, these findings enable the design of energy absorption structures that can be tailored to handle several types of collision scenarios over a wide energy range.},

  abstract     = {Self-adaptable materials with autonomous morphological transformation by sensing environmental changes have emerged as one of the most promising but challenging approaches for various chiral devices. Unlike previous work on reconfigurable chirality through human intervention, we proposed a temperature-adaptive chiral meta -device. It can autonomously sense the environment and manipulate the optical chirality through 3D-to-3D morphological transformation. As a proof of concept, a 3D morphable chiral meta -device was designed with shape memory alloy (SMA), resulting in reconfigurable circular dichroism (CD). The curving direction of SMA enables the meta -device to switch between left-handed, right-handed, and non-chirality by sensing environmental temperature. The analysis of surface currents and CD spectra reveals that the underlying physical mechanism behind the chirality originates from the surge of toroidal and electric quadrupole dipole moments. Simultaneously, the spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion is realized based on the Pancharatnam-Berry phase, where the topological charge is modulated by the environmental temperature. Encouragingly, this work paves the way for the self-adaptive chiral meta -devices with 3D morphological transformation and can be applied to a series of novel photon-spin-selective devices for optical communication and biosensing.},

Compared with the traditional multi-cell tubes, the proposed MFCS structure exhibits micro-folding lobes with shorter wavelength, resulting in larger energy absorption, higher energy absorption efficiency and a more stable and controllable deformation mode, with the mean crushing force almost reaching that of an ideal energy absorber. Moreover, the effects of the geometric coefficient of MFCS multi-cell tube on the energy absorption performance and deformation pattern were studied parametrically.

However, it exhibits relatively poor mechanical strength and cytocompatibility as well as slow degradation rate, hindering its potential application as bone repair material. In the present work, biodegradable Zn-1 wt\%Mg- n vol\%β-TCP ( n = 0, 1, 3, 5, 10) composites are fabricated via vacuum heating-press sintering to address the above concerns. The results show that the addition of magnesium (Mg) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) positively regulate the mechanical properties, degradation properties, and osteogenic activity of the composites. Zn-1 wt\%Mg-3 vol\%β-TCP possess the highest compressive yield strength of approximately 243.9 MPa compared with about 137.6 MPa of pure Zn. The in vitro corrosion rates of the Zn-1Mg-β-TCP composites are tunable between 0.428 and 0.546 mm/y. The 24-week in vivo experiments prove that the Zn-1Mg-β-TCP composites possess better osteogenic activity than that of pure Zn. In general, the Zn-1Mg-β-TCP composites exhibit suitable mechanical strength and degradation rate, coupled with their great biological activity, which are expected to provide reliable performance for clinical bone repair.},

The results showed that the acidic microenvironment could trigger drug release from MOF@PH featured by an increasing release proportion with pH decreasing. The cell assessment indicated that MOF@PH could suppress the inflammatory response of the nucleus pulposus significantly, downregulate the expression of related inflammatory markers (IL-6, ROS, NLRP-3 etc.) and promote the expression of nucleus pulposus specific markers. The administration of MOF@PH in rat disc degeneration model was proven able to effectively delay the degeneration process.

  abstract     = {In the present work, duplex stainless steels (DSSs) SAF2507 were friction stir processed with flowing cryogenic medium mixed with liquid nitrogen and industrial ethanol. Homogeneous ultrafine grained (UFG) dual-phase structure with ferrite (α) and austenite (γ) grains with average size of around 1 μm was obtained due to the significantly lower peak temperature and shorter high-temperature duration. The developed UFG dual-phase structure enabled a dramatic enhancement of yield strength by about 22\%, while maintaining a high elongation of 55\% owing to the excellent strain hardening capacity. The grain refinement and increased number of α/γ interfaces were dominantly responsible for the significantly improved YS, while the massive development of geometrically necessary dislocations around the deformation incompatible α/γ interfaces primarily contributed to improving the strain hardening capacity. As a result, the enhanced strength-ductility synergy was achieved by cryogenic friction stir processing. Also, the obtained UFG dual-phase structure helps with enhancing corrosion resistance. This work provides a new strategy for preparing uniform UFG DSSs with outstanding mechanical properties and anticorrosion.},

  abstract     = {Low frequency is a difficult problem in noise control. How to design new lightweight materials or structures to achieve low-frequency noise reduction is of utmost importance. This study presents a multi-parameter optimisation design procedure for a specific sound insulation frequency and bandwidth of a lightweight acoustic metamaterial. First, a sound insulation model of membrane-type acoustic metamaterials (MAMs) was established based on the finite element method, and the predicted results are validated with results from previous studies. Subsequently, the bandgap characteristics and generation mechanism of the sound insulation peak are analysed. Second, the influences of both material and structural parameters of the membrane and mass block, on the sound insulation characteristics of the MAMs are systematically investigated. They are discussed by first using a single variable control method and then considering the multi-parameter coupling effect. Finally, a Kriging surrogate model for sound insulation prediction of MAMs is established. Aiming at a specific sound insulation frequency and bandwidth, the multi-parameter optimisation design of the MAMs is performed. According to the results, during multi-parameter coupling, the influence law of a single variable on the sound insulation peak of MAMs is unchanged; however, the influence magnitude differs. The Kriging surrogate model can effectively design acoustic metamaterials with a specific sound insulation frequency and bandwidth.},

Aiming to understand the underlying mechanism responsible for this strength improvement, this study examines how TA mediates the hydration of tricalcium silicate (alite). Experimental study shows that TA can form complex with calcium ions through chelating, retarding the hydration of the alite and changing of the hydration products. Particularly, X-ray diffraction analysis shows that TA makes calcium hydroxide preferentially grow on the [0 0 1] face. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and 29 Si MAS NMR results reveal that the mean chain length of calcium silicate hydrate (C S H) is reduced by TA. More importantly, mercury intrusion porosimetry testing reveals that pores with size near 30 nm was almost eliminated by adding TA, leading to higher elastic modulus of the produced C S H and higher compressive strength of the produced concrete.},

An initial extrusion force instead of a gap between the flexible roller and powders is used to improve the recoated powder density, while the recoated powder layer thickness is proved to be controllable. An industrial camera and a laser displacement sensor were used to estimate the recoated surface filling rate and recoated surface profile. The mixed powder was recoated with an FRFR on a baseplate at first, the achieved surface filling rate was the same as that of 55 μm AlSi10Mg recoated with a rubber blade. Then 120 layers of mixed powder were recoated continuously with FRFR, the recoated surface profile within a single layer and between multiple layers were compared with the rubber blade recoated AlSi10Mg, their difference is insignificant. Furthermore, composite parts with different shapes were successfully made with the FRFR.

The presented graft was composed of polycaprolactone/gelatin (inner layer) and polyurethane/polycaprolactone (outer layer) and fabricated by sequential electrospinning process. Physico-mechanical evaluation, in vitro biocompatibility and hemocompatibility assays were performed for both layers to ensure safe in vivo applications Then, the vascular grafts were successfully implanted into a rat abdominal aorta model. Tubular vascular graft had a nanofibrous and porous outer structure, which provided a conducive micro-environment for smooth muscle cell migration as well as proliferation but the lumen wall had a smooth surface to reduce thrombogenicity and improve endothelialization. Both layers showed excellent biocompatibility and hemocompatibility in all in vitro assays. After three months, the harvested grafts exhibited smooth muscle cell regeneration and complete endothelialization on the graft lumen. The dual layered graft could therefore play a pivotal role in the arena of vascular tissue regeneration application.},

In the face of plaque formation, traditional scaling and antibiotic treatment can lead to gum recession, drug resistance and other side effects. The nanoplatform of multifunctional complex treatment is attractive for the treatment of periodontitis. In this study, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was loaded into gold nanoparticle-modified hydrogels (E-Au@H) to achieve the synergistic functions of near-infrared (NIR) photosensitization, bactericidal and periodontal tissue regeneration. E-Au@H rapidly heats up to 50.7 °C within 5 min under NIR light irradiation, exerting a good photothermal effect, while the NIR spectrum can effectively control the release of tea polyphenols, enhance the antibacterial effect, promote angiogenesis and improve bone regeneration. In vitro studies showed that NIR-irradiated composites inhibited S. aureus , E. coli and S. aureus biofilms by 94\%, 92\% and 74\%, increased alkaline phosphatase activity 5-fold after 7 days and increased extracellular matrix mineralization rate 3-fold after 21 days. The rat periodontitis model successfully demonstrated that E-Au@H with NIR light irradiation inhibited dental plaque biofilm by 87\% and promoted alveolar bone regeneration by 38\%. The experimental results suggest that this hydrogel with a NIR-sensitive composite nanoplatform offers new possibilities for the treatment of periodontal disease.},

A series of nondestructive testing techniques were carried out to detect damage to the stem-cement interface and cement. Results suggested that the initial stem-cement interface debonding and cement damage were induced at femur loading early period. The cement was subjected to a combination action of shear stress and bending from a sinking stem causing a pressure-arch effect resulting in compression creep and micro-crack on the cement successively. The stem-cement interfacial friction prevent stem from sinking due to the internal shear effect caused by the cement-stem interface micro-sliding. The interface debonding procession increased at first and then became stable, which was shown in cement&#39;s creep deformation-friction-fracture model. The initial micro-cracks released damage energy which was converted into stress waves. Further, the relationship of bond stress and slippage at different locations caused different degrees of damage belt for the interface and cement. It was concluded that the combination effect of pressure arching and shear lag was the primary reason for cement&#39;s initial damage and the matrix defect affected the failure progress.},

  abstract     = {An inhomogeneous chemical distribution can be problematic in many biomaterial applications, including wood impregnation. Since wood is a hierarchically structured material, the chemical distribution must be considered on different length scales. Here, a combination of imaging methods revealed the distribution of phenol–formaldehyde resin in impregnation-treated European beech wood within the scale of several millimeters or larger (macroscopic) and the micron scale (cellular level). The macroscopic resin distribution was quantified by hyperspectral near-infrared (NIR) image regression. A partial least square regression model accurately predicted the resin content in the range of 0–30\% with average prediction errors of ≤0.93\% for calibration and the test set. The cellular resin distribution was investigated by mapping the UV absorbance in selected regions of interest at high lateral resolution using UV microspectrophotometry (UMSP). The application of both imaging techniques to board sections revealed a process-dependent resin distribution. NIR image regression quantified the drying-induced migration of resin toward the board surfaces. UMSP measurements in selected regions revealed that this resin migration also affected the resin distribution across cell walls. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of combining chemical imaging techniques to quantify process-dependent heterogeneity and to develop efficient treatments for wood and other biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {The goal of this work is to detect flaw formation in the wire-based directed energy deposition (W-DED) process using in-situ sensor data. The W-DED studied in this work is analogous to metal inert gas electric arc welding. The adoption of W-DED in industry is limited because the process is susceptible to stochastic and environmental disturbances that cause instabilities in the electric arc, eventually leading to flaw formation, such as porosity and suboptimal geometric integrity. Moreover, due to the large size of W-DED parts, it is difficult to detect flaws post-process using non-destructive techniques, such as X-ray computed tomography. Accordingly, the objective of this work is to detect flaw formation in W-DED parts using data acquired from an acoustic (sound) sensor installed near the electric arc. To realize this objective, we develop and apply a novel wavelet integrated graph theory approach. The approach extracts a single feature called graph Laplacian Fiedler number from the noise-contaminated acoustic sensor data, which is subsequently tracked in a statistical control chart. Using this approach, the onset of various types of flaws are detected with a false alarm rate less-than 2\%.

  abstract     = {Nanoindentation creep behavior and underlying mechanisms of nanocrystalline (NC) Ni and NC Ni-20 wt\% Fe (Ni-Fe) alloy were investigated at room temperature by a new testing method. The continuous creep strain rate versus creep stress data and hence the continuous apparent activation volume versus creep stress data in the entire holding stage on each single sample were achieved under a loading rate-controlled mode by a cooperative use of the continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) technique. Furthermore, the dependence of the apparent activation volume on the creep stress was interpreted by performing a theoretical analysis. Based on the above experimental and theoretical results and the high-resolution transmission electron microscope observation of the microstructures, the effects of the loading rate and stacking fault energy on the nanoindentation creep behavior of NC Ni and NC Ni-Fe alloy and the underlying mechanisms were analyzed. It was demonstrated that NC Ni-Fe alloy shows higher creep resistance in the transient regime, but lower creep resistance in the steady-state regime compared to NC Ni. The contact stiffness data obtained by the CSM technique in a strain rate-controlled mode can be used to determine the creep stress data from the creep displacement data obtained in a loading rate-controlled mode.},

Our results evidence that the γ′′ phase brings out significant precipitation hardening effect (∼10.2\%volume fraction contributes ∼ 685 MPa strength enhancement). The metastable γ′′ phase could abnormally transform to ε phase, and the morphology and distribution of ε phase shows great impacts on mechanical properties. A hetero-lamellae grain coupling with dual-precipitation (HLG + dual-P) structure was successfully constructed in this Nb-alloyed MEA, which could effectively combine precipitation hardening and hetero-deformation induced (HDI) hardening effects. Deformation characters investigations reveals that the absence of mechanical twinning in γ′′-strengthened MEA originates from the improved critical twinning stress related to the fine dislocation source size and the difficulty of high-energy complex SFs reordering. The combination of massive stacking-faults, Lomer-Cottrell locks and dynamically reinforced HDI hardening contribute to the excellent ductility and work-hardening capacity at high-level strength in the HLG + dual-P structural alloy.

The results showed that the addition of Sm obviously improves the microstructure and mechanical properties. It promotes the formation of twins and beneficially activated the non-basal slip at the initial stage of plastic deformation, resulting in a high ductility. The Visco-Plastic Self-Consistent (VPSC) and the two-beam diffraction results confirmed that the pyramidal slip and prismatic slip were activated during tensile testing. The quantitative analysis of slip traces verified that the volume of non-basal slips reached 35\% after Sm addition. The additions of Sm with solid solution increased the activities of pyramidal dislocation during deformation, which was beneficial to accommodate the c-axis strain, and finally improved the room temperature ductility of Mg. First-principle calculations demonstrate that the solute Sm atoms would reduce the stacking fault energy for basal and prismatic slips.},

The growth mechanisms of VB 2 and VB particles in grain refiner followed the principle of atomic adsorption and growing layer by layer based on the fundamental crystal growth theories. Grain refinement and mechanical properties of AZ91 alloy induced by the grain refiner and subsequent extrusion were investigated. The average grain size of the as-cast AZ91 alloy decreased from 217 μm to 78 μm with the optimal addition of 1 wt\% Al-5.1V-2.3B grain refiner, and the UTS, YS and EL of the as-cast AZ91 alloy were improved by 27.6\%, 42.0\% and 43.0\%, respectively. Mechanical properties of the hot extruded samples were further enhanced due to the grain refinement, weakened texture and dislocation strengthening. The matching relationships between VB 2 , VB particles and α-Mg were characterized with the assistance of the high-resolution transmission electron microscope and edge-to-edge models. There were good matching relationships between VB, VB 2 particles and α-Mg, as [0 0 1] / [1 2 ¯ 1 2¯1 0] in (1 1 0) / (10 1 ¯ 0 1¯0 ) and [0001] / [1 2 ¯ 1 2¯1 0] in (10 1 ¯ 0 1¯0 ) / (0002), which were the key for grain refinement.},

The heterogeneous grain structures display larger tensile ductility, stronger strain hardening and higher fracture toughness at the similar yield strength level. Hetero-deformation-induced hardening is found to play an important role in the heterogeneous grain structures, resulting in better mechanical properties. The size of plastic zone and the strain hardening capacity around the crack tip for the heterogeneous grain structures are found to be much larger/higher than those for the homogeneous grain structures at the same level of yield strength, resulting in better fracture toughness. High density of geometrically necessary dislocations and grain refinement are induced at the adjacent area of the main crack path, and numerous microvoids are also observed besides the main crack for the heterogeneous grain structures, resulting in more energy dissipation for higher fracture toughness. The deformation mechanisms around the crack tip are highly dependent on the magnitude of plastic strain and the grain size. The observed higher fracture toughness in the heterogeneous grain structures can be partly attributed to the formation of microbands.},

The aim is to broaden the understanding of the control actuation via printing path tailoring and unlock new potential applications for biomaterials and autonomous actuator design. The composites are made with continuous flax yarns and polylactic acid matrix filaments and exhibit moisture-induced actuation. The actuation capability is first demonstrated by printing a calla lily flower-inspired configuration subjected to 98\% relative humidity. This structure did not however achieve the anticlastic double curvature and large actuation targeted. To resolve these issues, cross-ply composite architectures with bent filaments deposited in one layer have then been developed. The amplitude for curvature control ranges obtained were 1.9*10 −3 mm −1 and 7.9*10 −3 mm −1 depending on the position on the specimen. Other cross-ply hygromorphs solutions are also proposed, with the orientation of their passive layers ([0°] 2 ) tilted by α degrees (stacking sequence: [- α , α , 90°]). The largest actuation curvature was obtained when α =40°, which increased by 0.0072 mm −1 when compared to α = 0°.

In this study, three model alloys Mg-6Al-2Ca, Mg-5Al-3Ca and Mg-4Al-4Ca were investigated, which include C15, C36, and C14 Laves phases. The as-cast alloys have interconnected Laves phases that form a skeleton structure. After annealing, they became more rounded particles, while the metastable C36 phase was transformed to C15. The Laves phases in different crystal structures exhibit distinct ranges of chemical compositions and lattice parameters. Well defined orientation relationships were observed between small C15 platelets and the Mg matrix (Mg(0002) // C15(1 1 1), Mg[112̅0] // C15[112̅]). Another pair of parallel orientations was found between Mg(11̅01) and the c -plane of hexagonal C36/C14. Nevertheless, most coarsened Laves phases have incoherent interfaces with the matrix and hinder dislocation slip transfer. The annealed alloys have lower yield strength than their as-cast counterparts, but higher ductility or ultimate tensile strength. The yield strengths of as-cast alloys are correlated to the interconnectivity of the skeleton, whereas those of annealed alloys are related to the spacing between Laves phases.},

However, the lack of a full understanding of the plastic carrier-interface interaction mechanism obscures the essential role of the interface in the simultaneous enhancement of strength and ductility. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms from an interface perspective, FCC/BCC multilayers with semicoherent and coherent interfaces were prepared by a magnetron sputtering system. The mechanical properties and microstructure evolution of multilayers were investigated by using nanoindentation, X-ray diffractometer and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Moreover, the dislocation motion behavior and stress distribution during plastic deformation were analyzed by MD simulation. It is found that the plastic deformation behavior and mechanical properties of EHEAs are sensitive to the heterogeneous interfacial structure. During plastic deformation, the coherent interface facilitates the continuous slip of dislocations, whereas the semicoherent interface promotes amorphization by dislocations pileup. The results are important for understanding the plastic carrier-interface interaction mechanism, and the findings provide new insights for the development of high strength-ductility HEA materials.},

  abstract     = {The design of novel biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds (BTS) using computer aided design (CAD) technology is challenging additive manufacturing technologies. At the microstructure level, BTS should mimic bone histomorphometry and assure optimum mass transport and mechanical properties . In this study, a novel BTS has been designed, by using a parametric and variational CAD method, to model a bio-inspired and interconnected porous structure. The mechanical (elastic modulus) and the fluid mass transport (permeability) properties have been computed and compared to other implicit surfaces modelling scaffolds. The results showed that the new BTS could be tuned during the design stage to match the microstructure and the histomorphometry properties of trabecular bone. Those with porosities between 0.7 and 0.9 and highly smooth curvatures were the most appropriates. The new BTS, once appropriately designed, could be made/manufactured by 3D printing technology with an internal microstructure mimicking the local bone properties of the selected bone volumes of interest, for example, those coming from computed tomography medical images.},

  abstract     = {Nature has developed smart strategies to morph joint contact surfaces as a response to local mechanical stimuli. Hence, it is compelling to explore the advantages of mimicking these strategies to design mechanical pieces. Researchers and engineers have developed generative design strategies mostly focused on structural topological and shape optimization. However, these generative strategies are not well developed for joint contact surfaces, even though they are critical points in engineering structures and machinery. This work presents a computational tool for adaptive surface shaping in contact problems inspired by the morphogenesis of synovial joints. The algorithm follows the cartilage growth rules, in which the hydrostatic and shear octahedral stresses either promote or inhibit an isotropic expansion of the local domain. The implementation is based on the finite element method and it is freely available on GitHub. A parametric study was performed to tune the parameters of the algorithm and it was successfully tested for two elastic bodies in unilateral contact. It was evidenced that the cartilage growth rules adapted the geometry of the surfaces in such a way that the contact stresses got uniformly distributed. This study is a step forward in the scope of bio-inspired generative designs.},

Sulfasalazine (Sul), an immunosuppressant, can potentially treat autoinflammation-induced disorders; however, clinical application of Sul is hindered by its inability to be directly taken up by cells. To address this challenge, we developed Mn doped prussian blue nanozymes (MPBs) to directly deliver Sul for targeting reactive oxygen species (ROS)-enriched microenvironment. The artificial nanozyme (Sul-MPBs) exhibits reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging properties against hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and possesses both catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-like properties in vitro. Furthermore, it significantly enhances therapeutic effects in treating dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced IBD via alleviating ROS-mediated inflammatory responses. This study demonstrates good biocompatibility and protective properties of this artificial nanozyme, thus potentially leading to a highly innovative and translational approach to treat IBD efficiently and safely.},

Combined with the 3D printing technology, the composite bioceramics scaffolds were fabricated with interconnected porous magnesium-doped wollastonite (CSi-Mg) scaffolds as the architecture and nano-hydroxyapatite ( n -HA) as the surface. The influence of manufacturing process on the n -HA layer thickness and degradation performance, biological performance and anti-tumor performance of the composite scaffolds were investigated. The n -HA surface layer could effectively retard the degradation rate of CSi-Mg scaffolds and maintain high mechanical strength (over 90 MPa) after immersion in simulated body fluid for 3 weeks. Meanwhile, CSi-Mg/n-HA3 scaffold induced about 50\% of cell death for human osteosarcoma cells (MG-63) in vitro. CSi-Mg/ n -HAx (x = 1, 3) scaffolds could improve the osteogenic performance of Rat BMSC.

In this work, we use thermally reversible pastes to fabricate ceramic matrix (Al 2 O 3 ) composites reinforced with continuous metallic fibres (steel). The approach is based on the micro-extrusion of ceramic–metal filaments with core–shell and layered arrangements. These filaments are employed in the additive manufacturing of dense and light-weight cellular structures that combine the stiffness and strength of the ceramic shell with the fracture resistance and energy absorption capabilities provided by the metal core. The approach can be used to extrude filaments with thin porous interlayers separating the core and the shells to create a weak fibre/matrix interphase. The cellular structures fabricated with these filaments exhibit higher compressive strengths and energy absorption capabilities than those fabricated from pure ceramics. The works of fracture of the dense composites are one to two orders of magnitude above those of the ceramic matrix (10 3 J/m 2 ) while the bending strengths remain comparable to those of 3D printed alumina (200–350 MPa). The technique could be easily extended to other material combinations opening new opportunities in the additive manufacturing of multi-material parts and devices.},

The influence of the deposition process on the Cr 2 AlC formation, texture, and phase composition is investigated and an in-depth discussion of the intermediate phase is carried out. Cr-Al-C thin films were deposited by Direct Current Magnetron Sputtering and High Power Pulsed Magnetron Sputtering with the variation of the deposition temperature . To investigate the microstructure, phase composition, and texture, in situ synchrotron and high-temperature X-ray diffraction experiments were conducted and accompanied by electron microscopy . The Cr 2 AlC formation can be described as a temperature and time-dependent process with one intermediate state characterized by the formation of the disordered-Cr 2 AlC phase. Disordered-Cr 2 AlC shows a similar unit cell to Cr 2 AlC with an increased c/a ratio. The ratio decreases during the phase formation resulting from an ordering process. Formation temperatures depend on the initial phase, with a decreased formation temperature for (Cr,Al) 2 C, and the deposition process. While the (002) fiber texture of (Cr,Al) 2 C inherited to Cr 2 AlC, Cr 2 AlC originated from amorphous Cr-Al-C showed no preferred orientation.

The complex thermal history influences the final microstructure and the macroscopic properties of the printed part. In this work, we demonstrate how high-speed in situ X-ray diffraction in transmission mode can be used to measure temperature profiles and cooling rates in a Ti-6Al-4V single-track wall. During the laser remelting of the top layer, a temperature exceeding the β transus temperature (T β ∼ 1252 K) is measured up to 150 µm below the surface. The maximum observed cooling rates vary from 10 6 K/s at the top surface, to 10 5 K/s at a depth of 135 µm and 10 4 K/s at a depth of 255 µm. Based on the temporal evolution of the various crystallographic phases, the dimensions of the melt pool and the high-temperature β zone surrounding the melt pool are estimated. It is anticipated that the data obtained from in situ measurements in transmission mode on a thin wall combined with in situ measurements in reflection mode on a bulk sample will allow verification and validation of finite element models used in l -PBF processing.},

However, many HCC patients do not respond due to low tumor antigen exposure and the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITM). Chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy are considered to be effective methods for eliciting anti-tumor immune responses. Here, we developed a light-triggered nanoplatform Ce6@PMTKP for combination chemo-photodynamic therapy and the potentiation of ICB therapy. The Ce6@PMTKP micelles entrapped Ce6 for photodynamic therapy, while PMTKP contains the ROS-sensitive paclitaxel (PTX) polymeric prodrug for chemotherapy. The Ce6@PMTKP micelles showed excellent tumor accumulation and light-triggered drug release. Compared with chemotherapy or photodynamic therapy alone, the combination therapy mediated by Ce6@PMTKP was found to be more effective in the elimination of tumors, induction of immunogenic cell death, and the promotion of dendritic cell maturation and cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration, thus mitigating ITM immunosuppression. When combined with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, the Ce6@PMTKP micelles induced complete regression of primary tumors and effectively inhibited distant metastatic tumors by enhancing anti-tumor immune responses.},

This nanoagent-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) in combination with RT (PTT-RT) demonstrated excellent photothermal-enhanced RT effect by significantly inhibiting migration and invasion, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and causing more DNA damage in two different pathological types of cell lines of cervical cancer, compared with mere RT. The PTT-RT based on this nanoagent further showed enhanced RT effect in vivo , and increased the production of some metabolites remarkablely enriched in the phenylalanine metabolism pathway revealed by the metabolomics analysis, compared with RT alone. Meanwhile, this nanoagent exhibited excellent computed tomography imaging (CTI)/photoacoustic imaging (PAI)/fluorescence imaging (FLI)/photothermal imaging (PTI) multi-modal imaging capability .

Compared with untreated M2 macrophage-derived exosomes, cell-penetrating peptide modified primary M2 macrophage-derived exosomes can be better taken up by target cells, enabling inflammation targeting. The results of experiments in vivo also showed that after cell-penetrating peptide modification, the accumulation of exosomes at the site of inflammation was about 176\% of that of unmodified ones. Experiments in SCI or RA mice also showed that primary M2 macrophage exosomes loaded with curcumin penetrating peptide modification had a more prominent ability to inhibit inflammation and improve motor function in inflammation models. Especially in promoting the repolarization of macrophages, in vitro experiments showed that under the action of curcumin loaded and R9 peptide modified M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (Cur@EXs-R9), more than 50\% of macrophages were repolarized to M2-type macrophages.

The fabrication process is prone to induce various defects that can have detrimental effects on the AM components. Therefore, a reliable technique that enables monitoring the integrity of AM components and in return helping to optimize the fabrication parameters in mission-critical structures is highly demanded. This work presents a fast and high-resolution damage visualization method using laser-ultrasonic (LU) imaging technique for accurately detecting and quantifying the subsurface defects in printed AM components. Specifically, a fully noncontact LU scanning system is implemented to generate and detect high signal-to-noise ratio laser ultrasonic waves using a pulsed laser and laser Doppler vibrometer, respectively. A strategy for fast defect localization using Rayleigh waves with circular scans is firstly proposed. The high-resolution 3D synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT) imaging with raster scans is subsequently performed focusing around the located damage areas to stereoscopically visualize and quantify the subsurface defects. The reconstructed images are further processed and improved using Gaussian filter algorithm to obtain accurate defect shapes, sizes, and positions. The feasibility of the proposed method is eventually verified on AlSi10Mg and stainless steel (316L) components containing subsurface defects with various types and dimensions. The measured sizes are well consistent with the designed values, suggesting that it is a reliable inspection method for AM parts to ensure quality control and feedback.},

As such, their fatigue performance must be excellent to prevent the need for revision surgery. This paper provides insight into the high-cycle fatigue behaviour of novel titanium scaffolds with hierarchical porosity and properties comparable to those of human bone that were produced by direct ink writing (DIW) and tested under cyclic loading typical for bone implants. Opposite to traditional expectations in the field of metal fatigue, scaffolds produced with an open intrastrand pore network (14.3\%) endured nearly an order of magnitude more cycles than those with relatively compact strands (5.9\%) and their normalized fatigue strength (62\% of their yield strength in 10 6 cycles) was competitive with many current titanium scaffolds produced by other additive manufacturing technologies. Improved fatigue performance was related to fatigue crack growth shielding effects that reduced the crack growth rate, prolonged the crack path, and increased energy absorption. Consequently, these novel hierarchically porous titanium structures prepared by DIW can serve safely under cyclic loading conditions, and at the same time can provide multiple open porosity-related functionalities in advanced biomedicine and other industrial sectors.},

  abstract     = {The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the oxidative stress microenvironment of diabetic wounds often results in delayed wound healing. In this study, a multifunctional hydrogel with ROS-scavenging property was developed by cross-linking epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), 2-(hydroxyethyl) methacrylamide (HEMAA), acrylamide (AM), and borax. The resulting hydrogel showed adequate hemostatic properties, self-healing capability, tissue adhesiveness, and an appropriate degradation rate . Moreover, the green tea derivative-based hydrogel scavenged the accumulated ROS and protected skin-related cells (such as keratinocytes , fibroblasts, and endothelial cells) from ROS-mediated death and proliferation inhibition. In vivo , this hydrogel accelerated diabetic wound healing by decreasing the ROS level, inducing macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype, alleviating excessive inflammation, and promoting proliferation, epithelialization, collagen deposition, and neovascularization. By day 16, the hydrogel dressing had almost completely healed the diabetic wounds, whereas the residual wound areas of the blank control and the commercial Tegaderm TM dressing were 55.57 ± 5.67\% and 35.15 ± 3.45\%, respectively. Overall, this advanced hydrogel provides an effective strategy for the treatment of diabetic wounds and may be applied for the treatment of tissue injury in other ROS-accumulated microenvironments.},

  abstract     = {Surgical suture plays an important role in increasing wound repair. However, the healing efficacy of sutures currently is still not satisfactory due to their failure in regulating healing biology. Therefore, developing functional sutures are highly required. Herein, we fabricated a new degradable suture to control the release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for incisional wound healing. The suture (bFGF-DA@PCL) was simply made by anchoring bFGF onto the surface of the electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) suture through the assistance of dopamine with a bFGF loading efficiency around 80\%. The introduction of dopamine to the suture also increased the mechanical strength of suture from 17 kPa to 27 kPa. The in vitro data evidenced that the suture could effectively prolong bFGF release up to 10 days and enhance cell adhesion and proliferation. Further in vivo results demonstrated that the suture could increase wound healing and induce a complete wound closure within 13 days. Moreover, the suture was found to accelerate skin mechanical restoration with a recovery of maximum strength to 87.1\% of the healthy skin. The suture was also revealed to help the skin wound healing by promoting granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, reepithelization, and basement membrane reconstruction.},

Recently, scientists have attempted to develop composite scaffolds for repair of osteochondral injuries. However, the available composite scaffolds do not fully recapitulate the functions of the cartilage, subchondral bone, and cancellous bone. In this study, we developed a bioactive multiphase scaffold by decellularizing an intact osteochondral graft for osteochondral repair. The porosity and mechanical properties of the scaffolds were optimized using laser drilling and collagen digestion. The scaffold promoted the recellularization of the cartilage layer. The experimental results showed that the multiphasic scaffolds had excellent mechanical properties and structural stability similar to that of the normal rabbit osteochondral tissue. The in vitro analysis showed that the scaffold promoted zone-specific gene expression. Approximately 12 weeks after in vivo implantation, the multiphasic scaffold significantly facilitated the concurrent regeneration of cartilage and subchondral bone in a rabbit model (detected using gross and micro-computed tomography images, histological staining, immunohistochemistry, and visualization of the collagen network). Overall, this study provides ideas for the development of new multiphasic scaffolds for osteochondral defect repair.},

  abstract     = {3D printing allows the fabrication of complex microstructures that would traditionally require specialized machinery. In the fabrication of textiles, 3D printing may enable unique yarn structures, greater manufacturing flexibility and facilitate the development of personalized and tunable devices. In literature, 3D printed textiles have not been subjected to a thorough mechanical characterization. In this paper, a generative model of 3D printed biaxial weaves is developed and a parametric study to effectively map the design parameters to the weaves’ mechanical properties is performed via a two-stage Design-of-Experiments methodology. The samples are printed with material jetting layer by layer in planar direction and destructively tested in tension to obtain the resulting stress–strain behavior. The stress–strain curves are approximated by a bilinear model characterized predominantly by a transition strain and the major modulus after transition. The transition strain is influenced by the load direction and the weave pattern, while the major modulus is impacted by the load direction, the yarn diameter, the weave pattern and the yarn spacing in descending order. Further evaluation of the fracture behavior shows a mitigation of layer-wise delamination. This result indicates that material jetting can enable the production of arbitrary, quasi-continuous textile structures. The characterization results presented here may pave the way towards the design of textiles with spatially varying mechanical properties.},

  abstract     = {Micro-architectured materials with periodically configured microstructures are widely used in various engineering fields due to their superior mechanical properties . Compared with conventional topology design with one single material, topological design with multiple materials can provide a better solution as the expanded design freedom. This paper presents a level set-based multi-material topological design method for micro-architectured materials involving three phases or more. In this method, a difference-set-based multi-material level set model is employed to represent the topology of each phase, in which N + 1 phases can be precisely represented by the sequential difference-set of N level set functions without any overlaps and redundant regions. By using an alternating active-phase algorithm, the multi-material topology design problem with N + 1 phases is splitted into N ( N + 1)/2 binary-phase topological design sub-problems, where each sub-problem involves fewer design variables and volume constraints. The effective properties of multiphase micro-architectured materials are evaluated by a numerical homogenization approach, and their topological evolutions of two active phases in each sub-problem can be readily achieved by updating a single level set function, which greatly facilitate the extension to topological design problems with more phases. Both numerical examples and additive-manufactured specimens demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for designing multiphase micro-architectured materials.},

The microstructure, dielectric and energy storage performance of the synthesized ceramics were systematically studied. Owing to the involvement of CSP, grain size is reduced to submicrometer scale, and uniform and dense morphology are achieved at a lower sintering temperature compared with the CS method. As a consequence, high critical electric field (420 kV/cm), a good recoverable energy storage density (3.32 J/cm 3 ), and a superior energy efficiency (92.84\%) can be realized for the ceramic via CSP sintered at 1170 °C. Meanwhile, it also exhibits good stability over wide ranges of measuring frequencies and temperatures, and increasing cycles to 10 7 . A high power density (85.46 MW/cm 3 ) is achieved due to a very fast discharge rate (∼61.7 ns). Moreover, the synthesized ceramic demonstrates an ultrahigh hardness of ∼ 8.73 GPa. These results indicate that CSP is a feasible solution to achieve outstanding comprehensive dielectric energy storage performance by utilizing the synergistic effects of grain refinement and densification.},

First, the common synthesis strategies to realize vdWs heterostructures are presented.

Specifically, the designed meta-atom contains dual-layer metallic cross-strips and one-layer circular slotted patch. Eight positive-intrinsic-negative diodes are loaded between each strip structure through via hole, with each two of diodes as a group along x - and y -direction, respectively, and thus supporting four switchable states via different applied bias voltages. Numerical results indicate that the designed meta-atom achieves high-rate transmission of 0.9 and individual phase manipulation in four independent transmission channels at 7.4 GHz. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we numerically and experimentally show different versatile functionalities, including anomalous deflections with steered beams in range of 0° ∼ 40°, orbital angular momentum generation with mode of l = 1, and beam focusing among four polarization-encoded channels at 7.4 GHz. Our metasurface owns the advantages of multi-polarization EM wave manipulations in transmission mode, which completely distinguishes from previously reported works with single polarization in reflection mode.},

The effect of the simultaneous addition of Si and Ni on the Al/Fe joint strength associated with the microstructure of the intermetallic compound (IMC) layer was systematically examined. The addition of Si and Ni individually improved the Al/Fe joint strength by the reduction in the IMC layer thickness caused by the Si addition and the refinement of the IMC grains due to the Ni addition, respectively.

  abstract     = {As a pillar material of semiconductors, single-crystal silicon (Si) has attracted much attention due to its excellent electronic properties. Meanwhile, femtosecond laser processing as a convenient fabrication method for miniaturized structures provides an effective way to improve the performance of Si-based devices. However, the final-state analysis of femtosecond laser-induced Si micro-nano structures remains to be explored. In this study, the evolution of the micro-nano structures and the variation of surface and subsurface damage with pulse number were studied. Based on the atomic structure, the amorphous layer, dislocation layer, and unaffected layer were found. The amorphous layer resulted from the re-solidification of melted materials. The dislocation layer consisted of dislocations and lattice distortion. The unaffected layer retained the initial lattice structure and was not affected by laser irradiation. The high temperature and stress induced by multiple pulses led to the stacking faults and nano-twins in the subsurface layer. The evolution of the Si structure was essentially a transition process from a dislocation layer to a high-density defect layer and a transition process from nanotips to laser-induced periodic surface structures. During this process, dislocations dominated the femtosecond laser-induced microstructural deformation, affecting the nano-hardness of the irradiated surface. As a result, the nano-hardness of Si structures fabricated using femtosecond laser processing was maximally enhanced by 9.54\%. This work provides new information about ultrafast laser-induced surface and subsurface damage, which is significant for the efficient and high-precision fabrication of Si-based functional micro-nano devices.},

Cascade-forward neural networks predict UCS and CR with high accuracy of over 0.95 for a total of 840 data points. Random forest regression identifies Zn as a major determinant of UCS and CR. Based on this, three chemical compositions are recommended with improved compressive strength and in vitro corrosion resistance by well-verified neural network models. The proposed Mg alloys have UCS of 244–305 MPa and CR of 0.31–0.83 mm/y according to the change of the Zn content.

To achieve the desired functionality while minimizing costs, a combination of facile coating methods and accurate microstructural designs is required, but remains elusive. Herein, novel conductive and porous membranes are designed based on a facile and scalable approach to fabricating conformally coated gold layers on electrospun PVDF fibers (Au-PVDF-NFMs) via electroless plating. The deposition of a conformal and fully interconnected gold layer with an average thickness of circa 38 nm on the surface of nanofibers is confirmed by systematic characterizations. The high-conjunction gold layers endows a high electrical conductivity to the membranes, yielding a low sheet resistance of 1.2 Ω/sq. In addition, the membranes show integrated functionalities such as hydrophobicity and gas permeability. Notably, the NFMs also show excellent mechanical durability under both stretching and bending, with negligible conductivity losses after 1000 test cycles. Thanks to these properties, the Au-PVDF-NFMs demonstrates practical suitability as gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for electrochemical CO 2 reduction. The Au-PVDF-NFMs exhibit a substantial Faradaic efficiency towards CO, as high as ∼ 85\% at −0.7 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and are able to reach current densities of 100 mA cm −2 at −0.95 V versus RHE.},

The Monte Carlo Potts is a widespread simulation model for grain growth with high computational efficiency but has not been considered suitable for the quantitative prediction of practical processes since the physical meaning of variables is not fully understood yet. Efforts have been made to assign realistic physical meaning to variables. The existing equation for converting simulation time to real time involves a strong temperature dependence, which causes a problem under non-uniform temperature distribution, as in additive manufacturing. This problem could be solved by assigning a temperature dependence to the simulation result, which was possible by using realistic temperature and energy values. We found that the simulated activation energy for grain growth could be equated to the experimental value by adjusting the activation energy for grain boundary migration within a reasonable range in the simulation. The modified model made the time conversion equation completely temperature-independent and was free from the above-mentioned problem in time conversion. The Monte Carlo Potts simulation can now more reasonably predict grain growth in various materials under various temperature conditions.},

Sandwich structures with gold film thicknesses of 50 nm and 150 nm were prepared. The contact angles between the water surface in the trough and its edge line were 0° (horizontal) and 35° (protruding) during slicing. The cutting feed of the slab should be &lt; 430 nm for sandwich structures with a 50-nm gold film thickness and &lt; 344 nm for a 150-nm gold film thickness to ensure dimensional accuracy. The sandwich structure with a gold film had a higher shear yield stress than a pure epoxy structure. Increasing the thickness of the gold film and the contact angle with the water surface decreased the strength of the structure, thereby facilitating cutting. In accordance with a comparison of segmented cutting-force curves for the sandwich structure, this characteristic is a result of different adhesions between the resin and metal film. Thus, researchers should improve epoxy material preparation to reduce adhesion of the material and improve the stability of the slicing.},

  abstract     = {A high-temperature theoretical model is established to investigate the sound absorption performance of helically perforated porous metamaterials (HPPM) at high temperature. Finite element simulations are carried out to validate the theoretical model, and good agreements have been achieved. By perforating three-dimensional helical holes in homogeneous porous material, sound waves can enter the porous material matrix more fully through these extended macroscopic helical perforations, thereby obtaining good low-frequency sound absorption at high temperatures. The results show that with the increase of temperature, the impedance matching between the metamaterial and air becomes better, so as to improve the low-frequency sound absorption ability. Compared to homogeneous porous materials, the average absorption coefficient is greatly improved, especially at higher temperatures. The numerical results of sound pressure and energy dissipation at different temperatures show that high-temperature enhances the pressure diffusion effect at off-peak frequencies, resulting in more energy dissipation in high sound pressure regions. The helically perforated porous metamaterials with large helical diameter and low pitch exhibit better sound absorption performance in the low frequency range. The proposed metamaterial can be used for low-frequency sound absorption at high temperature.},

Specifically, the dynamic response of the WRIs has been analysed by varying input properties, such as amplitudes and frequencies, and simulated by means of a recently developed hysteretic model derived from a new class of uniaxial phenomenological models. For completeness, the influence of the axial preload as well as of the wire rope diameter on the dynamic behaviour of the tested WRIs is also discussed. In particular, a close agreement between predicted hysteresis loops, having asymmetric shape, and experimental ones has been achieved.},

  abstract     = {It is crucial to inhibit tumor growth and distant metastasis for breast cancer (BC) therapy. However, the treatment primarily dependent on surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy is far from satisfactory. It had been demonstrated that the CXCL1/2-S100A8/9 axis played an essential role in BC therapy. Therefore, we constructed a natural product hydrogel for BC therapy by blocking CXCL1 signaling. The GK-GA (phytochemicals of Genkwa Flos -glycyrrhizic acid) hydrogel was designed in a one-step “green” approach. The pharmacodynamics study showed GK-GA exhibited significant anti-tumor and anti-lung metastasis activities, resulting in the inhibition rate of tumor growth (IRG) over 90\% at 6.25 mg·kg −1 , and did not display any obvious toxicity. In addition, the potent antitumor efficiency was also attributed to aggregation/assembly-induced retention (AIR) property. RNA sequencing analysis revealed the gene expression was significantly down-regulated in the GK-GA group, which were BCL2, CASP3, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCR2, S100A8, S100A9, and confirmed further by western blot (WB). Our findings indicated natural product GK-GA hydrogel inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis via the BCL2-CASP3 mitochondrial apoptosis pathway as well as the CXCL1/2-S100A8/9 pathway. This study provides inspiration for the fabrication of new excipients-free nano-dispersion in a one-step, no‐carrier‐added, organic solvent-free, “green” approach, particularly for small molecular antitumor agents.},

A novel electric field-driven microscale three-dimensional printing (EFD μ-3D printing) was proposed for manufacturing these structures of molten polymers with high resolution. For printing on curved substrates, the distributions of electric field force on substrates with different curvature radii in the self-excited electrostatic field were revealed via numerical simulations. The optimal process parameters for EFD μ-3D printing on curved substrates were determined. To improve printing accuracy, a micro-area preset eccentricity strategy was proposed by reducing the vertical angle of printing jets. A number of printing cases have been carried out. It is shown that the proposed method is effective for the micro-nano scale printing of 3D structures. The printed structures have good flexibility; they can be restored to their original state after 8.9\% axial compression, with an original length of 67 mm. Moreover, a conformal printing variable stiffness thin-wall tubular mesh structure has been achieved with a length of 28 mm, a line diameter of 80 μm, a big end diameter of 8 mm, and a small end diameter of 4 mm.},

Simple columnar and zig-zag γ-Mo 2 N thin-film electrodes were prepared by magnetron sputtering. The latter is obtained by glancing angle deposition (GLAD), which is known for open porous structures due to the ballistic shadowing effect. As intended, the zig-zag structured γ-Mo 2 N electrode presents an outstanding area capacitance of 248 mF/cm 2 at a scan speed of 50 mV/s, which is 4 times higher than that of the simple columnar one. Both of them exhibit excellent cycling stability of 95\% over 20,000 cycles (at 200 mV/s). The symmetrical solid-state supercapacitor prepared with the zig-zag structured γ-Mo 2 N thin film delivers an excellent power density of 107.1 W/cm 3 at 33.8 mWh/cm 3 , and its volumetric capacitance is ∼ 3.5 times higher than the simple columnar structured γ-Mo 2 N device. Bending tests of such solid-state γ-Mo 2 N supercapacitors proved their mechanical flexibility to a bending angel of even 107°. Based on these studies we can conclude that the highly porous zig-zag structured γ-Mo 2 N-based electrodes prepared by GLAD combine outstanding electrochemical energy storage capabilities with excellent mechanical flexibility.},

However, the systematic precise delivery still remains intractable challenge because of the existence of multi-staged biological barriers after intravenous administration. Herein, to address this issue, injectable and TME-responsive nanocomposite hydrogels were developed for localized and synergistic cancer therapy. The nanocomposite hydrogels (Au NBPs&amp;Pt NCs@DOX gel) were synthesized via the formation of metal-sulfur bonds between 4arm-PEG-thiol and Au nanobipyramids or Pt nanoclusters with the DOX encapsulation. The hydrogel exhibited rapid gelation and excellent injectability. Attributed to the high absorbance of Au NBPs, the nanocomposite hydrogels revealed superior photothermal effect under NIR irradiation, which the DOX release was also regulated by NIR laser. In addition, the catalase- and peroxidase-like activities of Pt NCs were validated to convert endogenous H 2 O 2 into ROS and O 2 in situ to achieve chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and alleviate the hypoxic microenvironment. Simultaneously, catalytic therapy combined with NIR irradiation exhibited strongest inhibition to the growth of 4T1 tumor in vitro and in vivo . Thus, this study provided a new strategy for TME remodeling and local combination therapies of different therapeutic agents.},

Titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) scaffolds have advantages because of their biomechanical stability but lack electrical activity, which hinders their further use. This work is focused on the fabrication of Ti6Al4V-Barium Titanate (BaTiO 3 ) bulk composite scaffolds to combine the biomechanical stability of Ti6Al4V with electrical activity through BaTiO 3 . For the first time, a hollow cylindrical Ti6Al4V is additively manufactured by electron beam melting and combined with piezoelectric BaTiO 3 powder for joint processing in field-assisted sintering. Scanning electron microscope images on the interface of the Ti6Al4V-BaTiO 3 composite scaffold showed that after sintering, the Ti6Al4V lattice structure bounded with BaTiO 3 matrix without its major deformation. The Ti6Al4V-BaTiO 3 scaffold had average piezoelectric constants of (0.63 ± 0.12) pC/N directly after sintering due to partial dipole alignment of the BaTiO 3 tetragonal phase, which increased to (4.92 ± 0.75) pC/N after a successful corona poling. Moreover, the nanoindentation values of Ti6Al4V exhibited an average hardness and Young’s modulus of (5.9 ± 0.9) GPa and (130 ± 14) GPa, and BaTiO 3 showed (4.0 ± 0.6) GPa and (106 ± 10) GPa, respectively. It reveals that the Ti6Al4V is the harder and stiffer part in the Ti6Al4V-BaTiO 3 composite scaffold. Such a scaffold has the potential to treat critical-size bone defects in load-bearing areas and guide tissue regeneration by physical stimulation.},

Two alloys are fabricated, one showing superelastic, the other showing shape memory properties at room temperature. The microstructures of both alloys are characterized and set into perspective with the measured thermo-mechanical properties. The 3D-printed NiTi showed a shape memory strain of 1 . 9\%, respectively a superelastic strain of 1 . 3\% for an applied strain of 4\%. To enlarge the shape memory strain actuator geometries are designed, fabricated, and tested. The results of this study may find application in the field of additive manufacturing of active structures, also referred to as 4D printing. Commonly, polymeric materials are used in such structures, which often suffer from poor mechanical properties and durability.
