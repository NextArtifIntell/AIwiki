  abstract     = {Safety state assessment is an important aspect of maintenance decisions for complex systems. However, assessing the safety state of systems is a challenge due to their complexity and the potential consequences of failure. One way to address this challenge is to use models with process interpretability and result traceability. This paper proposes an interpretable belief rule base model with reverse causal inference (IBRB-R) to provide a useful approach for safety state assessment. First, interpretability criteria are proposed for the safety state assessment method to regulate the interpretability of the entire modeling process. Second, based on the criteria, three interpretability constraint strategies are designed to correct behaviors that undermine model interpretability. Then, the inference method and optimization of the model are shown. In addition, a reverse causal inference model using the evidential reasoning (ER) algorithm is proposed to trace the causes of the assessment results and improve the reliability of the model. Finally, a case study on safety state assessment for the WD615 diesel engine verifies the validity of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning systems encounter various security risks, including backdoor, inference and adversarial attacks . Backdoor attacks within this context generally require careful trigger sample design involving candidate selection and automated optimization. Previous methods randomly selected trigger candidates from training dataset, disrupting sample distribution and blurring boundaries among them, which adversely affected the main task accuracy. Moreover, these methods employed non-optimized handcrafted triggers, resulting in a weakened backdoor mapping relationship and lower attack success rates. In this work, we propose a flexible backdoor attack approach, T rigger S ample S election and O ptimization (TSSO), motivated by neural network classification patterns. TSSO employs autoencoders and locality-sensitive hashing to select trigger candidates at class boundaries for precise injection. Furthermore, it iteratively refines trigger representations via the global model and historical outcomes, establishing a robust mapping relationship. TSSO is evaluated on four classical datasets with non-IID settings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by achieving higher attack success rate in fewer rounds, prolonging the backdoor effect. In scalability tests, even with the defense deployed, TSSO achieved the attack success rate of over 80\% with only 4\% malicious clients (a poisoning rate of 1/640).},

  abstract     = {Class incremental learning (CIL) enables deep networks to progressively learn new tasks while remembering previously learned knowledge. A popular design for CIL involves applying a shared feature extractor to learn old and new classes. However, this design can lead to representation interference, a phenomenon in which knowledge acquired from different tasks interferes with each other. This limits the ability to maintain feature information from previous tasks, especially without access to training data from previous tasks. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel CIL approach called task-specific model parameter decoupling, which includes a parameter decoupling (PD) framework and a dynamic-parameter-fusion (DPF) strategy. The PD framework compresses the knowledge of each task into a compact set of task-specific model parameters. In this situation, interactions between compact model parameters related to different tasks are eliminated to reduce representation interference. In addition, we adopt a DPF strategy to adaptively fuse the parameters of the larger model. As the learning task progresses, the DPF strategy enhances the model&#39;s adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet, demonstrate the performance improvement of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Recommendation systems have required centralized storage of user data, but due to privacy concerns, recent studies adopted federated learning (FL) that discloses intermediate statistics instead of raw data to build privacy-preserving federated recommendation systems. However, they suffer from inefficiencies in privacy-preserving mechanisms and inaccuracies in simple algorithms that ignore sequential information. This study proposes an extension of Word2Vec for a privacy-preserving federated sequential recommendation system (PPFSRS). This method exploits sequential information to generate contextual item representations for accurate recommendations while concealing privacy-sensitive features efficiently. Specifically, we mixed updates from negative samples to inhibit the direct leakage of purchased items from model updates. In addition, our method computes approximate model updates that can occur when sensitive features only belong to negative samples to prevent inference attacks. In experiments, we used benchmark datasets for recommendation and simulated highly distributed data such that each user stores historical data locally. While preserving privacy with reasonable complexity, the proposed method showed little degradation in recommendation performance compared to FL-based Word2Vec without privacy-preserving mechanisms. Utilizing contextual item representations trained by our method from highly distributed data will be a practical starting point for PPFSRS in a cross-device setting.},

Therefore, this paper introduces a novel approach, namely ambiguity-measure-based complex belief entropy ( C E A M CEAM ), within complex evidence theory. Compared with traditional ambiguity measures, C E A M CEAM quantifies the quantum interference effects between focal elements in uncertainty measure, making the uncertainty measure more reasonable.

  abstract     = {Federated Learning allows a myriad of clients to train a global model in a collaborative process over a period of rounds without essentially sharing their privately-stored data. The high frequency of communicating model updates to and from the central server, coupled with indiscriminate updating of the global model during training, makes communication a bottleneck for federated learning. Several methods, including model compression techniques , have been introduced to improve the communication efficiency of federated learning. However, some of these methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming whiles others result in information loss and low convergence rates. In this paper, we propose a new federated learning framework, FedSULP, that significantly reduces communication costs by accelerating learning convergence through gradient-based selective updating and clients&#39; loss penalization. Specifically, we first investigate the gradient direction of the global model and then estimate the significance of the local updates to the convergence of the global model. Subsequently, we perform selective updating of the global model based on the estimation outcome. Additionally, we optimally penalize the loss objectives of the clients if their collective gradients and learned parameters largely deviate from the global model. Extensive experiments performed on real-world image classification data sets demonstrated that our proposed framework ensures faster learning convergence and reduces communication up to 2x, compared to other existing baseline and state-of-the-art frameworks, while developing good-performing models.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view subspace clustering has recently received great interest in the communities of computer vision and pattern recognition, as it can overcome the limitation of conventional single-view subspace clustering by fusing complementary information from multi-view features. Recent work emphasizes the learning of latent representations rather than the affinity graph from each view to accomplish the task. Although they try to obtain consistent latent representations, it is difficult for these methods to design the term explicitly enforcing the desirable property such as diversity on the latent representation in their models. In this situation, we do not know if these methods can collect sufficient complementary information from multi-view features. In this paper, we propose Consistent and Diverse Deep Latent Representations (CDDLR) to address this problem. Our method provides a framework for enforcing necessary properties such as consistency and diversity on the learned latent representation by relating K-means with spectral clustering . Adopting the Laplacian regularized deep neural networks and novel strategies about diversity and consistency, CDDLR can learn the consistent and diverse deep latent representation for multi-view subspace clustering. Our experiment shows that for CALTECH and Football, our proposed method improves accuracy by 11.37\% and 4.01\%, respectively, compared to the second-best method.},

  abstract     = {Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) rank among the most popular and widely employed intelligent approaches for approximating the relationships between dependent and independent variables, demonstrating a wide range of successful applications. MLPs are flexible techniques capable of universally modeling and analyzing real-world problems in forecasting and classification domains with a desirable level of accuracy. In conventional MLPs, cost functions are formulated based on the error term. Subsequently, the learning process aims to estimate the unknown parameters to minimize the error-based cost function. The logic of the procedure is founded on the assumption that maximum generalization will be achieved from models displaying the highest accuracy within the training sample. While this learning process is rational and beneficial, a model&#39;s generalization capability depends simultaneously on the model&#39;s accuracy and the reliability level of that accuracy. In this manner, reliability is not taken into consideration when formulating the conventional cost function for MLPs. This paper introduces a reliability-based cost function for estimating the unknown weights and biases of MLP models during the learning process. The proposed cost function is designed to calculate the variation of the performances in dissimilar data situations. In the learning process of the proposed reliability-based multi-layer perceptron, in contrast to traditionally developed models, the goal is to minimize variation rather than error, or equivalently, to maximize reliability instead of accuracy. The generalizability of the proposed reliability-based MLP (EMLP) model in forecasting and classification domains is comprehensively evaluated using 30 benchmark data sets in each domain. Empirical results in the forecasting area indicate that, from a general perspective, the proposed EMLP model exhibits superior generalizability in 23 cases (76.67\%) compared to traditional models. Furthermore, numerical results in the classification area reveal that the proposed model outperforms or matches the performance of the conventional MLP in 26 cases (86.67\%). These outcomes clearly underscore the significance of reliability, a factor not considered in any of the conventional MLP modeling procedures. Therefore, the proposed MLP model represents a suitable alternative in modeling, especially when greater generalizability is desired.},

Both of these methods require sorting the squared residuals. Because sorting is not a differentiable operation, end-to-end optimalisation with gradient-based methods is not stable. Furthermore, existing algorithms for estimating LTS and LMS regressors rely on multiple random initial starting points . We propose and investigate two potential improvements to LTS and LMS: (1) the use of soft differentiable sorting in the loss functions and (2) deterministic initialisation of the estimators using the wrapping transformation. The first improvement aims to tackle the drawbacks of using hard sorting by introducing an alternative loss function that can be optimised using gradient based optimisation schemes, while the latter improvement aims to remove the need for multiple random initial starting points , leading to both improved accuracy as well as faster convergence. We perform an extensive experiment on both simulated and real world datasets and compare the performance of our introduced methods with well known baseline methods for robust regression . We show that the deterministic initialisation has significant benefits for LTS and LMS, both for predictive accuracy and for computational speed. The soft loss function mostly benefits LMS, as it makes it possible to apply iterative optimisation schemes to the LMS loss function. We also demonstrate the potential application of the Soft LTS loss function to non-linear regression problems using neural networks .},

  abstract     = {Differential Evolution is a well-known stochastic algorithm in Evolutionary Computation (EC) for single-objective numerical optimization , and its powerful variants secured excellent ranks in recent competitions. These winner DE variants all employed binomial crossover which tackles the positional bias in crossover operation by treating the D parameters separately and independently, however, the binomial crossover in these winner DE variants still have bias from the spatial search perspective, and this was the reason why the QU asi- A ffine TR ansformation E volution (QUATRE) algorithm in the literature was proposed. In this paper, a novel QUATRE algorithm with novel adaptation of E volution M atrix and S election operation (QUATRE-EMS) was proposed to further improve the overall performance of the QUATRE variants for numerical optimization and the main highlights can be summarized as follows. First, the number of control parameters is reduced from three in DE to two in QUATRE-EMS by proposing an auto-generated evolution matrix. Second, a novel adaptation scheme of the evolution matrix M is proposed for a better adaptation of the landscape of the objective during evolution; Third, a new selection operation is proposed instead of employing the canonical selection operation in DE. Finally, a large test suite containing 100 benchmarks from CEC2013, CEC2014, CEC2017 and CEC2022 test suites for single-objective numerical optimization is used for algorithm validation, and total 11 state-of-the-art algorithms including our QUATRE-EMS are taken into comparison.

  abstract     = {In many cases, data are not expressed as individual values on a timeline, but are a collection of values obtained at certain moments in time - they are time series. In these cases, traditional clustering models for one-time data are unable to properly account for the time-variability of the data. In this paper, by considering the partitioning around medoids approach in a fuzzy framework, we propose fuzzy clustering models for multivariate time series . In order to neutralize the negative effects of outlier time series in the clustering process , we proposed robust fuzzy c-medoids clustering models for time series based on the combination of Huber&#39;s M-estimators and Yager&#39;s OWA operators . The proposed models are able to smooth the influence of anomalous time series by means of the so-called typicality parameter, capable to tune the influence of the outliers. The performance of the proposed models has been shown by means of a simulation and real-data sets study: (i) two-dimensional dataset of time series, (ii) the average daily time series of temperatures, and (iii) the pregnancy dataset of time series. The comparison made with the robust clustering models known from the literature indicates the competitiveness of the introduced model to others.},

To address such problems, we design a deep learning-based model (named I 3 T) using I nter- and I ntra-Path of I nfluence T ransitivity to predict the incremental popularity of information diffusion in information networks. First, we leverage a graph neural network (GNN) to aggregate the node information of the local neighbors. Then, we sample the information cascade into a group of sequences using DeepWalk and update the node embedding with GNN and DeepWalk simultaneously, which embodies both the inter-path and intra-path of influence transitivity. Next, we exploit bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) to extract structural features and apply gated recurrent unit (GRU) to extract temporal features. Finally, we learn the structural factor weight under the temporal guidance of the attention mechanism .

It is important to judge if a target instance is from one of the classes shared by the source and target domains. Toward this end, we propose a Collaborative learning-based unknown-Class Instance Identification (CoCII) model, in which a cross-domain network and a dedicated network are jointly optimized. The knowledge is learnt from the labeled source data, and then leveraged to predict the labels of target domain samples by the first network. The second network specializes in the target domain under the guidance of the first one. We further incorporate an augmented classification head together with semantic-based contrastive regularization into the dedicated network. This will enable the model in capturing information useful for identifying unknown-class instances, as well as identifying the shared classes. The dedicated network in turn guides the cross-domain network via consistency regularization . Empirical results on Office-31/Home, DIGIT and VisDA-2017 demonstrate that CoCII can outperform other existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the average of class-wise accuracies over both known and unknown classes.},

  abstract     = {RGB-D object recognition systems improve their predictive performances by fusing color and depth information, outperforming neural network architectures that rely solely on colors. While RGB-D systems are expected to be more robust to adversarial examples than RGB-only systems, they have also been proven to be highly vulnerable. Their robustness is similar even when the adversarial examples are generated by altering only the original images&#39; colors. Different works highlighted the vulnerability of RGB-D systems; however, there is a lacking of technical explanations for this weakness. Hence, in our work, we bridge this gap by investigating the learned deep representation of RGB-D systems, discovering that color features make the function learned by the network more complex and, thus, more sensitive to small perturbations. To mitigate this problem, we propose a defense based on a detection mechanism that makes RGB-D systems more robust against adversarial examples. We empirically show that this defense improves the performances of RGB-D systems against adversarial examples even when they are computed ad-hoc to circumvent this detection mechanism, and that is also more effective than adversarial training .},

The assessment of the importance of a specific element in a process could be always important, but regarding the importance of the operating system (OS), in a computer system, is critical due to its pivotal role in contemporary human life, enabling the efficient and seamless execution of multiple tasks for various users. The proposed methodology integrates two theoretical concepts, namely complex intuitionistic fuzzy sets (CIFS) and soft sets (SS). Furthermore, we aim at assessing the significance of the OS by an innovative technique of complex intuitionistic fuzzy soft relations (CIFSRs), that consists of merging two complex intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (CIFSSs), the Cartesian product (CP) of the CIFSRs notions can be determined. Hence, the proposed fuzzy-based structures are utilized to model problems related to the OS, which is accountable for managing the memory and operations of computer systems, including their hardware and software. It facilitates users in performing tasks with ease. The CIFSRs offer a comprehensive structure as they consider the membership degree (MD) and non-membership degree (NMD) aspects of objects in complex numbers. Moreover, score functions are established for the proposed CIFSRs to facilitate effective decision-making processes.

  abstract     = {Credit transactions are vital financial activities that yield substantial economic benefits. To further improve lending decisions, stakeholders require accurate and interpretable credit scoring methods. While the majority of previous studies have focused on the relationship between individual features and credit risk, only a few have investigated cross-features. Notably, cross-features can not only represent structured data effectively but also provide richer semantic information than individual features. Nevertheless, most previous methods for learning cross-feature effects from credit data have been implicit and unexplainable. This paper proposes a new credit scoring model based on contrastive augmentation and tree-enhanced embedding mechanisms, termed CATE. The proposed model automatically constructs explainable cross-features by using tree-based models to learn decision rules from the data. Moreover, the importance of each local cross-feature is then derived through an attention mechanism . Finally, the credit score of a user is evaluated using embedding vectors. Experimental results on 4 public datasets demonstrated the interpretability of our proposed method and outperformed 13 state-of-the-art benchmark methods in terms of performance.},

However, tabular benchmarks have several drawbacks that can hinder fair comparisons and provide unreliable results. These usually focus on a small pool of operations in heavily constrained search spaces – usually cell-based neural networks with pre-defined outer-skeletons. In this work, we conducted an empirical analysis of the widely used NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201 and TransNAS-Bench-101 benchmarks in terms of their generability and how different operations influence the performance of the generated architectures. We found that only a subset of the operation pool is required to generate architectures close to the upper-bound of the performance range. More, the performance distribution is negatively skewed, with many architectures clustered near the upper accuracy bound. Further experiments revealed that convolution layers have the highest impact on the architecture&#39;s performance and that specific combinations of operations favor top-scoring architectures. Overall, our results demonstrate the need for benchmarks with greater operation diversity and less constrained search spaces. We provide suggestions for improving future benchmark design and evaluation of NAS methods when using existing benchmarks.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel notion of a transition that has two kinds of conditions: observable and unobservable modes . In this study, such a transition under the two kinds of conditions is called a bimodal transition. Sensors are normally deployed in discrete event systems , such as automated manufacturing systems , to observe the occurrences of events in order to control a system&#39;s evolution and prevent from entering forbidden states such as deadlocks . The events that are observable under normal conditions may become unobservable if sensors that detect their occurrences fail or generate faulty data. In this sense, a transition could have two operational modes : the observable mode under normal conditions and unobservable mode under failure conditions. A system&#39;s controller can be disabled if a bimodal transition changes from an observable mode to an unobservable mode. To this end, we propose an adaptive supervisory control strategy that prevents deadlocks in a system whether bimodal transitions are operating in an observable or unobservable mode. The adaptive supervisory controller is composed of control places, making all the siphons in a net system max-controlled, and bimodal transition controllers, re-marking siphons that may become under-marked if bimodal transitions are operating in an unobservable mode.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial attacks in visual object tracking aim to drop tracking performance through injecting imperceptible perturbations to the input of the tracker. Current methods usually superimpose perturbation maps on the input images, and advocate blinding the tracker via occluding the real targets to achieve attack effect. From the perspective of attraction, we alternatively propose a novel idea of attacking the tracker, which advocates using perturbation patches to act as fake targets to attract the tracker&#39;s attention. For this purpose, we establish a multi-conditional objective function to generate our ideal patch in an offline iterative manner. For invisibility, we integrate the constraint of patch value into the function for unified optimization. For universality, in addition to adopting large-scale and high-diversity training samples, we also incorporate the video-agnostic condition into this function. To make the patch attractive like a fake target, we elaborately design the non-overlapping area to determine the patch position, and generate matched fake labels to mislead the tracker to track the patch. In online attacking, it only needs to paste the optimized patch onto the video frames, the tracker will be successfully attracted by our patch, achieving attack effect. Extensive experimental results on 8 popular tracking datasets demonstrate that our method can obtain exceptional attack performance in both non-targeted and targeted attack. Additionally, the experiments on transferability illustrate our optimized patches can be directly applied to other trackers with different architectures.},

For group decision-making (GDM) problems with multi-granularity PLZN preference relations (PLZNPRs), this paper proposes a GDM method based on data envelopment analysis cross-evaluation (DEA-CE) model and expert credibility. First, as the foundation for solving GDM problems with multi-granularity PLZNPRs, this paper reveals the inadequacies of existing methods on transformation and comparison between multi-granularity PLZNs through arithmetic examples. After analyzing these inadequacies, this paper proposes the novel transformation and comparison methods with better performances. Second, to obtain the priorities of multi-granularity PLZNPRs more efficiently, DEA-CE model is introduced and the effectiveness of introducing DEA-CE model is demonstrated. The superiority of introducing DEA-CE model is that it requires no further adjustment of preference relations at any consistency level, which helps to maximize the retention of original information. Third, the subjective expert weights determined based on realistic situations are objectively adjusted using the expert credibility calculated according to the information quality, making the results more reasonable. Finally, this paper illustrates by two case examples that the proposed model can be well adapted to GDM problems with all sizes, regardless of the numbers of decision variables and experts.},

However, it is expensive to obtain segment-level annotations for large-scale datasets. To overcome this challenge, a new few-shot learning method is proposed that localizes temporal actions for unseen classes with only a few training samples. In this study, a new multi-level encoder cosine-similarity alignment module is adopted that exploits the alignment of visual information at each temporal location . The proposed method arranges the video snippets that contain similar foreground action instances, and it captures the intra-class variations more implicitly. In addition, it incorporates cosine similarity in Transformer encoder layers that supports the self-attention mechanism. This emphasizes more on refined features at the higher encoder layers. Towards this objective, an episodic-based training scheme is adopted to learn the alignment of similar video snippets with a few training examples. At the test time, the learned context information is then adapted to novel classes. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for few-shot temporal action localization with single and multiple action instances on the ActivityNet-1.3 dataset and achieves competitive results on the THUMOS-14 and HACS datasets.},

To address this problem, this study introduces a novel safe reinforcement learning algorithm that satisfies joint chance constraints with a high probability for multi-constraint gold cyanide leaching processes. In particular, the proposed algorithm employs chance control barrier functions to maintain the state within the desired safe set with high probability and transforms the joint chance constraint into a cumulative cost form using a constraint relaxation method. This relaxation method guarantees the satisfaction of safety requirements within a specified time horizon. A surrogate objective function optimized by stochastic gradient ascent is derived to ensure monotonic improvement of the policy in the trust region . The augmented Lagrangian-based constrained policy optimization is utilized, converting the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained saddle-point optimization problem and avoiding the periodic performance oscillations common in the general Lagrangian method. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of policy improvement, and constraint satisfaction and operates safely in multi-constraint scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Rapid and accurate detection of anomalies is critical to safety and profitability in the industrial process. In recent years, most data-driven unsupervised anomaly detection methods adopt a two-stage model framework, that is, dimensionality reduction first and then detection, to overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by excessive dimensionality. Among them, Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM) has become the focus of research due to its excellent model design and joint optimization strategy . However, DAGMM can only retain the reconstructed features of input samples during dimensionality reduction, which limits its detection performance. To make up for the deficiency of DAGMM in feature extraction, this paper proposes the Pyramid Reconstruction Assisted Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (PRDAGMM). This model uses a Pyramid Reconstruction (PR) mechanism to calculate the reconstruction errors of each hidden layer of the Deep Autoencoder used for dimensionality reduction and add them to the low-dimensional representation of the sample as features, thus preserving the deep features of samples. These new features can effectively participate in the subsequent anomaly detection task and complement the original features. With these complementary features, the detection performance of PRDAGMM is significantly improved. Experiments on two industrial cases have proved the effectiveness of PR, and the practical ability of PRDAGMM in industrial process monitoring has also been fully verified.},

  abstract     = {Sustainable smart living (SSL) is a crucial component in the emergence of smart cities. These cities offer potential solutions to address pressing urban challenges, including traffic congestion, energy consumption and environmental degradation. Recently, many SSL frameworks have been developed based on multiple factors. However, no framework can simultaneously address all these factors. Furthermore, no research has ranked and graded the identified SSL frameworks to select the most sustainable framework. These are considered challenging tasks. To address these challenges, three-way decisions (TWD) and multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) can serve as a valuable solution for city planners and decision-makers. This study introduces TWD-based MCDM as novel conditional probabilities by opinion scores (CPOS) within the context of circular-Pythagorean fuzzy sets (C-PFSs), namely, C-PFSs-CPOS method, to estimate the conditional probability of each alternative. Additionally, Bayesian decision theory within a C-PFS environment is employed to construct the decision thresholds for each alternative. Furthermore, the prioritisation of factors that impact the ranking and grading of SSL frameworks is achieved through the application of the fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) method within a C-PFS environment, namely, C-PFS-FWZIC method. A total of 37 SSL frameworks (alternatives) are evaluated on the basis of 19 assessment factors (criteria) distributed in 4 layers. Results show that six alternatives exhibit a high level of sustainability, as evidenced by their position in the positive region, whereas two alternatives consistently fall within the negative region for all σ σ values. At σ = 0.05 σ=0.05 , the remaining SSL framework alternatives are positioned within the boundary region. When σ σ value increases to a range of 0.55–0.59, TWD is transformed into a two-way decision-making. Sensitivity and correlation analyses are conducted to evaluate the stability and robustness of the proposed methods.},

The result is an exhaustive characterization of such number-conserving cellular automata. Until now, such a characterization was known only for finite grids, for which research hypotheses could be derived on the basis of computer experiments. It turns out that when considering number conservation for non-uniform cellular automata, the infinite grid cannot be treated as a limiting case of finite grids, i.e. , there are number-conserving non-uniform cellular automata on the infinite grid that have no analogous counterpart on finite grids.},

In this study, we explore the driving role of social networks in the consensus-reaching process from the perspective of structural holes and construct a social network-driven bi-level minimum cost consensus model (MCCM) for LSGDM. The bi-level MCCM reflects the Stackelberg game between the moderator and decision-makers, in which two structural hole indices are used to obtain the weight of decision-makers and facilitate consensus-reaching, respectively. We analyze the Nash equilibrium strategy and design a particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the bi-level MCCM. Furthermore, we implement the proposed bi-level MCCM on a social network generated from a real dataset. Subsequently, a detailed analysis of the implementation results shows the decisive role of social networks driving large-scale group consensus-reaching and reveals the relationship between position and benefit in the social network of decision-makers.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the rationality of selecting HRSCs as a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem and to develop a more effective and advantageous decision model for this problem. Firstly, a set of evaluation attributes that meet the requirements of economic development in the post-epidemic era is developed. Secondly, trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy numbers (TrIT2FNs) are used as the quantitative form of linguistic term set (LTS) to describe the evaluation information of alternatives under multiple attributes. Then, the TrIT2FNs-MABAC method, based on regret theory and the combined weight of game theory, is proposed to solve the problem. With the MABAC method, enterprises can tackle the MADM problem for choosing HRSCs in the post-epidemic era. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are also demonstrated through comparative analysis and discussion. In addition to providing solid theoretical knowledge, this research also makes a special contribution to enterprises seeking to select HRSCs and human resources departments .},

  abstract     = {Multi-view semi-supervised feature selection can identify a feature subset from heterogeneous feature spaces of data. However, existing methods fail in handling large-scale data since they have to calculate the inverses of high-order dense matrices. Moreover, traditional methods often pre-construct graphs to mine the similarity structure of data, such that the interaction between graph construction and feature selection is directly ignored, degrading their effectiveness in practice. To address these issues, we propose an efficient multi-view feature selection method (EMSFS), which combines graph learning, label propagation as well as multi-view feature selection within a unified framework. Specifically, EMSFS can adaptively learn a bipartite graph between training samples and generated anchors, not only reducing the cost of graph computation but also tactfully avoiding the inverse of a high-order matrix. As a result, the main computational complexity of EMSFS is approximately linear to the number of training samples. Meanwhile, EMSFS simultaneously selects important features and exploits the similarity structure in the projected feature space, which enhances the reliability of the graph and positively facilitates feature selection. To solve the formulated objective function, we developed an alternating optimization, and experiments validate the effectiveness and the efficiency of EMSFS.},

This method can be applied to a triggered condition with a bound and nonlinear adaptive law, and the better synchronization performance can be arrived with the assistance of the fuzzy controller . Second, the switched pinning strategy is designed, which further saves the energy and avoids the occurrence of communication congestion. Then, by introducing a hidden Markov chain , an asynchronous pinning strategy is further developed. With the assistance of convex optimal techniques, some sufficient criteria are presented to reach the desired synchronization.

The updating law of the dynamic quantizer is regulated by the quantization range to enhance network transmission efficiency while ensuring system performance. A parameter-based dynamic event-triggered mechanism is established based on the correlation between the triggering criterion and updating law of the dynamic quantizer. This mechanism determines whether to broadcast measurements and which measurements to broadcast, as opposed to relying on fixed reporting schedules. Additionally, to deal with the mismatch between the stochastic communication protocol and filter modes, an asynchronous fault detection filter is presented. Using Lyapunov theory , sufficient conditions are attained to guarantee the stochastic stability of the filtering error systems.

Nevertheless, in practice, labeling a large number of samples may be costly. If there are not enough labeled samples available to train the classifier, their classification accuracy may be restricted. To deal with this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-task semi-supervised ordinal regression (MTSSOR) method. Our method is able to incorporate the additional information from the related tasks and unlabeled samples into improving the performance of OR classifiers, when the labeled samples are insufficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt on multi-task semi-supervised OR. In the experiments, we compare MTSSOR with the single-task supervised OR methods , single-task semi-supervised OR methods and multi-task supervised OR method on real-world multi-task OR datasets. The mean-zero error (MZE) and mean-absolute error (MAE) are used as evaluation metrics . The experimental results show that compared with these OR methods, MTSSOR can achieve a minimum of 0.015 and up to 0.152 improvements in term of MZE, and a minimum of 0.02 and up to 0.272 improvements in term of MAE.},

In this paper, we propose a two-phase frequency estimation framework for data with a large domain based on an LDP learned sketch, which separates the high-frequent and low-frequent items to avoid the errors caused by hash collisions . We theoretically proved that the proposed method satisfies LDP. Our method is more accurate than the state-of-the-art frequency estimation methods under LDP including Apple-Count Mean Sketch (Apple-CMS), Apple-Hadamard Count Mean Sketch (Apple-HCMS) and Flash Local Hashing (FLH). The experimental results verify the performance of our method.},

  abstract     = {In pattern recognition tasks, selecting the appropriate features for a supervised classification problem is a critical task. One theoretical tool used for this purpose is the Test Theory, which identifies feature relevance and reduces the complexity of the training and classification processes. However, searching for irreducible subsets of features, called typical testors, that can differentiate objects belonging to different classes, is an exponential problem in terms of the number of features. To address this problem, various algorithms have been proposed in the literature that use different strategies to avoid unnecessary comparisons. In this paper, is proposed the RegularSearch algorithm to find all typical testors in a dataset associated with a supervised classification problem. The algorithm incrementally searches for candidate subsets of features that are most likely to be associated with a typical testor, reducing the number of comparisons as new features are added to the candidate subset. Our comparisons with the best-performing algorithms reported in the literature demonstrate that RegularSearch is more efficient for processing synthetic and real problem datasets in certain scenarios.},

Therefore, collecting numerous fragmented learning coursewares of diverse types constrained by limited budgets has become a challenge. This study presents a mathematical model to formalize the problem of type-diversity maximization-aware coursewares crowdcollection with a limited budget in MOOCs. To solve this problem, this study first proposed two budget allocation algorithms, such as Eba and Wba . Based on Eba and Wba , this study further developed four courseware crowdcollection algorithms, including CC-Eba , CC-Wba - β , GA-CC-Eba , and GA-CC-Wba - β ( β is the scale factor). GA-CC-Wba - β uses three optimizations, including sampling estimation, convergent genetic algorithm , and dimensionality reduction, to obtain the optimal solution. Theoretical proof and extensive experiments show that regardless of budget adequacy, GA-CC-Wba - β can converge to optimal type diversity (TD).

  abstract     = {Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is a powerful model for graph representation learning . Since GCN updates nodes with a recursive neighbor aggregation scheme, training GCN on large-scale graphs suffers from enormous computational cost and large memory requirement. The subgraph sampling method trains GCN on sampled small-scale subgraphs to speed up GCN. However, they also suffer from problems, such as training GCN on unconnected and scale-unbalanced subgraphs, which reduce performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing subgraph sampling methods train GCN on subgraphs independently and ignore the relation information among different subgraphs. This paper proposes a novel subgraph sampling method, Improved Adaptive Neighbor Sampling (IANS), and a novel loss function, Subgraph Contrastive Loss. Subgraphs sampled by the IANS method are scale-balanced, inside nodes are significantly relevant, and the sample ratio controls the sparsity of subgraphs. To recover the lost relation information between different subgraphs, the Subgraph Contrastive Loss is defined, which constrains the initially connected nodes in different subgraphs to be closer and pushes unconnected nodes far away in feature space. A series of experiments are conducted, which train GCN with IANS and Subgraph Contrastive Loss for node classification on three different scale datasets. The training time and classification accuracy demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The realm of large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) has gained prominence in management sciences, offering effective solutions for real-world decision challenges. Given that experts from diverse fields possess varying degrees of expertise within LSGDM, their viewpoints exhibit considerable disparity. To attain decision outcomes that enjoy broad consensus, it becomes imperative to ensure equity and rationality within consensus models. However, a significant number of existing consensus models predominantly emphasize inter-subgroup consensus levels, inadvertently neglecting the significance of intra-subgroup consensus degrees. The incorporation of intra-subgroup consensus mechanisms holds pivotal importance for rational subgroup leader selection and opinion refinement among subgroups. Remarkably, this aspect has been underexplored in many prior studies. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel approach called three-way clustering (TWC), inspired by the traditional k -means clustering technique , denoted as the TWC-KM method. By closely intertwining the clustering process with consensus mechanisms , we introduce a TWC-based two-stage adaptive consensus reaching (ACR) model that judiciously accounts for both intra-subgroup and inter-subgroup consensus aspects, aptly named the TWC-ACR model. Furthermore, we introduce an objective method for setting consensus thresholds, which considers the subgroup silhouette&#39;s size. Ultimately, the outcomes of our case study and numerical analysis compellingly demonstrate the superior efficacy and reliability of our devised model.},

An appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation can drive a search process toward global optima with a fast convergence rate. However, this balance is not comprehensively understood, and the issue of how to effectively control it is very challenging. In this paper, a new search framework based on an explicit control strategy that balances the amounts of exploration and exploitation in a search process is proposed. First, an explicit control strategy consisting of three types of transference is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation. Then, exploration and exploitation operators are formally defined by adaptive Gaussian local search with reinitialization and multioffspring-based differential evolution, respectively. Finally, a new triple-transference-based differential evolution method is proposed. The experimental results on 29 benchmark optimization functions show its outstanding performance, especially on complex problems. The balance between exploration and exploitation in the proposed algorithm is discussed in detail. The success of this new framework provides more insights into the principles of balancing exploration and exploitation. It also leads us to believe that exploration and exploitation in evolutionary algorithms can eventually be explicitly controlled.},

However, modern supervised multimodal deep learning methods heavily rely on extensive amounts of human-annotated training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised method for multimodal remote sensing land-cover type clustering: Transformer-based Multimodal Prototypical Contrastive Clustering (TMPCC). It is based on three core designs. First, we design a multimodal Transformer that learns a shared space through adaptive interactions between and within modalities. Second, we introduce an online clustering mechanism based on unified prototype learning that is scalable to large-scale multimodal datasets. Third, we employ a self-supervised training strategy that combines instance contrastive loss and clustering loss to enable efficient and effective model training. Coupling these three designs allows for training an end-to-end online clustering network that achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal RS data clustering, e.g., the highest clustering accuracy (92.28\%) among existing methods on the hyperspectral-LiDAR Trento dataset. Our method demonstrates promising scalability in terms of modality and sample size, and it can also generalize to out-of-sample data.

To bridge the gap between unsupervised and supervised learning for FGVC, we investigate the essential factors (including feature extraction, clustering, and contrastive learning) for the performance gap between supervised and unsupervised FGVC. Furthermore, we propose a simple, effective, and practical method, termed as unsupervised fine-grained clustering learning (UFCL), to alleviate this gap. Three key issues are concerned and improved: First, we introduce a robust and powerful backbone, ResNet50-IBN, which has the ability of domain adaptation when we transfer ImageNet pre-trained models to FGVC tasks . Next, we propose to introduce HDBSCAN rather than DBSCAN for clustering, which can generate better clusters for adjacent categories with fewer hyper-parameters. Finally, we propose a weighted feature agent and its update mechanism to perform contrastive learning by employing pseudo labels with unavoidable noise, which can enhance the optimization process of learning the network&#39;s parameters. The effectiveness of our UFCL was confirmed on the CUB-200-2011, Oxford-Flowers, Oxford-Pets, Stanford-Dogs, Stanford-Cars, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets.

However, traditional methods often suffer from maladaptation when implemented in varying data contexts: 1) Although “prompt”-based models demonstrate their worth in data-deficient situations, they underperform in data-abundant settings. 2) Contrastingly, “fine-tuning”-based techniques, which outperform “prompt”-based models in the data-abundant scenario, typically fall short in low-resource environments. In response to these challenges, we propose an anchor-guided sequence labeling model that ingeniously merges the aforementioned paradigms to bolster effective event detection in both data-rich and data-scarce situations. Firstly, we formalize event detection as locating triggers in type-aware inputs, eliminating formal discrepancies between the two paradigms and enabling traditional sequence labeling algorithms to detect events under low-data and zero-shot settings. Secondly, this study introduces an innovative anchor-guided attention mechanism that sets up an information exchange conduit between the two paradigms. Lastly, to enhance the utility of anchors, auxiliary outputs are generated by predicting masked tokens in type-aware inputs.

Firstly, a kind of observable output coupling is introduced into the modeling of CNs based on a type of output coefficient matrices having a general form. Additionally, some distributed dynamic event-triggered control (EVTC) schemes are developed based on the local output information to reduce communication frequency and resource waste. By using FIX stability theory and the method of reduction to absurdity, some concise criteria are derived to reach FIX/PT synchronization and the Zeno behavior is excluded.

  abstract     = {Adversarial training methods are frequently-used empirical defense methods against adversarial examples . While many regularization techniques demonstrate effectiveness when combined with adversarial training, these methods typically work in the time domain. However, as the adversarial vulnerability can be considered a high-frequency phenomenon, it is crucial to regulate adversarially-trained neural network models in the frequency domain to capture low-frequency and high-frequency features. Neural networks must fully utilize the detailed local features extracted by their receptive field. To address these challenges, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the regularization properties of wavelets, which can enhance adversarial training. We propose a wavelet regularization method based on the Haar wavelet decomposition named Wavelet Average Pooling . This wavelet regularization module is integrated into a wide residual neural network to form a new model called WideWaveletResNet. On the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, our proposed Adversarial Wavelet Training method demonstrates considerable robustness against different types of attacks. It confirms our assumption that our wavelet regularization method can enhance adversarial robustness, particularly in deep and wide neural networks. We present a detailed comparison of different wavelet base functions and conduct visualization experiments of the Frequency Principle (F-Principle) and interpretability to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Although the Mel spectrogram is commonly used in SER, it emphasizes low-frequency emotional components. In this paper, we propose VMD-Teager-Mel (VTMel) spectrogram , which complements the Mel spectrogram by emphasizing high-frequency components. In addition, to reduce the redundancy of the acoustic features, we propose a convolutional neural network with a deep restricted Boltzmann machine (CNN-DBM) to obtain optimized deep features. Furthermore, a dual-channel complementary structure is proposed for SER. First, a CNN-DBM extracts optimized deep features from the Mel spectrogram, highlighting low-frequency components. Second, another CNN-DBM extracts optimized deep features from the VTMel spectrogram, highlighting high-frequency components. These features are spliced together and fed to a classifier. The experimental results on three public datasets (EMO-DB, SAVEE, and RAVDESS) reveal that the use of the merged features achieves better performance, confirming the complementarity between the Mel and VTMel spectrograms. The recognition accuracy using CNN-DBM optimized deep features is superior to that using deep features from CNN alone, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Broad learning system (BLS) has attracted widespread attention owing to its concise structure and efficient incremental learning based on ridge regression approximation of pseudo-inverse. However, BLS struggles with expensive computational costs and high memory usage when processing complex problems and training large networks due to the inverse operation of a large matrix. There has been some attempts to address this issue. In this work, we attempt to ameliorate the computational efficiency motivated by the state-of-the-art randomized iterative least squares solver. First, we improve the iteration manner of randomized extended Kaczmarz (REK) and then propose the iterated projection learning for training BLS without pseudo-inverse. The iterated projection learning is suitable for both offline and online learning scenarios and can adjust the model structure by incremental learning. Thanks to its linear convergence of least norm in expectation, the obtained model is expected to have better generalization ability without additional regularization procedure. Our model is found to maintain stable performance during incremental learning. Moreover, instead of grid search, we present an evolutionary bilevel programming (EBP) method with dispersion operator to further optimize the hyperparameters of the network structure. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed methods can improve the efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability compared with pseudo-inverse and grid search based methods.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks typically require a large number of accurately labeled images for training with cross-entropy loss, and often overfit noisy labels. Contrastive learning has proven impressive in noisy label learning because it can learn discrimination representations. However, the weak correlation between the samples and their semantic class, which ignores the correlation between the instances and labels, as well as the instance semantic divergence with the same label, may inevitably lead to class collisions, hampering the label correction. To address these problems, this study proposes a noisy label learning framework that performs label correction and constructs a contrastive prototypical classifier cooperatively. In particular, the prototypical classifier maximizes the distance between the instances and class prototypes to improve the intraclass compactness using contrastive prototypical loss. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that the contrastive prototypical loss has a smaller Lipschitz constant and boosts the robustness. Motivated by the theoretical analysis, this framework performs label correction using the prediction of a contrastive prototypical classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior classification accuracy on synthetic datasets with various noise patterns and levels.},

Most of the existing methods enhance their sentiment classifiers by incorporating user information.

Furthermore, the related studies may not fully utilize user&#39;s personality to model her/his mood. In this paper, we are motivated to propose a Personality-Assisted Mood for Sentiment Classification (PAMSC) model to classify user sentiment. Concretely, we first adopt the target review with global user preference to prejudge user sentiment. Meanwhile, we model the personalized mood impact on her/his sentiment expression according to the corresponding historical reviews. We finally obtain the prediction result by utilizing the personalized mood impact to adjust the prejudged sentiment distribution. Particularly, personality plays two major roles in the process of mood modeling. One is to analyze the personalized duration of user&#39;s mood, and the other is to model the personalized attention toward mood-congruent information. The experimental results demonstrate that our PAMSC model not only achieves the highest classification accuracy than the related models on three real-world datasets but also has stronger interpretability for the prediction process.},

  abstract     = {Ordinal regression (OR) is a crucial in machine learning . Usual assumption is that all training instances are perfectly denoted. However, when this assumption does not hold, the performance degrades significantly. As a widely used ordinal regression model, support vector ordinal regression (SVOR) identifies r-1 parallel hyperplanes to separate r ranks, where each instance is associated with r-1 constraints for r-1 parallel hyperplanes . Different from the traditional classification problem, an instance with incorrect label may have no influence on certain parallel hyperplanes during SVOR learning. If a constraint induces the deviation of parallel hyperplane(s), it is termed as constraint noise. To address constraint noises, this paper proposes constraint-weighted support vector ordinal regression (CWSVOR) by introducing a constraint weight vector whose length is r-1 to control the influence of r-1 constraints on parallel hyperplanes for each instance. When an instance is denoted as an incorrect rank, the elements of the weight vector for constraint noises are close to 0, while others remain close to 1. The proposed constraint-weighted strategy aims to mitigate the detrimental effects of constraint noises and simultaneously retain the useful constraints during SVOR learning. The experiments on several datasets demonstrate that CWSVOR outperforms KDLOR, ELMOP, NNOP , SVOR and NPSVOR when the training set is corrupted by noises and it shows comparable performance to pin-SVOR.},

However, existing methods often train a dedicated unsupervised model for each graph dataset and require laborious tuning. They often prioritize the noisy topological structure and overlook the generalizable implicit connections in local patterns, which hinders the efficient learning of both structure and semantic knowledge . To this end, we consider the powerful expressive ability of the prompt and propose a structural-aware m otif-based p rompt t uning for g raph c lustering framework, namely, MPTGC. Specifically, we first employ a motif-based prompt to match and identify important local patterns, thereby augmenting the structure and semantic information of the original input graph. This helps mitigate the impact of long-tailed distribution and noise in the graph structure. Then, we utilize pretext tasks to pretrain a transferable backbone that facilitates quick adaptation to the graph clustering task . Based on the pretrained model, we leverage the task token prompt function to reformulate the objective of the downstream graph clustering task , making it resemble a general feature reconstruction. Therefore, the pretrained model could be directly applied without tedious fine-tuning to obtain the prediction probability . Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. The MPTGC gains the average improvements of 10.92\% on ACC, 13.53\% on NMI, 16.42\% on ARI and 9.90\% on F1 against the baseline methods on six benchmark datasets.},

This paper proposes a solution for these problems by introducing a Prediction-based and interpretable Meta-Learning method called MbML-NAS, capable of generalizing to different search spaces and datasets using less data than several state-of-the-art NAS methods. The proposal uses interpretable meta-features extracted from neural architectures and regression models as meta-predictors to infer Convolutional Networks performances. Experiments compared MbML-NAS with a graph-based Neural Predictor, state-of-the-art NAS methods, a lower bound, and an upper bound Oracle baseline. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis of meta-features and meta-predictors is presented. As a result, using at least 172 examples representing 0.04\% and 1.1\% of the popular NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 search spaces, MbML-NAS find architectures with better or comparable performances than most baselines, including the Oracle. Moreover, the results showed the potential for using simple meta-features to generalize across NAS search spaces and datasets, encoding neural architectures so that even linear models can accurately predict their performances.

  abstract     = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the standard model architecture for facial expression recognition (FER). However, CNN-based models struggle to capture the structural correlations between different local regions in a face image. Recent methods based on Vision Transformer (ViT) have been introduced to capture long-range dependencies among local regions. Nonetheless, ViT-based approaches are vulnerable to facial regions unrelated to expressions and may learn redundant correlation representations due to their self-attention mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel graph-based model called Face2Nodes, which can flexibly learn the graph representations of facial expressions without requiring additional auxiliary facial information such as landmarks. Our Face2Nodes consists of two key components: a multi-scale feature fusion-based patch embedding and a relation-aware dynamic graph convolution network. The patch embedding method uses a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism to obtain more discriminative graph node features for further graph representation learning. A dynamic graph is constructed using the dilated k-nearest neighbors algorithm, and a relation-aware graph convolution operator is designed to learn the latent informative correlations among different nodes in the graph. Extensive experiment results show that Face2Nodes achieves state-of-the-art performance on several popular in-the-wild FER datasets, with overall accuracies of 91.41\%, 91.02\%, and 66.69\% on the FERPlus, RAF-DB, and AffectNet databases, respectively. Furthermore, we found that CNN-based FER approaches have a more significant performance gap between pre-training and training from scratch than Face2Nodes, demonstrating that our model is more data-efficient than CNN-based approaches.},

The exact threshold of these new nodes, below which the node embedding space will be maintained, however, is rarely considered from theoretical or experimental perspectives. When considering the matrix perturbation theory , the threshold for the maximum number of new nodes to keep the node embedding space approximately equivalent is analytically provided and empirically validated. It is therefore theoretically guaranteed that when the number of new nodes is below this threshold, the embeddings of these new nodes can be quickly derived from the embeddings of the original nodes. A generation framework, space-invariant projection (SIP), is accordingly proposed to enable arbitrary static matrix factorization-based embedding schemes to quickly embed new nodes in dynamic networks. The time complexity of the SIP framework is linear with the network size. By combining SIP with four state-of-the-art MF (matrix factorization) -based schemes, we show that SIP exhibits not only wide adaptability but also strong empirical performance in terms of efficiency and efficacy in both the node classification and link prediction tasks with different real-world datasets.},

To this aim, we specifically focus on hill-climbers and introduce the maximum expansion pivoting rule, which selects the improving neighbor having the highest number of improving neighbors. Experiments show that having one step ahead of information allows for wiser neighbor choices, leading to better local optima. As the best improvement climber, a maximum expansion climber selects a particular search trajectory among all possible first improvement trajectories, however, it significantly increases the expected quality of the trajectory. On the other hand, the computational overhead makes this heuristic less valuable when included in an iterated search process, where repeating fast random hill-climbings from random starting points still allows a better exploration of the search space. This paper, therefore, extends previous studies on the relative efficiency of hill-climbing pivoting rules, by focusing on the original maximum expansion selection criterion. Results suggest that the achievement of good local optima combined with the use of approximation techniques and problem specificities could lead to the design of effective advanced metaheuristics that exploit the maximum expansion principle.},

  abstract     = {With regard to scientific literature reviews, these papers are divided into three major aspects: traditional and novel clustering algorithms , applications, and problems. This study aimed to develop a novel clustering method to remove all the problems of existing clustering methods, such as unnecessary logical partitions , uncertain results, and increased time complexity. A novel clustering method is based on three major steps. It extracts data from the database via a heuristic mechanism and makes comprehensive logical partitions in the main memory. It transforms all logical partitions from main memory into a text file. Furthermore, it presents consistent data in all clusters in three-dimensional format via a Python program. It has few advantages over conventional clustering methods. Firstly, it is one of the systematic approaches to dealing with mixed data types , consistent data, and handling outliers. Secondly, when it uses attributes for the splitting process, it performs single-time database scanning. In other words, it introduces abstract and mathematical models as well as algorithms and metrics and gets significant results via a two-step cluster. Finally, it uses five datasets (freight, HR employee, patient treatment, medical store, and iris flower as raw data) to present consistent data in all clusters in a three-dimensional format.},

The proposed architecture implements secure procedures for processing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) based on an access control array. The cryptographic proof of smart contracts ensures the security of medical data processing and also allows for non-repudiation, enforceability, and accountability of digital agreements made between system actors. We developed an open data exchange format for EHRs stored in the blockchain based on a nested tree structure and the DOM interface. The article presents algorithms for creating, executing and validating smart contracts for processing medical data contained in EHRs. The proposed solutions were subjected to empirical tests and cybersecurity assessment in terms of threat and vulnerability analysis using the risk analysis method.

  abstract     = {Film reviews contain rich and complex linguistic information that can reflect the opinions and emotions of the reviewers. However, existing methods for emotion classification of film reviews rely on quantifying qualitative evaluations numerically. This approach can lead to difficulties in interpretation, information loss, and performance degradation under massive data. In this paper, we propose a novel method that utilizes a probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) and graph attention network (GAT) to classify films based on their emotional content in long reviews. Firstly, the Bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) method is used to convert film reviews into distributed emotional probabilities . This approach not only captures the emotional information in reviews, but also avoids the limitations of numerical quantification. Secondly, using PLTS to represent emotional information not only considers the relationships of linguistic features but also captures multiple emotional information simultaneously. Finally, we utilize multiple GATs to learn and aggregate the distributed emotional probabilities , enabling our method to fully perceive multiple emotional information in the reviews. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other models in classification accuracy on the IMDB film review dataset. Our method emulates human thinking to analyze emotional information in reviews and uses a human-like attention mechanism to learn the interrelationship between emotions in film reviews. Therefore, our method exhibits significant improvements in both accuracy and interpretability compared to current models, making it applicable to diverse domains that necessitate the analysis of linguistic data. Overall, the proposed method in this paper presents a novel and effective approach to analyzing and classifying films based on linguistic reviews.},

To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic multi-objective prediction strategy based on the temporal distribution characteristics assisted by a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network (GTBP). First, a time series is created using the improved historical centroid information, and the time series distribution information is represented by the temporal distribution characteristics. Subsequently, a GRU neural network is used to maximize the distribution characteristics and minimize the losses to train the network model. Finally, the individuals composed of the estimated manifold and the population centroids predicted by the model are combined with some individuals randomly generated for increasing the population diversity to form the initial population at the next moment. To evaluate the GTBP performance, it was compared with four dynamic multi-objective algorithms for 15 test problems. The experimental results demonstrated that GTBP is competitive for solving dynamic multi-objective optimization problems.},

The definition approach is first used to develop the iteration form of corrupted estimation error covariances that is utilized to evaluate the adversary&#39;s detrimental effect . Subsequently, we formulate the solving problems of optimal CR attacks into nonlinear 0-1 programming problems under one-step, terminal, and holistic objectives, respectively. Based on the analysis of physical implementation of attacks, a novel double serial number check method is proposed to detect multi-stage CR attacks with different objectives. From the perspective of system protection, the optimal defense mechanism that minimizes the estimation error with optimal attacks is designed by anticipating the actions of the attacker. Comparisons of CR attacks and its countermeasures through the microgrid consisting of 5-Generator and 8-Line are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Domain generalization is an active research topic for mitigating distribution shifts and improving model generalization by transferring domain-invariant knowledge learned from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods that use static parameters attempt to obtain domain-invariant knowledge by aligning all the sample distributions. However, such static models lack adaptability, and it is difficult to resolve cross-domain conflicts. Moreover, these approaches align all representations to a latent space, where the aligned non-transferable features are prone to cause negative transfer and reduce the discriminability of the algorithms. To solve these problems, we develop an enhanced dynamic feature representation learning framework (DFRL) using Fourier transform for domain generalization. The framework consists of two parts: Fourier-based dynamic residual feature representation learning (DRFR) and dynamic factor . Specifically, DRFR is implemented by developing a dynamic residual module based on Fourier-based sample amplitude mixing to capture the coarse-grained and fine-grained dynamic feature knowledge. Then, we construct a dynamic factor to quantitatively trade-off the alignment and discriminability , preventing model performance degradation due to excessive of pursuit of any aspects. Extensive experiments have been carried on several standard public benchmarks, including Digits-DG, VLCS, PACS and Office-Home, which demonstrate that our framework achieves significant results.},

  abstract     = {The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is the most general and popular solution for imbalanced data . Although SMOTE is effective in solving the class imbalance problem in most cases, it insufficiently exploits the data prior distribution. Additionally, most existing SMOTE variants randomly produce new instances between a minority sample and its nearest neighbors, which carries the risk of noise propagation. To address this, in this paper, local distribution trust estimation based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and dynamic multi-dimensional oversampling (TDMO) is proposed as a novel approach to exploring data distributions. First, undersampling and XGBoost techniques are introduced to train multiple balanced subsets to identify the internal structure of the original data and obtain the classification prediction accuracy of each instance, called the confidence level (CL). Then, instances with low CL (i.e., noise) are filtered out, and the densities of the two classes in the neighborhood of the non-noise instances are evaluated to create candidate samples to expand the diversity of the minority class. Finally, the minority class is enhanced by combining multiple samples in a multi-dimensional feature space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that TDMO outperformed the comparative oversampling methods clearly and obtained the optimal classification results .},

However, current inflexible and non-explicit feature combination methods have limitations that hinder accurate prediction. To address this issue, we propose a sophisticated feature interaction model based on a graph and factorization machine (FM). In this model, each node in the graph corresponds to a raw feature, the edge and its weight between two nodes are determined by the learnable latent vectors in the FM. This interaction method integrates the flexible and explicit representative ability of the graph with the learnability of the FM. Furthermore, it can be combined with most learning-based CTR prediction models to improve their performance. To verify this viewpoint, we apply it to improve three prominent models, including one deep-forest-based model and two deep-learning-based models, and compare them with the state-of-the-art techniques.

These systems separately model linear and nonlinear patterns aiming to overcome the limitations of using only a single model. This system comprises three phases: linear modeling of the time series, forecasting the residuals using an ML model, and final forecasting through the combination of past phases. Modeling the residuals is challenging because the residuals may present heteroscedasticity , complex nonlinear patterns, and random fluctuations. Hence, specifying a single ML model is a complex task. This work proposes a hybrid system that combines a linear statistical model with an ensemble of ML models to forecast real-world time series. The proposed method employs an ensemble in the phase of modeling the residuals, aiming at: improving the generalization capacity of the system, reducing the risk of selecting an incorrect model, expanding the function space, and increasing the system&#39;s accuracy. Moreover, for each time series, a data-driven search is carried out for the parameters of the ensemble that will be the most suitable for that time series.

In this paper, a multifunctional associate memory circuit based on spiking signal is proposed and implemented in hardware. The circuit mainly consists of neuron circuits and synapse modules. These neuron circuits emulate the transmission of spiking signals akin to biological neurons. Fundamental associative memory functions, such as learning and forgetting, are achieved by modulating synaptic weights . This modulation is governed by the voltage differential and input signal sequencing within the circuit. Notably, leveraging parameters derived from simulations, the implementation of the associate memory circuit in hardware obviates the need for stringent experimental prerequisites. And the experimental results are consistent with the simulation results. Furthermore, the circuit is endowed with the capability to execute generalization and differentiation functions, enabling the discrimination between signals labeled as “bell 1200 Hz” and “bell 1500 Hz”.

This proves extremely valuable when labeled samples in the target domain are limited. The framework utilizes test statistics with the same nature to quantify the magnitude of the various shifts, making results more interpretable. It is versatile, suitable for both regression and classification tasks , and accommodates diverse data forms—tabular, text, or image. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DetectShift in detecting dataset shifts even in higher dimensions .},

  abstract     = {Node injection attacks on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received increasing attention recently, due to their ability to degrade GNN performance with high attack success rates. However, our study indicates that these attacks often fail in practical scenarios, since defense/detection methods can easily identify and remove the injected nodes. To address this, we devote to camouflage node injection attack , making injected nodes appear normal and imperceptible to defense/detection methods. Unfortunately, the non-Euclidean structure of graph data and the lack of intuitive prior present great challenges to the formalization , implementation, and evaluation of camouflage. In this paper, we first propose and define camouflage as distribution similarity between ego networks of injected nodes and normal nodes. Then for implementation, we propose an adversarial CA mouflage framework for N ode injection A ttack , namely CANA, to improve attack performance under defense/detection methods in practical scenarios. A novel camouflage metric is further designed under the guide of distribution similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CANA can significantly improve the attack performance under defense/detection methods with higher camouflage or imperceptibility . This work urges us to raise awareness of the security vulnerabilities of GNNs in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection for time-series data is crucial in the management of systems for streaming applications, computational services, and cloud platforms. The majority of current few-shot learning (FSL) approaches are supposed to discover the remarkably low fraction of anomaly samples in a large number of time-series samples. Furthermore, due to the tremendous effort required to label data, most time-series datasets lack data labels, necessitating unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Therefore, time-series anomaly detection is a problem that combines the aforementioned two difficulties, termed FS-UDA. To solve the problem, we propose a Few-Shot time-series Anomaly Detection framework with unsupervised domAin adaPTation (FS-ADAPT), which consists of two modules: a dueling triplet network to address the constraints of unsupervised target information, and an incremental adaptation module for addressing the limitations of few anomaly samples in an online scenario. The dueling triplet network is adversarially trained with augmented data and unlabeled target samples to learn a classifier. The incremental adaptation module fully exploits both the critical anomaly samples and the freshest normal samples to keep the classifier up to date. Extensive experiments on five real-world time-series datasets are conducted to assess FS-ADAPT, which outperforms the state-of-the-art FSL and UDA based time-series classification models , as well as their naive combinations.},

In most FWA variants, a simple random explosion generates sparks, accompanied by the guiding operator to explore promising search directions. However, this mechanism proves inefficient in exploiting the local landscape and effectively navigating the promising search directions. In this paper, we introduce a novel explosion technique based on orthogonal design (OD), wherein the orthogonal array is leveraged to regulate the distribution of sparks, thus enabling efficient analysis of spark information. Furthermore, we devise a two-stage mechanism for information utilization. In the initial stage, we propose an orthogonal learning (OL) prediction operator to capitalize on local optima by performing factor analysis on both the objective function value and the ranking feature information. Subsequently, in the second stage, an enhanced guiding method is deployed to determine the most promising search direction. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm (OLFWA) showcases competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art FWA variants, various renowned OD-based algorithms, and other promising methods.

In ER Rule-GFS, the feature spaces of data streams are generalized, which means that at each stage, new features and existing features will occur randomly or not. When a new data stream arrives, a certain effective feature selection algorithm is used to select the informative features first. Then, the selected features and the features stored thus far are divided into three categories, namely, active/new/silent . According to whether active and new are null , three generalized basic learning problems are formulated, and their solutions are given. Afterwards, if there are too many features, follow-on feature selection will be performed mainly in silent based on the activated frequency and weight. The effectiveness of ER Rule-GFS is verified by various experiments on 20 synthetic datasets .},

Over the last years, filter methods have been successfully employed to reduce the size of the input dataset and retain, at the same time, the relevant feature information for modeling and classification problems. However, the extant filter algorithms are mostly heuristic or require high computational effort. The BPA overcomes these drawbacks by taking advantage of the links between variables brought to the fore by the Edwards&#39;s algorithm. Once the High Dimensional Graphical Model, depicting the probabilistic structure of the variables, is determined, the BPA selects the best subset of features by analyzing its path-steps. The path-step that includes the variables with the most predictive power for the target one is then determined via the computation of the entropy correlation coefficient . This index, being based on the notion of (symmetric) Kullback-Leibler divergence, is closely connected to the mutual information that the path-step variables share with that of interest. The BPA application to simulated and real-word benchmark datasets highlights its potential and greater effectiveness compared to alternative extant methods.},

A disentangled representation of the malware&#39;s control flow graph is exploited, and a specialized transformer architecture is trained with a triplet-loss function, aiming to fine-tune the representation of malicious attributes. An attention mechanism of the transformer judiciously discerns functional signatures from intricate control flow graphs. Empirical evaluations on real-world malware datasets underscore the efficacy of the proposed method, achieving an outstanding recall rate of 83.37\% with mere 2,000 training samples. As a result, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of 99.45\% and a recall of 97.89\%.},

However, most continuous DGNN methods only aggregate local neighborhood information and ignore the importance of global information, leading to the loss of structural and semantic information that is not aggregated during the evolution of networks. Therefore, we propose a continuous dynamic network representation learning model called the T ransformer-based T emporal G raph N eural N etwork (T-TGNN) to aggregate global event-driven information in continuous dynamic networks. Specifically, we first adopted ordinary neural differential equations to model continuous temporal changes in dynamic networks. Subsequently, we used transformer mechanisms to aggregate the temporal and structural information. To better utilize transformers to aggregate the impacts of large regional changes, we designed a spatial event coefficient based on an attention mechanism to describe the global range of event dependencies in dynamic networks. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted on dynamic network benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

Smart transportation is an integral part of modern-day smart city projects.

  abstract     = {Existing multi-view clustering algorithms are typically built on the prior assumption that data collected from different sources are complete without missing, while this is not always satisfied in real-world applications. Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMC) aims at discovering the latent cluster structure and partitioning the incomplete multi-view data into different groups, which is more practical yet challenging. Moreover, the main bottleneck of the current IMC research is how we could economically cluster large-scale incomplete multi-view data with limited resources. In this paper, we propose a novel Scalable Incomplete Multi-view Clustering with Adaptive Data Completion (SIMC_ADC) method, which seeks to deal with large-scale IMC with promising instance-level restoration. Specifically, to cater to large-scale IMC, our SIMC_ADC unifies representative anchor learning and similarity recovery into a one-stop learning scheme within linear computational and memory costs. Moreover, we formulate an adaptive instance completion scheme to discover and generate trustworthy underlying connections across instances, which iteratively infers and pads the missing instances along with the complete similarity learning. Importantly, theoretical analysis on data completion error further guarantees the reliability of such data completion paradigm. Extensive experiments validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method when handling large-scale IMC problems in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.

  abstract     = {Context-aware systems (CASs) have become increasingly prevalent in modern-day settings such as digital home and smart healthcare, primarily owing to the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT). High-quality contexts play a vital role in the effectiveness of CASs, especially in applications involving multiple sensors. When multiple sensors provide identical information, utilizing various sources of context can enhance the dependability of said contexts through the provision of mutual support. However, there is a high possibility that multiple contexts conflict, which can lead to a problem of context inconsistency. Various methods that include quality of context (QoC) parameters have been employed to solve the issue of context inconsistency. One of the limitations of these methodologies is their inadequate consideration of the context correctness. Moreover, when attempting to address context inconsistency through the utilization of QoC parameters, the conventional Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory may result in significant conflicts. To tackle the aforementioned concerns, a comprehensive measure of correctness (CMoC) is introduced to offer a more efficient assessment of the correctness of contexts. In light of the limited flexibility in assigning probabilities to contexts using D-S evidence theory, the two-dimensional mass function (TDMF) is introduced. This method allows for assigning probabilities to contexts from various sources. On this basis, a context inconsistency elimination algorithm based on CMoC and TDMF is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been verified through experimental analyses conducted across various dimensions. Based on the experimental findings, it has been demonstrated that the proposed algorithm’s context-judge rate can achieve 97.08\%, provided that the high precision configuration of sensors, as outlined in this paper, is utilized. This achievement surpasses that of other inconsistency elimination algorithms by at least 2.05\%.},

  abstract     = {The consistency issue of uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems with state delay is investigated. We propose a novel neuroadaptive control scheme that utilizes the novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional design to get rid of the effect of state delay. In the design of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a set of reduced-order smoothing functions is introduced to enhance the system&#39;s transient performance. In addition, an improved tuning function method is proposed to reduce the dimension of the adaptive parameters. In this paper, the estimation parameters are the greatest norm of the ideal weighted vector, so that each agent needs only one online update parameter, which greatly reduces the online computation burden. The proposed controller converges the synchronization error to a predetermined interval and guarantees the transient performance of the adjustable L 2 L2 -norm. Finally, the results are proved through two examples.},

  abstract     = {Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) are challenging due to the complexity of feasible regions caused by constraints, especially when facing small feasible ranges, multiple feasible regions, and complex distribution of feasible regions. Existing algorithms struggle to balance population convergence, diversity, and feasibility. This paper proposes a constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm framework based on global and local feasible solutions search to address this issue. The proposed framework is divided into three stages, and an adaptive method is proposed to decide when to switch the search state. In the first two stages, the evolution of the population is relatively free and not subject to constraint restrictions. Feasible solutions in the population are saved in the FeasiblePool for environmental selection during these two stages. The FeasiblePool does not affect the evolving population during these stages. In the first stage, the framework uses global search operator to fully explore the decision space and determine the rough range of feasible solutions in the decision space. In the second stage, the framework uses local search operator to enhance the diversity of FeasiblePool within this determined range. In the last stage, the framework reuses these excellent feasible solutions information to guide population evolution while considering constraints. The proposed framework has been compared with four state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective algorithms on four benchmark suites and three real-world applications. The complete experimental results show that the proposed framework has high competitiveness for solving CMOPs.},

Unfortunately, it faces a series of security challenges and threats in developing and deploying multimedia services, such as tampering, hijacking, and adversarial attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual-embedding framework based on block truncation coding to improve the security of intelligent multimedia systems. First, the signal is decomposed in frequency domain by using approximate translation invariance to obtain multi-layer frequency-domain parameters; then, this paper hides the encrypted data in two layers of low-frequency coefficients through fragile and robust embedding algorithms, respectively. In addition, in order to further improve the security performance, this paper adopts the method of block truncation coding to encrypt the embedded data. On the basis of performance analysis, the superiority of this method is illustrated by comparing with the existing methods.},

This scenario creates new possibilities for social interactions that can worsen problems like the Echo chamber or the information cocoon effects. In this work, we devise a virtual and real blending network environment and introduce the concern vector indicator to explore the equilibrium of individual concern-critical influence maximization (EIC-cIM). We compute the complexity of the EIC-cIM and verify the modularity of the objective function. A surrogate objective function is introduced to tackle the problem of the EIC-cIM. We exploit the continuous relaxation technique to develop an approximate projected subgradient algorithm, which effectively guarantees the balance of individual concern in the information diffusion process. The experimental simulations on three network data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and the experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing heuristic algorithms by at least 23\% in performance and even outperforms the max-greedy algorithm in some cases.},

However, the large increase in feature dimensions poses a great challenge to FS methods. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization algorithm consisting of an Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) and NSGA-III was proposed to solve the FS problem with high-dimensional data. Through S-shaped, V-shaped and U-shaped transfer functions, the conversion from real number coding to binary coding is realized to solve discrete problems, and the influence of these three transfer functions on the effect of FS is compared. In addition, the algorithm optimizes the population in the binary search space by building an external archive , and realizes the selection and optimization of external archive individuals based on the clustering strategy. The KNN classifier was used to realize the classification progress. The simulation experiments are divided into two groups with 18 medium and high dimensional data . The first group analyzes the optimization effect of the proposed framework under three transfer functions. The second group of experiments selects the algorithm that wins in the first group of experiments and compares it with eleven classical multi-objective optimization algorithms. The evaluation criteria includes two optimization objectives of the FS problem and the optimization indices of HV and IGD. The first set of experiments showed that the U-shaped transfer function family performed best in the FS problem, with U3 being the most excellent, followed by V-shaped and S-shaped. Compared to other multi-objective optimization algorithms, the simulation results also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {Subspace mapping is a key step and an important tool for feature extraction and selection. Although subspace mapping methods are successful, there are still some common defects: 1) The final subspace does not possess global properties, only local properties; 2) most models fail to retain the low-rank structural information; and 3) the projection matrix contains considerable redundant and irrelevant information. Accordingly, we develop a novel method, i.e., structure preserving projections learning via low-rank embedding (SPPL-LRE), to address the above issues. We first extract the principal component information by seeking the projection directions of maximum variance, which makes the final subspace equipped with global properties. Then, SPPL-LRE regresses the principal component information to a classwise block-diagonal structure. In this way, the low-rank information and main energy of the data are held in the subspace so that the obtained projection can extract more salient and informative features. Meanwhile, introducing low-rank information can also enhance the robustness of the model. Moreover, a strong L2 norm constraint is imposed on the projection to avoid model overfitting and exclude the interference of redundant information, which can enhance the interpretability of the model. Finally, we introduce the graph smoothness of the representation matrix to better preserve the manifold geometry of the original data. Extensive experiments indicate that our method is more robust and effective than other state-of-the-art methods.},

This study proposes a pragmatic guideline for using the PC matrix in the AHP to help decision makers (DMs) improve their decisions. First, extensive computer simulations indicate that, without strong evidence of linear relationship between an inconsistency index of a PC matrix and validity of priority vector derived from that matrix, it is questionable to set a threshold for this index to determine whether a PC matrix acceptable. Second, to resolve this problem, we propose a scale-validity (SV) index as an effective proxy for evaluating the validity of derived priority vector . Third, by integrating two paradigms ( deterministic vs. statistical ), we suggest a pragmatic guideline for DMs who have different epistemological views of inconsistency in order to improve their decision when using the AHP. To demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, four examples of comparative analysis are illustrated. Finally, we summarize the results, contributions, and suggestions.},

However, these devices often encounter limitations in terms of computational power and battery life. Moreover, iterations of mobile health device versions may result in changes to their computational limitations, leading to additional costs for model design and training. Therefore, it is crucial to develop lightweight models that enable efficient inference under resource constraints and are compatible with various devices. To address these challenges, we propose a resource-efficient and device-adaptive electrocardiogram diagnosis model based on a multi-classifier dynamic neural network . This model achieves efficient computation by exiting simple samples early and can adapt to the computational limits of various devices by adjusting predefined thresholds. Furthermore, we propose two novel approaches, namely rethinking structure and feature-based knowledge distillation, which enhance the collaboration among classifiers and improve the overall performance. The proposed model is evaluated using three electrocardiogram datasets: PTB-XL (AUC = 0.9706), ICBEB2018 (AUC = 0.964), and MIT-BIH arrhythmia (ACC = 0.994, F1 = 0.961).

Second, for data pre-processing, we introduce a dynamic variable coefficient embedding layer to achieve good adaptability to higher-order tensors and higher prediction accuracy in the initial stages. Moreover, the interval prediction architecture is embedded in the DDPM for the first time, which reduces the influence of interference factors in multivariate time-series prediction on the prediction accuracy of hierarchical models.

The information provided by neighbors may be perplexing due to the set presumption of K for every test sample without any prior knowledge, which might result in incorrect classification results . The hypothesis of locally constant class conditional probabilities relied on by K-NN, is violated by high dimensions , which also bring out the dimensionality curse. Notably, in the case of imperfect data, training samples may be noise-corrupted or located in substantially overlapping regions, thus impairing the effectiveness of the K-NN rule. In contrast to existing research, which frequently focuses on just one of the problems above, this paper presents an adaptive evidential K-NN classification (AEK-NN) algorithm that synchronizes neighborhood search with feature weighting. In order to jointly learn the adaptive neighborhood for each sample and various feature weights, AEK-NN maps the Euclidean space into a rebuilt space consisting of similarity coefficients through a two-stage training process. Within the evidence theory framework, AEK-NN produces classification results for data with imperfect labels. The advantages of applying evidence theory , incorporating adaptive neighborhood search, and feature weighting are shown through ablation studies. We also use simulated and real-world datasets to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of AEK-NN.},

  abstract     = {As a key preprocessing step in classification, feature selection involves two conflicting objectives: maximizing the classification accuracy and minimizing the number of selected features. Therefore, multi-objective optimization is widely used in feature selection due to its excellent trade-off between the convergence of two objectives. However, most existing multi-objective feature selection methods still face the issues of the “curse of dimensionality” and high computational costs, especially when the search space is large. To solve the above issues, this paper proposes a bidirectional dynamic grouping multi-objective evolutionary approach for high-dimensional feature selection, referred to as BDGMOEA. This approach transforms a high-dimensional feature selection problem into a feature selection task with a smaller search space by the idea of feature grouping, in which one bit of an individual represents a group of features. Specifically, a grouping search strategy is developed to divide the features into different quadrants according to the importance of the features obtained by different evaluation techniques. Then, the features in each quadrant are grouped by sector. This strategy can effectively narrow the search space and quickly locate promising feature regions. In addition, a bidirectional dynamic adjustment mechanism is presented by considering the evolutionary state of the population, and it can be used to explore each feature in more detail and comprehensively to prevent good features from being ignored in unselected groups. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BDGMOEA method performs the best in most cases, indicating that BDGMOEA not only achieves better classification performance but also reduces the training time.},

However, handling data containing imbalanced labels, multiple subclasses , bridging points, and nonlinear distributions is challenging. These challenges often make it difficult for existing methods to learn accurate relationships between labelled and unlabelled samples . In this paper, we propose multiple labelled spanning trees (MLSTs). Each labelled sample is initialized as the root node of a tree, and all trees are grown asynchronously according to the manifold structure of their neighbours such that all of the unlabelled samples can establish a connection with the labelled samples. The MLST construction method can better adapt to different disturbances. In addition, MLSTs-constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (MLSTs-NMF) is proposed for label propagation; it constructs a global relationship by using nonlinear representation with labelled samples and combines the manifold structure information from multiple labelled spanning trees to comprehensively estimate the labels of unlabelled samples. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is higher than that of the existing methods, and it exhibits better robustness to various interferences.},

  abstract     = {Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is regarded as useful and efficient tool in identifying and eliminating system failures and important means in safety and reliability analysis. It is widely utilized in diverse areas for improving and enhancing the performance of systems. However, in the procedure of risk assessment, traditional FMEA method usually ignores the influence of weights. Simultaneously, when represent risk assessment information , fuzzy and complex information cannot be represented accurately. Besides, psychological behaviors of decision-makers cannot be considered. Thus, this paper aims to present a new method based on FMEA and S-additive ratio assessment (S-ARAS) method to address the marine risk assessment problems under probabilistic double hierarchy linguistic (PDHL) environment. Firstly, the probabilistic double hierarchy linguistic term sets (PDHLTSs) are utilized to express the evaluation information of failure modes. The expert evaluation information of failure modes and subjective weight is also assessed by using PDHLTSs. The PDHLTSs can describe the information more reasonably and precisely. Secondly, FMEA method is used to evaluate these alternatives from three aspects of Severity ( S ), Occurrence ( O ) and Detection ( D ). Then, the bounded rationality of decision-makers (DMs) is considered. So, the prospect theory and ARAS method is combined to evaluate the risk problems. Meanwhile, comprehensive weight determination method is established based on the social network analysis (SNA) and The Integrated Determination of Objective CRIteria Weights (IDOCRIW) method under PDHL environment. The integrated method is more flexible in determining the importance of failure modes and avoids the randomness of subjective evaluation. Finally, the newly proposed method is applied to address the marine risk assessment problem. Sensitivity analysis of parameter and weight methods is carried out. Furthermore, comparison analysis is given to illustrate the superiority of the presented method.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning techniques for ordinal classification have recently gained significant attention. Predicting an ordinal variable , that is, a variable that demonstrates a natural relationship between categories, is of relevance for a number of real-world problems in various fields of knowledge. For example, a medical diagnosis can occur at different stages of the disease. Applying standard classifiers to ordered labels can lead to errors in distant categories, when errors in an ordinal problem ideally tend to be produced in adjacent classes because of their similarity. To address this issue, we propose a soft labelling approach based on generalised triangular distributions , which are asymmetric and different for each class. The parameters of these distributions are determined using a metaheuristic and are specifically adapted to the given problem. Moreover, this approach enables the model to avoid errors in distant classes (e.g. classifying a patient with a severe disease as healthy). A comprehensive comparison was performed using eight datasets and five performance metrics. The main advantage of the proposed soft-labelling approach is that it adapts the distributions to each problem, resulting in greater flexibility and better performance. The results and statistical analysis show that the proposed methodology significantly outperforms all other methods.},

Unsupervised domain adaptation is a reasonable solution that has recently gained attention. However, most efforts have focused on stationary environments and have ignored the uncertainties that arise from mismatched distributions. Therefore, the proposed method addresses the classification of samples in streaming data in the presence of concept drift, employing a heterogeneous unsupervised domain adaptation method. Accordingly, a fuzzy rough set-based sample weighting approach is introduced to modulate the impact of uncertainties on feature alignment in non-stationary environments. The domain adaptation is carried out through a fuzzy approach and is optimized by a heuristic optimization technique that reduces the sensitivity to tunable parameters. Moreover, an incremental classifier is designed to enable rapid adaptation to changes. The advantages of the proposed method encompass an effective avoidance of excessive alignment, training cost optimization, and the gradual reduction in dependency on the source domain for domain adaptation. Regarding different types of concept drift, experiments on several tasks taken from four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and computational time.},

  abstract     = {Support vector machine (SVM) is an excellent pattern recognition method. Many experiments have shown that SVM can achieve a generalization performance gain by carrying out it in the feature transformation space. Nevertheless, the theoretical foundation behind this phenomenon is presently lack of deep investigation. In the paper, we first give and prove a vital theoretical conclusion that SVM in the feature transformation space can obtain a lower radius-margin bound than one in the feature original space. This means that the performance of SVM can be improved by feature transformation since the radius-margin bound is directly associated with the generalization capacity. Based on this theoretical support, we further propose a novel method called covering-hyperellipsoid-constrained large margin classifier (CHC-LMC). The key characteristic of CHC-LMC is that it jointly learns the minimum bounding hyperellipse and the used classifier by directly minimizing the radius-margin bound in the transformation space, and so embodies the structural risk minimization principle. We develop the linear and nonlinear versions of CHC-LMC and employ an alternate optimization strategy to deal with the corresponding optimization problems . Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the validity of CHC-LMC and evaluate the generalization performance by comparing it with the competing methods.},

  abstract     = {For constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs), the ultimate goal is to obtain a set of well-converged and well-distributed feasible solutions to approximate the constrained Pareto front (CPF). Various constraints may change the position and/or shape of the CPF. This poses great challenges to the approximation of the CPF. This is especially true when the CPF mainly lies on constraint boundaries (i.e., CPF and unconstrained PF have little or even no intersection). To tackle this issue, we propose a novel dual population algorithm for approximating the CPF from both sides of the constraint boundaries. Specifically, P o p u l a t i o n 1 uses the constrained-domination principle to approximate the CPF from the sides of feasible regions only; P o p u l a t i o n 2 adopts an improved ϵ -constrained method to approximate the CPF from both the feasible as well as infeasible regions. Offspring generated by both populations are merged and combined with P o p u l a t i o n 1 and P o p u l a t i o n 2 . In addition, some selected members of P o p u l a t i o n 1 and P o p u l a t i o n 2 are permitted to migrate to the combined populations to facilitate knowledge sharing . Systematic experiments carried out on three benchmark test suites and 10 real-world CMOPs show the proposed algorithm achieved superior or competitive performance, especially for CMOPs where the CPF is mainly located at constraint boundaries. Therefore, on the basis of dual population, approximating CPFs from both sides of feasible and infeasible regions contributes an alternative approach to solving CMOPs.},

Deep learning-based techniques, utilizing abundant observations, have gained popularity in recent years. However, many existing methods mainly explore temporal patterns of meteorological variables while neglecting the interactions between variables across regions. To address this limitation, we propose HiSTGNN , a novel Hi erarchical S patio- t emporal G raph N eural N etwork, which enables accurate predictions of multiple variables and stations over multiple time steps. HiSTGNN incorporates an adaptive graph learning module that constructs a self-learning hierarchical graph, comprising a global graph representing regions and a local graph capturing meteorological variables for each region. By leveraging graph convolution and gated temporal convolution with a dilated inception as the backbone, we effectively capture hidden spatial dependencies and diverse long-term meteorological trends. Additionally, we introduce dynamic interactive learning to facilitate bidirectional information between the two-level graphs. Experiments on three real-world meteorological datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to seven well-known baselines, including convolutional neural networks , recurrent neural networks, and spatio-temporal forecasting methods. Notably, HiSTGNN achieves remarkable improvements over the state-of-the-art weather forecasting method on the WD_BJ dataset, with a 4.25\% decrease in MAE and a 5.34\% decrease in RMSE .},

In this paper, we propose a novel pixel-wise JND prediction model based on deep transfer learning . Since it is almost impossible to manually label each pixel&#39;s visibility threshold, lacking labeled training data is the crucial issue. Transfer learning addresses the problem of insufficient training data. We found an underlying correspondence between full reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) and JND estimation, which implies that knowledge related to FR-IQA can be applied to JND estimation. To quantify the intrinsic association between JND estimation and FR-IQA, a local perceived discrepancy (LPD) index is deduced. With the guidance of the LPD index, a JND predictor based on residual dense network (RDN) is designed to discover good representations of visibility limitation from annotated image quality databases. Subjective viewing test experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art JND models. Furthermore, we apply our model to image compression , and around 14.42\% of the bit rate can be reduced by removing visual redundancy.},

The algorithm is based on the observation that individuals with similar attitudes or beliefs tend to coexist harmoniously in human societies, unlike birds or fish that squeeze or clash in the same space. By incorporating the concept of homogeneity into the optimization process, the algorithm controls particle learning and generates distinct subpopulations for competition and learning. Furthermore, to accelerate the convergence rate, the algorithm employs an autophagy mechanism and dynamic subpopulation diversity, guiding the population towards global optimal solutions while reducing redundant fitness evaluations. The effectiveness of HLPSO is illustrated through its exceptional performance in benchmark test suites, including the IEEE congress on evolutionary computation (CEC) 2008, CEC 2010, and CEC 2013, in both 1000 and 2000 dimensions. These results not only highlight its superiority over several state-of-the-art algorithms but also underscore its aptitude for effectively addressing low-dimensional optimization challenges encountered in CEC 2017.},

  abstract     = {Cross-modal hash has become a key technology for large datasets retrieval. However, some challenges still need to be tackled: 1) How to effectively embed semantic information into hash learning; 2) How to strengthen cross-modal mutual communication and common learning; 3) How to effectively solve data extension with semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel Extensible Multi-similarity Cross-modal Hash Learning (EMCHL) method. To reduce the differentiation of inter-modal and strengthen cross-modal mutual communication, EMCHL mainly considers three similarity measures: 1) Using Hamming distance to measure the semantic structure self-similarity of label and sample hash codes in unimodal, it can reduce the sample quantization error ; 2) the log -likelihood function is adopted to enhance information exchange in cross-modal hash codes. Correspondence cross-modal reciprocal-similarity measurement can reduce the inter-modal quantization code errors; 3) The robust low-rank constraint of the dot product is introduced to perform the cross-modal sparse latent-similarity calculation. It can establish the connection between the common latent semantic space and the hash codes. Besides, we also propose an Interactive Projection Matrix Learning (IPML) extensible mechanism that makes it easier to be applied to large-scale retrieval datasets. Extensive experiment results show the superior performance of EMCHL compared to state-of-the-art cross-modal hash methods. Our method code is released at: https://github.com/Tjeep-Tan/EMCHL .},

  abstract     = {Multiview learning (MVL) has attracted considerable attention since an object can be observed from various views. To use the consistency of multiple views, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used as a basic technique for analyzing correlated subspaces. However, CCA-based methods are designed to extract the correlation information between each pair of views. In addition, these methods ignore view-specific geometric structures , which may provide effective complementary information. To address the limitations of CCA-based methods and improve the performance of multiview subspace learning methods, a novel MVL framework called generalized multiview regression (GMR) is proposed. It aims at finding a common subspace to preserve the complementary information of each view and maintain consistency among all the views. Specifically, to preserve the view-specific structures, GMR first considers data reconstruction and local geometrical structures. Subsequently, by introducing an orthogonal dictionary, GMR captures the discriminative consistency suitable for classification tasks . Finally, it uses L 2 , 1 L2,1 as the basic norm to measure errors and regularization , which facilitates robustness and sparsity for feature extraction and selection. An iterative algorithm is designed to solve the proposed GMR. In addition, the convergence and complexity are analyzed theoretically. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted to compare the GMR with state-of-the-art or some available multiview methods. The competitive performance implies that GMR is an effective multiview method for learning sparse projections and extracting discriminative and robust features.},

  abstract     = {To explore a better method to solve the economic emission dispatch (EED) problem and enhance the optimization performance of the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), we propose a novel, efficient update of the sine cosine algorithm (ECDSCA) with three improvement strategies. First, in the phase of particle position updates, an enhanced elite leadership strategy is introduced to effectively adjust the global search and local exploitation capabilities of SCA. Second, a strategy combining crossover and optimal selections is designed to prevent the algorithm from falling into local extremes. Third, a dimension-by-dimension variation strategy is adopted to enrich the population diversity and improve SCA’s optimization accuracy. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that ECDSCA has the same time complexity as SCA. The probability measure method is utilized to prove that ECDSCA is a global convergence algorithm. To evaluate the optimization ability of ECDSCA, it is compared with six representative algorithms on the IEEE CEC2017 test suite. The test results reveal that the optimization ability, convergence rate, and robustness of ECDSCA are improved significantly. Finally, ECDSCA is used to solve the EED problem. The test is carried out on two cases and compared with several algorithms. The comparison results show that ECDSCA significantly outperforms the other comparison algorithms.},

However, as the number of tasks increases, selecting similar tasks and transferring useful knowledge become increasingly difficult tasks, further leading to negative transfers and affecting the algorithm performance. In this study, we propose a knowledge-reuse-based multitask evolutionary algorithm (KR-MTEA), that includes two strategies: knowledge-reuse-based knowledge transfer and adaptive strategies. The knowledge-reuse-based knowledge transfer strategy transforms knowledge to be transferred while considering the convergence interval of the decision variables and makes it more suitable for the current task. For the adaptive strategy, the concept of advantage is proposed to adapt to similar tasks and transfer probabilities . In addition, the proposed knowledge transfer strategy is applied to the self-evolution within the task to improve the performance of the KR-MTEA. On four benchmark test suites with 2, 10, 50, and 50 tasks, the KR-MTEA demonstrated its competitiveness in solving multitask and many-task optimisation problems compared with other advanced multitask and many-task algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the real-time dynamic clustering analysis of power load data based on the dynamic conditional score (DCS) model, and an autocorrelation increment fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm based on the DCS model is proposed. (1) The paper addresses the problem that current power load clustering methods, when performing time series data mining, tend to focus on capturing the mean structure while ignoring the variance characteristics of the data, making it difficult to effectively capture the structural information of time series data. The DCS model is used as the statistical model basis for clustering analysis, and the time series is clustered based on the estimated conditional moment characteristics of the model, dynamically capturing data features such as the mean, variance, and sequence correlation of time series data, effectively improving the clustering performance. (2) This paper also addresses the issue that current power load clustering methods tend to focus on static datasets of user power loads and cannot effectively handle the data stream clustering problem with time series characteristics in practical applications. The DCS model parameter dataset and the autocorrelation increment fuzzy clustering algorithm are used to conduct a dynamic data flow analysis of user electricity behaviour evolution and pattern continuous updating research for power loads. The clustering results are dynamically updated based on the user&#39;s power load data stream using the proposed algorithm, achieving research on a universal clustering model and secure and efficient algorithms in a big data environment. (3) The paper verifies the clustering performance of the proposed method using power load time series data provided by a Chinese power supply company as a case dataset. The clustering evaluation index shows that the proposed algorithm has high clustering accuracy and good clustering performance. Additionally, different power supply recommendations are proposed for different customer electricity types in the obtained clustering results to provide more personalized power services.},

  abstract     = {In light of the growing concerns regarding the unauthorized use of facial recognition systems and its implications on individual privacy, the exploration of adversarial perturbations as a potential countermeasure has gained traction. However, challenges arise in effectively deploying this approach against unauthorized facial recognition systems due to the effects of JPEG compression on image distribution across the internet, which ultimately diminishes the efficacy of adversarial perturbations. Existing JPEG compression-resistant techniques struggle to strike a balance between resistance, transferability, and attack potency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel solution referred to as low frequency adversarial perturbation (LFAP). This method conditions the source model to leverage low-frequency characteristics through adversarial training . To further enhance the performance, we introduce an improved low-mid frequency adversarial perturbation (LMFAP) that incorporates mid-frequency components for an additive benefit. Our study encompasses a range of settings to replicate genuine application scenarios, including cross backbones, supervisory heads, training datasets, and testing datasets . Moreover, we evaluated our approaches on a commercial black-box API, Face++ . The empirical results validate the cutting-edge performance achieved by our proposed solutions.},

According to the T-invariants of the timeless counterpart of a time Petri net, a necessary condition is established for the solvability of the liveness enforcement problem. Then, a critical state class graph is designed with the nodes containing critical constraints of the controllable transitions. The existing parametric models to enforce liveness of a time Petri net with controllable and uncontrollable transitions are in general subject to the state explosion issue. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the concept of the first weakly live nodes and transitional nodes to avoid the enumeration of all constraints on unnecessary weakly live nodes. We develop an algorithm to transform a non-live time Petri net into live by controlling the time intervals of controllable transitions. Two production examples are used to illustrate the approach. This approach is efficient since it avoids the extensive enumeration with regard to the constraints on each node in a critical state class graph.},

  abstract     = {DOS ( D elta O pen S et) is an interesting clustering algorithm that transforms cluster identification into set identification. It identifies the objects whose neighborhoods coincide as an open-set, and an open-set corresponds to a cluster. However, once the dataset is complex, DOS tends to identify overlapping clusters as one category. We believe the main reason is that DOS unifies the neighborhood radius by a specific function, resulting in the inability to cope with various object distributions. To improve DOS, we propose DOS-IN ( I rregular N eighborhoods). Specifically, DOS-IN generates irregular neighborhoods based on the similarity between objects to self-adapt to diverse object distributions. As a result, DOS-IN not only can accurately distinguish overlapping clusters but also has fewer input parameters. In addition, DOS-IN introduces the small-cluster merging mechanism to address the shortcoming of DOS in recognizing Gaussian clusters. The experimental results show that DOS-IN is completely superior to DOS. Compared with baseline methods , DOS-IN outperforms them on 7 out of 10 datasets, with at least 13.8\% (NMI) and 2.4\% (RI) improvement in accuracy.

The former approach uses graphs to represent the dependencies among variables and apply graph neural networks to the forecasting problem. The latter approach decomposes the matrix of multivariate time series into global components and local components to capture the shared information across variables. However, both approaches cannot capture the propagation delay of the dependencies among individual variables of a multivariate time series, for example, the congestion at intersection A has delayed effects on the neighboring intersection B. In addition, graph-based forecasting methods cannot capture the shared global tendency across the variables of a multivariate time series; and global-local forecasting methods cannot reflect the nonlinear inter-dependencies among variables of a multivariate time series. In this paper, we propose to combine the advantages of both approaches by integrating A daptive G lobal- L ocal G raph Structure Learning with G ated R ecurrent U nits (AGLG-GRU). We learn a global graph to represent the shared information across variables. And we learn dynamic local graphs to capture the local randomness and nonlinear dependencies among variables. We apply diffusion convolution and graph convolution operations to global and dynamic local graphs to integrate the information of graphs and update gated recurrent unit for multivariate time series forecasting.

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction is an important part of smart city management. Accurate traffic prediction can be deployed in urban applications such as congestion alerting and route planning, thus providing sustainable services to the public or relevant departments. Although some improvements have been made in existing traffic prediction methods, there are challenges due to the following: (1) Time series has multi-scale nature, that is, from different scale time ranges, traffic flow changes show different trends; (2) Spatial heterogeneity, meaning that traffic conditions in similar functional areas are usually similar. This task remains difficult. To address the above challenges, we propose a new spatial-temporal prediction method, namely Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Aware Transformer (MSSTAT), which is a Transformer architecture with multi-scale characteristics. Specifically, compared to the input of encoder, the input of different decoder layers has different scale information, MSSTAT synchronizes model the connection between time steps and scale information by a kind of Parallel Cross Multi-Head Attention, which gives each time step several times the perceived field while also being able to weaken the impact brought by anomaly point. In addition, to add connections between regions with similar functions, we map the traffic data of each node as a probability distribution and then measure the similarity between the nodes by the Wasserstein Distance, which leads to our proposed spatial-temporal aware adjacency matrix . Experimental results on four traffic flow datasets show that MSSTAT outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is an effective way to improve the model learning performance while being a challenging problem in the Partial Multi-label Learning (PML). Different from multi-label learning, PML is closer to reality, which means the annotators may assign irrelevant labels at least one in the set of candidate labels for each instance. However, previous PML researches only design the model on label disambiguation but ignore to consider the problem as point of finding discriminative features in the noisy scenario. In this paper, a novel feature selection method named PML-FSSO is proposed which utilizes the theory of linear weighted to jointly consider the label subspace and feature subspace. The influence of noisy labels is eliminated by decomposing the label matrix into the low-dimensional space, and we call the low-dimensional space as the label subspace. Then, the feature matrix is not only designed to be the denoising matrix as the feature subspace, but also to steer the direction for label disambiguation. Finally, the coherent subspace is constructed through the shared coefficient weight matrix which is used in the linear weighted method. Extensive experiments clearly validate the effectiveness of PML-FSSO in improving the state-of-the-art feature selection methods in the field of partial multi-label learning.},

Most of these methods manually assign parameters to adjust the restrictive relationships between these dependencies including strong and weak links. However, manual parameter tuning is challenging to accurately determine the influence degree of each parameter to harm performance, because the parameter tuning process involves the interdependence between the multiple hierarchical structures. Along these lines, we propose feature selection based on structural manifold learning with multi-granularity knowledge coordination to balance local structure relationships automatically. First, an affinity matrix based on multi-granularity knowledge is defined as a manifold coordination analysis, which learns all dependencies without destroying the original class space. This analysis effectively trade-offs these dependencies to adjust inter-class alienation and intra-classes inseparable. Afterward, feature correlation and sparsity are leveraged to select features with the most distinguishable and informative features as differentiation analysis. These two analyses jointly selected the feature subsets that are ask-related and informative in the original knowledge structure. Additionally, the proposed method has good universality, which can handle hierarchical classification tasks of the different structure types. Different hierarchical classification results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method.},

  abstract     = {In Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, interconnected gadgets and sensors produce large-scale, dynamic, and private data by the arrival of the fourth industrial revolution. Such data must be stored by cloud service providers (CSP) and is capable of accessed by consumers. To guarantee data privacy, Public-key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) is a cryptographic primitive designed to resolve this challenge, which is troubled by costly certificate management and key escrow problem. The majority of current PEKS schemes rely on expensive bilinear paring and single-receiver, which are highly vulnerable to keyword guessing attacks (KGA) and have low computational efficiency. Consequently, we propose an Multi-recipient Certificateless Authenticated Encryption with Keyword Search (MCLAEKS) scheme, which has the following advantages: 1) hiding search pattern; 2) data allows multiple consumers; 3) involving no costly bilinear pairing operations; 4) resisting Inside Keyword Guessing Attacks (IKGA). The comparison and analysis of performance indicate that the proposed scheme is more efficient than existing PEKS schemes and is suitable for the IIoT environment.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a technical problem, that is, how to apply the backstepping to obtain an event-triggered controller for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems . If the controller is set to be triggered, then all virtual controls are also forcibly triggered synchronously since this controller incorporates all virtual controls. That indicates the virtual controls applied to the control operation are event-triggered and discontinuous. As a result, the control design and performance analysis may become more complicated for such event-triggered systems. Therefore, this paper presents a prescribed-time fuzzy adaptive event-triggered control strategy for MIMO nonlinear systems . A new event-triggered mechanism is constructed for updating the actual controller and all virtual controls, and the nonlinear impulsive dynamics approach is employed for tackling the difficulties arising from the discontinuity of the virtual controls. Moreover, the Lyapunov stability analysis approach for nonlinear impulsive system is utilized to determine the performance of the controlled system. The good tracking performance is accomplished by selecting the proper design parameters. Ultimately, the feasibility and validity of the developed control strategy is supported by simulation.},

  abstract     = {Currently, graph learning models are indispensable tools to help researchers explore graph-structured data. In academia, using sufficient training data to optimize a graph model on a single device is a typical approach for training a capable graph learning model. Due to privacy concerns, however, it is infeasible to do so in real-world scenarios. Federated learning provides a practical means of addressing this limitation by introducing various privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as differential privacy (DP) on the graph edges. However, although DP in federated graph learning can ensure the security of sensitive information represented in graphs, it usually causes the performance of graph learning models to degrade. In this paper, we investigate how DP can be implemented on graph edges and observe a performance decrease in our experiments. In addition, we note that DP on graph edges introduces noise that perturbs graph proximity, which is one of the graph augmentations in graph contrastive learning . Inspired by this, we propose leveraging graph contrastive learning to alleviate the performance drop resulting from DP. Extensive experiments conducted with four representative graph models on five widely used benchmark datasets show that contrastive learning indeed alleviates the models&#39; DP-induced performance drops.},

  abstract     = {Multi-metric learning -a method to learn multiple local metrics to reveal the feature&#39;s correlations of samples from different local regions-has become an essential tool to measure the similarities between instances from heterogeneous datasets. However, most existing cluster-based MML methods first partition the training data with a predefined metric and then learn multiple metrics via the local instances, leading to these two independent procedures fail to cooperate with each other. In this paper, we propose an Optimal instance Partition-based Multi-Metric Learning (OPM 2 L) method for heterogeneous dataset classification by unifying the instance partition and multiple local metrics learning into a single objective. In particular, multiple anchor centers together with a global metric are employed to assist the instance partition process. During the training, the shared information contained in local metrics is aggregated into the global metric by a dedicated regularizer, which improves the instance partition process and offers the subsequent multiple local metrics learning with more informative instances. Moreover, an efficient alternating direction technology is employed to seek a feasible solution to the proposed method. We further confirmed that the sub-problems can be settled with closed-form solutions, while the superiority of the proposed method is also proved by experimental results on extensive datasets.},

Their purpose is to learn known facts to infer the missing entities in triples. Traditional embedding-based methods usually only focus on the information of individual triples and do not use the deep logical relationships of the KG. In this study, we propose a new KGC method referred to as QIQE-KGC. It uses quantum embedding and quaternion space interaction to capture the external logical relationship between triples in a KG and enhance the connection between entities and relations within a single triple to model and represent the KG. The proposed QIQE-KGC model can capture richer logical information and has more powerful and complex relationship modeling capabilities. Extensive experimental results using QIQE-KGC on 11 datasets demonstrate that the model achieves outstanding performance. Compared to the baseline models , QIQE-KGC produced the best results on most datasets.},

In this study, we presented a holistic overview of existing constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) to address three research questions: (1) Why do we introduce helper problems? (2) Which problems should be selected as helper problems? and (3) How do helper problems help? Based on these discussions, we developed a novel helper-problem-assisted CMOEA, where the original CMOP was solved by addressing a series of constraint-centric problems derived from the original problem, with their constraint boundaries shrinking gradually. At each stage, we also had an objective-centric problem that was used to help solve the constraint-centric problem. In the experiments, we investigated the performance of the proposed algorithm on 66 benchmark problems and 15 real-world applications. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive compared with eight state-of-the-art CMOEAs.},

Certain convergence properties are established for the subsequence are generated by the IAPSVRG algorithm using the supermartingale convergence theorem . Building on the powerful Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) property, it is shown that each bounded sequence generated by the IAPSVRG algorithm converges globally to a critical point of the objective function if an appropriate threshold of the inertial coefficient is provided. A regularized nonlinear least squares is used to check the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of classification, convergence, and sensitivity to the choice of the momentum parameter. The experimental results show that the testing accuracy of the proposed algorithm on each of the four selected datasets exceeds at least half that of the other four compared algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is less sensitive to the choice of the momentum parameter within a certain threshold compared to the four compared algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Texture recognition is one of the most important tasks in computer vision , with numerous applications in several areas. Despite the recent success of end-to-end deep learning models in image recognition in general, when it comes to texture images, the classical approach based on the combination of a local predefined descriptor with a pooling encoder is still competitive and may be advantageous, especially when we do not have access to a large amount of data for training or when understanding what each step in the algorithm pipeline performs is an important matter. In this context, here we propose a method for texture recognition based on a hybrid approach that combines a randomized neural network with multifractal transform for a local complete and robust representation. The first stage of the method employs a randomized neural network similar to that used in extreme learning machines . We use pixel intensities within each particular neighborhood as inputs and pixels strategically placed around the neighborhood center as our (multiple) targets. The learnable weights (connecting hidden and output layers) are computed over the entire image. In the second stage, we compute a multifractal measure over each pixel and repeat the procedure with the randomized model. Finally, we combine the learnable weights of both representations to compose our final descriptors. The effectiveness of our approach is verified on texture classification , over benchmark databases, and on a practical task of plant species identification. In both cases, our method achieves promising results, being competitive with several approaches in the state-of-the-art of the area.},

  abstract     = {Least squares regression (LSR) has demonstrated promising performance in various classification tasks owing to its effectiveness and efficiency. However, there are some deficiencies that seriously hinder its application in imbalanced data scenarios. The first is that LSR strongly relies on a balanced class distribution. A severely imbalanced class distribution may seriously damage the effectiveness of the algorithm. Second, the utilized binary label matrix in the conventional LSR model may be too strict to learn a discriminative transformation matrix for imbalanced learning. To address the above issues, in this paper, an adaptive weight learning mechanism and label relaxation constraint are proposed and incorporated into the framework of LSR to tackle the imbalanced classification problem. The weight of each sample can be adaptively obtained according to the original distribution information of the imbalanced data , in which the importance of minority class samples can be better reflected with larger weights. A new label relaxation matrix consisting of the original label matrix and auxiliary matrix is constructed to widen the margins between different classes. Further, we provide an iterative algorithm with fast convergence to solve the resulting optimization problem . Extensive experimental results on diverse binary-class and multi-class imbalanced datasets show that the proposed method outperforms many other state-of-the-art imbalanced learning approaches.},

The coarse-grained granule is described as an aggregation (mean pooling) of deep embeddings of an object from a few frames extracted with a low frame rate. A descriptor for a fine-grained granule is computed using the embeddings of most frames. The classifiers are learned for every granularity level. At the classification phase , the coarse-grained descriptor of the input sequence is fed into the first classifier, and the classes with high confidence scores fill a positive set from three-way decisions. The decision-making procedure is terminated at a granularity level for which the only one category is included in its positive set or the last fine-grained granule is reached. It is experimentally shown for the video-based facial expression recognition problem that our technique is up to 30 times faster than traditional processing of all frames without significant accuracy degradation.},

  abstract     = {Three-way group decision-making is an important direction of study in the fields of three-way decision-making and granular computing and has received much attention from scholars in recent years. According to previous studies, three-way group-decision usually involves two pivotal processes: consensus reaching of collective loss functions in a group and the determination of both thresholds. To address both issues, this paper approaches from a novel perspective of weight updating rather than by opinion adjustments as in previous studies, and we propose a weight-updating-based three-way group decision method in linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy opinions. First, a linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy set (LIFS) is utilized to evaluate loss functions among experts due to its advantages in uncertain evaluations, and we define a θ -similarity measure between LIFSs by combining similarity and divergence information. Moreover, some properties of this measure are verified and an approach to calculate the initial weights of experts is explored based on the measure. Second, we use the measure to define a group consensus index, construct an optimal aggregation model and design a weight-updating-based algorithm for achieving consensus of collective loss functions, and prove a convergence of the algorithm. Third, via consensus loss functions, we establish a single optimization model to determine both thresholds of each object and develop a weight-updating-based consensus reaching method for three-way group decision with linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy opinions. Finally, an illustrative example and comparative experiments are conducted to show the validity of our method.},

  abstract     = {Traceable ring signatures (TRSs) were proposed by Fujisaki and Suzuki (PKC 2007), which is a variant of ring signatures that aims to restrict excessive anonymity of them. If the signer signs two identical messages about the same group of ring members and issue , the two signatures will be detected, but the identity of the signer will not be disclosed; if the signer signs two different messages about the same group of ring members and issue , it allows to reveal the identity of the signer. This primitive is very useful in scenarios that require anonymous protection and avoid duplicate signatures, such as electronic voting, blockchain and Internet of Things. However, the existing post-quantum TRS schemes all have a long signature and low computational efficiency, which is far from practical application. In this paper, we propose an efficient lattice-based TRS scheme by improving DualRing that is a short ring signature scheme proposed by Yuen et al. (CRYPTO 2021). Among all existing post-quantum TRS schemes, the proposed scheme has the shortest signature for a ring size between 5 and 2000, and it is also the fastest one in signature generation, taking only about 0.4 s for a ring size of 1024. In the random oracle model, the proposed scheme is proved to satisfy anonymity, tag-linkability and exculpability under the Module Short Integer Solution and Module Learning With Errors hardness assumptions over lattice . In addition, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme, we develop a post-quantum blockchain model with access control based on it, which can be extended to Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), e-commerce, education, banking and other systems.},

  abstract     = {Competitive and collaborative strategies and topologies are among the most essential concepts and greatly influence the optimization ability of population-based optimization algorithms. To update individuals&#39; information, this article proposes a multilevel hierarchical artificial electric field algorithm with competitive and collaborative strategies (PAEFA). The proposed algorithm constructs a multilevel structure and places them in specific layers. The whole population is divided into two groups of winners and losers by pairwise comparison of their fitness in the same layer. Losers collaborate with their respective winners, whereas winners collaborate with individuals who are on the upper layers. In the proposed algorithm, each individual has their own learning mechanism, which can learn from more than one exemplar, rather than only from the global best. With the knowledge of this structure, the diversity of the population increases, which strengthens the performance of the scheme. To verify the adaptability of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments are performed on the CEC 2017 test suite at 30, 50, and 100 dimensions. We have studied the diversity factor of PAEFA using all three dimensions. These experiments suggest that PAEFA outperforms over thirty state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy, statistical results, and convergence speed while achieving comparable computational time in most cases and showing the validity of results. The PAEFA algorithm achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms on 87.60\% and 80.05\% of problems in terms of accuracy and statistical significance across all three dimensions, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has become a promising technique to deal with tough wargaming decision-making problems. However, DRL suffers an inherent problem of low learning efficiency and it often requires massive cost of training steps, which may be alleviated with expert demonstrations in wargaming domains. Most learning methods with demonstrations generally treat the demonstration data from different expert demonstrators without distinction. Besides, a more appropriate and effective mechanism is highly needed to control sampling balance of expert-generated demonstration samples and agent-generated interaction ones. To tackle the two issues, this work proposes an improved approach to leverage expert demonstrations to further accelerate DRL. It innovatively extracts inherent diversity in multiple demonstrators by pre-training agents individually from multiple demonstration sources, thereby producing a strong and initial ensemble model. In addition, a novel technique to evaluate the learning importance of each demonstrator is designed to dynamically tune sampling ratios of learning data in a more adaptive and effective manner. Through the evaluation on several classic game tasks and a typical wargaming scenario, our method shows superior performance over several state-of-the-art methods and significantly raises DRL’s efficiency for typical wargaming decision-making applications.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective optimization problems with interval parameter (IMOPs) are among the most critical optimization problems in practical applications. However, in contrast to deterministic multi-objective optimization, few studies have addressed IMOPs. Moreover, the uncertainty in such problems makes the convergence and diversity of the algorithm more challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes an interval multi-objective optimization algorithm based on elite genetic strategy (EG-IMOEA). First, existing interval dominance relations cannot comprehensively determine which of the two intervals is better when their midpoints are equal but their upper and lower limits are unequal. Therefore, a conditional-based interval confidence dominance relation is proposed that considers both the average level of convergence and value of the minimum lower limit of intervals. The interval crowding distance (ICD) applied to multiple objectives is then defined to evaluate the solutions more completely. Furthermore, an elite genetic strategy for crossover and mutation is proposed to generate better offspring. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on nine benchmark test problems and compared with the typical algorithm as well as state-of-the-art algorithms. The results showed that this algorithm outperformed the comparison algorithms in terms of convergence, diversity, imprecision , and uniform distribution.},

  abstract     = {Predicting information diffusion cascade is an essential task in social networks. We mainly focus on predicting the size of the information cascade. The relationships inside a cascade are diverse, including global and relative spatio-temporal relationships, as well as interpersonal influence relationships. These complex relationships between nodes play a crucial role in cascade prediction, but they have not been thoroughly investigated. The Transformer&#39;s global receptive field can assist in capturing the relationships between two arbitrary nodes. However, using Transformer directly for a cascade is insufficient without considering its temporal and structural characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel cascade Transformer for the first time, called CasTformer, specifically designed for cascade size prediction. CasTformer utilizes a global spatio-temporal positional encoding and relative relationship bias matrices on the self-attention mechanism to capture diverse cascade relationships. Moreover, self-knowledge distillation is employed for obtaining a better cascade representation to enhance prediction performance. We use four datasets with nearly millions of cascade samples to validate our model and it achieves training in 3 hours. Experimental results show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 11.9\%, 6.1\%, and 9.6\% on MSLE , MAPE, and R 2 R2 , respectively.},

In recent decades, academics and industry have spent considerable time and energy discussing security and privacy. Other systems, known as intrusion detection systems , are required to breach firewalls, antivirus software, and other security equipment to provide complete system security in smart operation systems. There are three aspects to an intrusion detection system: the intrusion detection method, the architecture, and the intrusion response method. In this study, we combined linear correlation feature selection methods and cross-information. The database used in this article is KDD99. This paper examines applying two feature selection methods in predicting attacks in intrusion detection systems based on INTERACT and A multilayer perceptron (MLP). Since the number of records associated with each attack type differs, one of our suggestions is to continue using data balancing techniques. As a result, the number of records associated with each type of network status becomes closer together. The results in the categories can also be improved using information synthesis methods, such as majority voting.},

Binary quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (BQPSO) algorithm is a simple yet efficient discrete optimization approach since it guarantees global search. However, BQPSO suffers from local optimum and slow convergence problems due to aggregation among particles, limiting its performance. To address this problem, an improved BQPSO (IBQPSO) algorithm is proposed to effectively solve the 0-1 knapsack problem . First, to address the discretization issues in existing QPSO algorithms, a mapping strategy based on the average position of all particles is introduced. Then, the transfer function is used to discretize the local attractors into binary vectors for crossover operations, which can guide individuals in the discrete space to the optimum. In addition, a new repair method is employed to address infeasible solutions, and a diversity maintenance mechanism is developed in IBQPSO to alleviate the local optima problem. The proposed algorithm is compared with ten state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms on a set of 0-1 knapsack problems with different scales. Experimental results show that IBQPSO has obvious superiority over the other ten algorithms in terms of convergence speed and search performance.},

Then, we propose a new state compensation model to characterize hybrid attacks and communication delays. Based on this model, a novel event-based distributed fusion estimator (EDFE) is derived in the minimum mean square error (MMSE) sense. The EDFE can be used to address multiple types of attacks rather than a specific attack. A stability condition of the EDFE is obtained such that the MMSE of the EDFE is bounded. Further, we reveal the relationship between the number of fusion nodes and the performance of fusion estimation based on the fusion criterion of the EDFE.

Second, most existing multi-label feature selection (MLFS) algorithms do not consider the characteristics of the labels themselves, i.e., label-specific features. To solve the above problems, an MLFS method based on stable label relevance and label-specific features are proposed in this study, which combines global and local label relevance to learn the label-specific features. A stable global label relevance strategy is designed for the self-representation model to avoid the effect of noise and outliers, and a manifold regularization term is adopted to explore the local label relevance. Moreover, ℓ 1 ℓ1 -norm is applied to the feature weight matrix and self-representation matrix to select the label-specific features. Then, a solution for optimizing the objective function is designed. Compared with eight related algorithms on sixteen public datasets.

To address this problem, we consider comprehensively the relationships between all features and class, develop a method of recognizing all the ordered features accurately. Firstly a sample grouping method by constructing the virtual feature is designed, and it can help to focus on the features that are difficult to distinguish. Then we design a metric named ranking separability to measure the distance in the order of superiority and inferiority between classes from the perspective of features. And finally the ordered features are identified by judging whether the elements of ranking separability matrix constitute an ordinal arrangement. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed method is effective in recognizing all the ordered features accurately and can improve the classification performance of classifier on mixed data with coexistence of ordered and unordered features.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the combination of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and manifold learning has been widely confirmed. Although these methods are successful, there are some shortcomings: 1) The traditional manifold learning methods require predefined manifold geometry, which cannot reasonably reflect intrinsic geometric properties; 2) Most previous methods only consider the robustness of models to noise and outliers, but not occlusion; 3) Many models only contain the local neighborhood structure, but not the global geometric structure . To address these issues, we propose a novel model robust latent nonnegative matrix factorization with sparse reconstruction (RLNMF-SR) to conduct complex classification tasks . Our method utilizes sparse nodes to automatically reconstruct a global-based affinity graph without manually defining the graph structure, which guarantees that our model more accurately grasps the underlying distribution of the data. In addition, by decomposing the principal component with a low-rank structure, we can not only remove redundant features and reduce the computational cost but also obtain a more compact, discriminative and interpretable low-rank representation. At the same time, low-rank restriction can also recover the row and column information of the matrix to decrease the negative effects of noise and occlusion. On the other hand, applying the L2,1-norm to perform part-based nonnegative factorization can also attain the local attribute information of the data and suppress the model&#39;s sensitivity to destruction, greatly enhancing the robustness of the RLNMF-SR. Extensive experiments indicate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially on low-quality image datasets.},

In this paper, we present a relaxed version of the problem in Euclidean space , called the ρ -approximate SL problem. We propose a grid-based algorithm, called ρ -SL, to solve this problem in O ( n + ν ) O(n+ν) expected time, where ν is an integer associated with the maximum and minimum coordinates of each dimension. ρ -SL first partitions the dataset into non-empty grids and constructs a grid tree to organize them for efficient non-empty neighboring grid queries. Then, an initial cluster structure is established to keep track of all pairs of grids that may be mergeable. ρ -SL proceeds to identify the pairs of grids that are mergeable by a fast merging algorithm which takes into account the spatial relationships among points to reduce unnecessary distance calculations. Experiments were conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of ρ -SL. The results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than SL and its fastest variants.},

  abstract     = {Process data collected from real-world industrial operating environments have different distributions and lack real-time labeled samples, which causes the performance of process monitoring to decline. In this paper, a multiple structured latent double dictionary pair learning (MSLdDPL) method for cross-domain industrial process monitoring is proposed to address the issue of inconsistent distribution between acquired offline training set and online testing data. And it monitors the target domain with insufficient label information of data by learning the rich data knowledge in the source domain. The latent projective double reconstruction strategy is designed to integrate transfer learning and latent space mining into a unified framework, maximally bridging the distribution divergence between both different domains. In MSLdDPL, a multiple structured regularization is proposed to ensure the discrimination of coding coefficients and significant features. Meanwhile, an adaptive locality-preserved function is developed to jointly obtain the block-diagonal locality weights, so as to enhance the locality of coding coefficients and significant features in latent space. Then, the robust dictionary pair and a projection matrix are obtained for monitoring, further identifying abnormal sources with a reconstruction-based anomaly isolation technology. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed method performs better in the property and application of cross-domain process monitoring.},

However, so far, a thorough study on the use of dynamic populations in Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP) is missing. Still, GSGP is a resource-greedy algorithm, and the use of dynamic populations seems appropriate. This paper adapts algorithms to GSGP to manage dynamic populations that were successful for other types of EAs and introduces two novel algorithms. The novel algorithms exploit the concept of semantic neighbourhood. These methods are assessed and compared through a set of eight regression problems . The results indicate that the algorithms outperform standard GSGP, confirming the suitability of dynamic populations for GSGP. Interestingly, the novel algorithms that use semantic neighbourhood to manage variation in population size are particularly effective in generating robust models even for the most difficult of the studied test problems.},

  abstract     = {Modeling the dynamics of sequential patterns ( i.e. , sequential recommendation) has obtained great attention, where the key problem is how to infer the next interesting item according to users&#39; historical actions. Owing to high efficiency and accuracy, several Transformer-like frameworks have successfully achieved this task without adopting complicated recurrent or convolutional operations. Nevertheless, they focus only on the user-item bipartite graph and forgo other auxiliary information, which is non-trivial to attain satisfactory performance especially under long-tail distribution scenarios. In modeling short-term user interests, they fail to capture the time intervals between the recent actions and the target timestamp, which may result in the suboptimal performance. To settle such two problems, we propose a novel architecture for the task of sequential recommendation, namely graph-coupled time interval network (GCTN). Specifically, by means of item category information, we devise a category-aware graph propagation module to better learn user and item embeddings. Furthermore, we design a time-aware self-attention mechanism, which explicitly captures the effect of the time interval between two actions for next item prediction. To integrate these two parts into an organic whole, we introduce a personalized gating strategy to differentiate the importance of each part under the special context. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GCTN over recent state-of-the-art methods on four real-world datasets, seamlessly combining the advantages of graph neural networks and Transformers.},

In many real missions the tasks have associated deadlines. However, the literature only contains a few swarm methodologies, and thus response-threshold methods, tackling tasks with deadlines. Motivated by this fact, in this paper, we propose a new task allocation strategy inspired by response-threshold methods which deals with tasks with time deadlines, models stimuli using fuzzy sets and, in addition, in which each robot makes the decision about the best task to perform through the celebrated Bellman-Zadeh fuzzy optimization technique. An extensive number of simulations have been carried out in order to evaluate the quantitative performance of the swarm system based on the new approach. The results confirm that the proposed mathematical approach is able to model the evolution of the system when tasks with deadlines are under consideration. We have also observed competitive performance on a fleet of real robots, which corroborates the results derived from the simulations.},

In this work, we propose an analytic solution for bridge regression based on solving a penalized error formulation using an approximated ℓ p ℓp -norm. The solution is presented in primal form for over-determined systems and in dual form for under-determined systems. The primal form is suitable for low-dimensional problems with a large number of data samples, while the dual form is suitable for high-dimensional problems with a small number of data samples. We also extend the solution to problems with multiple classification outputs. Numerical studies using simulated and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution.},

Using a mean value estimator, the agent can calculate its allocation status only by its neighbor&#39;s information. Since an agent can only track one target, an extended tracking error is introduced, where if the agent wins one of the competitions, it will track the assigned target, and if the agent wins both competitions, by selecting one of the targets, track the selected target. Also, the agent which is not win any competitions, return to a specified point. Then, using neural networks and adaptive techniques, an adaptive fixed-time controller is introduced for the agents to track the target based on the allocation status or to return to the specified point.

  abstract     = {The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks has attracted attention in many fields, and researchers have sought methods to improve the robustness of DNNs. Most existing methods are empirical defenses that can only cope with known attack environments and specific attack conditions and are likely to be broken by more powerful attacks. In contrast, certified defense methods provide theoretical proof of robustness bounds and provide worst-case adversarial robustness that can guarantee reliable robustness for the target model. To ensure the security of DNNs against adversarial attacks , it is crucial to develop certified defense methods. However, the currently available study has paid little attention to certified defenses, and the currently certified defense commonly relies on unrealistic prior knowledge and assumptions, which is limited in practice. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic and attack-agnostic certified defense method that implements denoising and refactoring of input samples through the Makser and the Purifier. The Makser is rule-based and the Purifier is trained by self-supervised fine-tuning on the improved BERT-MLM, and the whole implementation is independent of any target models or attack methods. We have theoretically demonstrated that the condition for method satisfying certified robustness and obtained its robustness boundary through simulation experiments. Meanwhile, experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our proposed method has superior performance in balancing the prediction accuracy on clean examples and the robustness against adversarial attacks compared with six state-of-the-art defense methods.},

  abstract     = {Wind turbines play a crucial role in renewable energy generation systems and are frequently exposed to challenging operational environments . Monitoring and diagnosing potential faults during their operation is essential for improving reliability and reducing maintenance costs. Supervised learning using data-driven techniques, particularly deep learning , offers a viable approach for developing fault diagnosis models. However, a significant challenge in practical wind power equipment lies in the scarcity of annotated samples required to train these models effectively. This paper proposes a semi-supervised fault diagnosis approach specifically designed for wind turbines, aiming to address this challenge. Initially, a semi-supervised deep neural network is constructed using adversarial learning, where a limited set of annotated samples is used in conjunction with a vast amount of unannotated samples. The health status features present in the unannotated samples are leveraged to capture a generalized representation of the underlying features. Subsequently, a metric learning-guided discriminative features enhancement technique is employed to improve the separability of different manifolds, thereby enhancing the performance of the semi-supervised training process. By employing this methodology, it becomes possible to develop a fault diagnosis model with superior accuracy using only a limited amount of annotated samples. Comprehensive fault diagnosis experiments were conducted on a wind turbine fault dataset, revealing the efficacy and superiority of the presented methodology.},

To unify the heterogeneous preference relations, the transformation of multiplicative preference relations (MPRs), fuzzy preference relations (FPRs), intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs), and linguistic preference relations (LPRs) into distributed preference relations (DPRs) is analyzed. As consistency among DPRs is constructed under the assumption that decision-makers are bounded rationality, the abstract transformation of MPR, FPR, IFPR, and LPR into DPR is defined, and its reality depends on the preferences of decision-makers. Two important properties of abstract transformation, namely, internal consistency and restricted max-max transitivity , were theoretically verified. The reliabilities of decision-makers are involved in MCGDM by estimating the reliability of each criterion to improve solution quality. Based on the four types of abstract transformations, a process for analyzing MCGDM problems with heterogeneous preference relations and decision-makers’ reliabilities is developed. The proposed method is used to analyze a new business selection problem for an enterprise located in Changzhou, Jiangsu, China to demonstrate its applicability and validity.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, sensors and signal catchers in various fields are capturing time-series data all the time, and time-series data are exploding. Due to the large storage space requirements and redundancy, many compression techniques for time series have been proposed. However, the existing compression algorithms still face the challenge of the contradiction between random access and compression ratio. That is, in a time series database, large-scale time series data have high requirements on compression ratio, while large pieces of data need to be decompressed during the access process, resulting in poor query efficiency. In this paper, a proper solution is proposed to resolve such a contradiction. We propose a data compression method based on reinforcement learning , and use the idea of data deduplication to design the data compression method, so that the queries can be processed without decompression . We theoretically show that the proposed approach is effective and could ensure random accessing. To efficiently implement the reinforcement-learning-based solution, we develop a data compression method based on DQN network. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm performs well in time series data sets with large amount of data and strong regularity, performs well in compression ratio and compression time. Besides, since no decompression is required, the query processing time is much less than the competitors.},

They can achieve satisfactory classification performance on linearly separable data, but not on nonlinear data. So, linear classifiers need extending, typically by modification of their algorithms, resulting in their nonlinear variants. In this paper we present one general method, cluster-based data relabelling (CBDR), that allows linear classifiers to work effectively on nonlinear data. CBDR partitions the data set into several non-overlapping class-specific clusters and relabels data by the clusters. A linear classifier can then be applied to the relabelled data to seek cluster-based linear decision boundaries instead of class-based decision boundaries. Extensive experimentation has demonstrated that CBDR can significantly enhance the classification performance of linear classifiers, and even outperform their nonlinear variants. Further experimentation has demonstrated that CBDR can also improve the classification performance of nonlinear classifiers. Most significant outperformance was observed on imbalanced data in both cases.},

With the help of C-D experiment and D experiment, this paper develops a dynamical Markov decision-making model based on mass function to quantitatively predict the interference effects. This model employs both the mass function and discount coefficient to generate distribution of initial state. A transition matrix based on the characteristics of unitary matrix is then generated, which is capable of realizing both transition between adjacent states as well as constraining variation interval of the discount coefficient. Next, this model quantifies the difference between the two experimental results obtained through a probability transformation to predict interference effects. Finally, our proposed model is applied to existing dataset with the results indicating that our model can process all existing data associated with the experiments, as compared to other models.},

The proposed VIN-RS embeds a CNN trained on computed labels using the message passing mechanism of the Hidden Markov Model. The CNN processes images or graphs of the environment to predict the shaping values. Recent work on reward shaping still has limitations towards training on a representation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and building an estimate of the transition matrix . The advantage of VIN-RS is to construct an effective potential function from an estimated MDP while automatically inferring the environment transition matrix . The proposed VIN-RS estimates the transition matrix through a self-learned convolution filter while extracting environment details from the input frames or sampled graphs. Due to (1) the previous success of using message passing for reward shaping; and (2) the CNN planning behavior, we use these messages to train the CNN of VIN-RS. Experiments are performed on tabular games, Atari 2600 and MuJoCo, for discrete and continuous action space. Our results illustrate promising improvements in the learning speed and maximum cumulative reward compared to the state-of-the-art. The improvement achieved by VIN-RS can only be observed for some of the games due to the underlying nature of some environments. In terms of the studied MuJoCo games, there is on average an increase of 30\% in the maximum reward reached during early stages of learning.},

  abstract     = {The multiple-target self-organizing pursuit (SOP) problem has wide applications and has been considered a challenging self-organization game for distributed systems, in which intelligent agents cooperatively pursue multiple dynamic targets with partial observations. This work proposes a framework for decentralized multi-agent systems to improve the implicit coordination capabilities in search and pursuit. We model a self-organizing system as a partially observable Markov game (POMG) featured by large-scale, decentralization, partial observation, and noncommunication. The proposed distributed algorithm–fuzzy self-organizing cooperative coevolution (FSC2) is then leveraged to resolve the three challenges in multi-target SOP: distributed self-organizing search (SOS), distributed task allocation, and distributed single-target pursuit. FSC2 includes a coordinated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) method that enables homogeneous agents to learn natural SOS patterns. Additionally, we propose a fuzzy-based distributed task allocation method, which locally decomposes multi-target SOP into several single-target pursuit problems. The cooperative coevolution principle is employed to coordinate distributed pursuers for each single-target pursuit problem. Therefore, the uncertainties of inherent partial observation and distributed decision-making in the POMG can be alleviated. The experimental results demonstrate that by decomposing the SOP task, FSC2 achieves superior performance compared with other implicit coordination policies fully trained by general MARL algorithms. The scalability of FSC2 is proved that up to 2048 FSC2 agents perform efficient multi-target SOP with almost 100\% capture rates. Empirical analyses and ablation studies verify the interpretability , rationality, and effectiveness of component algorithms in FSC2.},

The effective T-S fuzzy model describes the behavior of the nonlinear model into linear sub-models based on IF-THEN fuzzy membership functions and the corresponding fuzzy CMSFC is proposed. The main intention of this paper is to stabilize the active and reactive power constant, control the stator and rotor voltages of α − β α−β frames when enhancing the system stable output power. To do this, a fuzzy CMSFC strategy is designed. By constructing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKFs) with the effect of constant time-delay, the delay-dependent sufficient criteria are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be easily assessed by MATLAB LMI Control toolbox. Based on the delay-dependent sufficient criteria, the mean-square asymptotic stability of the DFIG-based WT system under the proposed controller is also achieved. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method through numerical simulations and comparative results.},

It furnishes information on all four fundamental subspaces of the matrix. In this paper, we introduce a randomized version of the QLP decomposition called Rand-QLP. Operating on a matrix A , Rand-QLP gives A = QLP T A=QLPT , where Q and P are orthonormal, and L is lower-triangular. Under the assumption that the rank of the input matrix is k , we derive several error bounds for Rand-QLP: bounds for the first k approximate singular values and for the trailing block of the middle factor L , which show that the decomposition is rank-revealing; bounds for the distance between approximate subspaces and the exact ones for all four fundamental subspaces of a given matrix ; and bounds for the errors of low-rank approximations constructed by the columns of Q and P . Rand-QLP is able to effectively leverage modern computational architectures, due to the utilization of random sampling and the unpivoted QR decomposition, thus addressing a serious bottleneck associated with classical algorithms such as the SVD, CPQR and most recent matrix decomposition algorithms. We utilize a modern computing architecture to assess the performance behavior of different algorithms. In comparison to CPQR and the SVD, Rand-QLP respectively achieves a speedup of up to 5 times and 6.6 times on the CPU and up to 3.8 times and 4.4 times with the hybrid GPU architecture. In terms of quality of approximation , our results on synthetic and real data show that the approximations by Rand-QLP are comparable to those of pivoted QLP and the optimal SVD, and in most cases are considerably better than those of CPQR.},

However, it remains a challenge to solve high-dimensional expensive problems (HEPs) with the curse of dimensionality . Therefore, this paper proposes a surrogate-assisted improved multioperator differential evolution (SA-IMODE) algorithm to address HEPs up to 2000 dimensions. Specifically, this paper proposes a novel relationship classification model-based environment selection strategy (RCES), in which a classification model is used to distinguish between “good” and “bad” solutions to assist in environment selection. By doing this, the “unpromising” solutions are thrown away directly without evaluation to reduce the number of expensive fitness evaluations. Moreover, the solution-improvement data point and error samples are added to construct the training dataset to improve the model&#39;s prediction accuracy. Two coordinate systems are utilized to produce five types of DE operators to suit different fitness landscapes. An adaptive strategy is also used to select suitable DE operators to generate promising offspring. Furthermore, a local search mechanism is applied to refine the best solution in the current population to accelerate the algorithm&#39;s convergence. The systematic experiment results show SA-IMODE has a significant advantage over thirteen state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark problems.},

Logs, serving as the system runtime information, are the key resources to understand system statuses. The existing automatic log anomaly detection approaches focused on the temporal features deriving from sequential nature of logs/events, which can be suitable for limited-sized information systems with homogeneous structure. However, with increasing complexity of systems, the time-aware relationships among discrete logs/events become non-trivial features. Different from the previous works, a novel framework for log anomaly detection is proposed from the perspective of link prediction. First, a temporal event graph is constructed to model the time-aware relationships between events, which is derived from discrete event sequences and possesses the evolutionary properties of sequential events. Second, we pre-train a graph convolutional neural network by using graph contrastive learning to capture local topological features . Third, a temporal convolutional network is used to learn the temporal features. Finally, based on generative adversarial network , link prediction is implemented by generating the next moment event graph, which also is the basis for anomaly detection. Experiments are conducted on public datasets to verify the validity of the model, and superior results are achieved compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Specifically, each individual is assigned two rankings: one ranking calculated based on Pareto dominance (regardless of constraints) and another calculated based on the constrained dominance principle (CDP). The fitness value of an individual is the weighted sum of these two rankings, and the weight is related to the generation number and the proportion of feasible solutions in the current generation. Based on the proposed CHT, a constrained multiobjective differential evolution algorithm is proposed. To generate high-quality offspring, the proposed constrained multiobjective differential evolution algorithm combines four mutation operations as core components of the search algorithm.

However, some issues pose serious challenges to MaOEAs, such as the intensification of the conflict between convergence and diversity, and the lack of Pareto selection pressure. To address the above issues, we propose a cooperative-competitive two-stage game mechanism assisted many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEA-GM). The algorithm is divided into two stages, such as competition and cooperative. In competitive game stage, a strategy pool is constructed, including angle penalty distance strategy and favorable convergence strategy. In addition, a new game utility function is designed to balance convergence and diversity. This method promotes the selection of genetically superior parents for inheritance, so that the population can quickly approach the true Pareto front . In cooperative game stage, individuals choose their preferred environmental selection mechanism by voting. The final scheme is determined using the criterion of minority obedience to the majority, thereby increasing the algorithm Pareto selection pressure. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with five advanced MaOEAs, The MaOEA-GM algorithm has not only preponderance in convergence and diversity indicators, but also higher competitiveness in solving MaOPs.},

  abstract     = {In combination with social networks, opinion dynamics models can effectively describe the interaction and exchange of opinions between experts in social network group decision-making (SNGDM). Usually, the opinion dynamics model allows all experts to be involved in the interaction process simultaneously. However, if a subgroup has a dominant influence in SNGDM, the authoritative subgroup can easily control the group opinion. Therefore, we propose the grey relational analysis (GRA)- and clustering-based opinion dynamics model to avoid this situation. First, this paper applies a new operator to social network analysis (SNA) to obtain complete social relationships among experts. Next, we propose an improved k-means clustering method based on experts’ social relationships and opinion similarity. Then, based on SNA, GRA, and clustering results , a novel opinion dynamics model is proposed to weaken the influence of the authoritative subgroup. Finally, the validity of the proposed model is demonstrated through numerical examples and comparative analyses.},

We propose a novel method that combines multi-similarity reconstructing with clustering-based contrastive hashing. Firstly, we construct image feature , text feature and joint-semantic feature multi-similarity matrices in their original space, along with their corresponding hashing code similarity matrices in the Hamming space, to enhance the semantic consistency of the inter-and intra-modal reconstructions. Secondly, the clustering-based contrastive hashing is proposed to capture the global intrinsic correlation and manifold structure of the image-text pairs.

Such a process is implemented by editing all images into the same histogram. Image entropy equalization is evaluated by comparing the original and equalized images in various machine learning tasks. The main advantage of image entropy equalization is to improve the AUC score for one-class autoencoder (OCAE). This result gives a new hypothesis that using image entropy equalization could improve various studies using autoencoder (AE). In addition, the proposed method shows fair results for classification and regression tasks. On the other hand, the main challenges are that the equalization process depends on a reference histogram and is affected by diverse backgrounds.},

The technique selects a subset of features with high discriminative power to maintain or improve the classifier&#39;s classification performance. In many practical applications, it is not possible to use multi-label data to express the relative importance of each label versus each sample. Therefore, all relevant or irrelevant labels are measured with the same importance, neglecting the potential relationship between labels and samples. To better account for the relationship between samples and labels, traditional logical labels are enhanced to label distributions. Aiming at the application of latent sample correlation in label enhancement, a new label enhancement algorithm is proposed. First, to extract potential correlation from the sample space, an objective function is proposed and solved. Second, in the process of label enhancement, the correlation is embedded into label distributions. Finally, label distributions are applied to the sparse linear regression model instead of logical labels. Experiments show that proposed method is superior to 5 advanced multi-label feature selection algorithms on 11 multi-label datasets.},

  abstract     = {Fairness concerns have recently been gaining increasing attention in machine learning (ML) research and applications. ML models typically require massive data, which can be costly and challenging for collecting and labeling. To address these concerns, active learning has been proposed as a promising approach to build accurate and fair ML models by interactively querying an oracle within a labeling budget. However, current research on fair active learning only focuses on single sensitive attribute, where the model often show unfairness on subgroups defined by the intersections of different protected attribute values. In this article, a novel active learning approach with a fairness-aware clustering technique is proposed for fair classification that can simultaneously ensure the equality of fairness metrics across multiple sensitive attributes. The fair clustering method enables to control the trade-off levels between the clustering and fairness objectives with multiple sensitive attributes, which mitigates bias and protects the unprivileged classes by balancing their representativeness in all clusters. A tight upper bound is theoretically derived for our fairness objective based on its concave-convex decomposition, which can be jointly optimized with the clustering objective through Majorize-Minimize technique and enable parallel computing . The active learning sampler aims to select highly informative and representative samples from fair clusters to enhance the model classification accuracy and fairness. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing with state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets. The experimental results are accordant with theoretic analysis , and show that (i) our approach significantly improves the fairness while maintaining model classification accuracy ; (ii) our approach outperforms state-of-the-art fair active learning methods across fairness metrics on both single and multiple sensitive attributes for fair classification tasks .},

Besides all these aspects, there is also a need for an algorithm that quickly processes high-dimensional data sets. To satisfy these requirements, we propose an unsupervised local outlier detection method that can draw the neighborhood boundaries of the data points via Chebyshev inequality . The proposed method sets the boundaries of the points through the so-called deviation parameter that correlates to the standard deviation of the data distribution and then detects outliers by quantifying their neighborhood densities. The experimental results on real-world and synthetic data sets show the efficacy of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.

To demonstrate the applicability of the constructed decision framework, a case study of NEV evaluation in Zhuzhou City is carried out and the result analysis and management implication are conducted in detail.

The feature enhancement method groups the features of raw traffic according to the value of Gaussian characteristics, and generates the cluster features with k-means algorithm. The raw features and generated features are feed into a dual classification model that constructed with shallow neural networks and random forests algorithm for detecting the network traffics. In experiments, we use two classic datasets (CIC-IDS-2017 and IOT-23) and simulate the malicious traffic detection targeting small-scale imbalanced dataset. The results show that FE-MTDM has stronger detection ability and reliability than deep learning network (DNN) based models. Regarding to IOT-23, when the percentage of attack samples is 30\%, the detection rate of FE-MTDM for DDoS and PortScan is improved 42\% and 33\% compared with DNN.},

For supporting SCC search in different situations, two search methods—peeling and expansion—are proposed by peeling from the ( α , β α,β )-core containing the query vertex and expanding from the query vertex respectively. An efficient lower bound based on degree gap is proposed by terminating unpromising search branches early to increase the efficiency of the community search.

To improve the comprehensive performance, a hierarchical recursive L–M (H-R-LM) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The concepts of parameter separation and model decomposition are integrated into the algorithm to reduce the model’s complexity. Multi-innovation and forgetting factors leverage historical data more reasonably, thus accelerating the convergence. Hierarchical recognition and alternating optimization can improve identification accuracy. Two experiments on analog and actual data sets are used to compare the performance of the RBF-AR model using R-LM and H-R-LM algorithms. Compared with the R-LM algorithm, experiments verify that the new H-R-LM algorithm presents higher identification accuracy, faster convergence rate, improved predictive performance, and less computational effort.},

For addressing this problem, we propose a novel method called Double Constrained Discriminative Least Squares Regression (DCDLSR), which incorporates both inter- and intra-class distances to improve classification performance. First, the constrained relaxation labels of Fisher criterion are introduced into the DLSR model, which shortens the interval of similar samples. Second, we place the operation of matrix decomposition inside the label space to preserve as much of its manifold structure as possible. Additionally, we introduce l 2 , 1 l2,1 -norm constraints to the noise matrix to mitigate the impact of outliers. Our experiments demonstrate that improving the double constraint and matrix decomposition significantly overcomes the limitations of DLSR and achieves better performance on multi-classification tasks.},

To address these issues, we propose L ocal C ausal S tructure L earning for S treaming F eatures ( LCSL SF LCSLSF ).

Second, it learns local causal structures by mining and splicing the V-structure of feature nodes in batches from aMB of the target variable. On benchmark Bayesian networks with the number of variables ranging from 20 to 724, LCSL SF LCSLSF achieves a significantly better performance than its rivals. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting a real-world case study on causal discovery in medical diagnostics. Code is released at https://github.com/youdianlong/LCSLSF .},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a model across multiple parties while preserving the privacy of users&#39; data. Traditional FL only develops a common model for users, and does not adapt the model to each user. Therefore, personalized FL approaches emerged that can further adapt the model to users, thus showing better performance. Among these personalized FL methods, meta-learned personalized FL methods achieve the advanced performance. However, this personalization scheme adapts model to each user according to their own data, and the features it learned are not enough and not rich, especially when there are extremely little data in some users. In this paper, we study a more effective variant of personalization federated learning. We first formalize a new learning problem and propose a Distributed Co-Meta-Learning approach for this learning problem. Then, we show how to design a new personalized FL framework based on this Distributed Co-Meta-Learning approach. To optimize our proposed personalized FL framework, while reducing the computational cost in the optimization, we study a chain-estimation aggregation method for our framework. It also reduces the computational load in the clients. Further, we give the theoretical convergence analysis of our method on the most complex case, non-convex and non-IID problems, and analyze some parameters&#39; properties within it. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the personalization FL area.},

Most related studies focus on using multi-critic to reduce estimation bias and seldom consider the multi-actor impact on value estimation. This paper proposes a multi-actor mechanism (MAM) for Actor-Critic reinforcement learning that can provide multiple behavior choices in the same state, resulting in diverse Q-values that provide richer information and enhance exploration capability. MAM contains two technologies. One is obsolescence technology, which quickly generates high-quality experience to help the agent find the optimal policy . The other is Q-value weighting technology, which leverages multiple Q-values to achieve a more accurate value estimation. The proposed mechanism, MAM, is general and can be applied to any Actor-Critic reinforcement learning algorithm. Specifically, we embed MAM into DDPG and TD3 and demonstrate that MAM can mitigate estimation bias, enhance exploration, and yield state-of-the-art results in various MuJoCo tasks, including the challenging Humanoid-v2 and Walker2d-v2 benchmarks.},

By taking the acceleration of each part of the suspension as the component of the system state, the vehicle suspension system is successfully extended to a singular vehicle suspension system. The regularity and non-impulsiveness of the time-varying delays SHVSSs with impulsive perturbations are proved via singular value decomposition (SVD) method. By means of constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional embodied with Markovian jump modes and impulse times information, neoteric conditions are smoothly concluded under linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) framework, which guarantee that the closed-loop SHVSS acquires H ∞ H∞ stochastic admissibilization. By exploiting Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy technique and parallel-distributed compensation (PDC) method, a reliable Bernoulli random delay-based fuzzy mode-dependent feedback (FMDF) controller is proposed to handle the change of sprung mass and actuator fault of the controlled time-varying delays SHVSSs.

  abstract     = {In the transfer-based adversarial attacks , adversarial examples are only generated by the surrogate models and achieve effective perturbation in the victim models. Although considerable efforts have been developed on improving the transferability of adversarial examples generated by transfer-based adversarial attacks , our investigation found that, the big convergence speed deviation along the actual and steepest update directions of the current transfer-based adversarial attacks is caused by the large update step length, resulting in the generated adversarial examples can not converge well. However, directly reducing the update step length will lead to serious update oscillation so that the generated adversarial examples also can not achieve great transferability to the victim models. To address these issues, a novel transfer-based attack, namely direction tuning attack, is proposed to not only decrease the angle between the actual and steepest update directions in the large step length, but also mitigate the update oscillation in the small sampling step length, thereby making the generated adversarial examples converge well to achieve great transferability on victim models. Specifically, in our direction tuning attack, we first update the adversarial examples using the large step length, which is aligned with the previous transfer-based attacks. In addition, in each large step length of the update, multiple examples sampled by using a small step length. The average gradient of these sampled examples is then used to reduce the angle between the actual and steepest update directions, as well as mitigates the update oscillation by eliminating the oscillating component. By doing so, our direction tuning attack can achieve better convergence and enhance the transferability of the generated adversarial examples. In addition, a network pruning method is proposed to smooth the decision boundary, thereby further decreasing the update oscillation and enhancing the transferability of the generated adversarial examples. The experiment results on ImageNet demonstrate that the average attack success rate (ASR) of the adversarial examples generated by our method can be improved from 87.9\% to 94.5\% on five victim models without defenses, and from 69.1\% to 76.2\% on eight advanced defense methods, in comparison with that of latest gradient-based attacks.

  abstract     = {Multi-phase batch processes (MPBP) have the characteristics of nonlinearity and various cases of switching, where the switching between two adjacent phases can be divided into synchronous vs asynchronous cases. The present study introduces a robust fuzzy predictive method for switching control to ensure that an MPBP can still operate stably in the above two cases. First, considering the multi-phase characteristics of MPBP, multiple stable sub-models are established under the synchronous case. On this basis, unstable sub-models are established between adjacent phases under the asynchronous case. Second, in order to deal with the inherent nonlinearity of MPBP, each sub-model is locally linearized and a mixed Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) model is established. Third, using a mapping relationship between controller and local subsystem including direct mapping and fully associative mapping, a global output control law is designed. By combining the Lyapunov stability theory , linear matrix inequality (LMI) theory, mode-dependent average dwell time method, etc., corresponding LMI conditions are derived by the mapping relationship of different cases, making each phase asymptotically stable and each batch exponentially stable. Then, the distribution compensation gains of the corresponding controllers, the shortest operating time of the stable subsystem and the longest operating time of the unstable subsystem can be obtained by solving corresponding LMI conditions in a synchronous or an asynchronous case. Finally, if the MPBP is in an asynchronous case, according to the longest operating time of the unstable subsystem, a time compensation method based on the obtained operating time is proposed to avoid the occurrence of an unstable subsystem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has greater advantages than the reference methods.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, with continuous integration of big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing technologies, there are increasing demands and specific requirements for data sharing in sustainable smart cities: (1) practical data sharing should be implemented in the non-interactive fashion without a trusted third party to be involved; (2) dynamic thresholds are preferred since the participants may join or leave at any time; (3) multi-secret sharing is desirable to increase the packing capacity. To fulfil these requirements, we propose a general construction of ideal threshold changeable multi-secret sharing scheme (TCMSS) with information-theoretic security, in which polynomials are employed to achieve dealer-free and non-interactive in the secret reconstruction phase. The TCMSS scheme can be built on any existing linear secret sharing scheme , and it is simpler and more efficient than the existing TCSS schemes in the literature. The main difference between TCMSS and Shamir’s SS is that univariate polynomial is used in Shamir’s SS to generate the shares for all shareholders; while in TCMSS, each shareholder can recover her own univariate polynomial using her share. This article demonstrates that with this novel modification, the classic polynomial-based SS can be transformed into an ideal TCMSS. Moreover, the TCMSS scheme is lightweight and it can resist both internal and external attacks. It does not require pairwise key distribution and its secret reconstruction phase is improved with enhanced properties. Therefore, the designed proposal is fairly suitable and attractive to be deployed in sustainable cities.},

However, the concept of ordering the actions has never been used within the field, and the reason for this is that there is no way to order the actions a priori . The recently-introduced Hierarchical Discrete Pursuit Automaton (HDPA) has an interesting concept of placing two-action LA along the nodes of a tree, implying that the leaves signify an underlying ordering. In this paper, we show that if estimates are available (as in the case of estimator algorithms), these can be used to place the actions at the leaf level to further enhance the convergence capabilities of the overall ensemble of the two-action LAs. This paper contains the design of this HDPA, the proof of this assertion, and the simulation results on benchmark Environments. Based on the results, we believe that it is the fastest and most accurate LA to date. Our position is that it will be very hard to beat its performance, since it has been incorporated all the salient features of the entire field of LA.},

Since the control policy for each agent is dynamic, when the traffic scale is large, the adjustment of the agent&#39;s policy brings non-stationary effects over surrounding intersections, leading to the instability of the overall system. Therefore, there is the necessity to eliminate this non-stationarity effect to stabilize the multi-agent system. A collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning method is proposed in this work to enable the system to overcome the instability problem through a collaborative mechanism. Decentralized learning with limited communication is used to reduce the communication latency between agents. The Shapley value reward function is applied to comprehensively calculate the contribution of each agent to avoid the influence of reward function coefficient variation, thereby reducing unstable factors. The Kullback-Leibler divergence is then used to distinguish the current and historical policies, and the loss function is optimized to eliminate the environmental non-stationarity. Experimental results demonstrate that the average travel time and its standard deviation are reduced by using the Shapley value reward function and optimized loss function, respectively, and this work provides an alternative for traffic signal controls on multiple intersections.},

For both the multi-agent systems over a switching digraph of uniform joint strong connectivity, it is demonstrated that the conventional distributed protocols, despite the simultaneous existence of the input saturations and communication delays, still guarantee the consensus results.

Given the existence of class imbalance in multiview learning, we introduce Universum to multiview subspace learning (MvSL) to further enhance its performance and L-CIBU happens to be able to overcome this problem. As far as we know, this is the first time to introduce Universum into MvSL with more than two views.

By analyzing several randomly generated imbalanced datasets, it is intuitively demonstrated that L-CIBU is more effective than FIBU and CIBU in the case of class imbalance. The experimental results on two real datasets show that the time required for creating the Universum using L-CIBU is 25\% ∼ 95\% 25\%∼95\% less than that of FIBU and CIBU.

However, the continuous form is the most common form of information in the real world. Simplifying continuous Z-number calculations is significant for practical applications. There are two reasons for the complexity of continuous Z-number calculations: the use of normal distributions and the inconsistency between the meaning and definition of Z-numbers. In this paper, we extend the triangular distribution as the hidden probability density function of triangular Z-numbers. We add a new parameter to the triangular distribution to influence its convexity and concavity , and then expand the value&#39;s domain of the probability measure. Finally, we implement the basic operations of triangular Z-numbers based on the extended triangular distribution. The suggested method is illustrated with numerical examples, and we compare its computational complexity and the entropy (uncertainty) of the resulting Z-number to the traditional method. The comparison shows that our method has lower computational complexity, higher precision and lower uncertainty in the results.},

  abstract     = {Link Recommendation (LR) in complex networks has attracted huge interest in the social and computer science communities. Numerous networks, such as recommendation systems and social networks (which facilitate user contact), are probabilistic rather than deterministic due to the uncertainty surrounding the presence of links. Evaluating the various characteristics of such networks has frequently been tricky as the Intra-layer linkage graph requires at least two nodes to be in the same layer. Moreover, many existing LR methods mainly operate well on Single-Layer Graphs (SLGs) compared to Multi-Layer Graphs (MLGs) when nodes traverse multi-layers in a network of Intra-layer linkages. Considering this drawback, this paper proposes a Multi-Layer Stochastic Block Interaction method driven by Logistic Regression (MLSBI-LR) to exploit the bi-directional resources associated with Intra-layer linkages. Its inherent dependence on knowledge-based systems uses multi-criteria recommender systems to accommodate additional criteria and can modify neighborhood-based approaches. A multi-criteria network with relations over the same set of nodes is used since the modified neighbor-based method can exhibit rich dependence between entities and have available experimental data sets in MLGs to recommend links that would efficiently enrich users&#39; experience. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed MLSBI-LR method compared to existing LR methods were extensively investigated using three distinct benchmark data sets and four evaluation metrics . Based on our experimental results across the databases and metrics, the proposed MLSBI-LR method performed significantly better (recording up to 17\% increment in accuracy), recommending potential links in MLGs. Consequently, the proposed method may revolutionize link recommendation tasks in social networks by improving users&#39; overall experience.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) is an effective method to ameliorate incompleteness and sparsity problems, which infers new knowledge based on existing knowledge. The Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches can obtain advanced effectiveness. However, it still suffers from some problems such as obtaining insufficient graph features, introducing noises, ignoring path connectivity, and acquiring incomplete neighborhood information. This paper proposes a neighborhood-aware (NA) graph self-attention mechanism-based pre-training model for KGR, namely NA-KGR. The proposed model is composed of two phases. The first phase is an enhanced graph attention network , which can use the weighted characteristics of its neighbors to represent and encode the entities that are most likely to have a positive effect on reasoning. The second phase is a neighborhood-aware self-attention mechanism, which makes the model more able to obtain information from the neighbor entities for inference by increasing an adaptive entity similarity matrix when calculating the attention score . Moreover, we propose a pre-training pattern based on neighborhood-aware random walk sampling and general subgraph structure sampling to improve NA-KGR&#39;s generalization ability . Extensive comparison and ablation experimental results on various benchmarks unambiguously demonstrate that the proposed NA-KGR model can obtain the state-of-the-art results of current GNN-based methods.},

In order to shrink the search space, the sensing area is evenly segmented into several subarea, and the tasks in a subarea are allocated to the users preferring it. Following that, a dynamic multi-objective task allocation model is formulated, and an end-to-end algorithm based on generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed as its problem-solver, with the purpose of quickly generating the Pareto-optimal allocation schemes. Specifically, after decomposing multi-objective problem into a set of scalar subproblems , each subproblem in each subarea is modeled as a neural network , in which the outputs represent the probabilities of users assigned to tasks. In order to produce better solutions and jump out local optima, a new loss function is designed for the discriminator . Besides, a rapid response mechanism is developed to timely adjust the structure of generative nets once a dynamic event occurs, avoiding the time-consuming re-training. Extensive experiments have been conducted to analyze the performance of proposed algorithm.

The new algorithm adopts a partitioning-merging strategy. By dividing the data into multiple sub-clusters, the impact range of high-density points on subsequent allocation points can be reduced. And the fast nearest neighbors search improves the speed of DPC. In the experiment, KS-FDPC is used to compare with eight improved DPC algorithms on eight synthetic data and eight UCI data. The results indicate that the overall clustering performance of KS-FDPC is superior to other algorithms. Moreover, KS-FDPC runs faster than other algorithms. Therefore, KS-FDPC is an effective improvement of DPC.},

However, most existing multi-view fuzzy systems require a large amount of labeled and complete multi-view data, which is a demanding requirement for real-world applications. To address these challenges, a novel transductive semi-supervised incomplete multi-view TSK fuzzy system (SSIMV_TSK) is proposed. First, to deal with the scarcity of labeled data, we introduce transductive learning , in which pseudo labels is assigned for unlabeled data . Then, to handle the incomplete multi-view data simultaneously, we integrate missing view imputation, pseudo label learning, and fuzzy system training as a single process to enable mutual learning. Furthermore, two new mechanisms – bidirectional structural preservation of instances and labels, and the adaptive multiple alignment collaborative learning – are proposed to further improve the robustness. Compared with the existing methods, the highlights of the proposed SSIMV_TSK are the ability to handle label scarcity and incomplete multi-view data simultaneously, the integration of missing view imputation and modeling as one process to make the imputed views more pertinent for classification; and the introduction of two new mechanisms to improve the quality of the learned pseudo labels and the imputed views.

An inherent assumption is that those connected graph nodes exhibit strong homophily, passing consistent label information into the associated central node representation. However, heterophilic graphs may hold inconsistent labels for those connected nodes, degenerating the performance of the typical message passing and exacerbating its over-smoothing issue. In this paper, to tame heterophilic graphs for GNNs, a novel label estimation-based message passing scheme is presented, which can further relieve the over-smoothing and lead the learned representations to be more distinguishable on graphs with either homophily or heterophily. Specifically, we optimize the edge weights of the graph by invoking the label estimation with the goal of returning a more effective adjacency matrix . With this matrix, a novel message passing scheme is presented, aggregating neighbor information with consistent labels to their central nodes. Meanwhile, a symmetric cross entropy is also employed to mitigate negative effects from noisy labels. With such guarantees in our new message passing, a uniform framework termed Label Estimation-based GNN (LE-GNN) is finally established.

However, the feature space of multi-label dataset and the hypothesis space of classifier are always complex. In order to obtain high performance multi-kernel learning algorithms, the core problem is to design algorithms that compress both hypothesis space and feature space. In this paper, by combining the local Rademacher complexity and Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC), an effective multi-kernel learning algorithm for multi-label classification is proposed to compress the feature space and hypothesis space simultaneously. Based on the tail sum of eigenvalues of the integral operator corresponding to kernels, the upper bound of local Rademacher complexity of linear functions class in the feature space is determined. The Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion is applied to maximize the correlation between the convex combination of the input kernel matrices and the ideal kernel matrix in the label space. Finally, the Laplace regularization model is built by controlling the tail sum of eigenvalues of the integral operator corresponding to kernels of this criterion. Therefore, the above process obtains a combined kernel, simultaneously by sorting the coefficients of the combined kernel, a feature selection algorithm can be constructed. On the basis, the combined kernel can also be used to design a new binary classifier for multi-label classification. The experimental results verify that our proposed multi-kernel learning algorithms can effectively compress the hypothesis space, while the feature selection algorithms can effectively compress the feature space.},

SFE can effectively extract and incorporate multiple spatial frequency information from in-stage and cross-stage feature maps and output an arbitrary number of comprehensive and compact frequency features. Then we design a spatial frequency enhanced network (SFENet) adopting two SFE modules to refine high- and low-frequency salient features end-to-end. High- and low-frequency salient features are then integrated into a final full-band saliency prediction. Experiments show that SFENet can ensure the integrity and sharpness of salient regions in complex backgrounds on five benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on filling the gap between strategy evaluation and strategy learning in two-player symmetric games, as a learning algorithm may converge to the strategies not preferred by an evaluation metric . When a player determines its strategies, it needs to first evaluate candidate strategies without knowing the opponents&#39; decisions. Then, based on the result of the evaluation, a preferred strategy is selected. On the contrary, many multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms are constructed provided that the strategies of other players are known in each training episode. In this paper, we first introduce two graph-based metrics grounded on sink equilibrium to characterize the preferred strategies of the players in strategy evaluation. These metrics can be regarded as generalized solution concepts in games. Then, we propose two variants of the classical self-play algorithm, named strictly best-response and weakly better-response self-plays , to learn the strategies for the players. By modeling the learning processes as walks over joint-strategy response digraphs , we prove that under some conditions, the learned strategies by two variants are the preferred strategies under two metrics, respectively, which thus fills the evaluation–learning gap, and ensures that the preferred strategies are learned. We also investigate the relationship between the two metrics.},

  abstract     = {The problem of security control for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is gradually becoming a popular research topic. In the presence of the denial-of-service (DoS) attack, this paper investigates the switched-type unknown input observer-based fault-tolerant control problem for multi-channel CPSs. Firstly, based on the sampling mechanism, a switched-type unknown input observer (SUIO) which can discard the outdated information is designed to obtain state/fault estimations, and converting the estimation error system stability analysis under DoS attack into that under SUIO. Then, to compensate the effect of actuator fault , an SUIO-based fault-tolerant controller is designed. And the input-to-state stability of the CPSs is analyzed. In comparison with the existing UIO studies, this paper considers the case of DoS attack affecting the transmission channel, and the impact of DoS attack on estimation effect can be effectively reduced by introducing the switching mechanism. Finally, based on the simulation results of the given experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated.},

In order to provide a practical example, we use a dataset of used cars to show how the proposed method facilitates the selection of the most suitable vehicle based on individual needs. The main goal of this paper is to show how the ESP-COMET method can help to adapt decisions to individual needs and expectations. We also introduce a novel and efficient approach for determining characteristic values in personalized decision-making, which plays a crucial role in ensuring the higher accuracy of the ESP-COMET method. Additionally, we compare the proposed approach with such methods as Stable Preference Ordering Toward the Ideal Solution (SPOTIS) and Reference Ideal Method (RIM).

  abstract     = {A machine learning algorithm is monotonic if it returns a model with better performance when trained with a larger data set. Monotonicity is essential in scenarios when a learning algorithm is working with continually collected data, as non-monotonicity may result in unstable performance and a huge waste of resources during the learning process. However, existing learning algorithms working in scenarios such as online learning, domain incremental learning and reinforcement learning hardly address the monotonicity issue. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary framework that focuses on the enforcement of monotonicity for a learning algorithm over streaming data feeds. In each iteration, training is triggered by a new collection of incoming data, which consequently creates a new generation of hypotheses, and only a portion of the generation with best performance is retained for the next round based on a novel statistical hypothesis test. We carry out experiments on DNN models with continual data feeds constructed from MNIST, CIFAR-10, SST-2 and Tiny ImageNet. The results justify that our approach can significantly increase the probability of locally monotonic updates on the generated learning curves for the trained models and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on that purpose.},

  abstract     = {Public key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS) is an asymmetric searchable encryption technique secure against inside keyword guessing attacks. The security properties of PAEKS are modeled via ciphertext indistinguishability (CI) and trapdoor indistinguishability (TI). Nowadays, CI security has been extended to enable the attacker to challenge two keyword tuples (MCI security), and even obtain ciphertext embedded with any keyword (fully MCI security). However, similar extensions to TI security have not yet been achieved from bilinear pairings . In this work, we address this problem by focusing not only on ciphertext privacy, but also on trapdoor privacy. In particular, we adopt the enhanced TI-security, namely fully MTI security. We begin by conducting a detailed comparison of the fully MTI security with current TI models. Subsequently, we design a PAEKS scheme from bilinear pairings that initially achieves both fully MTI and fully MCI security, thereby offering a stronger security guarantee than other existing PAEKS schemes. To optimize the practical efficiency, we adopt various techniques: accelerating the online efficiency by shifting most computational cost offline; leveraging parallel computing to speed up the test algorithm. Consequently, our optimized scheme is competitive with other PAEKS schemes optimized using similar techniques.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to achieve competitive performance by labeling only a few training examples. However, unlabeled training examples from the wild are vulnerable to backdoor poisoning. Hence, networks trained by SSL tend to be injected with backdoors. Most existing backdoor attacks focus on labeled examples, while some backdoor poisoning methods on unlabeled examples require that SSL networks must be pre-trained on labeled examples. In this paper, we propose a backdoor poisoning method on unlabeled examples of trained-from-scratch SSL networks. We find that backdoor poisoning always fails when the poisoned unlabeled examples come from different classes, which is different from poisoning the labeled examples. The reason is that SSL algorithms always strive to correct them during training. Therefore, for unlabeled examples, we implement backdoor poisoning on examples from the target class. We propose a gradient matching strategy to craft poisoned examples such that their gradients match the gradients of target examples on the SSL network. This can fit poisoned examples to the target class and realize backdoor injection. Experiments show that our poisoning achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on most SSL algorithms while ensuring the imperceptibility of backdoor patterns and bypassing modern backdoor defenses.},

Inspired by the existing results, a set of sub-observers is designed which can exclude the influence of unknown input and output disturbances. To achieve switching between different sub-observers, the adaptive switching mechanism is designed according to the switching adversarial principle. Some parameters of the observer are obtained by designing a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

This study aims at forming a novel group decision making (GDM) method based on the consistency and consensus preference analysis for IVLIFPRs. First, the new concepts of additive consistency and acceptably additive consistency for IVLIFPRs are defined. Based on these definitions, two optimization models are constructed to obtain the incomplete information and acceptably additive consistent IVLIFPRs, respectively. Then, inspired by the Markov model, the derivation approach of DMs&#39; weights is designed. Afterward, the consensus improving process is constructed under the premise of acceptable consistency and smallest information distortion. Accordingly, the normalized priority weights of alternatives are further determined. Thus, a mechanism for the GDM method with incomplete and unacceptably consistent IVLIFPRs is developed. Finally, an application and comparison analysis show that the proposed method comprehensively considers the key steps in the GDM process, so that the logical rationality and technical superiority are well guaranteed.},

However, the subtle nature of online fake news makes it challenging to solely rely on textual information for debunking. Recent studies that focus on multimodal fake news detection have demonstrated superior performance compared with text-only methods, thereby establishing a new paradigm for detecting fake news. However, this paradigm may require a large number of training instances or updating the entire set of pre-trained model parameters. Furthermore, existing multimodal approaches typically integrate cross-modal features without considering the potential introduction of noise from unrelated semantic representations . To address these issues, this paper proposes the S imilarity- A ware M ultimodal P rompt Le arning (SAMPLE) framework. Incorporating prompt learning into multimodal fake news detection, we used three prompt templates with a soft verbalizer to detect fake news. Moreover, we introduced a similarity-aware fusing method, which adaptively fuses the intensity of multimodal representation so as to mitigate noise injection from uncorrelated cross-modal features. Evaluation results show that SAMPLE outperformed previous work, achieving higher F1 and accuracy scores on two multimodal benchmark datasets, demonstrating its feasibility in real-world scenarios, regardless of data-rich or few-shot settings.},

  abstract     = {Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) has garnered considerable attention in recent years, aiming to obtain an optimal partition from multiple base kernels. Existing MKC methods typically focus on either learning the pairwise structure by constructing an optimal kernel from the base kernels or learning the cluster structure by integrating multiple base partitions into a consensus one for clustering. However, these previous approaches overlook the potential for mutual structure learning between the two aspects, i.e., pairwise and cluster structure, of clustering. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multiple kernel clustering method, referred to as MSL-MKC, which simultaneously learns pairwise and cluster structure to achieve an improved consensus partition matrix for clustering. Specifically, MSL-MKC extends the adaptive neighbor graph learning approach into kernel space to construct a discriminative similarity graph from multiple base kernels for pairwise structure learning . The consensus partition is formulated by aligning it with multiple base partitions for cluster structure learning. We utilize a Laplacian regularization term to preserve the pairwise structure in the consensus partition and inject the cluster structure into the discriminative similarity graph . The proposed method integrates similarity graph learning, partition fusion, and Laplacian regularization into a unified framework, optimized using an iterative algorithm . Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of MSL-MKC. The demo code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/guanyuezhen/MSL-MKC .},

  abstract     = {The field of intelligent multimedia systems, which rely heavily on multimodal models trained on large amounts of high-quality data, has been revolutionized by the use of deep learning. One promising approach to collect such multimodal data is Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS). However, MCS platforms face a significant challenge in selecting both high-credit and high-quality workers at low cost due to the Post-Unknown Worker Recruitment (PUWR) problem. The PUWR problem makes it difficult to determine the credits and qualities of workers in advance, which can lead to the recruitment of dishonest or low-quality workers. This problem severely affects the quality and quantity of MCS data collection, posing a serious threat to the security and robustness of large-scale multimedia models. To address this issue, we propose a Credit and Quality Learning based Multi-Armed Bandit (CQL-MAB) scheme, which consists of a novel credit identification algorithm, a fine-grained worker quality calculation method, and a two-stage reward-based Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) for worker selection in reverse auction. The theoretical proof shows that the CQL-MAB scheme achieves the truthfulness, individual rationality , and efficiency of the auction mechanism. A large number of simulation experiments on real data traces are conducted to demonstrate the outstanding performance of CQL-MAB.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model based on a rough extension of the Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) to determine the order of importance of users&#39; perspectives on Electric Vehicle (EV) purchases. Unlike conventional methods that rely on predefined ranks for criteria weighting coefficients , the proposed rough OPA method employs an aggregated rough linguistic matrix, enabling a more precise and unbiased calculation of interval values. Moreover, the model addresses inherent uncertainties by incorporating nonlinear aggregation functions, accommodating decision makers&#39; risk attitudes for flexible decision-making. To validate the model&#39;s efficacy, a large-scale post-EV test drive survey is conducted, enabling the determination of relative criterion importance. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the model, demonstrating that marginal changes in parameters do not alter the ranking order. The results unveil the significance of the reliability criterion and reveal that vehicle-related characteristics outweigh economic and environmental attributes in the decision-making process. Overall, this innovative MCDM model contributes to a more accurate and objective analysis, enhancing the understanding of users&#39; preferences and supporting informed decision-making in EV purchases.},

  abstract     = {The complementary information from RGB and thermal images can remarkably boost semantic segmentation performance. Existing RGB-T segmentation methods usually use simple interaction strategies to extract complementary information from RGB and thermal images , which ignores recognizability features from different imaging mechanisms. To address these problems, we propose a multistage information interaction network for RGB-T semantic segmentation called MS-IRTNet. MS-IRTNet has a dual-stream encoder structure that can extract multistage feature information. To better interact with multimodal information , we design a gate-weighted interaction module (GWIM) and a feature information interaction module (FIIM). GWIM can learn multimodal information weights in different channels, while FIIM integrates and fuses weighted RGB and thermal information into a single feature map. Finally, multistage interactive information is fed into the decoder for semantic prediction. Our method achieves 60.5 mIoU on the MFNet dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MS-IRTNet also achieved state-of-the-art results in tests of daytime images (51.7 mIoU) and nighttime images (62.5 mIoU).

  abstract     = {Opinion evolution is a common phenomenon in social network group decision-making (SNGDM), where the key issue is modelling trust weights among individuals. In social and economic networks, the links among individuals represent trust relationships that can offer value. However, extant studies on trust weight distribution have failed to consider individual network values. Moreover, in some scenarios, the external stakeholder may want to manipulate the opinion evolution process to achieve the desired consensus outcome. Therefore, this study proposes value-based opinion evolution and discusses consensus manipulation in SNGDM. First, we measured the total value of an individual in a network, which consisted of two parts: intrinsic value and network value. Notably, we used the constant elasticity of substitution from economics as an operator to aggregate intrinsic and network values. Based on this, we described value-based opinion evolution and established an optimisation-based consensus manipulation model for SNGDM with value-based opinion evolution (CM-VBOE). Furthermore, we conducted some sensitive analyses, which indicate that an individual’s value in the network increases with the decay factor and decreases with the elasticity of substitution, and provide a comparative analysis, which expands on the importance of accounting for the decay factor and elasticity of substitution when modelling value-based opinion evolution. Finally, a hypothetical application for crowdfunding project selection is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed CM-VBOE.},

Theoretically, this seems leading to two types of local hidden variable theories (LHVTs) given by C-LHVMs and D-LHVMs, respectively. In this paper, we show the equivalence of these two types of LHVTs by mathematically proving that a correlation tensor (equivalently, a box) has a C-LHVM if and only if it has a D-LHVM.

In this context, this study proposes an innovative hybrid MCDM model that integrates criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC), multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC), and k-means with Monte Carlo simulation (i.e., CRITIC–MABAC–Kmeans with Monte Carlo simulation), aiming to address MCDM problems with substantial stability and reliability. Specifically, MABAC attests to the stability of this method, as it is less affected by normalization and weighting schemes. In addition, the challenge of conflicting k-means clustering outcomes, owing to diverse initial centroid selections, is mitigated by a Monte Carlo simulation , which identifies the most probable type of result and compensates for small-sample size bias. The model performance is tested using a case study of observing transport safety accomplishments in the ASEAN region. Enhanced multiple comparisons of the experimental results verify the quality, efficiency, and adaptability of the proposed model, indicating its feasibility for DMs, policymakers, and practitioners as a practical tool for handling real-life MCDM activities in various domains under compounded sensitivity and uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {More and more studies have demonstrated that circRNAs can be used as markers of various diseases due to their inherent stability. Numerous computational methods, especially artificial intelligence approaches, have been applied to the prediction of circRNA-disease associations. However, the objective functions of these prediction methods are usually single and standard. The single objective function hardly reflects the characteristics of the prediction problem, and leads to low prediction accuracy. There has never been a method to design a set of objective functions for the circRNA-disease prediction problem and solve it by using intelligent optimization algorithms . In this paper, a method ICDMOE is proposed to identify circRNA-disease associations via a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. A solution space is defined and four objective functions are designed based on matrix factorization and modularity of similarity networks. An improved decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D) is also employed to solve these objective functions. In the MOEA/D, an adaptive penalty-based boundary intersection strategy is proposed, which not only ensures convergence, but also guarantees the diversity of solutions in the Pareto front . Finally, the experimental results show that ICDMOE has better performance than pure matrix factorization-based methods, non-adaptive MOEA/D-based methods and other prediction methods. Furthermore, we find that the predicted disease-circRNAs can be confirmed by existing studies, miRNA regulations and expression profiles, etc . These indicate that ICDMOE can provide good candidates for biomedical experiments.},

  abstract     = {The flexible paradigm of Resource Description Framework (RDF) has accelerated the raw data published on the web. Therefore, the volume of generated RDF data has increased impressively in the last decade promoting compression to manage and reduce the size of RDF datasets. Universal RDF compressors can be able to detect and remove redundancy at symbolic, syntactic , or semantic levels . However, these compressors rarely exploit the graph patterns as well as structural regularities in real-world datasets. An efficient approach for compressing the RDF datasets based on the structural properties is HDT (Header-Dictionary-Triple). However, it cannot manage the RDF datasets with named graphs, the regularities of the graph structure, and structural redundancies . Because HDT considers all the triples to reside in the same default graph. Though, the triples of an RDF dataset belong to various named graphs. In this study, we have proposed a novel approach to deal with the above-mentioned challenges. We introduce hybrid TI-GI (Triple Interpreter-Graph Interpreter) to manage the RDF datasets with named graphs and use compact RDF serialization. We also propose RDF-RR (RDF-Redundancy Reducer) and object mapping that detects and removes structural redundancies by identifying the common patterns related to the predicates and objects in the RDF datasets. We employ a differential compressor to discover the frequent graph pattern in a single pass by using the data structure-oriented approach of the dataset. Evaluation of real-world datasets affirms that our proposed approach can substantially reduce the size of the experimental RDF datasets at approximately 30.52\%, 24.92\%, and 26.96\% when compared with the existing HDT, HDT-FoQ (HDT-Focused on Querying) and the 2Tp (two Triple Predicate based index) approaches. Moreover, the indexing time of our proposed system is also reduced at approximately 17.89\%, 13.70\%, and 9.32\% when compared with the HDT, HDT-FoQ, and 2Tp approaches.},

In this method, two heterogeneous graphs are constructed according to the statistical characteristic of the mentioning relationship between users and words, and the mentioning relationship between users in the tweets, respectively. By sampling the nodes in the graph, the complex topological structure of the constructed graph is captured and natural language-like node sequences are generated. The Skip-gram model is used to construct the objective function, and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm is employed to optimize the objective function to learn the representations. Finally, a neural network is used to train the user geolocation model. Experiments conducted on two real-world Twitter datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper, a delegatable FE-IP (DFE-IP) scheme is proposed to support decryption delegation. Our scheme provides the following important features: (1) a delegator can delegate his/her decryption power to a delegatee; (2) a proxy is not required to re-encrypt ciphertexts; (3) it supports temporary delegation and flexible revocation . We first formalize our DFE-IP scheme including definition and security model, and then describe a concrete construction. Furthermore, the implementation and evaluation are provided to show its efficiency. Finally, its security is formally proven.

  abstract     = {This paper develops model-free optimal tracking policies for Markov jump systems by solving non-zero-sum games (NZSGs). First, coupled action and mode-dependent value functions (CAMDVFs) are built for solving a two-player NZSG and getting Nash equilibrium solutions. Second, we propose a value iteration (VI) algorithm to parallelly update policies under each mode by collecting data on different operation modes within each iterative window. Moreover, the iterative increasing convergence of the CAMDVFs is proved by introducing auxiliary functions between two adjacent iterations. It is worth pointing out that an influence function is introduced to remove abnormal data to improve the learning capability of the VI algorithm effectively. Finally, the tracking policies&#39; validity, self-adaptability and application potential are verified by a numerical example and a generalized economic model.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm in which clients collaboratively train a global model with shared gradients while preserving the privacy of local data. Recent researches found that an adversary can reveal private local data with gradient inversion attacks. However, setting a large batchsize in local training can defense against these attacks effectively by confusing gradients computed on private data. Although some advanced methods have been proposed to improve the performance of gradient inversion attacks on the large-batch training, they are limited to specific model architectures (e.g., fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) with ReLU layers). To address these problems, we propose a novel gradient inversion attack to compromise privacy in large-batch FL via model poisoning. We poison clients&#39; models with malicious parameters, which are constructed purposely to mitigate the confusion of aggregated gradients. For FCNNs, the private data can be perfectly recovered by analyzing gradients of the first fully connected (FC) layer. For convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we extend our proposed method as a hybrid approach, consisting of the analytic method and the optimization-based method. We first recover the feature maps after the convolutional layers and then reconstruct private data by minimizing the loss of data-wise feature map matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on four datasets and show that it outperforms previous methods for large-batch FL (e.g., 64, 128, 256) and models with different activation layers (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid and Tanh).},

Firstly, a lemma about the variable separation technique is proposed and proved for dealing with nonlinear functions in stochastic time-delay systems, which avoids the restrictive growth assumption that nonlinear functions need to satisfy. Secondly, a reduced-order observer is devised to reconstruct partial unmeasured state variables in systems, which equilibrates the control behavior between output feedback and state feedback. Then, without imposing any constraints on the derivative of time-varying delay, a dynamic event-triggered controller based on the symbol function technique is constructed to reduce the waste of resources in data transmissions and improve the communication efficiency. Furthermore, in the light of the stability theory of stochastic systems and Lyapunov-Razumikhin lemma, it is proved that the designed control algorithm can ensure that the controlled system is globally asymptotically stable in probability .

However, these concepts have not been extended to Random Permutation Set (RPS) because of the difficulties in giving a suitable definition of containment relationships of permutations . In this paper, we addressed this issue by defining both ordered and unordered containment relationships . Based on the defined containment relationships, the corresponding belief function and commonality functions for RPS are derived naturally. Besides, the plausibility function for RPS is also proposed following the definition in D-S evidence theory. Furthermore, the transformations between them and permutation mass functions are discussed and implemented by matrix converters. Thanks to the properties of commonality functions, the combination process in RPS, including left and right orthogonal sum, are both implemented by matrix operations . Moreover, based on matrix operations , the reverse transformation of combination, that is, the decomposition of fusion results given one information source is achieved for the first time. Numerical examples are listed to illustrate the calculation process. The proposed matrix operations provide a way to implement and accelerate information transformations, combinations and decompositions.},

However, filling the missing information for views results in a loss of consistency, while fusion and reconstruction between views face over-fitting problems. The optimal transport algorithm delicately measures the distance of two distributions, resulting in decreased reconstruction errors and guaranteeing consistency and complementarity across multiple views of the data. In light of this, this paper proposes the incorporation of the optimal transport algorithm into the framework of incomplete multi-view clustering. The proposed consistent graph embedding network (CGEN-OT) via optimal transport combines the adversarial module and fusion module to learn a completed latent graph embedding. Specifically, CGEN-OT utilizes an adversarial module to generate complete views and fuses them into a consistent embedding, and introduces reconstruction loss and Sinkhorn loss to jointly optimize the proposed network and obtain superior latent graph embedding and clustering performance. To further validate the clustering accuracy and convergence of the CGEN-OT, experimental evaluation was conducted on six distinct incomplete datasets. A comparison with existing state-of-the-art models highlights the superiority of the proposed framework.},

The current model, although primarily intended for mixed noise reduction, can indeed be utilized with great efficacy on images that have been solely degraded by Gaussian noise .

  abstract     = {The study of complex-valued evidence theory has become an interesting topic, particularly in the context of information fusion techniques. These studies mainly focus on its geometric interpretation and application. Moreover, little work has been conducted with regard to conflict measure. Therefore, this paper defines a complex similarity measure which quantifies the degree of conflict among complex-valued mass functions by measuring the degree of consistency among complex-valued mass functions. It also satisfies some basic properties, such as non-negativity, symmetry and etc. Complex similarity measure is an extension of traditional similarity measure in complex space, which will collapse to a similarity measure of real space when complex-valued mass functions collapse to mass functions of real space. Furthermore, some numerical examples illustrate the rationality and effectiveness of complex similarity measure. By employing complex similarity measure, this paper proposes a method to combine information and reduce the time cost associated with complex-valued Dempster&#39;s rule of combination. Experimental results on datasets indicate that for some data sets (Take iris for example), the proposed method can not only reduce the time cost (75\%), but also improve the accuracy of fusion results (96\%).},

  abstract     = {With the widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, a large amount of private data has been generated. Due to the limited computing and storage resources of IoT devices, enterprises and individuals choose to use a cloud storage provider (CSP) to manage their data. However, they lose the actual control of the data, and hence users need to verify the integrity of the data in the cloud. As a result, reducing the computational overhead of integrity auditing tasks for massive amounts of data and optimizing the distribution of benefits among the participants have become the key to the healthy development of IoT technologies. This paper proposes an integrity auditing method based on smart contracts . First, we construct a noninteractive auditing model based on a chaotic system so that the third-party auditor (TPA) can complete the auditing task without challenging the CSP. Second, we proposed a new construction method for audit trees that can quickly generate the verification tag of the root node. Finally, we design a smart contract-based auditing algorithm on the blockchain, which can simultaneously verify the behaviour of the CSP and the TPA to achieve fair payments. The theoretical analysis shows that our scheme can effectively prevent the TPA from falsifying audit results and prevent collusion between the TPA and the CSP. The experimental results show that our scheme has higher audit efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Hypergraph generation has found wide applications in data analysis, social networks, and communication networks. Although various hypergraph generation methods have been proposed, many challenges remain. On the one hand, traditional hypergraph generation methods are time-consuming since they rely on computing various statistics about hypergraph distributions prior to generation. On the other hand, they store many intermediate variables in the process of hypergraph generation, thus depleting a large number of memory resources, which could lead to memory explosion. To address these issues, we present a novel deep generative model for hypergraph generation (DGMH), which consists of a node selection module and a hyperedge size decision module. In DGMH, each hyperedge is treated as an embedding in a high-dimensional space, where values along specific dimensions represent the probabilities of node inclusion in the hyperedge. The node selection module captures the distribution of hyperedge embeddings and identifies other latent hyperedge embeddings within the space. In addition, the hyperedge size decision module determines the hyperedge size based on the hyperedge embedding. We sample a certain number of nodes from the categorical distribution parameterized by the embedding and assign these nodes to the hyperedge, an essential step in hyperedge generation. Once a sufficient number of hyperedges are generated, they are connected through common nodes to form a complete hypergraph. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DGMH in capturing the structural distribution of hypergraphs in a short time while maintaining a modest memory footprint during the generation process.},

Transformer-based models are considered to have revolutionized the field of time series forecasting.

Furthermore, the complex temporal pattern of the time series leads to increased difficulty for the models in mining reliable temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Transformer with probabilistic decomposition representation, which provides a flexible framework for hierarchical and decomposable forecasts for time series. The hierarchical mechanism utilizes the forecasting results of the Transformer as conditional information for the generative model , performing sequence-level forecasts to approximate the ground truth, which can mitigate the cumulative error of the autoregressive Transformer. In addition, the conditional generative model encodes historical and predictive information into the latent space and reconstructs typical patterns from the latent space, including seasonality and trend terms . The process provides a flexible framework for the separation of complex patterns through the interaction of information in the latent space. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the model, indicating that it compares favorably with the state of the art.},

  abstract     = {Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) aims to classify samples from seen and unseen classes using class-level features. Although existing GZSL methods have achieved remarkable progress, GZSL assumes a closed-set scenario, where both the seen and unseen classes are pre-defined. This assumption does not satisfy the complexity and variability of real-world scenarios. To address this, a new paradigm called Open Zero-Shot Learning (OZSL) has emerged, which aims to identify seen and unseen classes while rejecting the unknown ones where no semantic and visual features are available. Due to the absence of semantic features for unknown classes, the conventional methods adopted in GZSL are no longer applicable. Our research discovered that dissimilarities within the semantic space could be transferred to the visual space, achieving a shared dissimilarity space. Building upon this idea, we propose an asymmetric Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture. The encoders compute the dissimilarities within features and learn the latent distribution of dissimilarities, while the decoders synthesize features for unseen and unknown classes conditioned on original features and dissimilarities. We evaluate the proposed method on benchmark datasets, including AWA, CUB, SUN, and FLO, and achieve state-of-the-art OZSL performance.},

  abstract     = {Optimal controls receive much attention owing to their remarkable performance for nonlinear systems . However, unknown time-delay disturbances in the optimal control process make it difficult to find high-quality optimal set points. To address this problem, a hybrid evolutionary robust optimization-based optimal control (HERO-OC) method is proposed to reduce the negative effect of time-delay disturbances and enhance the performance of optimal set points. First, a data-driven time-delay disturbance observer (DTDO), based on fuzzy neural networks , is designed to describe the time-delay disturbances of optimal objectives. Then, the expressions and intervals of time-delay disturbances can be estimated to improve the accuracy of optimal objectives. Second, a hybrid evolutionary robust optimization (HERO) algorithm, which combines an expectation robust optimization strategy with a min–max evolutionary robust optimization strategy, is proposed to solve optimal set points. Then, the average robustness and conservative of robustness optimal set points can be improved. Third, an adaptive time-delay controller using Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals is proposed to track optimal set points. Then, control accuracy is improved while ensuring control stability. Finally, the superior performance of HERO-OC is compared with some novel optimal control methods in a second-order nonlinear system and a wastewater treatment process .},

In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving online diagnosis scheme for e-healthcare system based on federated learning mechanism (FLM). Specifically, we first transform the data owner&#39;s data sharing problem into machine learning problem through using FLM. By sharing calculated local model parameters instead of actual data, the privacy of training data sets can be well protected. Then, we use a homomorphic cryptosystem and the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to classify patients&#39; physiological data efficiently without leaking their privacy. Furthermore, we design a novel approach to recover decision function of SVM model, which can efficiently prevent model parameters from leaking. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can protect data privacy under the defined threat models. Numerical results derived from experiments show that the proposed scheme is highly efficient. Therefore, our scheme is of practical significance in the e-healthcare system.},

However, most of the existing machine learning-based crime prediction methods have difficulty in simulate the spatiotemporal dependence of crime. In this study, we mitigate the spatiotemporal dependence embedded in crime data by introducing a spatiotemporal lag variable. To verify the feasibility of the proposed methods, four machine learning methods were used to determine whether considering spatiotemporal dependency could improve model prediction accuracy and explore the impact of various factors (i.e., environmental factors and demographical factors) on crime risk intensity in different locations using crime data collected from June 2014 to May 2018 in Dallas. The results indicated the following: (1) incorporating spatiotemporal lag variables can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of machine learning models; (2) variables predicting crime are highly nonlinear over time and space, and tree-based nonlinear models greatly outperform linear models in predicting crime; and (3) interpretable machine learning models can reveal the unique contribution of each variable to researchers and practitioners. These findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of crime occurrence and may guide the development of crime prevention strategies.},

  abstract     = {In a big data environment , data streams are sequences of dynamically changing data with unlimited length; they are often associated with concept drift, caused by data distribution transition. The uncertainty of data streams challenges the prediction ability of traditional static algorithms and hampers their practical application. Although many deep neural network models can be tailored to perform in an online manner, they are not suitable for non-stationary data streams that continually change over time. In this work, we propose a deep neural network model that can dynamically adjust to data distribution change by self-growth, that is, by changing its structure from narrow to wide and/or from shallow to deep. Specifically, initialized from a standard multilayer perceptron , the model grows by adding neurons according to a local error and adding layers according to the change in Jenson–Shannon divergence. The growth involves an adaptive memory mechanism, designed to avoid catastrophic forgetting, which may occur when hidden layers are added. In experiments, the proposed model achieved remarkable improvements in adaptability and prediction performance across 12 regression datasets (including non-stationary and stationary data streams), compared with the state-of-the-art dynamic neural network and other online approaches. The influence of the parameters, timeliness, convergence, and size of the pretrained model are explored in the paper.},

Existing methods for pruning inaccurate or out-of-domain information from knowledge graphs often rely on topological graph-pruning strategies. However, these approaches have two major drawbacks: they may discard logical structure and semantic information, and they allow multiple inheritance. To address these limitations, this study introduces KGPruning, which is a novel approach that can effectively clean and prune noisy knowledge graphs by guiding tasks with a given set of concepts and automatically generating a domain-specific taxonomy. Specifically, KGPruning employs a graph hierarchy inference method that is based on the Agony model to precisely identify and eliminate noisy entries while striving to preserve the underlying hierarchy of semantic relations as much as possible. Furthermore, to establish a tree-structured taxonomy, KGPruning integrates semantic relations and structural characteristics to effectively eliminate out-of-domain information and multiple inheritance. Through extensive experimental evaluations conducted on open benchmark datasets as well as large-scale real-world problems, the superior performance of KGPruning over state-of-the-art methods is demonstrated on the task of pruning noisy knowledge graphs.},

Specifically, we construct a high-dimensional continuous-time bipartite graph centered on target users and their historical sequences while preserving the interaction order. Subsequently, we create meta-path graphs through meta-path exploration. Additionally, to capture both effective high-dimensional collaborative signals and dynamic changes in users&#39; interests throughout the sequence, we design a High-Dimensional Information Collaboration Module within GNSR, which enables a comprehensive understanding of user behavior. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets and demonstrate that the performance of GNSR improves by approximately 0.1\% ∼ 3.2\% over selected baselines.},

To address this issue, researchers introduced the pinball SVM, which uses all the instances to determine the separating hyperplane and has a discontinuous piecewise linear loss function. A more recent variant, the linex loss SVM with NAG, employs a combination of linear and exponential loss functions, resulting in an asymmetric and continuous loss function. Due to the employment of Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG), the older linex SVM formulation was unstable. This study presents a novel noise-robust variant of linex SVM, termed linexSVM, which is stable in performance compared to the linex SVM with NAG. Additionally, the proposed linexSVM has fewer hyperparameters in the dual formulation than other noise-robust SVM variants, such as pinball SVM, ϵ -insensitive pinball SVM, and ϵ 1 , ϵ 2 ϵ1,ϵ2 pinball SVM. We evaluated the performance of the proposed linexSVM, hinge SVM, and pinball SVM using the UCI dataset repository. The experimental results indicate that the proposed linexSVM outperforms hinge and pinball loss SVMs on datasets with and without noise.},

  abstract     = {With the progressive technological advancement of autonomous vehicles, taxi service providers are expected to offer driverless taxi systems that alleviate traffic congestion and pollution. However, it is challenging to maintain the efficiency and reliability of a taxi service system due to the complexity of the traffic network and fluctuating traffic demand. In this paper, we present a robust variant of the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3), namely, adaptive TD3 integrated with robust optimization (ATD3-RO), to implement a fleet of autonomous vehicles for a taxi service under uncertain passenger demand. Our proposed method incorporates an adaptive module for integer-valued action generation, which also enhances the model&#39;s resilience to a larger action space. Considering the uncertain demand of passengers, we design a perturbation sampling-based method to generate adversarial examples for robust training. Additionally, we propose a robust optimization-based strategy to generate a lower bound and guide the convergence of the critic network during the model training process. In our case study, we validate the efficacy of ATD3-RO by constructing a reinforcement learning simulator of the driverless taxi transportation system using real taxi data. The simulation results demonstrate that ATD3-RO outperforms the general TD3 algorithm and other state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning-based approaches while improving learning efficiency. We assess the algorithm&#39;s robustness against sudden changes in requests, e.g., a surge in demand at some traffic nodes caused by an emergent event. The results suggest that ATD3-RO performs adaptive actions that are aligned with the variations in passenger demand. Finally, we prove that our model can provide a reliable dispatching strategy even at various ratios between driverless taxis and passenger demand.},

To address the deficiencies of existing anomaly detection techniques that are mainly suitable for certainty data, this study proposes an anomaly detection method based on fuzzy granules. This method uses the fuzzy information granulation model as a unified framework to gradually develop a fuzzy granular anomaly detection method for calculating the anomaly score of each sample. First, the fuzzy granular distance is defined by fusing single-attribute fuzzy granules to represent the dissimilarity between two samples. Second, a matrix is constructed using the fuzzy granular distance between the samples as the state transition matrix of the Markov random walk. Anomalies in the dataset are then detected using the stationary distribution generated by iterative calculations. Finally, the fuzzy granular anomaly score for each object is obtained by normalizing the stationary distribution. Experiments are conducted on public datasets to compare the proposed method with some state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method is effective.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are data hungry, and being trained directly for cardinality estimation of activity trajectory similarity queries usually leads to poor performance. To address this problem, we propose two enhancements to improve accuracy and reduce the training data size: query slice and data slice. Query slice divides a query trajectory into three slices based on similarity dimensions (i.e., spatial, temporal, and textual). Data slice organizes similar trajectories into data slices. Furthermore, we design a global-local model to determine which local models should be used for a given query. We also extend above model to support similarity joins. Experimental results show that our method efficiently learns to estimate the cardinality, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

By utilizing the barrier Lyapunov function , backstepping procedure and dynamic surface control technique, an event-triggered adaptive control scheme is proposed to ensure that the constrained states remain within their bounds, all system signals are bounded, tracking error converges to a bounded set containing the origin, and no Zeno behavior occurs.

Research on human activity recognition (HAR) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its growing demand in various application domains. As wearable sensor-aided devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) became more common, great attention has been paid to the HAR ubiquitous computing and mobile computing . To infer human activity data from a massive amount of multivariant data generated by different wearable devices , in this study an innovative deep learning–based model named HAR-DeepConvLG is proposed. It includes three convolution layers and a squeezing and excitation (SE) block, which are employed to precisely learn and extract the spatial representation data from the collected raw sensor data. The extracted features are used as input of three parallel paths, each of which includes a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer connected in sequence with a gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer to learn temporal representation. The three paths are connected in parallel to avoid the vanishing gradient problem. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, experiments were conducted on four widely utilized HAR datasets. Additionally, the model’s performance was compared to several state-of-the-art deep learning models, which further validated its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the proposed HAR-DeepConvLG model performs better than the existing HAR deep learning–based models, achieving a competitive classification accuracy .},

Thus, we develop a multi-step time series prediction model that relies on prediction correction to address this problem. First, we mitigate the problem of excessive accumulation error by constructing a sample set in combination with the prediction target. Second, we employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) model with memory function to make initial predictions. Finally, building on the concept of prediction correction, we develop a new prediction model that effectively rectifies the initial prediction results. Remarkably, the model efficiently safeguards against deviations during prediction tasks. Additionally, our proposed model integrates a clustering algorithm during the data processing phase, which introduces a rule for sample selection. This rule ensures the inclusion of diverse types of data to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model.

  abstract     = {In recent decades, sustainable investing has caught on with investors, and it has now become the norm. In the age of start-ups, with scant information on the sustainability aspects of an asset, it becomes harder to pursue sustainable investing. To this end, this paper proposes a sustainable financial portfolio selection approach in an intuitionistic fuzzy framework. We present a comprehensive three-stage methodology in which the assets under consideration are ethically screened in Stage-I. Stage-II is concerned with calculating the sustainability scores, based on various social, environmental, and economic (SEE) criteria and an evaluation of the return and risk of the ethical assets. Intuitionistic fuzzy set theory is used to gauge the linguistic assessment of the assets on several SEE criteria from multiple decision-makers. A novel intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making technique is applied to calculate the sustainability score of each asset. Finally, in Stage-III, an intuitionistic fuzzy multi-objective financial portfolio selection model is developed with maximization of the satisfaction degrees of the sustainability score, return, and risk of the portfolio, subject to several constraints. The ϵ -constraint method is used to solve this model, which yields various efficient, sustainable financial portfolios. Subsequently, investors can choose the portfolio best suited to their preferences from this pool of efficient, sustainable financial portfolios. A detailed empirical illustration and a comparison with existing works are given to substantiate and validate the proposed approach.},

Unfortunately, the asymptotic variance depends on the underlying distribution and differs from one symmetric distribution to another one. A possible way out is to estimate this asymptotic variance from the sample by means of the bootstrap . In this paper, we explore this approach for six different skewness coefficients existing in the literature. Extensive experiments are performed for comparing the performance of the six associated tests of symmetry to that of two state-of-the-art symmetry tests in terms of preservation of the significance level under several symmetric distributions, power under asymmetric distributions and robustness in the presence of outliers.

Realistic service composition applications operate in uncertain environments where QoS values may change dynamically. Moreover, user requirements on QoS attributes should be considered, and their different nature can make it difficult to express them by adopting relative weights. Reinforcement Learning is proposed as a viable approach in order to deal with the complexity and variability of the environment. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates traditional reinforcement learning with a norm-based paradigm to consider cases where component services may have a different number and types of QoS attributes. In such a way, it is possible to consider additional local requirements that may hold only for specific service components still pursuing a global optimization. Norms allow using a uniform formalism to express qualitative and quantitative as well as hard and soft user requirements. The approach has been tested on a real dataset of 2500 web services showing its performance, scalability, and adaptability properties.},

While several techniques have been proposed to detect change points by identifying whether there is a significant difference between the target network and successive previous networks, they neglect the natural evolution of the network. In practice, real-world graphs such as social networks, traffic networks, and rating networks are constantly evolving over time. Considering this problem, we treat the problem as a prediction task and propose a novel CPD method for dynamic graphs via a latent evolution model. Our method focuses on learning the low-dimensional representations of networks and capturing the evolving patterns of these learned latent representations simultaneously. After the evolving patterns are learned, a prediction of the target network can be achieved. Then, we can detect the change points by comparing the prediction and the actual network by leveraging a trade-off strategy, which balances the importance between the prediction network and the normal graph pattern extracted from previous networks. Intensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our model is up to 12\% better than the baseline methods in terms of the average detection accuracy.},

In particular, we define the utility calculation principle of attack behaviors and regard it as the benchmark for evaluating defensive capabilities.

  abstract     = {In existing deep clustering methods, as the model gets deeper, extracted representations can be deteriorated due to a vanishing gradient, leading to reduced performance. Also, existing deep clustering frameworks may distort the hidden space without true labels by learning from unreliable estimated pseudo-labels. Therefore, the model learns non-discriminative features from the early epochs, which results in worse estimated pseudo-labels. Moreover, in these models, it is assumed that all learned representations in the bottleneck layer have equal significance throughout the clustering procedure. To address the shortcomings, this paper introduces RDEIC-LFW-DSS, a ResNet-based deep embedded clustering framework. The advantage of residual connection is that it enables the user to add residual connections for increased model capacity without incurring the cost of degradation for unsupervised feature learning compared to standard autoencoders. Furthermore, an efficient local feature weighting mechanism is used to weight each cluster&#39;s representations correctly. In addition, we introduce a mechanism in which suitable samples with highly reliable estimated labels are selected to train the deep clustering framework. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches confirm the high performance of RDEIC-LFW-DSS. The implementation- source code- of RDEIC-LFW-DSS is made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Amin-Golzari-Oskouei/RDEIC-LFW-DSS .},

  abstract     = {During product inspection, Type I and Type II errors, widely considered to assess product quality, are represented by erroneously rejecting non-defective products and erroneously accepting defective products, respectively. Meanwhile, the formulation of product inspection strategy is oftentimes deemed as an interdependent process influenced by multiple factors (e.g., production technology and customer demand) from both upstream (e.g., production process) and downstream (e.g., customer zone). Due to the limited understanding and knowledge of decision-makers on imprecise parameters of these factors, it is challenging for decision-makers to formulate an appropriate product inspection strategy. To address the aforementioned challenges, an improved three-way decision (3WD), known as robust possibilistic programming (RPP)-based 3WD is put forth. Such an improvement for 3WD is evident in two aspects (1) the RPP model endows 3WD to address imprecise parameters and chance constraints using flexible attitudes, and (2) the RPP model ensures the formulation of the product inspection strategy of 3WD is robust. Additionally, with the aid of 3WD, an intermediate/uncertain decision, is introduced to simultaneously reduce the aforementioned two types of errors. A case study of a semiconductor manufacturing system, along with discussions and two comparative studies, is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of this approach. As shown in this study, the proposed approach (1) effectively prevents decision-makers from making an over-conservative attitude in the formulation of the product inspection strategy, (2) has better performance in satisfying customer demand, and (3) has significant advantages in terms of cost and computational time.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world networks, such as social networks, contain structural heterogeneity and experience temporal evolution . However, while there has been growing literature on network representation learning , only a few have addressed the need to learn representations for dynamic heterogeneous networks. The objective of our work in this paper is to introduce DyHNet , which learns representations for such networks and distinguishes itself from the state-of-the-art by systematically capturing (1) local node semantics, (2) global network semantics and (3) longer-range temporal associations between network snapshots when learning network representations . Through experiments on four real-world datasets from different domains, namely IMDB with 4 , 178 4,178 movies, AMiner with 10 , 674 10,674 papers, Yelp with 2 , 693 2,693 businesses, and DBLP with 14 , 376 14,376 papers, we demonstrate that our proposed method is able to show consistently better and more robust performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques on link prediction and node classification tasks. More specifically, we are superior to the best baseline in the temporal link prediction task by approximately 13\% and 15\% on F1-score for the IMDB and AMiner datasets, respectively. Further, in the node classification task, our findings illustrate that the Micro F1 scores of our proposed model increase by 13\% and 17\% compared to the runner-up model on the Yelp and DBLP datasets, respectively. 1},

In this paper, we propose High-Order Paired-ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling) Network to exploit high-order statistics from various feature levels. The network first introduces a High-Order Representation module to extract the contextual high-order information from all stages of the backbone. They can provide more semantic clues and discriminative information than the first-order ones. Besides, a Paired-ASPP module is proposed to embed high-order statistics of the early stages into the last stage. It can further preserve the boundary-related and spatial context in the low-level features for final prediction. Our experiments show that the high-order semantics significantly boost the performance on confusing objects. Our method achieves competitive performance without bells and whistles on three benchmarks, i.e., Cityscapes, ADE20K and Pascal-Context.},

Existing models mainly focus on encoding global contexts of events using techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or self-attention mechanisms. However, local event contexts also play an important role in the occurrences of events, which has been largely ignored. Popular convolutional neural networks , which are designated for local context capturing, have never been applied to TPP modelling due to their incapability of modelling in continuous time. In this work, we propose a novel TPP modelling approach that combines local and global contexts by integrating a continuous-time convolutional event encoder with an RNN. The presented framework is flexible and scalable to handle large datasets with long sequences and complex latent patterns. The experimental result shows that the proposed model improves the performance of probabilistic sequential modelling and the accuracy of event prediction. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that applies convolutional neural networks to TPP modelling.},

  abstract     = {The extraction of spatial-temporal features is a crucial research in transportation studies, and current studies typically use a unified temporal modeling mechanism and fixed spatial graph for this purpose. However, the fixed spatial graph restricts the extraction of spatial features for similar but not directly connected nodes, while the unified temporal modeling mechanism overlooks the heterogeneity of temporal variation of different nodes. To address these challenges, a multi-view fusion neural network (MVFN) approach is proposed. In this approach, spatial local features are extracted through the use of a graph convolutional network (GCN), and spatial global features are extracted using a cosine re-weighting linear attention mechanism (CLA). The GCN and CLA are combined to create a graph-cosine module (GCM) for the extraction of overall spatial features . Additionally, the multi-channel separable temporal convolutional network (MSTCN) makes use of a multi-channel temporal convolutional network (MTCN) at each layer to extract unified temporal features, and a separable temporal convolutional network (STCN) to extract independent temporal features. Finally, the spatial-temporal feature data is input into the prediction layer to obtain the final result. The model has been validated on two traffic demand datasets and achieved the best prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been widely used to solve various practical engineering problems, but it has shortcomings such as premature convergence and poor global search ability. To solve these problems, evolutionary-state-driven multi-swarm cooperation particle swarm optimization (ESD-PSO) is proposed, using an adaptive multi-swarm cooperation mechanism (AMC) to improve the information exchange efficiency among all sub-swarms. In AMC, the population is randomly divided into multiple equal sub-swarms, and the best particle of a sub-swarm is used to evaluate its evolutionary state. When the number of stagnant sub-swarms reaches a threshold, all sub-swarms are adaptively regrouped. In addition, if a sub-swarm is stagnant for a long time without reaching the regroup condition, a stagnation compensation strategy (SCS) is triggered to enhance the stagnant sub-swarm diversity. In this case, a compensation sample is generated to help the stagnant sub-swarm to again search for promising regions. A competitive disturbance mechanism (CDM) is used to increase the solution accuracy. The performance of ESD-PSO is evaluated on the CEC2013 and CEC2017 test suites, and three engineering optimization problems . Experimental results show that ESD-PSO outperforms compared PSO variants.},

By employing three sets of neural networks (NNs), a data-based goal representation heuristic dynamic programming algorithm with the concurrent learning technique is offered to achieve the near-optimal control objective without model requirement. Specifically, by introducing the relaxed barrier function into the cost function, a barrier-based control strategy is proposed to generate the repulsive control force when the state moves to the constraint boundary. Subsequently, the recorded historical data is adequately leveraged to build a new weight updating rule, and persistent excitation of weight parameter estimation is hence removed. Furthermore, the Lyapunov method is utilized to demonstrate that the weights estimation errors of NNs are bounded. Finally, numerical simulation and power system examples are employed to demonstrate the validity of the control strategy.},

Analytical studies of these models are often complex and difficult. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop a suitable and comprehensive technique to solve these models analytically. In this paper, an explicit analytical technique for solving two-dimensional incommensurate linear fuzzy systems of fractional Caputo differential equations (FLSoCFDEs) considering generalized Hukuhara differentiability ( gH -differentiability) is presented and demonstrated. This extracted explicit solution is presented for different classes of such systems, including homogeneous and non-homogeneous cases with commensurate and incommensurate fractional orders . Moreover, the potential solution of FLSoCFDEs in terms of the Mittag-Leffler function involving double series is presented. The originality of the proposed technique is that the fuzzy Cauchy problem is transformed into a system of fuzzy linear Volterra integral equations of second kind and then the solution is extracted using the iterative Picard scheme based on the Banach fixed point theorem . Moreover, several interesting results are derived from FLSoCFDEs in terms of the Mittage-Leffler function for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases. To understand the proposed technique, we solve a diffusion process problem (a biological model) and several mass-spring systems as applications. Their graphs are analyzed to illustrate and support the theoretical results.},

To enhance the fault tolerance of attribute reduction algorithms, this study introduces a new model based on variable precision rough sets, comprising of three parameters: the inclusion of fault tolerance in the comparison of attribute values between two objects, the partition of information granules, and the calculation of upper and lower approximation operators. As a result, the model tolerates errors, enhances the fault-tolerance ability of information granules, and improves its inclusivity. Using this new model, we design a novel algorithm that deletes both redundant and noise attributes to improve the classification accuracy .

  abstract     = {The most widely used multi-view clustering approaches can be classified into different groups: Subspace multi-view clustering algorithms, multi-view kernel approaches, matrix factorization approaches, and spectral clustering algorithms. Most approaches rely on combining predefined individual similarity matrices from multiple views, and then estimate the common similarity matrix. Therefore, their performance can be severely affected by noisy original similarity matrices . Moreover, most of these methods integrate different spectral projection matrices of each view together, which can also affect the clustering results . To address these shortcomings, we propose a single-phase multiview clustering method with Consensus Graph Learning and Spectral Representation (MCGLSR) in this paper. Instead of directly integrating the similarity matrices of the different views, which could introduce noise, our proposed method jointly generates similarity graphs of the views and their common similarity matrix (graph matrix) using a unified global objective function. At this stage, the similarity matrices of the different views are enforced to be sufficiently similar, which eliminates the problem of noise and promotes a clearer unified data structure . Moreover, our proposed objective function is able to recover the common spectral projection and soft cluster assignments based on the common graph structure. The proposed method takes as input a kernelized representation of the views features and directly provides the individual graphs, the common graph, the common spectral representation, and the cluster assignments. Our technique allows us to obtain the final cluster assignments without requiring an external clustering algorithm . Several real-world datasets are used to evaluate our technique and demonstrate its efficacy. The code of the proposed method will be available at the following link: https://github.com/SallyHajjar/MCGLSR.git .},

  abstract     = {To support accurate personalized online intelligent education applications in the big data environment , computable online learner modeling is very important. It can accurately capture the unique needs and characteristics of learners in a computable way and provides customized learning experiences . We propose a structured semantic embedding-based approach for online learner modeling, which considers both the multidimensional learners&#39; characteristics and heterogeneous information on the learning context to develop a comprehensive learner model. Specifically, an AI-enabled heterogeneous information network embedding technique is employed to encode complications of different learners&#39; characteristics and rich relationships between them, which integrate different explicit characteristic information and implicit association information about inherent multidimensional interactions for computable learners modeling. Extensive experimental results and evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the optimal performance on the P r e c i s i o n @ N Precision@N and R e c a l l @ N Recall@N metrics in course recommendation tasks, and the A c c u r a c y Accuracy and F − s c o r e F−score metrics in learner clustering tasks are also better than other baseline models , which prove the ability to boost the performance of downstream tasks by incorporating and capturing the underlying semantic and structural information among different types of nodes to fuse the embedding for learner modeling.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) always involves a large number of heterogeneous clients (both in statistic and resource heterogeneity) when collaboratively training a model, leading to a compromise in the model performance. Recent research has focused on customizing FL frameworks to address the issues. However, compared to models trained on independent and identically distributed (IID) data, these methods still face performance degradation in non-IID scenarios. Moreover, resource consumption is also somewhat expensive. In this work, we present an efficient FL framework named FedRich to tackle the statistic and resource heterogeneity. The key idea of FedRich is adaptive segmentation of the model and heuristic scheduling of the active clients. Adaptive segmentation enables resource-dependent customization of the model, which is conducive to clients with varying resource budgets to conduct local training. The heuristic scheduling strategy appropriately selects clients to participate in federated training, mitigating statistical heterogeneity. Moreover, FedRich incorporates a hierarchical aggregation mechanism to stably aggregate heterogeneous models of different sophistication. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedRich outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous FL approaches.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) aim to locate multiple global optima simultaneously, which requires a high diversity of solutions. As a diversity preservation strategy customized for evolutionary algorithms (EAs), niching has been extensively incorporated into many algorithms to deal with MMOPs. However, many existing niching techniques require pre-defined parameters to control the size or number of niches, making the algorithm sensitive to parameters. Taking individuals as nodes, the inverse distance of two individuals as edges, and the historical information of recent generations as node attributes, we can construct a population as a network, whose purpose is to divide niches through community detection without relying on sensitive parameters. Inspired by this idea, this paper proposes a network community-based differential evolution for multimodal optimization problems (NetCDE MMOPs ). In NetCDE MMOPs , three strategies are proposed and work together. Firstly, the community detection-based niching (CDN) strategy constructs the population as an attribute network and automatically divides it into multiple niches without sensitive parameters. Secondly, the community elites-based updating (CEU) strategy allocates more evolutionary resources to elite individuals of communities, then predicts and updates these elites based on historical information. Finally, the poor individual remolding (PIR) strategy remolds the last-ranking individuals and guides them toward promising positions. After extensive experimentation with the widely adopted CEC&#39;2013 test suit, the experimental results reveal the superiority of NetCDE MMOPs over many successful or recent algorithms for MMOPs.},

Its popularity recently led to seminal works that proposed activating the dropout layers only during inference for evaluating epistemic uncertainty . This approach, which we call dropout injection , provides clear benefits over its traditional counterpart (which we call embedded dropout) since it allows one to obtain a post hoc uncertainty measure for any existing network previously trained without dropout, avoiding an additional, time-consuming training process. Unfortunately, no previous work thoroughly analyzed injected dropout and compared it with embedded dropout; therefore, we provide a first comprehensive investigation, focusing on regression problems . We show that the effectiveness of dropout injection strongly relies on a suitable scaling of the corresponding uncertainty measure, and propose an alternative method to implement it. We also considered the trade-off between negative log-likelihood and calibration error as a function of the scale factor. Experimental results on benchmark data sets from several regression tasks , including crowd counting, support our claim that dropout injection can effectively behave as a competitive post hoc alternative to embedded dropout.},

Most existing detection models often ignore event correlations, which is not applicable to multi-event detection at the document level. In the real world, it is a common phenomenon that the probability of correlated events occurring simultaneously is much greater than the probability of uncorrelated events occurring simultaneously. Based on this observation, we propose an event correlation-based document-level event detection model (EventCo-ED) to capture the document-level association between events. Specifically, EventCo-ED first constructs a novel event relation graph (ERG) to capture the correlation between events and uses this correlation to extract the topic features of a document. Secondly, DMBERT is employed to get sentence-level contextual representation as the local features. Finally, a gated feature fusion module is used to aggregate topic features and local features, and a correlation suppression module is used to increase the probability that related events are detected simultaneously and suppress the probability that unrelated events are detected simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed model can simultaneously improve the precision and recall of multi-event detection and achieve 1.56\% and 3.63\% F1 improvements on the LEVEN and MAVEN corpuses, respectively.},

Existing methods, employed independently as images/patches or jointly as tubelets, have, up to this point, typically focused on spatial or spatiotemporal inconsistencies. However, the evolving nature of deepfakes demands a holistic approach. Inspection of a given multimedia sample with the intent to validate its authenticity, without adding significant computational overhead has, to date, not been fully explored in the literature. In addition, no work has been done on the impact of different inconsistency dimensions in a single framework. This paper tackles the deepfake detection problem holistically. HolisticDFD, a novel, transformer-based, deepfake detection method which is both lightweight and compact, intelligently combines embeddings from the spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal dimensions to separate deepfakes from bonafide videos. The proposed framework achieves 0.926 AUC on the DFDC dataset using just 3\% of the parameters used by state-of-the-art detectors. An evaluation against other datasets shows the efficacy of the proposed framework, and an ablation study shows that the performance of the system gradually improves as embeddings with different data representations are combined.

Then, the q -ROF Choquet-based group consistency index ( q -ROFCGCI) and the q -ROF Choquet-based group inconsistency index ( q -ROFCGII) are defined. Next, to derive optimal 2-additive fuzzy measures on the criteria set and optimal experts&#39; weights, a new multi-objective q -ROF mathematical programming model is established by minimizing the q -ROFCGII and maximizing the q -ROFCGCI. Subsequently, an algorithm based on the adaptive non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (A-NSGA-III) is designed to solve the established model. Afterwards, the Choquet-based overall relative closeness degrees of the alternatives are used to obtain their preferred ordering.

  abstract     = {Multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) issues are gaining significant traction in the realm of social economy development. Given that individuals commonly rely on linguistic terms to express their opinions and often overlook psychological behaviors when making risky decisions, this study introduces a three-way decision (TWD) method via incorporating prospect theory (PT) and probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) to address MADM problems, namely the PL-PT-TWD method. Initially, it is worth noting that the majority of distance formulas fail to fulfill the four axioms associated with distance formulas . Consequently, to address the shortcomings of existing distance formulas for PLTSs, a novel distance formula is introduced as a remedy in this study. By considering the correlation between the distance formula and the similarity formula, it becomes feasible to calculate the similarity between two PLTSs. Thus, based on this similarity measure, the θ j θj -level similarity class can be established, facilitating the objective construction of conditional probabilities . Second, it is common for most methods to solely focus on assigning weights to one-dimensional attributes without taking practical considerations into account. As a result, the weights assigned to different alternatives within the same method may vary, this paper explores the weight calculation from two dimensions and successfully obtains the attribute-alternative weight. Subsequently, a novel satisfaction function is formulated to address the limitation of reference point selections in PT, enabling the realization of PT in TWD for decision-making purposes. Lastly, the proposed method is employed to a specific data set and compared with six counterparts to assess its practicality and efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in deep neural networks especially GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) have resulted in the creation of more realistic deepfake media. This technology can swap the source person&#39;s face or alter facial expressions in an image or video; Media manipulated in such a way is termed deepfake. This type of manipulated media poses potential risks to journalism, politics, court proceedings and various social aspects . While existing approaches concentrate on the use of deep neural networks to directly extract facial artefacts for deepfake detection, they do not examine subtle inconsistencies in/across frame/frames. Moreover, state-of-the-art deepfake detection networks appear more complex and tend to overfit on specific artefacts which limits their generalizability on unseen data. This paper proposed a novel technique that tackles the problem of manipulated face detection in videos and images by exploiting the noise pattern inconsistency amongst face region and rest of the frame. To enable a comparison between the noise patterns of these two regions, we propose a two-stream Siamese-like network called SiamNet. This network can extract the noise patterns of the face region and patch through separate streams without increasing the number of parameters, thereby enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness. Each branch consists of pretrained Inception-v3 architecture for camera noise extraction. Siamese training is utilized to compare both noise patterns computed through different base models. The proposed two-branch network, SiamNet is found efficient for several large-scale deepfake datasets such as FF++, Celeb-DF, DFD and DFDC achieving accuracy rates of 99.7\%, 98.3\%, 96.08\% and 89.2\% respectively. Furthermore, the proposed technique exhibits greater generalizability and outperforms state-of-the-art of deepfake detection methods. Performance of the proposed model is also evaluated on FaceForensics benchmark dataset against different approaches.},

  abstract     = {The distribution characteristic of populations is one of the main characteristics of population. The pattern of distribution characteristics determines the probability law of individual values. At the same time, the initialization of the population lays a foundation for the iterative process of the swarm intelligence optimization algorithm . To reveal the influence of population distribution characteristics on the swarm intelligence optimization algorithm , this paper proposes a variety of search strategies based on the populations with different distribution characteristics and analyzes the influence of population distribution characteristics on optimization process by comparing the test results of the optimization algorithm after implementing these strategies. First, a new population generator is designed that can transform the same initial population into a population with uniform and central peaking distributions. On this basis, the two kinds of populations are applied to the global and local search stages of the optimization process, and four different search strategies are formed. Among them, the global and local search strategies based on a uniformly distributed population are the traditional methods. Finally, the performance of the optimization algorithm using different search strategies is evaluated through 29 test problems from the CEC2017 benchmark for 10, 30, 50 and 100 dimensions. In addition, the algorithms are applied to solve the TSP problem. For CEC2017 in 100D, only 13 of the 29 test functions achieve the best optimization effect by using the traditional method, while the other 16 test functions achieve better search results by using the other three search strategies. The analysis shows that the population distribution characteristics have a great influence on the population optimization algorithm. The performance of the algorithm with different population distribution combination strategies is statistically superior to the traditional algorithm with a uniform distribution population, as revealed in the test functions ranging from 38.7\% to 62.9\% for different dimensions. By reconstructing populations with different distribution characteristics, the overall efficiency of the swarm intelligence optimization algorithm can be greatly improved.},

  abstract     = {The application of three-way decision models in solving multi-criteria ranking problems has been widely recognized and noticed by researchers in recent years. However, most types of three-way decision models will not be directly usable when there are individual criterion minimum requirements set by decision-maker in a multi-criteria problem. For this problem, a two-stage three-way ranking pattern oriented to criterion fuzzy concept has been proposed. But, when many objects are directly identified as accepted or rejected, using this ranking pattern, there will be some objects for which the ranking results cannot be achieved. In view of this, considering criterion fuzzy concept and three-way decision, a three-stage ranking pattern is proposed to provide a more realistic and reliable ranking in a multi-criteria environment. Firstly, a new risk-loss function is defined according to the level of risk involved in decision behavior. Then, the decision thresholds are calculated. Secondly, a fuzzy description of an object is obtained using a maximum- k -means clustering algorithm . A feasible way to calculate the conditional probability value of an object is provided by this means. Finally, a new three-way ranking rule is constructed and a feasible three-stage ranking pattern is derived. Meanwhile, the feasibility of the new ranking pattern is analyzed by a computer hardware selection problem and the definition of two ranking indices. In addition, according to the experimental results on several data sets, the ranking indices between the three-stage ranking pattern and some existing ranking patterns are mostly higher than 0.8. The effectiveness of three-stage ranking pattern in solving different types of decision problems is provided by this experiment results. Also, the advantages of the three-stage ranking pattern are demonstrated based on the qualitative analysis between several ranking patterns.},

  abstract     = {We revisit score combinations for outlier detection ensembles (ODEs). Different detectors&#39; scores vary in ranges and scales. Normalization transforms these into a common range. We assert that ODE score combinations may remain biased despite normalization. Determining a suitable normalization for an outlier model is challenging, which captures original score statistics apt for different parameters across different datasets. Thus, treating higher normalized scores of one detector as superior outlying probabilities to other detectors may be inappropriate. With differences between top rankers&#39; scores, detectors with higher normalized scores dominate during combination. This limits the effective utilization of diversity, undesired for ensembles. We propose a framework FairComb for providing unbiased combination treatment to outputs of all detectors. It stands for combination fairness in ODEs. We define combination parity, which quantifies differences between detectors&#39; participation in ensemble results. Higher combination parity indicates higher combination unfairness. This fairness work differs from others, which aim for fair treatment of protected data groups. The proposed FairComb checks for significant score variations across an ensemble. A reduction approach is used to mitigate these variations. We use a baseline approach WtSR to prove that addressing this issue promotes fairer combinations. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FairComb.},

  abstract     = {Searchable encryption (SE) meets users&#39; demand for the keyword search on encrypted data . Key-aggregate searchable encryption (KASE) improves data owners&#39; ability to selectively share encrypted data with users. In KASE, the data owner encrypts different documents/document classes with distinct keys and can share any selected subset of documents by simply transmitting an aggregate key to the user. The user only uploads an aggregate trapdoor to the server for querying these shared documents. However, the existing KASE schemes have some limitations: the security definition is incomplete, only single-keyword search is supported, and the provable security scheme relies on the random oracle model . For these reasons, in this paper, we propose the Key-Aggregate Searchable Encryption supporting Conjunctive Queries (KASE-CQ) framework and its two security models: indistinguishability against selective-document chosen keyword attack and existential unforgeability against selective-document chosen keyword attack. These models reflect the indistinguishability of ciphertext and the unforgeability of the aggregate key, respectively. Our system supports flexible data sharing and the conjunctive keyword search on encrypted data. Furthermore, we design a concrete KASE-CQ construction, which can be proven secure in the standard model. We also demonstrate that our construction is secure against the insider trapdoor attack presented by Zhou et al. [40] . Finally, performance analysis and comparisons with Cui et al.&#39;s scheme [10] illustrate the superior efficiency of our scheme.},

  abstract     = {Domain generalization aims to generalize knowledge learned from multi-domains sources to a target domain whose statistical distribution is unknown. The mainstream approach to domain generalization involves learning domain-invariant features by aligning them across the domain distribution. However, these methods usually neglect the causal relationship between the instances and class labels; thus, the domain generalization model may learn the features that are not causally related to the label predictions and lead to potential misclassification . To address this problem, we propose a deep discriminative causal domain generalization (DDCDG), which can effectively learn causal feature representations. Specifically, we first imitate various possible intervention styles by applying an enriched data augmentation technique while preserving causal features relevant to the prediction task. We then designed a new regularization term for causal feature disentanglement, aiming to separate the causal and non-causal features. Additionally, we introduce centre alignment to approximate the representations of cross-domain homogeneous objects and enhance their discriminative ability. Extensive cross-domain visual recognition experiments were conducted, and the results show that our method can achieve a significant improvement in classification accuracy when compared with existing state-of-the-art methods on the Domainbed benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning approaches have enabled increasingly powerful time series classifiers. While performance has improved drastically, the resulting classifiers generally suffer from poor explainability , limiting their applicability in critical areas. Saliency-based methods designed to highlight the critical features are one of the most promising approaches to improving this explainability. Here, current techniques commonly rely on artificially perturbing the features, using, for example, random noise or ‘zeroing’ these features. We first demonstrate that an important drawback of these methods is that the perturbations used can result in unrealistic assessments of the classifier, since the perturbations force the data outside their original distribution. We articulate how this can result in poor identification of critical features, and hence misleading explanations. In order to address this issue and identify the most important features for the output of a black-box model, we propose a dual approach through meaningful perturbation and optimisation. First, leveraging a mechanism originally proposed in image analysis, a generative model is trained to create within-distribution perturbations of the input. These are then used to reliably evaluate whether a set of features is critical. Second, a greedy-based segmentation and identification strategy is proposed to search for the smallest set of critical features. Experiments show that the proposed approach addresses the out-of-distribution problem and identifies fewer critical features than existing methods. In combination, both aspects of the proposed approach offer a qualitative advance towards generating meaningful and robust explanations in the context of time series classification.},

In fact, with the popularity and diversity of information network types , most of users may participate in multiple information networks for many purposes. Thank to tremendous grow in the number of information networks recently, data analysis in information network has become a major challenge in multiple scientific disciplines. Anchor link prediction, also known as network alignment, which is aimed to match the users between different networks who have the same identification, is one of the emerging research directions in this domain. However, recent anchor link prediction baselines still lack the capability of sufficiently preserving global graph-structured features of individual information networks to obtain better prediction results. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel model to align users between information networks using a seed set of known anchor links. To achieve better representations of individual networks in our proposed model, four embedding techniques are combined and learnt from the same latent space. We then apply the aggregation method to achieve a final network aligned embedding matrix which is later utilized to deal with the anchor link prediction problem. We run comprehensive experiments in real-life network alignment datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and compare them with the up-to-date baseline methods .},

  abstract     = {N-ary relation extraction models are required to be trained on large amount of high-quality data, but it is challenging to obtain such data in effect; thus, models are forced to rely on a limited amount of low-quality labeled data. This paper proposes an active learning method for cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction, addressing the following question: “How can we train an n-ary relation extraction model incrementally without a large amount of high-quality data?” To answer this research question, we introduce a schema-aware sampling strategy that selects informative samples in unlabeled dataset that will be used for model training. This method exploits structural relatedness between a relation and its entities to generate the context embeddings of inferred relations. Using the similarity between the clusters of context embeddings and target samples, we detect a set of informative samples in unlabeled dataset. Moreover, the paper proposes a balanced incremental learning method updating the extraction model without bias with only a small computational cost at each training iteration. Experimental results on benchmark datasets are demonstrated to confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Shrinkage methods reduce the search space of a Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) by progressively discarding candidates, which accelerates the search speed. However, their shrinkage strategy suffers from the vulnerability of too fine task granularity . In other words, they drop only one of the least promising candidates per round of shrinkage, which is suboptimal in terms of performance and efficiency. In this study, we introduce the concept of Granular Computing (GrC) into the shrinkage method and present a Fast Progressive Differentiable Architecture Search (FP-DARTS) method. This method effectively reduces the computational complexity of each round of shrinkage, thereby improving the efficiency and performance of the algorithm. FP-DARTS can be divided into three stages: adaptive granularity division and selection, granular-channel performance evaluation, and progressive shrinkage. In the first stage, to reorganize the task granularity, we cluster the candidate operations into granular-channels and adaptively select the appropriate task granularity. We also propose a dynamic clustering strategy to avoid introducing additional computation. In the second stage, we train the architecture parameters to measure the potential of the granular-channels. In the third stage, to improve the stability of the shrinkage results, we introduce a channel annealing mechanism to smoothly discard unpromising granular-channels. We conducted systematic experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and achieved a test accuracy of 97.56\% on CIFAR-10 with 0.04 GPU-days, and a test accuracy of 75.5\% on ImageNet with 1.2 GPU-days. We also conducted experiments on the search space of NAS-Bench-201, and obtained test accuracies of 94.22, 73.07, and 46.23\% for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet16-120, respectively. The above experimental results demonstrate that FP-DARTS achieves higher search speed and competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art shrinkage methods and non-shrinkage methods.},

In particular, the frame-level dependent relationships and inherent RD relationship are explored. As such, the rate dependency, distortion dependency and inherent RD characteristics are fully utilized in the global rate distortion optimization (RDO) process, and the quantization parameter (QP) for each frame could be adaptively solved. To facilitate the adaptive QP calculation, a two-pass coding strategy is proposed. In the first-pass coding, the video statistics are sufficiently collected with the proposed Dual Motion Compensation and Residual Coding (DMCRC) method to generate the parameters for the content-aware models. During the second-pass coding, the optimal QP at the frame level is obtained by optimizing the global RD performance with the dependent and inherent models. The proposed algorithm is implemented on VVC test model (VTM-4.0) and achieves significant performance gain for test sequences with constant and varying scenes.},

Specifically, the four kinds of rough sets can be considered as special lattice-valued rough sets. Secondly, based on a completely distributive lattice L , we provide representations of the upper and lower L -fuzzy rough approximation operators by using four kinds of cut sets of an L -fuzzy set and an L -fuzzy relation, which generalizes the existing results in the case that L = [ 0 , 1 ] L=[0,1] .

  abstract     = {Widespread fake news on social media threatens public security and the cyber environment, making fake news detection an essential area of study. The majority of existing fake news detection methods rely on news content (e.g., text and images) and/or social contexts (e.g., comment interactions between posts) to determine the veracity of news. However, existing methods still have the following drawbacks: (1) Overreliance on sufficient reliable labeled data. (2) Lack of robustness to noise and fraudster-designed harmful disguises. (3) Inability to differentiate between the multiple intentions behind retweet and comment behaviors, resulting in generating entangled representations. To address the above aforementioned three issues, we introduce contrastive learning and disentangled representation learning for fake news detection. Specifically, to mine supervised signals from unlabeled data and improve the model&#39;s robustness, we design a hierarchical contrastive learning framework that includes multiple data augmentation strategies and three contrastive learning tasks. In addition, to infer the latent intentions of retweets and comments between posts, we propose the disentangled graph encoder (Disen-GraphEnc) and disentangled sequence encoder (Disen-SeqEnc). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model over other state-of-the-art methods and is resistant to limited training data and noise attacks.

Black box refers to the inability to explain why the model turns the input into the output, which may be problematic in some fields. To overcome this problem, our approach provides a comprehensive combination of predictive and explainability techniques. Firstly, we compared statistical regression, classic machine learning and deep learning models, reaching the conclusion that models based on deep learning exhibit greater accuracy. Of the great variety of deep learning models, the best predictive model in spatio-temporal traffic datasets was found to be the Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network . Regarding the explainability technique, GraphMask shows a notably higher fidelity metric than other methods. The integration of both techniques was tested by means of experimental results, concluding that our approach improves deep learning model accuracy, making such models more transparent and interpretable. It allows us to discard up to 95\% of the nodes used, facilitating an analysis of its behavior and thus improving the understanding of the model.},

We then formulate the minimum CVaR-based uncovered area coverage (CVaR-UAC) problem and provide some theoretical guarantees for the problem. Unlike previous research that treats area coverage as a single problem, we propose an efficient particle swarm optimization (PSO) with evolutionary multitasking to solve the stochastic area coverage problem along with multiple simplified problem forms. These simplified problems act as the auxiliary tasks for the original CVaR-UAC to enhance the evolutionary search. We have improved the proposed PSO algorithm from the framework of disturbance PSO and virtual force directed co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization , using a hybrid method in population initialization and an adaptive perturbation in individual updating. As a result, the exploration ability of the algorithm is significantly enhanced.

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been widely used for solving computationally expensive optimization problems. However, the performance of SAEAs deteriorates drastically for high-dimensional problems since the accuracy of surrogates may decrease to an insupportably low level in high dimensions which profoundly affect subsequent evolution optimization. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes an adaptive multi-surrogate and module-based optimization algorithm named AMSMO. Unlike existing algorithms that adopt sole surrogate models , AMSMO develops a real-time autoselection of kernels approach for building the most promising RBF . AMSMO makes use of five modules to promote the optimization quality, including: a. global search module; b. local search module; c. semi-local search module; d. convergence module; e. restart module. Specifically, we provide a novel distance- and objective-value-based criterion for global search. The semi-local search module applies a dynamic search criterion that makes the algorithm explore at the early search stage and exploit at the final stage. A cluster-based restart criterion is proposed to address the stagnation of optimization. Several benchmark functions with dimensions varying from 30 to 100 and computationally intensive practical simulation–optimization problems are adopted to validate the proposed algorithm. The empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in most cases.},

This framework addresses both aspects of the three-dimensional knowledge implicated in the satisfaction, abstinence, and dissatisfaction inherent in human decision-making. It is an innovative approach to the problem of introducing computer cognition and decision-making in uncertain settings into the real world. The T -SFHSS is superior at determining what to do with unclear or imprecise data. The T -SFHSS enhances fuzzy sets such as the “intuitionistic fuzzy hypersoft set” and the “Pythagorean fuzzy hypersoft set”. It aims to increase the precision of fuzzy set calculations. To aggregate the decision data most effectively, we propose some novel Sugeno-Weber t-norm and t-conorm-based operational rules for T -SFHS numbers ( T -SFHSNs). We then propose some T -SFHS aggregation operators with desirable properties in light of these operational laws. We conduct an illustrative study on natural agribusiness to demonstrate the viability and utility of the present methodology. The correctness of the obtained results can be verified by contrasting the proposed SW aggregation operators (AOs) on T -SFSS with the approaches already in use.

Existing researches attempted to approach this goal by manually labeling data or writing simple rules without considering the human&#39;s inherent ability to estimate uncertainty. These approaches cannot take full advantage of human abilities and hence make the overall system inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel approach INFER that can distill knowledge from humans in the form of rules with uncertainty. Firstly, we propose a new paradigm of providing human intelligence by expressing human knowledge as uncertain rules. After obtaining the set of rules, we design a rule aggregation model and a classification model , these two models are jointly trained in a knowledge distillation framework with the uncertainty knowledge. We further improve the distillation process with a curriculum learning-based training method. Through these, we can directly extract knowledge from inaccurate human knowledge. Empirical results on four different tasks demonstrate our proposed INFER approach can significantly improve model performance. Furthermore, the proposed uncertainty can provide more information and be effective in refining rules.},

This random variable is made up of the spikes fired by the previous-layer binomial neuron upon crossing a randomly generated threshold. Depending on how long the neuron waits to aggregate the spikes and find the expectation, different model variants can be created. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the reliability of this new neuron. The results confirm the increase in the robustness/accuracy under adversarial attacks, or equivalently, the substantial increase in the amount of distortion attackers need to add to images in order to create successful adversarial samples. These distortions pass the perceptibility range to the extent that approach total image destruction.},

  abstract     = {The diffusion models in the influence maximization problem are a trending topic in many companies&#39; viral marketing to raise their business promotion. The majority of existing diffusion models have focused only on trust relationships, and a few models have considered distrust relationships. Nevertheless, the latter models lack appropriate theoretical support to cover social influences resulting from different user-relationship types and still do not provide proper predictions. In this study, a fuzzy-based approach is first introduced to model the influence propagation for different user-relationship types. Then, four novel fuzzy sign-aware diffusion models named FSC-SB, FSC-N, FST-SB, and FST-N are proposed by the introduced fuzzy-based approach in two categories: cascade and threshold-based models. In the proposed models, the user-relationship type is determined by a fuzzy expert system in which a natural multi-trust level relationship is applied instead of a commonly used crisp relationship. Moreover, new rules and equations are defined to determine a user&#39;s state by information received from its active neighbors. The performance of proposed models was compared with some state-of-the-art models conducted by two real-world networks, Bitcoin OTC and Bitcoin Alpha. The experimental results showed that the proposed models enhance the prediction accuracy and make effective decisions in viral marketing.},

In order to accomplish this goal, this paper investigated the original idea of bipolar complex picture fuzzy soft set (BCPFSS), which combination of two distinct theories known as the bipolar complex picture fuzzy set (BCPFS) and the soft set (SS). The capabilities of this new model are to achieve a larger range with the aid of the membership degree (MD), non-membership (NMD), and abstinence degree (AD) with complex integers. The BCPFSS represented two different degrees, known as positive degrees examine positive aspects of the problem and negative degrees examine negative aspects of the problem. Moreover, human–computer interaction (HCI) is an effective human–computer interface that presents a realistic world. HCI is a field that recognizes the significant role of educational applications and platforms in visualizing content, providing students with easy access to education in their homes, and paving the way for the development of alternative and advanced methods for implementing the concept of e-learning. With the technological advancements of HCI, it has become a fundamental tool in every area of activity, revolutionizing work environments and expanding their scope. In order to resolve the challenge of analyzing complex and unreliable data in real-world contexts, we proposed the idea of bipolar complex picture fuzzy soft sets (BCPFSSs). The innovative concept of BCPFSS defines many operations such as complement, extended intersection, and restricted intersection. The idea of BCPFSSs possesses a broad structure as they explore all values of MD, AD, and NMD with both positive (+ve) and negative (−ve) perspectives, making them adept at handling multivariable challenges. In this paper, modeling approaches based on BCPFSSs are proposed for choosing the HCI for effective implementation by formulating and analyzing score functions. Finally, a comparative analysis section illuminates a comprehensive and organized comparison of recent works to the earlier work.},

The Borda rule and Copeland rule are common ranking methods in group decision-making. This paper demonstrates that the ranked outputs of these two methods are unreasonable and cannot accurately reflect the inner structure of the ranked inputs in some cases. In order to objectively quantify the difference between two rankings, the concept of the relative inverse number (RIN) is proposed. Then a ranking rule, also called the voting rule, based on RIN is proposed. The RIN rule analyzes the structure of the ranked inputs more comprehensively than the Borda rule and the Copeland rule, and the output of the RIN rule is more precise in the sense that the alternative with more votes from the individuals is always ranked ahead in the RIN rule while may be ranked behind in other rules. However, the complexity of the RIN rule increases exponentially with the number of alternatives. Fortunately, combined with the Borda rule or other existing ranking rules, a fast solution algorithm to search the RIN rule output has been designed. In the applications of the RIN rule in science and technology evaluation, computational complexity is reduced by 10 5 to 10 21 times utilizing the proposed algorithm.},

In FSFC, a style flat matrix (SFM) is designed to project samples onto appropriate flats while maintaining the styles of different clusters in a reasonable manner. Based on SFM, the core of FSFC is to learn the potentially intersecting manifold structures of clusters in the projected flat space to make samples with the same style close to the cluster center and simultaneously far away from the other cluster centers. Furthermore, the objective function of FSFC can provide scale flexibility for each flat in the projected flat space. In particular, the optimization problem of FSFC can be decomposed into a series of sub-problems about the flat parameters, which can be locally optimized using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the competitive clustering performance of FSFC. Moreover, FSFC outperforms some state-of-the-art manifold clustering algorithms on six case studies about stylistic data.},

  abstract     = {Air pollution is one of the most common health-threatening factors, potentially causing millions of deaths every year. Static stations typically collect air pollution data by utilizing a small number of costly and high-quality sensors and numerous low-cost micro stations. However, data collected from micro stations usually suffers from large noise and thus calibration would be necessary for operating good air pollution governance. Point-to-point models and sequence-to-point models have the potential limitations of either failing to mine latent patterns embedded in historical time series or ignoring spatial dependency within a certain region. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called Spatio-Temporal Calibration Model (STCM) based on dual encoders. STCM consists of long-term encoder, short-term encoder, and decoder modules. The long-term encoder encodes historical reference data via GRU and extracts the trend, periodicity, and adjacency of the target pollutant through a temporal attention mechanism . The short-term encoder then reflects real-time conditions through a spatial attention mechanism , quantifying dynamic station-wise correlations between micro stations and the static station. The decoder ultimately integrates outputs of dual encoders and generates calibration results of all micro stations. STCM has been experimentally justified by comparing against nine baseline methods based on two real-world datasets.},

In this paper, we study the credibility-guaranteed multimedia application data offloading problem in MEC systems. Each IoT device competes for the limited transmission resources while ensuring that the credibility requirement is satisfied. We formulate the credible offloading problem with the goal of maximizing Quality of Experience (QoE) for resource-constrained devices. Each IoT device focuses on maximizing its own QoE. The constraints include credibility constraint and resource constraint. We reformulate the problem as a credibility-guaranteed multimedia data offloading game (CMDO-Game). It is proved that for any IoT device, there is an upper bound of communication interference. Based on this property, we further theoretically prove that there is at least one Nash equilibrium offloading strategy in the CMDO-Game. We propose a game-based credible data offloading (GCDO) method to obtain the Nash equilibrium offloading strategy in a distributed way. Finally, the proposed GCDO method is compared with various approximation methods, and a series of experimental results are given.},

In order to improve the filtering performance, a buffer-aided strategy is used to store the historical measurement data which is sent to the filter via a shared communication channel at each transmission instant. The main objective of this paper is to design a quadratic filter to estimate the states of the considered non-Gaussian stochastic systems by using the buffer-aided strategy. Specifically, an augmented system is constructed by combining the original system states and their second-order Kronecker powers. As such, the considered quadratic filtering problem amounts to the Kalman filtering problem for the augmented system . The filtering error covariance (FEC) conditioned on the transmission intervals is firstly derived recursively and then is minimized by choosing the suitable filtering gains. Moreover, sufficient conditions are deduced to guarantee the boundedness of both the FEC and the conditional FEC. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filtering method.},

This paper proposes a transformer-based three-layer hierarchical architecture that incorporates multi-scale spatiotemporal aggregation for dynamic facial expression recognition. The hierarchical structure consists of bottom-to-top layers, each comprising transformer encoders with local self-attention mechanisms. These encoders gradually expand their receptive fields through hierarchical spatiotemporal aggregation, enabling the modeling of spatiotemporal context dependencies among facial regions at different scales and across consecutive frames. Consequently, the bottom-to-top layers correspond to learning the fine-grained, coarse-grained, and global facial representations. To evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on four public datasets. The comparison results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art, with accuracies of 79.09\%, 62.19\%, 64.85\%, and 59.79\% on the RML, eNTERFACE&#39;05, RAVDESS, and AFEW datasets, respectively.

Spurred by this advantage, we propose a many-objective evolutionary algorithm with estimating the Convexity-Concavity of PFs and Clustering, named MaOEA-3C. Specifically, the convexity-concavity of PF is estimated according to a well-converged and well-distributed elitist archive that is updated periodically using non-dominated sorting and a niche-based method. Then, the solution fitness is computed according to the estimation result, enhancing the selection pressure and promoting the convergence when the Pareto dominance fails to select solutions. Additionally, the solutions in the elitist archive guide evolving directions for the current population by clustering, acting like reference vectors in decomposition-based algorithms, thus maintaining the diversity of solutions. The performance of MaOEA-3C is compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of MaOEA-3C on many-objective optimization problems .},

  abstract     = {Maximal subgraph mining is increasingly important in various domains, including bioinformatics, genomics, and chemistry, as it helps identify common characteristics among a set of graphs and enables their classification into different categories. Existing approaches for identifying maximal subgraphs typically rely on traversing a graph lattice . However, in practice, these approaches are limited to relatively small subgraphs due to the exponential growth of the search space and the NP-completeness of the underlying subgraph isomorphism test. In this work, we propose SCAMA , an approach that addresses these limitations by adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy for efficient mining of maximal subgraphs. Our approach involves initially partitioning a graph database into equivalence classes using bootstrapped backbones, which are tree-shaped frequent subgraphs. We then introduce a learning process based on a novel graph convolutional network (GCN) to extract maximal backbones for each equivalence class. A critical insight of our approach is that by estimating each maximal backbone directly in the embedding space, we can avoid the exponential traversal of the graph lattice . From the extracted maximal backbones, we construct the maximal frequent subgraphs. Furthermore, we outline how SCAMA can be extended to perform top- k largest frequent subgraph mining and how the discovered patterns facilitate graph classification. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SCAMA in identifying almost perfectly maximal frequent subgraphs, while exhibiting approximately 10 times faster performance compared to the best baseline technique.},

In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Trust Inference (DTI) approach to improve data collection quality for MCS, mainly including the following components: (a) A trust evaluation method is proposed to obtain trust baselines of different levels, which can be used to assess the trust of workers. In addition, a data filling scheme on the basis of Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (BPMF) is adopted to fill data when there is no credible baseline in the region. (b) Based on the DTI approach, we propose a worker recruitment method according to the priority of trust and bid ratio. Then, by preferentially selecting reliable and low-bid workers, we can improve data quality and reduce costs. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Multi-output prediction based on small samples (SSs) produced in industrial processing plays an important role in improving processing efficiency and reducing production costs. However, insufficient sample capacity will result in inaccurate and unstable multi-output regression prediction. To solve this problem, this paper jointly optimizes an artificial neural network (ANN) by employing an adaptive dynamic genetic algorithm and adaptive moment estimation (ADGA-AM-ANN) based on enhanced SSs. The data are enhanced by adding noise to the output data to prevent overfitting due to insufficient sample capacity. The adaptive dynamic genetic algorithm is employed to grope for the optimal parameters of the ANN in the global range. This prevents the ANN from falling into a local minimum in the training process, so as to improve the overall accuracy of the model in simultaneously predicting multiple variables, and to promote its internal prediction stability. Adaptive moment estimation is employed to optimize the gradient of optimal parameters to accelerate convergence and deepen the external prediction stability of the model. The cases of cutting and laser processes are used to verify the accuracy and stability of the proposed method.},

However, there is a nonnegligible gap between the results of automatic baseline determination and the consensus of experts. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for baseline determination. First, potential accelerations/decelerations are recognized from the fetal heart rate and excluded by an ensemble multiattention U-Net. Then, the reference baseline and reliable interval are calculated via long- and short-term filters. Based on the filters, unreliable points for estimating the baseline are removed, and the final baseline is determined. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on a public and a private database. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method yields better performance (the root mean square difference between baselines (BL. RMSD), F-measures for acceleration and deceleration (Acc/Dec. F-measures), the synthetic inconsistency coefficient (SI), and the morphological analysis discordance index (MADI) are 2.84 bpm, 0.80, 0.77, 48.9\% and 3.94\%, respectively) on the public database. The proposed method performs optimally in all metrics on the private database (BL. RMSD, Acc/Dec. F-measures, SI, and MADI are 1.75 bpm, 0.88, 0.80, 43.5\%, and 3.11\%, respectively).

This paper presents a novel approach to address these challenges. Firstly, a set of transformation rules is proposed to convert heterogeneous judgments expressed by individuals into a homogeneous preference form. These judgments can be classified from two aspects: direct or indirect assessments, and fuzzy set or linguistic term set schemes. Subsequently, a group clustering method is introduced to classify individuals into subgroups, considering both of their preferences and social relations. The clustering method incorporates the measures of opinion divergence among individuals within the group and social network analysis techniques comprehensively. Finally, an adaptive two-stage group consensus measurement and adjustment method is proposed. The first stage employs a centralized mechanism within each subgroup, aiming to achieve intra-subgroup consensus. The second stage employs a democratic mechanism among different subgroups, focusing on inter-subgroup consensus. The effectiveness and rationality of the proposed method are demonstrated through an illustrative example and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods. The findings highlight the usefulness of the proposed method in addressing real-world decision-making problems within large-scale group contexts.},

  abstract     = {In the era of big data, data explosion has brought challenges to cloud storage management. To improve cloud storage efficiency and save network communication bandwidth , cloud data deduplication has emerged as a research hotspot, especially in the field of encrypted cloud data storage. How to enhance the security of encrypted data deduplication by resisting various attacks on deduplication has become an important research issue. However, existing solutions suffer from security flaws and are vulnerable to a series of attacks, e.g., duplicate faking attacks, file ownership spoofing attacks , and file tampering attacks. Besides, dynamic data operation is rarely considered or audited. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel scheme, named SecDedup, to enhance the security of encrypted cloud data deduplication with dynamic auditing. SecDedup applies a homomorphic authenticator and designs a multi-functional data tag with optimized storage to support deduplication and auditing at the same time with security guarantee against various attacks as mentioned above. In particular, We embed multi-set hash functions into data tags to achieve dynamic data auditing. In addition, SecDedup supports batch auditing with optimized computational cost for multiple deduplication auditing tasks. We formally prove the correctness and security of SecDedup, showing that it can successfully achieve our design goals for resisting the above listed attacks. We also analyze and evaluate the performance of SecDedup in terms of computation, communication, and tag storage overheads by comparing them with existing works. The results show its effectiveness and scalability.},

Moreover, refined FTTC performance with event-triggered communications can be achieved by skillfully invoking fractional-order calculus. Furthermore, interval type-2 fuzzy neural networks with fractional-order adaptive modulation factors are constructed to compensate for the unknown nonlinearities. Lyapunov stability analysis has revealed that all attitudes can synchronously track their references.

Based on the above scenarios, an exact discrete-time model approach is developed for stabilizing networked T-S fuzzy systems. First, the considered system with the observer-based control scheme is transformed into its discrete-time model such that subsequent analysis will be carried out in the discrete-time domain. On this basis, stability criteria are derived by fully considering the probability distribution of consecutive packet losses .

In this paper, we uncover two neglected problems behind current feature-level attacks and propose an ingenious Salient Feature Variance Attack (SFVA). Concretely, we first apply a Combined Feature Enhancement Transformation (CFET) on the copies of clean images to estimate the optimal feature weight. Then we construct an efficient objective based on the variance of salient features and adopt a classical attack MI-FGSM (MI) to add adversarial noises to the clean image along the direction of gradients. Moreover, we also make it possible to combine the ensemble strategy with feature-level attacks. Abundant experiments on the ImageNet dataset forcefully confirm the superiority of SFVA, which has become a state-of-the-art feature-level attack. Furthermore, we also evaluate the robustness of the practical online model with SFVA, where the 90\% attack success rate reveals a worrying fact that the real-world deployed models are subject to serious security threats.},

  abstract     = {Several distinctive Pareto Sets (PSs) with an identical Pareto Front (PF) and local PSs with acceptable quality are comprised in multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs). Recently, many multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMEAs) have been proposed. However, even though most of MMEAs have the ability to discover equivalent global PSs, these methods encounter failures in developing local PSs. The main reasons are that local PSs are dominated by global PSs and are removed from the population during the evolutionary process. To tackle this matter, a two-stage adaptive differential evolution with a dynamic dual-populations strategy, termed TADE_DDS, is developed. In TADE_DDS, a dynamic population strategy is put forward to divide the population into a global population that locates equivalent global PSs and a local population that aims to locate local PSs. Subsequently, the whole procedure is completed by two evolutionary stages associated with a dynamic population strategy, and an adaptive differential evolution algorithm is adopted for both global and local populations. The first-stage evolution aims to find more favorable local PSs and the second-stage evolution concentrates on finding a variety of global PSs. Additionally, a local environmental selection and a global environmental selection are performed for developing the diversity of local PSs and improving the convergence of global PSs and local PSs, respectively. TADE_DDS and several popular MMEAs are implemented on standard test problems. Experimental results demonstrate that TADE_DDS is equipped to locate both global and local PSs, and is superior to its competing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The increasing use of neural networks for solving complex tasks has emphasized the need to optimize their performance. In recent years, the development of neural networks has enabled them to tackle increasingly challenging problems for applications in various fields. Existing methods, such as L1 and L2 penalty terms, improve the neural network performance by reducing the neurons&#39; weight and removing some neurons&#39; output. However, these algorithms reduce the number of active neurons and the theoretical maximum capacity of the neural network. A loss function penalty term can improve the network performance by guiding the gradient descent direction of neurons during the training process. Moreover, it does not need to alter the network structure, increase the data, or change the training process. In this study, a novel algorithm is proposed to improve the performance of the network by adding a new loss function penalty term. The algorithm proposed in this study enhances the accuracy and anti-interference capabilities of neural networks by increasing the number of active neurons based on the finding that identical neurons extract identical features from the data, while distinct neurons extract unique features. The neurons are treated as hyperspace points and the distance between them is converted into repulsive forces to increase the distance between these points. To verify the validity of the proposed algorithm, we tested it on image classification datasets (CIFAR-100 and CALTECH-256), text datasets (SST-2 and THUCNews), and an image detection dataset (PASCAL VOC). The results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the network performance for a variety of neural network structures, data types , and task types. This algorithm has demonstrated its effectiveness in robustness against data noise and compatibility with pre-trained models such as Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and RetinaNet.},

  abstract     = {Dimensionality reduction is considered in many learning methods using discriminative features to obtain optimal performance. In general, feature extraction and feature selection are two independent methods that cherry-pick the informative features in the mapping data space or original feature space. Fuzzy rough set theory is widely used in feature selection, which well keeps the interpretability of features. How to comprehensively consider the intrinsic information contained in features and combine the feature extraction with feature selection is a challenging and meaningful task. Most existing fuzzy rough-based feature selection methods select features from the whole feature set. However, some nonsignificant features may lead to a decline in useful information. Meanwhile, these existing methods directly remove redundant and irrelevant features. This study scrutinizes features to distinguish the significant degree of features and deal with them in different ways. The feature selection and feature extraction methods are combined to obtain compound features for the learning method. A feature set partition-based approach to fuzzy rough dimensionality reduction (FSPFRdr) by simultaneously considering feature selection and fuzzy similarity relation-based supervised locally linear embedding (FRSLLE) is proposed. First, the ϑ -fuzzy rough set model is defined to avoid the affection of noise, and approximation space is constructed based on fuzzy approximations and granular structure. The normalized independent classification information (NICI) is defined in the approximation space. According to NICI, the original feature set is divided into a nonsignificant feature set, a weak significant feature set, and a significant feature set. Then, the nonsignificant feature set is deleted before dimensionality reduction. Next, the proposed FRSLLE is applied to a weak significant feature set, and the embedded feature set is obtained. Furthermore, a feature evaluation function is proposed to select features from the significant and embedded feature sets. Finally, the performance of FSPFRdr is compared with thirteen dimensionality reduction algorithms on twenty-three public datasets. Experimental results on four different classifiers show that FSPFRdr has higher classification performance.},

  abstract     = {Reversible data hiding continues to attract significant attention in recent years. In particular, an increasing number of authors focus on the higher significant bit (HSB) plane of an image which can yield more redundant space. On the other hand, the lower significant bit planes are often ignored for embedding in existing schemes due to their harm to the embedding rate . This paper proposes an efficient reversible data hiding scheme via a double-peak two-layer embedding (DTLE) strategy with prediction error expansion . The higher six-bit planes of the image are assigned as the HSB plane, and double prediction error peaks are applied in either embedding layer. This makes fuller use of the redundancy space of images compared with the one error peak strategy. Moreover, we carry out the median-edge detector pre-processing for complex images to reduce the size of the auxiliary information. A series of experimental results show that our DTLE approach makes better performance on the scenarios of high capacity embedding and achieves up to 83\% higher embedding rate on real-world datasets, BOSSbase, BOWS2 and UCID, than the state-of-the-art approaches while guaranteeing better image quality.},

Then, an approximation of injected false data is implemented based on an adaptive neural network (NN) in the presence of FDIA.

The decision maker is offered visual evaluation options that enable better identification and definition of the attribution of actions that in a single analysis would be positioned on the border between categories, in addition to which, by aggregating multiple simultaneous evaluations, a single recommendation is offered in a more robust way, even in a fuzzy environment. To demonstrate the results, an application of the new method is presented in the context of distributing resources to support criminal investigations, the results of which were compared with those obtained with the FlowSort and F-FlowSort methods.

Inspired by the fact that gene sequencing can discover biological gene defects, this paper proposes a dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on gene sequencing and gene editing (GSGE). The gene sequencing algorithm is designed using support vector machine (SVM), and correlation coefficient , as the result of sequencing, has also been verified. Combining stratified sampling and multi-population strategy, a prediction strategy that can use all chromosome information is designed. The new gene editing strategy edits individual genes to optimize the Pareto optimal front (PF) distribution, for the first time different types of genes can match different optimization strategies , which greatly improves the distribution of the population without affecting the convergence. The comparison experiment between GSGE and the state of the art algorithms is performed on 25 test functions and the Pareto optimal set (PS) curves obtained by dimension reduction fully demonstrate the significant advantages of GSGE.},

In reality, not only can users upload data to the cloud, but more often they are inclined to download data from the cloud. Unfortunately, data stored on the cloud is not always trustworthy, and downloading Trojan or virus data can bring bad experiences to users. In certain cloud computing scenarios, with the aim of preventing data loss, both the original data and the corresponding data copies are stored. Consequently, the huge amounts of stored data copies result in large storage overhead to the cloud. In order to tackle all of the above problems, an efficient identity-based multi-copy data sharing auditing scheme with decentralized trust management is presented in this paper. In our scheme, the group manager detects shared data and generates short signatures for the data that can pass detection successfully before it is stored on the cloud. Further, the group manager calculates the trust value for users and enhances the management of user behavior according to it. Through adopting data merging, the total amount of data copies and the overhead of users and cloud are reduced in our scheme. In terms of security, our scheme can resist forgery attacks launched by three different adversaries. At last, we prove that our scheme is secure and practical through security and performance analysis, respectively.},

In response, this paper proposes a cooperative coevolutionary competition swarm optimizer with perturbation (CPCSO) that reduces computational resource consumption. The CPCSO is both simple and effective. Specifically, this optimizer divides the swarm into two sub-swarms, denoted N P 1 NP1 and N P 2 NP2 . A modified CSO algorithm is used in N P 1 NP1 to facilitate search space exploration while ensuring that the swarm is well diversified. In N P 2 NP2 , perturbation is introduced to each loser particle to guide it along a smooth granular trajectory, thereby avoiding unnecessary oscillations and improving its capacity to exploit the search space. The two sub-swarms exchange information to balance convergence and distribution, with excellent particles shared between them. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed CPCSO algorithm and several state-of-the-art high-dimensional multi-objective optimizers on the high-dimensional benchmark set LSMOP. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed CPCSO outperforms other algorithms regarding solution quality, convergence speed, and computational cost.

We devise optimization approaches for identifying community structures with local (global) social welfare maximizing under two varieties of CAESC models: The local CAESC model first identifies the non-cooperative behaviors by calculating the structure-preference coordination coefficients between pairwise decision makers, then employs the Logit response like dynamics process in a carefully defined potential game to find the optimal community structure that maximizes the local social welfare. To find the optimal community structure that maximizes the global social welfare, the global CAESC model is composed of three coupled phases during each stage: (i) opinion evolution within each community using the classic Jacobi method ; (ii) structure-preference coordination matrix updating based on the current opinion vector; and (iii) local optimal community structure updating based on the local CAESC model. Extensive experiments on both randomly generated and real-world social networks with synthetic and real-world preferences confirm that neglecting the empathetic effect and community structure usually yields sub-optimal group decisions which degrade the social welfare of network members. Our experiments also show that, the higher societal empathy, the rougher preference distribution and the denser network structure will facilitate the maximal social welfare reaching in both local and global CAESC models; meanwhile, by comparing with the typical empathetic decision making models and some recent proposed consensus reaching methods, our proposed approaches show relatively significant advantages in terms of candidate ranking and decision efficiency.},

Existing works all suffer from poor accuracy and slow start, due to the lack of valid information for Ground Truth Data (GTD) and workers. These problems make the MCS system vulnerable to fraudulent attacks by malicious gangs, causing the Estimated Truth Data (ETD) to deviate significantly from GTD. In this paper, we propose a Deep Learning based Fast Truth Inference mechanism, called DLFTI, to achieve fast trust computing and accurate truth discovery in MCS. First, we introduce the Degrees-Of-Trust (DOT) to characterize the sensing ability of workers and establish worker profiles based on DOT to recognize workers’ trustworthiness dynamically. Then, we abandon the unrealistic assumption of priori GTD in previous studies and instead utilize the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), recognized trustworthy workers and the Deep Matrix Factorization (DMF) method to construct three-level GTD and three-level ETD, which are used for fast trust computing of workers and accurate truth discovery of tasks respectively. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations on a real-world dataset to corroborate the significant performance of DLFTI.},

A completely general and data driven technique is proposed, which integrates dimensional and statistical analysis with the help of genetic programming supported symbolic regression and neural computing. The methodology exploits the potential of various machine-learning techniques and allows extracting mathematical models in terms of dimensionless quantities directly from the dimensional databases available.

  abstract     = {Given a temporal network that is composed of a stream of events that evolves continuously over time, like social posts on Reddit, how can we spot interesting events like anomalous posts? In general, it is critical to learn useful information from event time, attributes, and network structure, which means that the anomalous post can be detected by over-frequent posts, impolite comments, and incorrect choices of subreddits. In this paper, we propose a new learning objective, named Continuous-time Graph Directed Information Maximization (CGDIM), to learn informative node presentations for temporal networks. The proposed CGDIM is based on the popular mutual information maximization (InfoMax) method to learn node features that are shared across temporal neighborhoods. Specifically, to capture the time causal relations among edges with continuous time, we utilize directed information rather than mutual information as the measure. The designed learning objective is to maximize the directed information with the direction from the inputs of temporal neighborhoods to the node representations. By setting a source variable that only contains useful information on each node, we prove that directed information is more effective than mutual information for preserving information of the source variables. To show the effectiveness of the CGDIM, we train several popular backbone models for temporal network representation with the CGDIM and test the performance on temporal node/edge classification. Experiment results on four real-world temporal network datasets show that the proposed CGDIM can improve the Average-Precision scores of the backbone models by 3\%-8\%.},

Generally, static optimization is fast but suffers from low attack performance, and the dynamic adversary improves the attacking quality but is time-consuming. To address these challenges, a Generation-based Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (GP 2 SO) is proposed for the adversarial text attack. Specifically, the GP 2 SO employs an adaptive strategy to determine the word modification priority, which produces a high attack performance owing to the aggressive objective function. To achieve time efficiency, we parallelize the PSO on multiple pipelines in a generation-overlapping manner. Extensive experiments on four public text recognition datasets are conducted by attacking four deep models to evaluate the effectiveness of the GP 2 SO. Experimental results manifest that the proposed GP 2 SO averagely improves the time efficiency by 272\% with only 0.3\% success rate reduction compared to the PSO. Besides, the GP 2 SO also shows superiorities in adversarial training and transferability compared with baselines.

  abstract     = {The interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values (IVIFVs) have been widely employed for multiattribute group decision making (MAGDM). However, the existing decision making method using IVIFVs has some drawbacks. The recognition degree and information utilization suffer from a gap in the evaluation of alternatives. Therefore, the need for a reliable and effective decision method is obvious. In this paper, a novel score function considering both the angle and fuzzy information of IVIFVs is proposed, which ensures the effective fusion of the fuzzy information measure and angle measure and overcomes the shortcomings of the existing methods. Then, the weights of decision makers (DMs) are set as IVIFVs and subjective values are determined by the optimization model to ensure the objectivity and authenticity of the weights of DMs. Furthermore, a novel MAGDM method based on the proposed score function is proposed. Finally, the proposed method is implemented on the regional innovation resource allocation efficiency evaluation. The results show that our method possesses a higher recognition degree than the other methods, and it ensures relatively high ranking accuracy. The ideology and results of this research will help the DMs to evaluate the alternatives effectively.},

  abstract     = {At present, the TLS cryptographic protocol is widely deployed. While protecting the security and integrity of transmitted information, it also makes the detection of malicious behavior more difficult. In recent years, researchers have proposed many encrypted malicious traffic detection methods. However, the existing approaches have some shortcomings. Firstly, although researchers have extracted multi-view features from different aspects, which can be divided into vectorized features based on feature engineering and image features based on original data, existing methods cannot fully integrate the features of different forms of expression. Secondly, most of the existing methods do not fully analyze the correlation between different encrypted traffic. Thirdly, the existing methods based on correlation analysis have low processing efficiency and cannot be applied to real networks. In the paper, we present MalDiscovery , a novel technique to discover encrypted malicious traffic to address all the above issues. For encrypted malicious traffic, MalDiscovery constructs an attribute KNN graph, in which encrypted sessions are used as nodes to construct a KNN graph according to the similarity of image features , and vectorized features are used as attributes of corresponding nodes. After that, the GraphSAGE model is used to collect relevant node information through correlation analysis to enrich the embeddings of each node. Finally, we achieve the accurate binary classification of nodes in the graph based on richer embeddings. We use extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method, and the experiment results show that MalDiscovery can achieve an accuracy of about 99.9\%, significantly outperforming all compared methods.},

  abstract     = {Key Performance Indicator (KPI) clustering plays an important role in Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) when the number of KPIs is large. This approach can effectively reduce the overhead by dividing KPIs into several classes, then applying the same anomaly detection or prediction model to all KPIs in a class. However, KPI sampling strategies vary depending on the environment in question, which leads to the production of irregular KPIs. Few existing works have considered the clustering of KPIs with irregular sampling . Matrix factorization (MF) is widely applied in low-rank data recovery and can be used to align and fill irregular KPIs. However, the clustering performance after recovering and filling by MF remains unknown. These two problems interact with each other and should therefore be solved together. Accordingly, we formulate the joint MF and clustering problem for irregular KPIs and design an iterative clustering scheme based on MF. This iterative clustering scheme comprises alignment and pre-filling, the loop of clustering, and subclass filling by MF, and can work with two pre-filling methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that the iterative clustering scheme can obtain higher normalized mutual information (NMI) than non-iterative clustering, while also consuming less computational time than Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The two kinds of pre-filling methods each have their advantages on different datasets.},

Distributional RL considers the return as a random variable and estimates its distribution. The return distribution can provide more information than its expectation in conventional RL. Thus, distributional RL has been widely studied. However, very few previous works take full advantage of the learned distribution to improve distributional RL. This paper improves distributional RL by introducing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation. First, an epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation method is introduced using deep ensembles and the learned value distribution. Next, we improve the exploration efficiency of fully parametrized quantile function (FQF) for distributional RL and obtain a FQF-U (uncertainty) algorithm. Then, to overcome the problem that distributional RL cannot operate over continuous control tasks, we propose an epistemic-uncertainty-based distributional soft actor-critic algorithm with an adaptive risk-averse and risk-seeking policy. Finally, experimental results show that our algorithms outperform the baselines in Atari games and Multi-joint dynamics with contact (MuJoCo) environments.},

The proposed branching-process variant is able to evaluate the importance of an agent in a social network and, thus we propose a novel centrality index, called the Stochastic Potential Gain (SPG). The SPG is the first centrality index which combines the knowledge of the network topology with a dynamic process taking place on it which we call a graph-driven branching process. SPG generalises a range of popular network centrality metrics such as Katz&#39; and Subgraph. We formulate a Monte Carlo algorithm (called MCPG) to compute the SPG and prove that it is convergent and correct. Experiments on two real datasets drawn from Facebook and GitHub demonstrate that MCPG traverses only a small fraction of nodes to produce its result, thus making the Stochastic Potential Gain an appealing option to compute node centrality measure for Online social networks.},

Although event cameras can provide high dynamic range and low-energy event stream data, the scale is smaller and more difficult to obtain than traditional frame-based data, which restricts the development of neuromorphic computing. Data augmentation can improve the quantity and quality of the original data by processing more representations from the original data. This paper proposes an efficient data augmentation strategy for event stream data: EventMix . We carefully design the mixing of different event streams by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to generate random 3D masks and achieve arbitrary shape mixing of event streams in the spatio-temporal dimension. By computing the relative distances of event streams, we propose a more reasonable way to assign labels to the mixed samples. The experimental results on multiple neuromorphic datasets have shown that our strategy can improve performance on neuromorphic classification tasks as well as neuromorphic human action recognition tasks both for ANNs and SNNs , and we have achieved state-of-the-art performance on DVS-CIFAR10, N-Caltech101, and DVS-Gesture datasets.},

This paper studies a new causal-based framework CauTailReS to increase the diversity of session recommendations. We first propose a new causal graph and then use the do-calculus in order to understand how popularity influences the process of making recommendations from the user&#39;s point of view. Popularity only misleads users temporarily, rather than in a long term and globally. Second, we believe that user clicks on popular products demonstrate their high quality and reputation. CauTailReS only eliminates ‘bad’ biases and retains ‘good’ effects through interest and consistent causal embedding mechanisms. To determine how similar various users are on various target items, CauTailReS also employs a re-ranking technique known as ‘conformity-aware re-ranking’. To discover interactions based on what actual users want, CauTailReS also employs counterfactual reasoning . Extensive comparative experiments on four real world datasets have shown CauTailReS can well capture the true interests and consistency of users. As compared to the current state-of-the-art, CauTailReS enhances long-tail performance (APLT is increased by 8.14\%) and recommendation accuracy (MRR is increased by 2.75\%). This proves that introducing causal embeddings helps to reasonably enhance the diversity of recommendations.},

In this paper, the concept and connotation of consistency in the BRB system are first discussed. On this basis, a dynamic measurement formula of rule consistency is designed to determine whether a pair of rules is consistent and thus identify inconsistent rules. Then, an optimization process of inconsistent rules is proposed, in which expert experience or optimization algorithms can be utilized as the optimization tool. In particular, a conflict degree-based sorting method is presented to determine the optimization sequence of inconsistent rules. The proposed measurement and optimization process of rule consistency in the BRB system is validated by two cases, namely, pipeline leakage detection and remaining useful life estimation. The experimental results show that the process can effectively identify and eliminate inconsistencies in the BRB system and further ensures the effectiveness and interpretability of BRB systems in practical applications.},

Next, in view of multiple time-phase/period characteristics of trigonometric functions (sine and arcsine functions and cosine and arccosine functions), we propose the trigonometric t-norm and t-conorm operational laws of SvNCNs and the SvNCN trigonometric weighted average (SvNCNTWA) and SvNCN trigonometric weighted geometric (SvNCNTWG) operators to aggregate SvNCNs. Furthermore, a MCDM model is established in terms of the proposed two aggregation operators and the score and accuracy functions to solve MCDM problems in a SvNCN circumstance.

In this work, considering the interpretation that DNNs are feature extractors, we propose a clean-label poisoning attack against DNNs by dominant image features added to the original data. Each category of clean data is augmented with imperceptible perturbations which we call “dominant image features” of another category. The dominant image features determine which class the input belongs to, while the clean input behaves like noise. Well-trained DNNs on these poisoning data will get extremely low accuracy on clean test data. The attack can make personal data unlearnable for DNNs, which preserves an individual&#39;s privacy. Besides, our data poisoning attack can be expanded into a powerful clean-label backdoor attack in that the poisoned samples and their labels are consistent for humans. Experimental results show that our proposed attack can exceed the previous advanced poisoning attacks which demonstrate the effectiveness of our presented attack. Additionally, our work provides a new perspective on the interpretation of DNNs as feature extractors.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is a classic unsupervised clustering algorithm in machine learning fields. Euclidean distance is a frequently used distance metric in FCM, but it is only suitable for data with spherical clusters. Therefore, Mahalanobis distance was introduced into Gustafson-Kessel Fuzzy C-Means (GK-FCM) to help improve the performance on data with ellipsoidal clusters. However, GK-FCM and existing Mahalanobis distance based algorithms only focus on squared Mahalanobis distance, because squared Mahalanobis distance based problems are usually convex and easily solvable. But squared Mahalanobis distance is not a perfect metric, because it tends to exaggerate the influence of outliers and lead to unsatisfying results. In this paper, we propose a rooted Mahalanobis distance based GK-FCM model, which has better clustering performance and superior robustness than traditional GK-FCM. Moreover, owing to the introduction of rooted Mahalanobis distance, the optimization of the proposed model becomes non-trivial and it is not realistic to obtain a closed-form solution as that of traditional GK-FCM. In this paper, by making reference to the re-weighted method, we develop a novel iterative converging algorithm to optimize the proposed model. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world data sets to manifest the superiority of the proposed model.},

In addition, the similarity matrix and clustering results in SC are performed in two steps. To solve these problems, a novel joint clustering method called fast spectral clustering with self-adapted bipartite graph learning (FSBGL), is proposed. It is capable of obtaining low-dimensional representations from high dimensional data , thus decreasing the complexity and increase the efficiency of the algorithm. In contrast to traditional spectral clustering algorithms that obtain clustering results in a two-step process, FSBGL obtains clustering results directly from the concatenated components of the optimized similarity matrix while learning the optimized bipartite graph . This eliminates the effect of performing these two steps separately in SC. In effect, a more discriminative low-dimensional representation may be derived from the adaptively learned bipartite graph, while the better low-dimensional representation can continue to be used to learn the structure of the graph. The learning of the bipartite graph alternates with the iteration of the low-dimensional representation, which allows the algorithm to obtain more accurate clustering results. Furthermore, by means of a low-dimensional representation on the basis of fast spectral embedding, the algorithm has better performance on some large-scale datasets. The results of the experiment indicate that the FSBGL is better than other comparative methods in various data sets.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) has gathered extensive attention in various research areas. Many researchers leverage deep neural networks to explore spatial–temporal relationships for MTSF with great success. Nevertheless, plentifully available data required by deep neural networks often struggle to satisfy practical scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we exploit the internal structure of deep neural networks to automatically learn sample relationships, aiming to mitigate data scarcity by propagating information among different data samples. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a M ulti- R elations aware C onvolutional A ttention N etwork, termed MrCAN , which integrates spatial–temporal relation learning and sample relation learning, ad hoc for addressing MTSF issues. In MrCAN , we propose a novel spatial–temporal attention module for spatial–temporal relationship representation learning . With the proposed batch attention module, we further explore relational modeling among samples in each mini-batch to implicitly enrich the training sample information. In particular, we introduce parameter-sharing regressors located before and after the batch attention module to alleviate the training and testing inconsistency in learning batch invariant representations . Extensive experiments on six practical datasets demonstrate that MrCAN compares favorably to nine baseline models . Larger performance gaps are exhibited, especially on small datasets like the SML2010 dataset. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/JZhangNA/MrCAN .},

The ICC , besides its simple definition, seems to have other interesting advantages over traditional correlation coefficients, such as a more natural interpretation in terms of the reciprocal informativeness between two series, higher reliability for independent white noise, Student&#39;s t , and A R ( 1 ) AR(1) processes, higher reliability in the presence of spurious correlation and outliers, and a well-developed mathematical theory based on entropy. The ICC can also detect a number of nonlinear relationships , although it may not be equitable and general. Moreover, the ICC can be computed also for ordinal data, and it offers higher reliability for independent ordinal-valued time series. Monte Carlo simulations , applications to real data, properties of the estimator and asymptotics under independence are also discussed in this paper. In particular, the paper includes applications to signal processing, chaotic time series, macroeconomic and weather data.},

  abstract     = {The ability of spatial-temporal traffic demand prediction is crucial for urban computing, traffic management and future autonomous driving . In this paper, a novel Spatial-Temporal Guided Multi-graph Sandwich-Transformer (STGMT) is suggested to address the ubiquitous spatial-temporal heterogeneity in traffic demand forecasting. Compared to the original Transformer, we employ Time to Vector (Time2Vec) and Node to Vector (Node2Vec) in the embedding layer to obtain universal representations for temporal nodes and spatial nodes, respectively, which are then combined to form Spatial-Temporal Embedding (STE) blocks. The STE guides the attention mechanism , maintaining a unique parameter space for spatial-temporal nodes and enabling the learning of node-specific patterns. In STGMT, we develop Multi-head Temporal Attention (MTA) and Multi-head Temporal Interactive Attention (MTIA) for extracting temporal features, while Multi-head Spatial Attention (MSA) is employed for extracting spatial features . Furthermore, MSA incorporates both the accessibility graph determined by road topology and the similarity graph determined by specific traffic events to characterize the pairwise relationships among spatial nodes. Various attentions and feed-forward layers are rearranged and combined to form the Sandwich-Transformer. Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets of node-level tasks of two different types (highway and urban) and indicate that the STGMT outperforms state-of-the-art models. The proposed STGMT effectively addresses the ubiquitous spatial-temporal heterogeneity challenge in traffic demand forecasting, thereby enhancing the accuracy of traffic demand prediction and offering valuable guidance for traffic planning and operations.

To ensure that the considered system possesses the user-specified tracking performance, an improved error transformation is constructed and incorporated with a novel fixed-time performance function with an infinite initial value, completely removing the restriction that the tracking error is less than the pre-assigned performance boundary in the initial interval. Then, the utilization of command filtered technique and two single parameter estimators severally related to the upper bounds of fuzzy logic systems-based unknown constant parameters and external disturbances not only obviates the “explosion of complexity” issue but also simplifies the control design procedure. On this basis, by skillfully synthesizing adaptive technology and event-triggered mechanism within the framework of command filtered backstepping technique, a novel adaptive fuzzy event-triggered control solution is presented to save the limited network resources. Under the developed controller, the tracking error is steered to converge to an adjustable asymmetric region within a pre-specified time, and the boundedness of all closed-loop signals is ensured. Finally, simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the developed control solution.},

  abstract     = {Although various research studies have been performed to solve constrained multi-objective optimization and many-objective optimization problems, more attention should be paid to the widely existing constrained many-objective optimization problems (CMaOPs). Balancing convergence, diversity and feasibility is an essential issue for CMaOPs. To this end, traditional methods tend to adopt one-by-one selection or deletion strategies. However, these strategies rarely consider the quality of the entirety. Consequently, some poorly performed yet promising solutions might be discarded, finally degrading the performance. To overcome this drawback, this article first introduces the determinantal point processes (DPPs) in Machine Learning to handle CMaOPs. A new algorithm is proposed by applying the DPPs rather than traditional selection strategies for selecting population and archive. To effectively utilize DPPs, two novel Kernel Matrices are designed to represent convergence, diversity, and feasibility qualities of solutions in population and archive, respectively. Besides, a new ε -constrained technique is tailored for the update strategies of archive and corner solution set to handle CMaOPs, especially those with complex constraints. Experiments on 16 different CMaOPs of 77 instances with up to 15 objectives demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method to the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Also, the recommender systems that use side information partially process the feature information by ignoring the locality-preserving property of item features. This study proposes an approach for collaborative filtering by applying an ordinal consistency-based matrix factorization (MF) model to maintain the locality-preserving property of item features to counter this problem. The ordinal consistency condition is implied using a loss function to the item features. Using MF removes the redundancy and inconsistency in item features, producing good results in calculating similarity information for recommendations.

However, the existing theories and methods have two deficiencies: (1) many existing MFRSs are based on fuzzy relations or fuzzy coverings, which may not effectively solve some MADM problems; (2) VPFRSs usually do not meet the inclusion property, which hinders their further development in theory and application. Noted that both fuzzy relations and fuzzy coverings can generate fuzzy neighborhood systems in a natural way, so the fuzzy neighborhood system provides a broader multigranulation framework. Inspired by this, by using the generalized fuzzy neighborhood system, we propose three multigranulation variable precision fuzzy rough set models, namely optimistic, pessimistic and compromise, respectively. As expected, these models contain many existing models as special cases, thus broadening the framework of rough set. Additionally, we verify that these models fulfill many basic algebra properties, particularly the generalized inclusion properties, which overcome the limitation of VPFRSs. Finally, by combining the proposed fuzzy rough set models with the TOPSIS method, we develop a new method to MADM. A series of experiments show that our method has some obvious advantages.},

  abstract     = {Data privacy in e-health deals with the protection of sensitive medical information that is collected, stored, and analyzed in electronic health systems. Several organizations publish sensitive person-specific data for research purposes. E-health data and related domains are the loci of research. First, in publishing sensitive person-specific datasets, ensuring the privacy of user sensitive information is an issue. Secondly, ascertaining both privacy-preservation and data utility simultaneously are contradictory to each other. In addition, all transactions have the same prior belief that may result in erroneous modeling and privacy breaches . To refrain from the belief of an adversary and to solve the above discussed issues, a semantic privacy guarantee must be ensured before publishing data by any organization. This paper proposes a solution to the former issue, a framework for privacy preservation of structured datasets in ascertaining that an adversary has low confidence in extrapolation. The latter problem is also tackled by the proposed framework that combines stratified sampling with generalization to achieve representative semantic privacy-preservation with high data utility. Moreover, this study presents a mathematical proof that the proposed framework achieves differential privacy . Our experimental results show that our algorithm provides better data utility and privacy simultaneously. The proposed framework achieves 3\% and 0.04\% higher classification accuracy and low relative error, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art existing privacy-preservation approaches.},

  abstract     = {E-commerce companies collaborate with retailers to sell products via their platforms, making it increasingly important to preserve platform quality. In this paper, we contribute by introducing a novel method to predict the quality of product orders shortly after they are placed. By doing so, platforms can act fast to resolve bad quality orders and potentially prevent them from happening. This introduces a trade-off between accuracy and timeliness, as the sooner we predict, the less we know about the status of a product order and, hence, the lower the reliability. To deal with this, we introduce the Hierarchical Classification Over Time (HCOT) algorithm, which dynamically classifies product orders using top-down, non-mandatory leaf-node prediction. We enforce a blocking approach by proposing the Certainty-based Automated Thresholds (CAT) algorithm, which automatically computes optimal thresholds at each node. The resulting CAT-HCOT algorithm has the ability to provide both accurate and timely predictions by classifying a product order&#39;s quality on a daily basis if the classification reaches a predefined certainty. CAT-HCOT obtains a predictive accuracy of 94\%. Furthermore, CAT-HCOT classifies 40\% of product orders on the order date itself, 80\% within five days after the order date, and 100\% of product orders after 10 days.},

Many convolution neural network (CNN) based methods have been proposed to handle this problem. However, the information pertaining to subtle targets is delicate and can easily be lost or neglected in the upsampling and downsampling stages of conventional CNN. In this paper, we propose a new subtle target detection network, named the supervised attention delicate enhanced network (SADENet). Firstly, two sample vertebras are designed to solve the problem of information loss during upsampling and downsampling. Then, an enhanced context attention module (ECAM) is proposed, which extends the original supervised heatmap by fusing information from different scales. Based on the ECAM and the respective advantages of high-resolution and low-resolution feature maps, two effective sampling attention modules, the semantic fidelity upsampling module and the location enhancement downsampling module, are created to build a bi-directional connection neck structure. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated in experiments on the TinyPerson dataset, which outperforms many state-of-the-art detectors, especially in the detection of tiny and tiny1 scale targets.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied in complex model solving problems due to its fast convergence rate and concise algorithm structure. However, the balancing ability of PSO between exploration and exploitation still faces significant challenges. Therefore, a cooperative-based difference learning particle swarm optimization (CDLPSO) is proposed. In CDLPSO, dual swarm time-varying adjustment (DST) based on the subswarm division method is introduced on different periods, while using an appropriate subswarm division method to promote the cooperative learning of particles. Furthermore, a pros-cons coevolution mechanism (PCC) is designed in cooperative learning based on swarms. The elite subswarm can adaptively select a group of proper particles as the swarm updates, thereby obtaining a better exploration performance. Meanwhile, a stage-based cross-learning strategy (SBC) which is adopted to utilize common subswarm rationally adjusts different learning strategies on different stages. To further enhance the convergence accuracy, the common subswarm is added in more superior particles for learning. Ultimately, CDLPSO is used to solve the complex function problems on the CEC2013, CEC2022 test suite and a practical application. The experimental results demonstrate that CDLPSO can significantly balance exploitation and exploration abilities.},

  abstract     = {The volatility of stock prices makes it difficult to predict stock price trends correctly. This volatility is affected by many factors, including other stocks related to it. Stock prediction based on graph learning uses various graph neural networks to learn how stocks interact to provide more information. However, they tend to adopt statically defined stock relations based on prior knowledge (such as industry relations and Wiki relations), making it difficult to capture the interplay between stocks over time. In addition, their predictions mostly rely on a single stock relationship, while many types of stock relationships affect the volatility of stock prices in a complex and intertwined manner. A new price similarity relation graph is first constructed using the multi-view stock price similarity to capture dynamic stock relationships. Based on three stock graphs (price similarity, Wiki and industry), we further propose a multi-relational graph attention ranking (MGAR) network. In MGAR, the multi-graph aggregation is achieved by applying adaptive learning mechanisms, thereby forming effective relation embeddings. When combined with the captured price trend embedding, MGAR model gives a ranking list of future returns and chooses K stocks with the best returns to trade so that the return on investment is maximized. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGAR method outperforms state-of-the-art stock predicting solutions, achieving average returns of 164\% and 236\% on two real datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning allows multiple clients to jointly train a model on their private data without revealing their local data to a centralized server. Thereby, federated learning has attracted increasing attention in recent years, and many algorithms have been proposed. However, existing federated learning algorithms often focus on static data, which tend to fail in the scenarios of data streams. Due to the varying distributions/concepts within and among the clients over time, the joint learning model must learn these different emerging concepts dynamically and simultaneously. The task becomes more challenging when the continuous arriving data are partially labeled for the participating clients. In this paper, we propose SFLEDS ( S emi-supervised F ederated L earning on E volving D ata S treams), a new federated learning prototype-based method to tackle the problems of label scarcity, concept drift, and privacy preservation in the federated semi-supervised evolving data stream environment.

Though the emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) provides more possibilities to improve imputation performance, how to achieve the optimal latent code and precisely model the properties of incomplete time series remain a challenge. In GAN-based methods, an effective latent code of incomplete time series is necessary for precise reconstruction. To acquire the optimal latent code, we introduce GAN inversion to invert the input to the latent space of a pretrained GAN. The inverted latent code contains rich properties of original observations and thus can better reconstruct the target sample. To model the temporal irregularity due to the presence of missing values, the decay connection is exploited to quantify the influence that dependencies between adjacent observations should decrease as the time lags between them increase. We incorporate the quantification into the adjacent matrix of the GCN to better aggregate adjacent information of incomplete time series. With the adoption of decay connection, the resulting latent code through GAN inversion can further produce faithful reconstruction. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on several time series datasets show that our proposal achieves state-of-the-art or competitive imputation performance.},

To address this problem, a blockchain-based fingerprint localization scheme is proposed and evaluated in this article. Firstly, A real-time database of verified and temper-proof electromagnetic fingerprints is established by collecting the information from contributors through blockchain . Secondly, a distributed algorithm is designed to obtain a trusted localization based on shared electromagnetic fingerprint information. Lastly, to save on-chain computing resources and defend against spoofing attacks and collusion attacks, an on-chain/off-chain scheme is proposed. The simulations show the practicability and robustness of the proposed scheme. The results are analyzed based on localization accuracy and resistance to malicious activities . It is shown that devices can be located without increasing location errors in malicious environments where 20\% of data is uploaded by malicious nodes, and the localization results become more accurate as the decentralized database spontaneously established is expanded.},

However, when processing ECG signals over a long period of time , it is difficult for existing deep learning methods to effectively diagnose and classify ECG signals based on a few abnormal heartbeats in these long-term time series data . In this paper, we present a novel cross-modal multiscale multi-instance learning approach for long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) classification. Our method leverages the foundational paradigm of multi-instance learning (MIL) to tackle the challenge of processing long-term ECG signals, while incorporating cross-modal information to guide the global integration of instances. Furthermore, to enhance model performance and bolster its robustness, we introduce multiscale data into the modeling process. The experimental results show that our model achieves excellent performance in different patterns of different datasets, outperforming a series of other traditional deep learning methods and MIL-based methods.

The motivation that we utiliz the Euler formula of complex numbers for hierarchical network embedding is this can make the gradient descent algorithm easily work for complex vectors since vectors are non-Euclidean. To preserve the structure of the hierarchical networks well, we consider parent constraint and brother constraint for hierarchical network (tree) when modeling. Furthermore, we derive an accurate upper bound for the relative radius of complex embedding, which makes HCNE scalable into large hierarchical networks. We conducted a series of experiments on 4 hierarchy datasets, and the superiority of the proposed HCNE model is proved on the tasks of network reconstruction, node classification and network visualization. E.g., HCNE outperforms the suboptimal baseline by 5.1\% in terms of MAP on Georgetown dataset for the tasks of network reconstruction and by 9.9\% in terms of MP on Wordnet dataset for the tasks of node classification .},

To solving this problem, we propose a consensus-reaching framework to characterize the interactive and iterative process of opinion dynamics and trust/distrust level evolution in BNs. From the framework, we obtain the stable results of opinion dynamics and determine their convergence range in different BNs. Meanwhile, despite no consensus formed in these results, the key role of opinion leaders is captured in settling divergences. To eliminate the divergence and promote the consensus-reaching, we then devise leader-based strategies of minimum adjustments corresponding to different BNs by building consensus models. Finally, a series of simulation experiments are provided to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our theoretical results, and a comparative analysis is implemented to further verify the effect of our consensus models.},

To facilitate these problems, we propose an Efficient Discrete Cross-Modal Hashing (EDCH) in which an asymmetric model is introduced, which not only conveys external semantic information via embedding high-order labels but also preserves internal modality attributes by introducing binary representations and common subspace. To fully use label semantic information, we integrate the semantic supervised intersection scheme and the category correlations embedding in a shallow framework. Moreover, we elaborately develop an efficient and effective discrete optimization strategy to learn binary representations and a novel mutual linear projection to strengthen the capability and effectiveness of hash functions .

Therefore, we propose an extended fuzzy decision variables (EFDV) framework based on linear search and the non-dominated rate (the proportion of non-dominated individuals in the whole population) to solve large-scale multiobjective optimization problems . First, guiding solutions are sampled from the central region to provide more possible search directions in large-scale decision space. In addition, fuzzy evolution or precise evolution is determined according to the non-dominated rate. When the non-dominated rate is low, the convergence of the whole population is relatively poor. Then a higher degree of fuzzy search is carried out, and the individuals with poor convergence are reversed to increase the population&#39;s diversity and enhance the effectiveness of searches. Finally, by comparing experiments on several large-scale multiobjective test suites with 500–5000 decision variables, the efficiency of the EFDV is confirmed. According to experimental results, the EFDV can significantly enhance the performance and computing effectiveness of multiobjective optimizers when used for large-scale multiobjective optimization.},

How to accurately predict the energy consumption of servers is crucial to optimize data centers . Thus, a real-time server energy consumption prediction model that integrates distance correlation and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) named ECDX is proposed. First, the distance correlation coefficient method is used to filter essential feature parameters and remove redundant features. Second, the cross-validation method is employed to optimize the hyperparameters. Thereafter, a data center server energy consumption prediction model is constructed using the XGBoost algorithm. Numerous experiments have been conducted to compare the performance of the ECDX model with that of benchmark models . The results show that ECDX can adapt to changes in workload, the prediction accuracy is significantly improved, and the average relative error is reduced by 4.698\%.},

A system based on observers is implemented with non–parallel distribution compensation (N-PDC) . Moreover, the concept of dissipative control provides a framework for analyzing the performance of H ∞ H∞ , L 2 − L ∞ L2−L∞ , and dissipativeness. In order to design two sliding surfaces using the SMO gain matrix, first two integral–type sliding surfaces must be constructed. Then, we define a few additional parameters using fuzzy Lyapunov stability and SMO theory, resulting in asymptotically stable closed–loop performances. On the basis of the new error system, convex optimization is used to generate the sliding mode controller and the gained weight matrices.

To improve SSRS performance further, we designed a sample-labeling auxiliary algorithm, adaptive sample subspace algorithm, and adaptive weight voting rule for ASSRS to increase the proportion of labeled samples, obtain a suitable sample subspace for each feature subspace, and acquire a relative optimal weight for each base classifier . Experiments revealed that the performances of SSRS and ASSRS were better than those of other competitive algorithms and that the performance of ASSRS was stronger than that of SSRS. Additionally, we can accurately label samples in datasets where the proportion of labeled samples is relatively low by using SSRS and ASSRS.

Numerous community detection algorithms have been investigated to study graph problems wherein the network topology offers abundant behavioral and functional information. In real scenarios, networks are extremely susceptible to external perturbations, primarily because of sparse topological information. Consequently, maintaining robust community detection performance when confronted with intricate network attacks or perturbations is challenging. Previous anti-graph perturbation methods have typically been adjusted to specific perturbation types, leading to the degradation or failure of these defences when confronted with other types of attack. Accordingly, a unified robust framework that leverages extreme adversarial attacks is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a novel graph perturbation module is introduced into the model to generate extreme undirected or directed perturbations through dynamic updating; this ensures that the model can fit the attacked network well. The proposed framework derives a unified perturbation formulation capable of simultaneously attacking symmetric and asymmetric networks. Furthermore, this framework can be applied to many existing non-negative matrix factorization-based community detection methods. Extensive experiments on artificial and real-world networks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the robustness of detection tasks, particularly in noisy networks.},

Creating this fuzzy rule-based system that reflects user behavior requires constructing fuzzy rules increasing exponentially with the number of fuzzy variables and the membership functions and subsequently manually tuning according to expected results. Building such a system is not only time-consuming but also difficult to adapt to changes of threat behavior in different operational contexts .

Then, we employ empirical mode decomposition to detrend EEG noise and reconstruct EEG signals with inherent components and develop a belief f -divergence-based complexity (BFDC) evaluation method with five different functions, including belief KL divergence , belief Hellinger divergence, belief χ 2 χ2 divergence, belief triangular divergence, and belief total variation divergence, to evaluate the complexity of the EEG signals.

In this paper, a new quantum model of GQET is proposed, which provides a new perspective to express and handle the generalized quantum mass function with more explicit physical meanings. Specifically, a new quantum model for the generalized quantum mass function in GQET is first proposed, which represents the generalized quantum mass function as a mixed quantum system of quantum pure states. In addition, belief and plausibility measurement functions are newly defined in terms of the generalized quantum mass function in GQET, which represent the upper and lower bounds to support decision-making by means of the new quantum model. In addition, a new quantum X-entropy is proposed to measure the uncertainty of the generalized quantum mass function in GQET. The proposed quantum X-entropy can be viewed as the generalized model of classical von Neumann entropy. In particular, when the basic belief amplitude assignment of a GQBBA is in accordance with a probability distribution, quantum X-entropy degenerates into von Neumann entropy. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the new quantum model of GQET as well as quantum X-entropy.},

We started by attributing the phenomenon of Clean Accuracy Drop (CAD) in backdoor attack as the result of pseudo-deletion to the training data. Then an explanation from the perspective of model classification boundary is provided to explain this phenomenon that backdoor attack has advantages over undersampling in the data debiasing problem.

As a sample may not share all fine-grained semantic information of a class, our model does not require full association between samples and proxies, and is updated only according to the associated pairs. Moreover, a mini-batch may not contain sufficient information for learning. So our model also considers the proxy-proxy relation in order to provide a global view of the data structure which improves the learning on the intra-class distance. This study also investigates how the positive and negative margins, i.e. , the parameters of our model which control the required similarity for a class and different classes, affect our performance, and finds that less demanding on the negative margin avoids over-training and improves generalization ability to unseen classes.

  abstract     = {In the field of non-monotonic logics, the notion of Rational Closure (RC) is acknowledged as a notable approach. In recent years, RC has gained popularity in the context of Description Logics (DLs), the logic underpinning the standard semantic Web Ontology Language OWL 2, whose main ingredients are classes, the relationship among classes and roles, which are used to describe the properties of classes. In this work, we show instead how to integrate RC within the triple language RDFS (Resource Description Framework Schema), which together with OWL 2 is a major standard semantic web ontology language. To do so, we start from ρ df, a minimal, but significant RDFS fragment that covers the essential features of RDFS, and then extend it to ρ df ⊥ ρdf⊥ , allowing to state that two entities are incompatible/disjoint with each other. Eventually, we propose defeasible ρ df ⊥ ρdf⊥ via a typical RC construction allowing to state default class/property inclusions. Furthermore, to overcome the main weaknesses of RC in our context, i.e. , the “drowning problem” ( viz. the “inheritance blocking problem”), we further extend our construction by leveraging Defeasible Inheritance Networks (DIN) defining a new non-monotonic inference relation that combines the advantages of both (RC and DIN). To the best of our knowledge this is the first time of such an attempt. In summary, the main features of our approach are: (i) the defeasible ρ df ⊥ ρdf⊥ we propose here remains syntactically a triple language by extending it with new predicate symbols with specific semantics; (ii) the logic is defined in such a way that any RDFS reasoner/store may handle the new predicates as ordinary terms if it does not want to take account of the extra non-monotonic capabilities; (iii) the defeasible entailment decision procedure is built on top of the ρ df ⊥ ρdf⊥ entailment decision procedure, which in turn is an extension of the one for ρ df via some additional inference rules favouring a potential implementation; (iv) the computational complexity of deciding entailment in ρ df and ρ df ⊥ ρdf⊥ are the same; and (v) defeasible entailment can be decided via a polynomial number of calls to an oracle deciding ground triple entailment in ρ df ⊥ ρdf⊥ and, in particular, deciding defeasible entailment can be done in polynomial time .},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks trained using standard cross-entropy loss often induce overfitting of noisy labels that degrades performance. Label correction and contrastive learning have been theoretically demonstrated to be mutually beneficial in noisy label learning. However, the fusion of these two modules in practice has not been researched adequately, and the influence of each module on performance improvement has not been clarified. In this paper, we propose an effective noisy label learning framework that combines layered label correction with mixup supervised contrastive learning , based on hierarchical clustering using first neighbor relations and mixup contrastive loss. In particular, the framework consists of two modules— L ayered L abel C orrection (LLC) and M ixup S upervised C ontrastive L oss (MSCL). The LLC module aggregates the first neighbor&#39;s soft labels via label propagation among multilayer partitions based on the hierarchical clustering of the feature representation. Its purpose is to capture the underlying structure of learning representations at different levels of granularity . The MSCL module incorporates pseudo-labels into mixup contrastive learning directly to learn class-related representations of all instances of each class. Ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the contribution of individual modules to the overall performance enhancement of the framework. Moreover, experiments on synthetic datasets comprising noise of various patterns and levels demonstrate that the proposed framework yields a superior classification accuracy in comparison with existing alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Semantic gap is common issues in classification tasks . Different from traditional classification tasks , the semantic gap problem can introduce serious error propagation for hierarchical classification. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical feature selection method with label enhancement (HFSLE) to solve this challenge, which estimates the label distribution and selects subsets of features for each subtask. Firstly, HFSLE combines the label enhancement and hierarchical feature selection process so that the label enhancement benefits from the feedback of the loss function. Then, the label enhancement is constrained by the consistency of the parent-child distribution to obtain a plausible label distribution. Finally, feature selection is optimized based on intra-class consistency hierarchical regularization terms, which unifies feature subsets with hierarchical semantic descriptions to narrow the semantic gap. HFSLE gives a new perspective on the hierarchical feature selection based on label distribution rather than the original logical label. To demonstrate the superiority of the method, we compared it with six well-established feature selection methods on eight hierarchical data sets, and analyzed the convergence and robustness of the method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can perform favorably against advanced hierarchical feature selection approaches.},

For this purpose, we define a multi-label classification task from images to sets of users. The classifier uses a general-purpose convolutional neural network to extract the basic visual features, followed by additional layers necessary to accomplish the learning task. To evaluate our proposal we compared it with CFs, using two tourism datasets that include: restaurants of six cities and points of interest of three locations.

Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods have proven to be effective in solving this issue. However, most of them handle triples independently and do not capture complex information embedded in the neighborhood topology of central entities. To this end, we propose a T imespan-aware G raph A ttention-based E mbedding Model named T-GAE to tackle the TKGC task. To the best of our knowledge, T-GAE is the first KGE model in which Graph-Attention-Networks (GATs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks are simultaneously applied to the TKGC task. In essence, our model is an Encoder-Decoder architecture, where the encoder consists of an LSTM network and a GAT network. Firstly, we employ LSTM layers to learn new time-aware relational embeddings to incorporate time information. Then, we utilize these time-aware relational embedding and GATs considered as neighborhood aggregators to learn the entity and relational features of the central entity neighborhoods. Thus, T-GAE can capture the interaction features between multi-relational facts and the abundant temporal information in TKGs. As for the decoder, we choose the ConvKB model, which is essentially a scoring function. Our experiments demonstrate that T-GAE significantly outperforms most of the existing baseline methods for TKGC in terms of MRR and Hit@1/3/10.},

In such a BLMOP, the tower company is responsible for the construction of base stations at the upper level, while operators share the base station resources of the tower company at the lower level. In addition, we also propose two strategies to solve the optimization efficiently. First, we use surrogate models to fit lower-level Pareto fronts (PF), then the degree of lower-level optimality constraint violation is converted to distance between the candidate solutions and the approximate lower level PF. So the BLMOP is transformed to a single-level constrained multi-objective optimization problem . Second, to accelerate the current lower-level optimization, we migrate the modified population from the adjacent lower-level optimization tasks . These two strategies effectively reduce the computational overhead. Compared with three existing works, the proposed method has achieved the best or comparable results on 7 benchmark problems and 5 generated test instances with less computation overhead, whose efficiency has been confirmed.},

The traditional cell-level elimination of database vectors, such as the inverted file system (IVF), has limitations on accelerating the search process. Therefore, the Silhouette Coefficient is introduced to realize more accurate and effective vector-level pruning. The value of the Silhouette Coefficient is used as a novel criterion for dividing the Voronoi cell into the center region and the border region. In addition, a dynamic threshold selection model is introduced to determine the sampling rate for each cell adaptively. The proposed method can greatly improve the search speed by reducing the vector-level distance calculation. Besides, the value of the Silhouette Coefficient is saved by offline generating a rank in each Voronoi cell, which does not bring any extra memory cost. Through experiments, it can be seen that for two widely-used datasets of SIFT1M and GIST1M, with no more than 1\% accuracy reduction, the search speed can be significantly increased by about 44\% compared with the standard inverted file system. And compared with state-of-the-art ANN search methods that aim at acceleration, the proposed method can also achieve higher search accuracy with almost the same computational consumption.},

Meanwhile, incomplete interval-valued information systems containing missing values exist widely in reality. One of the key issues in handling incomplete interval-valued information systems is attribute reduction . Unfortunately, there are few studies on attribute reduction for incomplete interval-valued information systems. Moreover, most of the existing studies use fuzzy similarity relations to measure the similarity of objects. Due to the complexity of incomplete interval-valued information systems, traditional fuzzy similarity relations cannot adequately represent the information contained within incomplete interval-valued information systems. To address this issue, this study proposes interval-valued fuzzy min-max similarity relations for incomplete interval-valued information systems, along with two attribute reduction algorithms based on interval-valued fuzzy discernibility pairs model for incomplete interval-valued information systems. Firstly, this study defines interval-valued fuzzy min-max similarity relations using distance-based extended restricted equivalence functions. Secondly, this study presents the interval-valued fuzzy discernibility pairs and discerning ability measure for attribute sets. Furthermore, an attribute reduction algorithm is proposed for incomplete interval-valued information systems. Thirdly, taking into account decision attributes , the relative interval-valued fuzzy discernibility pairs and an attribute reduction algorithm for incomplete interval-valued decision information systems are proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is compared to four representative attribute reduction algorithms in experiments. The experimental results illustrate that our method is effective and has advantages over the compared algorithms.},

Besides, CuDFKD adapts the generation target dynamically according to the status of student model. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the majorization minimization (MM) algorithm and explain the convergence of CuDFKD. To measure the robustness and fidelity of DFKD methods, we propose two more metrics, and experiments shows CuDFKD has comparable performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) DFKD methods on all datasets.

In this paper, we aim at resolving Economic Dispatch Problems (EDPs) over multi-agent systems in a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving manner. Based on both row- and column-stochastic weight matrices , we first design a fully decentralized algorithm without any privacy-masking techniques, namely F-Deed, to resolve a class of structured EDPs over directed networks. We further consider an adverse case that potential attackers including both internal honest-but-curious adversaries and external eavesdroppers try to infer or steal the local cost functions of all agents to achieve their malicious goals. To protect agents&#39; local cost functions against differential attacks, a differentially private algorithm, dubbed DPF-Deed, is developed via enhancing F-Deed with local differential privacy (LDP). To attain LDP, DPF-Deed decomposes the gradient tracker of F-Deed into two sub-trackers, with one of them invisible to any other agents, and masks a decomposed gradient with Laplace noise. Under standard assumptions, theoretical analysis validates that DPF-Deed can achieve linear convergence and an explicit trade-off between LDP and convergence accuracy, which are derived by analyzing the contraction relationships among the network consensus error, the optimal gap, and the gradient-tracking error. Theoretical results are validated by case studies for (dynamical) EDPs based on modified IEEE-14 and IEEE-118 bus systems.},

  abstract     = {The shuffle model is a promising federated learning method, which has the advantages of the high accuracy of central federated learning and the high security of local federated learning. Although the shuffle model can well address the privacy security and model accuracy issues in federated learning, the existing research on shuffle models mainly has the following problems: First, the layers in machine learning models have different ranges of weights, and only some weights are important. Perturbing all weights equally will discard the importance of some weights and affect the accuracy of the model. Second, due to the perturbation of the weights of all clients, the dimension of model aggregation will increase, and the privacy budget will surge. In this paper, an adaptive top-k differential privacy federated shuffle model is proposed to address the above-mentioned issues, which dynamically adjusts the size of top-k iteratively, enabling the client and the shuffler to control the number of weight parameters that add perturbations, ensuring the importance of weights and reducing the privacy budget under the high-dimensional model. It is found when top-k comes to extremes, the security of the model decreases. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a double perturbation mechanism of top-k and non-topk with subsampling , which improves the security of the model and further reduces the privacy budget. Under the three data distributions of independent and identical distribution, non-independent and identical distribution, and non-independent and different distribution, experiments are conducted on three datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10. The experimental results show that the model proposed in this paper achieves good performance and efficiency for privacy protection.},

The method employs an inferential observation decomposition strategy to distinguish dynamic, static, and nonstationary components from BFIP data. It then implements an iterative modeling algorithm to estimate dynamic consistent features within a closed region and effectively isolates the dynamics and statics. The static part is further modeled by ordinary analytic stationary subspace analysis (ASSA) to construct static consistent features and eliminate the interference of nonstationary information. Moreover, an adaptive fault detection strategy is developed, using exponentially weighted statistic structures and adaptive threshold settings to enhance detection efficiency and robustness. Theoretical investigations and case studies confirm the advantages of the proposed method over traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Most transfer learning (TL) models generally need the fault data from similar scenarios to achieve cross-domain bearing fault diagnosis. However, due to the bearings are mostly in normal state and the fault experiment cost is high, it is hard to collect the complete fault data in any real scenario. Thus, the problem of no fault data still limits the application of various intelligent diagnosis methods, including TL methods. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a novel transfer learning (TL) strategy by driving the one-dimensional (1D) cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (Cycle-GAN) with numerical simulation. In this strategy, the bearing dynamic model is constructed to generate the simulated vibration signals under normal and fault states. Furthermore, a 1D Cycle-GAN is first devised as the TL model for signal-to-signal translation. By using all simulated signals (normal and fault) and real normal signals, this 1D Cycle-GAN is trained to translate each simulated signal into a nearly real signal. Two experiments indicate that this strategy can generate satisfactory fault signals to solve the problem of no fault data in bearing fault diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Existing research mainly uses prior knowledge to set all fuzzy sets in a fuzzy system to the same type. In data-driven fuzzy modeling , automatically determining the type of fuzzy set is still a challenging problem. In this paper, a novel data-driven design method is proposed to automatically determine the types of fuzzy sets (type-1 fuzzy sets (T1-FSs) or interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2-FSs)) based on fuzziness . In the hybrid-type fuzzy system (HTFS), the fuzzy set type is determined by fuzziness to improve the performance of the fuzzy system, and the interpretability of the fuzzy system is determined by the integrity, distinguishability, and redundancy of the fuzzy sets. First, fuzzy clustering based on fuzzy entropy is used to initialize the rule base and the types of fuzzy sets. Second, social learning particle swarm optimization (SLPSO) is used to optimize the parameters of the HTFS, and the types of the fuzzy sets are determined by fuzziness, which means that the types of the fuzzy sets will change dynamically in the optimization process. Because the fuzzy set types change, a parameter change strategy is also proposed for adaptive fuzzy set types. Finally, the HTFS is compared with the T1 fuzzy system on 10 real-world datasets, and it is shown that the HTFS has better performance than the T1 fuzzy system. Comparing the HTFS with other advanced methods, it is shown that the HTFS has better prediction performance while taking into account the interpretability of the fuzzy set distribution.},

An existence condition of the set-membership secure fusion estimator is presented to guarantee that the secure fusion estimation errors are always confined to expected ellipsoids. Subsequently, the secure fusion weight matrices are determined by solving a constructed convex optimization problem constrained by a linear matrix inequality condition.

It can fully catch the massive production data derived from the complex production process, and provide efficient, intelligent services. However, the deployment of edge AI aggravates the complexity and security risks caused by the massive heterogeneous resource-constrained and vulnerable edge IIoT devices. Effective fault prevention is crucial to ensure the security and robustness of the IIoT with numerous vulnerable edge devices. Most existing solutions are based on the history log, which can hardly defend against attacks and is easy to cause excessive maintenance. To address this issue, we propose a trustworthy self-healing scheme based on the combination of distributed digital twin (DT) and blockchain , to ensure the security and robustness of the industrial system network. We first propose an implementation architecture of the distributed DT based self-healing IIoT to apply the distributed DT simulation capability fully. In addition, we provide a DT simulation operating mechanism for the controlled industrial devices, considering the requirement of users and constrained resources of edge servers. Moreover, this work proposes a blockchain-based decentralized trust management mechanism to ensure the reliability of self-healing. The security analysis and performance evaluation show the security and efficiency of our proposal.},

However, such information exchanges often suffer from inevitable energy and bandwidth constraints due mainly to their distributed and networked nature. Event-triggered distributed optimization provides an effective means to address this issue. However, designing an event-triggered distributed optimization algorithm with both fast convergence and resource efficiency is challenging. In this paper, a distributed zero-gradient-sum algorithm with a dynamic event-triggered scheme is presented for distributed discrete-time optimization. The triggering threshold is composed of an exponential decaying term and a positive dynamic auxiliary variable. The linear convergence is established theoretically. Finally, this algorithm is applied to an economic dispatch problem to verify the theoretical findings and to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

The proposed scheme generates a key from a plain image with random noise, which is then used to generate the parameters needed in the scheme through using a new chaotic system structure. This structure employs data segmentation for the DCT data of a plain image and processes sparse data and non-sparse data separately: it permutes non-sparse data, and applies permutation and compressed sensing to sparse data. By merging the processed data and performing efficient confusion, we obtain the final encrypted data . The reverse operation is image decryption, and partial decryption can be performed quickly since sparse data is not required. Such partial decryption can be used for multiple applications, such as copyright protection platforms and machine learning based on private data. Simulation experiments and a performance analysis show that the key generation method and efficient confusion of our scheme can improve the security of image encryption .

  abstract     = {Rapid growth in solar power generation, accompanied by random fluctuations, has important implications for the security, stability, and productivity of the grid. Therefore, accurate predictions of solar power generation provide an essential benchmark for relevant institutions to conduct grid planning and power dispatch. Thereby, a novel data-driven seasonal multivariable grey model is proposed for simulating seasonal fluctuations and non-linear trends in solar power generation. To be specific, the novel model contains the following refinements: first, the seasonal factors and time-power item are introduced to modify the insensitivity of traditional multivariable grey models to seasonal fluctuations and non-linear trends. Second, to enhance the generalizability and adaptability of the model, the parameter associated with the time-power item is determined by using the genetic algorithm . Third, on the premise of proving the model’s requirements for period length and sample size, the derivation of the time response function is expounded. For illustration and verification purposes, comprehensive experimental studies are conducted with quarterly and monthly time series samples. In addition, forecasts of the novel model are compared with five prevailing models, including grey prediction models, traditional econometric technology, and artificial intelligence. Case studies indicate that this novel model exhibits improved generalizability, stability, and reliability in the face of quarterly or monthly time series data, confirming it as an auspicious and powerful tool for future solar power generation forecasting.},

Unlike most existing studies, the proposed algorithm eliminates the need for parameter tuning and utilizes real-valued numbers and path representation as chromosomes.

With such fast-paced advancement, inspecting and fully comprehending how given models make decisions is becoming problematic. The complex decision-making process of these models has become a black box, making it challenging to unravel how they work; therefore, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are crucial for further development. This paper discusses how state-of-the-art techniques determine classifications and why they need to be revised to understand the prediction-generating process fully. It compares those existing solutions with the new method called Principal Image Sections Mapping - PRISM, which relies on Principal Component Analysis and allows visualising the most significant features recognised by a given Convolutional Neural Network . PRISM is implemented in a piece of software called TorchPRISM that can generate and present the clustering based on the method&#39;s output. The result can indicate ambiguous classes discrimination; thus, the possibility of automating the output analysis process is also discussed. The paper&#39;s main objective is to examine how PRISM enhances the current understanding of the decision-making process and introduce a tool that can facilitate analysing the output.

  abstract     = {Zero-shot image recognition attempts to simulate the zero-shot learning mechanism of humans and recognizes the images of novel classes. It is crucial to learn transferable knowledge from seen classes and generalize it to unseen classes for image recognition in zero-shot learning (ZSL). Most existing ZSL methods extract visual features with pretrained backbone networks and learn transferable knowledge with the extracted visual features. However, the backbone networks are not pretrained for a special task, and the extracted visual features usually contain some distractive information for the ZSL task, which causes some discriminative information to be ignored or weakened and degrades the quality of knowledge learned from seen classes. Moreover, since visual samples of unseen classes are not obtainable, domain shift is another challenging problem. In this paper, we propose visual feature enhancement to learn more discriminative visual features via a graph convolutional network (GCN) and an attention mechanism for improving the quality of the learned transferable knowledge. Different from previous works, we explore the correlations between different latent visual patterns of an image and introduce GCN to enhance visual features. On the other hand, we take advantage of different learning mechanisms of GCN and MLP and propose dual classifier learning for improving the generalization and inference capabilities of our model. In end-to-end model training, the module of visual feature enhancement and the module of dual classifier learning are beneficial to each other via joint optimization. Finally, we perform extensive experiments in the ZSL setting and GZSL setting. The extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of our method.},

Group recommendations are essential in social media to help users identify their preferred groups. Our concern is event-based group recommendations, based on which users join a group primarily to participate in offline events hosted by group members. Traditional methods for group recommendation do not work well in addressing this issue, because they ignore the social relationships among users or multiple attributes of groups. The k nowledge-enhanced t rust p ropagation g raph n eural network (KTPGN) presented in this study exploits social trust, multiple attributes of groups, and user-group interaction history in a unified framework to predict user preferences for groups. First, an implicit social trust graph is constructed by considering two aspects of credibility, because explicit trust relationships are not always available in most real recommender systems . Furthermore, a graph neural network (GNN)-based model is proposed to learn group embeddings by iteratively aggregating multiple linked attributes and user embeddings through recursive propagation of social trust and historical interest. Experimental results on several datasets from Meetup demonstrate that KTPGN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods.},

  abstract     = {There is an increasing research interest in agent-based automated negotiation. However, how to design an agent that can adaptively compete with its human counterpart is still in its early stage. This research makes efforts toward this end by modeling two essential elements of human-led negotiation: emotion and timing, to adapt to negotiation dynamics. In multi-issue-multi-round bilateral negotiation, the Web-Fechner law is applied to model an agent’s emotion generation and the emotion decay law is used to realize a decaying property of emotion. Meanwhile, rather than a fixed time belief, agents are endowed with time beliefs that can vary with selected negotiation tactics and be adjusted by agents’ emotions. A proposal updating algorithm integrating those two elements is consequently proposed based on Q-learning. Then, 135 numerical experiments were conducted with comparative analyses and statistical tests. The results show that the proposed model can significantly increase an individual agent’s utility, the joint utility, and the probability of successful negotiations by an average of 76.14\%, 172.22\%, and 66.10\%, respectively, whereas reducing the utility difference and negotiation rounds by an average of 97.39\% and 29.57\%, respectively. These results imply that the proposed negotiation model has advantages in improving negotiation utility, efficiency, and outcome fairness.},

Numerous studies have been developed to address the data imbalance problem in classification samples . However, the issue of data imbalance in regression samples has not been researched well. The distribution of the target value of regression samples with the unbalanced data problem is more complicated than classification samples with the unbalanced data problem due to the continuity of the target values of regression samples. To solve this problem, we defined three basic modes of the data imbalance problem of regression samples: PSIR-mode (Positive Skewed Imbalanced Regression-mode), UNIR-mode (Un-Normal Imbalanced Regression-mode) and NSIR-mode (Negative Skewed Imbalanced Regression-mode). Any regression samples having data imbalance problems with complex target value distributions can be split into these three modes. To solve the data imbalance problem in regression samples, we proposed the DIRVAE (Deep Imbalanced Regression Variational Autoencoder) algorithm to generate missing and minority samples. The model can learn the distribution information of the original sample and the sample information between adjacent samples in the target value distribution. Experiments in biology, medicine and aerospace have proved the superiority of the model.},

This paper proposes a novel hierarchical tensor processing error correction gated recurrent unit-effective observation prediction lower- and upper-bound estimation ensemble model. First, we introduce a continuous-time tensor value function to integrate time and context information and create a dynamic variable coefficient embedding layer of continuous-time tensor decomposition , including time granularity , observation, Gaussian component , and context information through a B-spline function approximation. The main advantages of this method include accurate normalized distance squared, effective threshold delimitation, and effective prediction boundary estimation. Second, to solve the error interference caused by the physical factors of multivariate observations, the lower and upper interval boundaries of prediction interval (PI) are deeply integrated into the proposed tensor model through the error factor correction method. The experimental results for aviation datasets from Central and Southern China demonstrate that the proposed model is better than other benchmark models in terms of PI output quality, prediction performance, and computing resource consumption.},

  abstract     = {Time-series clustering of view counts with changes in online time can identify animated series with similar evolutionary count patterns over time, which may help companies reduce their investment risk. For time-series data of animation view counts, most existing time-series clustering methods ignore both the local relationships within data and global relationships between data, making it challenging to identify animated series with similar evolutionary patterns. Therefore, we propose a two-stage deep graph clustering method that involves graph data construction and deep graph clustering . Specifically, graph data construction converts time-series data into graph data, while deep graph clustering uses a temporal convolutional network and graph convolutional network to learn features from the time-series data and graph data, respectively. The entire model is then trained end-to-end to complete the clustering task , utilizing a dual self-supervised module. This study utilizes two datasets to evaluate the clustering performance of our proposed model in comparison to baseline methods . The datasets consist of view count data from 185 animated series on Tencent Video from 2018 to 2022, as well as a public time-series BME dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the baseline methods on both datasets. Additionally, through visualizing the identified three classes of evolutionary patterns, we propose new product development strategies for animation enterprises.},

Computation offloading problem (COP) is one of the key issues of UAV-MEC, which mainly aims to minimize the conflict goals between energy consumption and delay. Due to the time-varying and uncertain nature of the UAV-MEC system, deep reinforcement learning is an effective method for solving the COP. Different from the existing works, in this paper, the COP in UAV-MEC system is modeled as a multi-objective Markov decision process , and a multi-objective deep reinforcement learning method is proposed to solve it. In the proposed algorithm, the scalar reward of reinforcement learning is expanded into a vector reward, and the weights are dynamically adjusted to meet different user preferences. The most important preferences are selected by non-dominated sorting, which can better maintain the previously learned strategy. In addition, the Q network structure combines Double Deep Q Network (Double DQN) with Dueling Deep Q Network (Dueling DQN) to improve the optimization efficiency. Simulation results show that the algorithm achieves a good balance between energy consumption and delay, and can obtain a better computation offloading scheme.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in fraud detection has gained considerable attention. GNNs have demonstrated their efficacy in leveraging the abundant relational information inherent in graph-structured data for such tasks. However, despite the remarkable progress achieved thus far, several challenges still need to be addressed in the current GNN-based algorithms. On the one hand, GNNs exhibit limited performance when confronted with imbalanced label distribution between fraudsters and benign users. On the other hand, the embedding representations learned for nodes and their neighbors in the last layer are frequently processed in a simplistic manner, such as concatenation or averaging, which may compromise the performance of downstream tasks. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a novel im balanced and in teractive learning framework for f raud detection on multi-relation graphs (IMINF for short). Concretely, firstly, we design a novel neighbor sampler that can be trained using supervised contrastive learning . This sampler selects the most similar and consistent neighbors to update the target node&#39;s features, taking into account label information from multiple perspectives. Secondly, we introduce the learnable contrastive embedding and an improved relational aggregator to enhance the representation of the target node. Thirdly, we propose a new interactive learning module , which consists of explicit and implicit transformation layers, with the aim of capturing deep interactive relations between a target node and its neighbors. Additionally, we devise a feature mapping module prior to the relation aggregation step, transferring the raw input features to a latent feature subspace. Extensive experiments on two real-world fraud detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing baselines across all evaluation metrics , especially for the A m a z o n Amazon fraud detection dataset.},

The echo chamber effect and opinion polarization may be driven by several factors including human biases in information consumption and personalized recommendations produced by feed algorithms. Until now, studies have mainly used opinion dynamic models to explore the mechanisms behind the emergence of polarization and echo chambers. The objective was to determine the key factors contributing to these phenomena and identify their interplay . However, the validation of model predictions with empirical data still displays two main drawbacks: lack of systematicity and qualitative analysis. In our work, we bridge this gap by providing a method to numerically compare the opinion distributions obtained from simulations with those measured on social media. To validate this procedure, we develop an opinion dynamic model that takes into account the interplay between human and algorithmic factors. We subject our model to empirical testing with data from diverse social media platforms and benchmark it against two state-of-the-art models. To further enhance our understanding of social media platforms, we provide a synthetic description of their characteristics in terms of the model&#39;s parameter space. This representation has the potential to facilitate the refinement of feed algorithms, thus mitigating the detrimental effects of extreme polarization on online discourse.},

These intervals offer a practical and understandable way to quantify uncertainty. However, none of the belief-interval-based uncertainty measures currently in use satisfies all the necessary mathematical properties and behavioral requirements. Therefore this work proposes an uncertainty measure ( H k ) (Hk) which satisfies most of the mathematical properties , and a generic set of four behavioral requirements. This work identifies a specific set of four behavioral requirements based on the four possible distinct cases of belief intervals. H k Hk is verified over identified specific set of behavioral requirements, where it is found that the uncertainty value depends on both the length and the plausibility of the belief interval; uncertainty value increases with increase in the length of a belief interval, and if lengths of two belief intervals are equal, uncertainty value increases or decreases with increase or decrease in the Shannon&#39;s entropy over plausibility value.},

Considering the uncertainty of health demand and unit referral cost, we develop adaptive distributionally robust models for the CHND problem, where the location and allocation decisions anticipate the worst-case expected patient treatment and referral cost over an ambiguity set. In terms of tractability, we reformulate the adaptive distributionally robust models as tractable forms. Further, a hybrid genetic algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm with a commercial solver is designed to improve the computational efficiency for large-scale instances. Finally, we apply our models to a real-world case in Shenzhen, China, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and assess the value of the adaptive distributionally robust models over the corresponding robust model. The results show that our algorithm has outstanding efficiency and accuracy when compared to the hybrid particle swarm algorithm and the commercial solver.

In this study, we propose a selective-TTA method for reducing computational costs while maintaining the high classification accuracy . Given a query image, we quantify the predictive uncertainty of the CNN on the image to determine whether TTA should be performed. We perform TTA to obtain an enhanced prediction only when the uncertainty is high. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed method significantly reduced average computational costs while attaining comparable or higher classification accuracy than conventional full-TTA.

Due to the high computational cost of either distance calculation or feature extraction, most methods also have quite little potential to scale. We introduce INSTINCT – a novel deep learning-based framework for STIC, which 1) proposes an almost fully information-preserving transformation of raw STIs series into real matrices , and 2) presents a novel ensemble of deep inception-based convolutional neural networks for their classification. The evaluation is applied to the six real-world STIC benchmark datasets and demonstrates that INSTINCT significantly improves accuracy over seven state-of-the-art methods, as well as over three deep learning-based baselines.

Short-term passenger flow predictions for multi-traffic modes can be applied to the management of the multi-traffic modes system. However, this is challenging because the spatiotemporal features of multi-traffic modes are complex. Moreover, the passenger flows of the multi-traffic modes differentiated and fluctuated significantly. To address these issues, this study proposes a multitask learning-based model, called Res-Transformer, for short-term inflow prediction of multi-traffic modes. The Res-Transformer consists of two parts: (1) modified Transformer layers comprising the Conv-Transformer layer and the multi-head attention mechanism , which helps extract the spatiotemporal features of multi-traffic modes, and (2) the structure of the residual network , which is utilized to obtain correlations among multi-traffic modes and prevent gradient vanishing and explosion. The proposed model was evaluated using two large-scale real-world datasets from Beijing, China. One was a traffic hub, and the other was a residential area. The results not only demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the Res-Transformer but also prove the benefits of considering multi-traffic modes jointly. This study provides critical insights into short-term inflow prediction of the multi-traffic modes system.},

  abstract     = {Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) focuses on revealing data distribution from algebraic perspectives and has been widely applied to high-dimensional data. The key to SSC is to learn the sparsest representation and derive an adjacency graph. Theoretically, the adjacency matrix with proper block diagonal structure leads to a desired clustering result. Various generalizations have been made through imposing Laplacian regularization or locally linear embedding to describe the manifold structure based on the nearest neighborhoods of samples. However, a single set of nearest neighborhoods cannot effectively characterize local information. From the perspective of granular computing, the notion of scored nearest neighborhoods is introduced to develop multi-granularity neighborhoods of samples. The multi-granularity representation of samples is integrated with SSC to collaboratively learn the sparse representation , and an adaptive multi-granularity sparse subspace clustering model (AMGSSC) is proposed. The learned adjacency matrix has a consistent block diagonal structure at all granularity levels.

  abstract     = {Multi-task lasso (MTL) is an effective algorithm to handle multi-task problems. By introducing ℓ 2 , 1 ℓ2,1 -norm, it can realize joint feature selection across a group of related tasks. But it is time-consuming when handling high-dimensional problems. Motivated by the row sparsity of the optimal solution, an improved safe feature elimination rule termed IEDPP is proposed to accelerate the training process. It could delete most of the redundant features before we solve the problem. Then the computational efficiency will be improved since only a reduced problem should be solved. Moreover, the properties of the projection operator and the reconstructed feasible solutions ensure the safety of the proposed method. That is to say, it will derive an identical optimal solution to the original problem both in theory and in practice. But our IEDPP could only be used once before solving, there are still some redundant features that are not deleted. Therefore, we further propose an integrated IIEG-ML rule by combining IEDPP with GAP. Then, more and more redundant features could be deleted as the algorithm converges. Moreover, by embedding IIEG-ML into the grid search method, the whole training process will be accelerated. Finally, an improved Nesterov&#39;s method is used to solve the reduced problems. Experimental results on different datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {Identifying the critical nodes in a network is crucial for understanding its characteristics, controlling its structure, and determining its functionality. Cardinality-constrained CNP (CC-CNP) is a nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard combinatorial optimization problem that refers to minimizing a set of nodes such that after deletion, the size of the largest connected component in the residual subgraph is smaller than a prescribed value. CC-CNP is applicable to a variety of fields, such as epidemic and infectious disease control, electric power network construction and maintenance, and traffic network control. In this work, we present a multistage local search (MSLS) algorithm for generating high-quality initial solutions for CC-CNP, where two strategies, circular node deletion and node change and the tabu search-based first in, first out (FIFO) principle, are utilized to prevent search detours. Then, a population-based strategy is incorporated, resulting in a genetic algorithm-based multistage local search algorithm (GAMSLS) that adopts a genetic algorithm framework, refines the initial solutions in the crossover process, and utilizes a new population update strategy to ensure the diversity and individual quality of the population. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on 75 network instances and is shown to outperform state-of-the-art algorithms for CC-CNP.},

  abstract     = {Session-based recommendation (SBR) recommends the next clicked item to anonymous users. Recent studies utilize graph attention networks for modeling. There exist various problems in these algorithms: First, most of these methods only consider the long-term interests of users, ignoring the short-term interest transfer of users; second, when the graph attention mechanism obtains item weights, irrelevant items are assigned weights, which reduces the weights of related items, resulting in insufficient weight discretization . Third, the last action is taken as the user&#39;s final preference, however, this assumption does not necessarily correspond to the user&#39;s actual interest. This paper proposes a long- and short-term interest-attention aware network (LSIAN) model. First, we propose a novel time-aware attention mechanism that learns users&#39; short-term interests by considering context and time interval , and utilizes average pooling to represent users&#39; long-term interests. Next, we introduce a context-based adaptive sparse attention mechanism to discover irrelevant items, down-weight irrelevant items through a dynamic loop, and reserve higher weights for related items. Furthermore, we introduce a gated fusion method adaptively integrate the user&#39;s long-term and short-term preferences, thereby alleviating the problem of excessive weighting of the last term. Experiments on two public datasets show that LSIAN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.},

To address this problem, we construct a new fast SVM with a truncated squared hinge loss (dubbed as L t s Lts -SVM). We begin by developing an optimality theory of the nonconvex and nonsmooth L t s Lts -SVM, which makes it convenient for us to investigate the support vectors and working set of L t s Lts -SVM. Based on this, we propose a new and effective global convergence algorithm to address the L t s Lts -SVM. This method is found to enjoy a tremendously low computational complexity , which makes sufficiently decreasing the demand for extremely large-scale computation possible. Numerical comparisons with eight other solvers show that our proposed algorithm achieves excellent performance on large-scale classification problems with regard to shorter computational times, more desirable accuracy levels, fewer support vectors and more robust to outliers.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods mainly associate global or region features to semantic vectors within a single image, for transferring semantic knowledge from the seen classes to unseen ones. However, the interactive region learning among a group of images from different categories, which can enhance the discrimination of region features and thus lead to a desirable knowledge transfer between seen and unseen classes, is seldom considered. To remedy the above challenge, we propose a group-wise interactive region learning (GIRL) model to guarantee a comprehensive and explicit region interaction. Specifically, GIRL consists of an attentive region interaction (ARI) module and a holistic semantic embedding (HSE) module. ARI utilizes the semantic commonalities and differences of group regions to produce refined region features. HSE holistically maps these region features to the semantic space for a more stable semantic transfer. We also present a semantic consistency loss and a relation alignment loss that can distill the refined/original region features and introduce unseen class semantic vectors for training, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GIRL over other methods, achieving 68.9\%, 42.9\%, 75.5\%, and 47.8\% the Generalized ZSL (GZSL) H scores on CUB, SUN, AWA2, and APY.

Compared with the existing literature, which mainly focus on equilibrium in static games, the dynamic process of the Stackelberg game is also reflected in this paper, which demonstrates the intelligence of attackers switching channels to allocate aggressive energy. In the solution of Stackelberg equilibrium, self-adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to cope with the nonlinearity of the reward function.

Most of the existing guarantees are oracle generalization bounds and are proper for theoretical analysis, and they cannot be used directly for various applications. The upper bound on the empirical excess risk is more useful in practice since it is obtained based on the observed data. Therefore, getting a learning guarantee on the empirical process is helpful in practice. In this paper, under the Bernstein condition, we propose a novel approach that uses any oracle generalization bound to calculate an upper bound on the empirical excess risk of the empirical risk minimization (ERM) predictor with the fast convergence rate ( O ( 1 n ) ) (O(1n)) . Using a tighter general bound, our approach obtains a tighter bound on the empirical excess risk. We show that the proposed empirical excess risk bound is tighter compared to the best in the literature. Using this upper bound, we get a deterministic and known set of predictors such that with a high probability contains the minimum risk predictor. This set can be used in the algorithm design .},

Furthermore, these methods generally focus on the improvement of an algorithm architecture rather than on improving the quality of medical images. This paper aims to address this limitation by presenting a novel method, Fuzzy-VGG. With this approach, the image pixels are reordered based on their gray levels using fuzzy theory, placing a high priority on the most significant local information in each pixel. Following this, a VGG-based primary framework is employed to train the datasets, and a two-stage cutout strategy is used to augment the dataset and enhance training results. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in classification performance and accelerated model convergence. The primary novelties and contributions of this work encompass: 1) a focus on local key areas to expedite training and enhance results, 2) the utilization of a two-stage cutout data enhancement strategy tailored to medical images&#39; characteristics, and 3) seamless integration with blockchain technology to facilitate scalability and continuous model improvement.},

An observer-based dynamic cryptography-based encryption-decryption (CED) pairing algorithm is proposed to achieve privacy preservation and defend against replay attacks simultaneously. To reduce the computation and communication resources and facilitate paired password design, a Zeno-free edge-event-triggered mechanism (EETM) based on edge (rather than neighbor) information is developed in a completely distributed manner, using only local observation information without any knowledge about the global topology. The designed EETM can accommodate multiple event-triggered functions, which simplifies the EETM design procedure. Interestingly, the CED pairing algorithm makes the effect of replay attacks equivalent to that of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Thus, DoS and replay attacks can be handled as the same types of attacks. In addition, a resilient EETM-based control strategy against DoS and replay attacks is proposed to make the MAS reach consensus faster, within the attack sleep time. Furthermore, sufficient conditions for the frequency and duration of replay and DoS attacks are established to achieve secure consensus of the MAS. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the validity and superiority of the proposed method.},

Specifically, a stochastic evolutionary game is utilized to describe the interactions between the government and the platform with the consideration of random disturbance. Then, a cusp catastrophe model is developed to capture the mechanism of sudden changes. With the catastrophe threshold identified, a catastrophe-based resilience measurement method is proposed to quantitatively investigate the catastrophe process, and simulation experiments are conducted to explain and validate the proposed approach. The results show that ECPCR suffers catastrophe (e.g., from nonsupervision to supervision) when the combination of parameters reaches a certain threshold, and the impact of the parameters on catastrophe can be quantified by measuring the resilience of collaborative regulatory systems. In addition, increasing penalty intensity and reputation losses can effectively prevent catastrophe from supervision to nonsupervision, while supervision revenue has little impact. This integrated study provides a new perspective for supervision research and offers ideas for the quantitative analysis of catastrophe.},

  abstract     = {Energy forecasting plays an important role in effective power grid management. The widespread adoption of emerging technologies and the increased reliance on renewable sources of energy have created a need for a robust and accurate system for energy forecasting. This demand is becoming increasingly relevant due to the ongoing 2022 energy crisis. Modern power systems are very complex with many complicated correlations between various forecasting factors and parameters. Furthermore, renewable energy is often dependent on weather conditions, which complicates the process of forecasting. This work presents a novel artificial intelligence (AI) driven energy forecasting tuned deep learning framework. By formatting predictors as a time series, two variations of recurrent neural networks (RNN)s have been implemented: long-short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural networks. However, both approaches present several hyperparameters that require adequate tuning to attain desirable performance. Therefore, this work also proposes an improved version of a well know swarm intelligence algorithm, the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), tasked with tackling hyperparameter tuning for both approaches. To demonstrate the improvements made, three datasets have been constructed for evaluation from publicly available real-world data that contain relevant solar, wind, and power-grid load parameters alongside weather data. The proposed metaheuristic algorithm has been subjected to a comparative analysis with several contemporary metaheuristic algorithms to showcase the improvements made. The introduced metaheuristic demonstrated the best performance with a mean square error (MSE) rate for solar generation of only 0.0132 with LSTM methods and 0.0134 with GRU. Similar performance was observed for wind power generation forecasting with a MSE of 0.00292 with LSTM and 0.00287. When tackling power grid load forecasting a median MSE of 0.0162 was attained with LSTM and 0.01504 with GRU. Therefore there is great potential for tackling these tasks using the proposed approach. The best-performing models have been analyzed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to determine the factors that have the highest influence on energy generation and demand.},

It is shown here that the GHSORM is instrumental in sub-grouping clusters that are not fully separable by a single SOM. This combined approach is first tested and illustrated on the problem of clustering handwritten digits where a modification of the Activation Maximisation method for use at the SOM output layer demonstrates the benefit of hierarchical growth in the GHSORM. In particular, the SOM Node Activation Maximisation method is used to visually represent the best approximation of each of the SOM nodes at the output layer. This demonstrates the improvement in representing difficult to separate digits in the hierarchical case. To test and measure the efficacy of the GHSORM hierarchical model in class and sub-class separation the method is applied to complex digital gene expression data . A cancer dataset, comprising of gene expression data that has samples of different classes and sub-classes, is used for this purpose. The GHSORM demonstrates robust capabilities to cluster and sub-cluster the different classes and subclasses of cancer, where the results are superior to both linear methods, currently in use, as well as the methods of its constituent algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multi objective optimization problems (MOPs) with irregular Pareto Fronts (PFs) appear frequently in a large of practical cases. Proximity and diversity are the key indicators for decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA/D) to solve MOPs, which are decided by the neighborhood structure and a set of predefined direction vectors . In certain MOPs with irregular PFs, the effectiveness of MOEA/D is restricted by the shape of the PF. This limitation arises because MOEA/D generates direction vectors in a uniform manner, which can result in invalid direction vectors due to the irregularity of the PF. When dealing with many-objective optimization problems (MaOP) that have irregular PFs, such as degenerate or disconnected PFs, this decline in effectiveness becomes particularly problematic. To address this limitation, a copula incremental learning (CIL) scheme has been developed to progressively extract implicit knowledge on the appropriate distribution of direction vectors for generating non-uniform direction vectors. Additionally, a niche hierarchical selection (NHS) methodology is employed to construct the neighborhood structure and prevent the generation of duplicate solutions. These enhancements are designed to improve the overall effectiveness of MOEA/D. Efficiency is further ensured through the use of convergence-guided direction (CGD) to approximate irregular PFs. Statistical analysis indicates that the proposed method outperforms other competitive algorithms across most test benchmarks, particularly in its ability to effectively address MaOPs with irregular PFs.},

Many medical image enhancement methods can achieve good performance when training on paired data. However, acquiring paired high/low-quality medical images for training image enhancement models is challenging, and these methods are not applicable to unpaired images while also lacking structural information preservation. To address these problems, this paper proposes a fuzzy self-guided structure retention generative adversarial network (FS-GAN), which can perform unpaired learning. Specifically, we develop a fuzzy discriminator to distinguish real images from generated images in the fuzzy domain, which is able to improve the enhanced performance of the model. Moreover, we design the self-guided structure retention module (SSRM) and illumination distribution correction module (IDCM) to capture the structure information of nerve fibers in a self-guided manner and correct the illumination distribution of the image to improve the visual effect. Compared with the existing methods, the experimental results show that the enhanced images generated by the FS-GAN exhibit the most complete texture structure and uniform illumination distribution, and FS-GAN performs well in downstream application tasks.},

However, this sample may have been mistakenly deemed excellent due to noise . This can lead to an anomaly known as the “optimizer&#39;s curse”. Our goal is to manage this anomaly in single-task diffusion networks by giving almost the same importance to a set of good samples instead of just the excellent/ideal one. For this purpose, we introduce a novel loss function and propose a “robust diffusion smooth σ -insensitive correntropy” algorithm for distributed estimation. The proposed convex and smooth loss function is somehow related to the ϵ -insensitive loss family and also inherits some beneficial properties of the correntropy loss function to handle very small and very large errors at once. Accordingly, it provides high resistance to various types of Gaussian, Uniform, and impulsive non-Gaussian noises. Moreover, there are theoretical discussions of the convergence and stability of the proposed method, its steady-state and transient behavior, its computational complexity , and an explanation of the parameter values. Simulation results show the superior performance of the presented algorithm in both stationary and non-stationary environments compared to some recent diffusion-based methods in the literature.},

Researchers have proved that the attention matrix in Transformers has low-rank properties, and the self-attention plays a scoring role in the aggregation function of the Transformers. However, it can not solve the issues such as heterophily and over-smoothing. The low-rank properties and the limitations of Transformers inspire this work to propose a Global Representation (GR) based attention mechanism to alleviate the two heterophily and over-smoothing issues. First, this GR-based model integrates geometric information of the nodes of interest that conveys the structural properties of the graph. Unlike a typical Transformer where a node feature forms a Key , we propose to use GR to construct the Key , which discovers the relation between the nodes and the structural representation of the graph. Next, we present various compositions of GR emanating from nodes of interest and α -hop neighbors. Then, we explore this attention property with an extensive experimental test to assess the performance and the possible direction of improvements for future works. Additionally, we provide mathematical proof showing the efficient feature update in our proposed method. Finally, we verify and validate the performance of the model on eight benchmark datasets that show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In recent years, deep learning methods have demonstrated superior prediction outcomes compared to conventional numerical models. However, due to limited observational data, most of these deep learning methods learn information from simulation data derived from physical models, and ensuring the quality of such simulation data can prove challenging. As a result, the models in CMIP5/6 were recombined using genetic algorithms (GAs) to create our training dataset. A deep learning model was then used to learn features from the output of these combined CMIP models so that these physical numerical models can complement each other. To address the issue of inadequate spatiotemporal feature extraction present in many deep learning methods, we devised an ENSO deep learning regression model. An improved self-attention mechanism was introduced into the convolutional LSTM (long short-term memory) network to enable our model to better extract local and global spatiotemporal features. With our method and model, we were able to obtain less erroneous forecast results, and our method surpassed other state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of its capability for long-term forecasting.},

However, real-world time series data are often unbalanced, with long-tailed distribution and other characteristics resulting in the failure of IL algorithms. In this paper, a balanced-driven Active Learning (AL) strategy is proposed to deal with data imbalance problems in IL processes.

To address these issues, researchers have begun to work on investigating explainable or substitute models for deep model. In this paper, an explainable framework of molecular property prediction with their multi-granularity representation (MgR) is proposed to characterize the contribution of substructures to prediction, called MgRX for short (‘X’ comes from ‘eXplainable’). Specifically, the MgRX is constructed to denote the substructures&#39; contribution of different granularity , in which each substructure is progressively finer from top to bottom. The finest substructures&#39; contribution to target is implemented by the deep learning model with SHAP. Besides, several experiments are executed to analyze the effectiveness of the multi-granularity framework to molecular property.

So far, no defense has been demonstrated effective in this scenario. We show for the first time that this attack is detectable using stateful defenses, which store the queries made to the classifier and detect the abnormal cases in which they are similar. Once a malicious query is detected, the account of the user who made it can be blocked. Thus, the attacker must create many accounts to perpetrate the attack. To decrease this number, the attacker could create the adversarial program against a surrogate classifier and then fine-tune it by making a few queries to the target model.

  abstract     = {Probability density functions (PDFs) play an important role in machine learning , statistics , and in many real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to learn, infer and predict nonparametric PDFs with a Gaussian process prior. This is a challenging problem since there is no explicit formulas for conditional expectations and covariances. The proposed methods have two main advantages: Analyzing PDFs with an intrinsic manifold structure and establishing the connection with the Hilbert sphere when endowed with an appropriate metric. Therefore, all solutions are valid PDFs with non-negative values and integrate to one. We formulate the problem as constrained spherical Gaussian processes leading to an efficient solution with a spherical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. We test and evaluate different strategies with extensive experiments on both simulations and real dataset.},

  abstract     = {The Mach number distribution is an important factor in turbine design. Smooth Mach number distribution is an important feature of blades with small aerodynamic loss. However, existing gradient-based methods, such as adjoint methods, are problematic when the Mach number distribution&#39;s smoothness is considered an objective function. In the present study, we propose an optimization method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to maximize the smoothness of the Mach number distribution. In addition, the task was assigned repeatedly with slightly different conditions rather than viewing the turbine design task as a single optimization task . A situation such as this requires each optimization problem to be solved in a short time. For this purpose, we propose an optimization method based on DRL. The computation time for training the model is long; however, once trained, the model can be reused to solve different problems, and the computation time to solve each optimization problem is short. The numerical examples show that the trained agent successfully improves the smoothness, and the model can be reused for various tasks under different conditions.},

  abstract     = {The inferring of source in the aftermath of a pandemic outbreak has received immense attention due to its substantial practical potential. In light of the inaccessibility to the status of every individual in the network, observer-based approaches have become an essential research direction for solving this problem. However, the way that utilizes the combined observers to infer the source node, as most existing methods follow, may compromise the algorithm&#39;s flexibility and generalizability . To address this issue, we ask the question: can observational information be viewed as pairs of expert-driven information so that it allows us to frame the source localization as an information-fusion problem? To this end, we propose an evidential source localization (ESL) model that utilizes evidence theory to represent the uncertainty caused by limited information and to determine the source node by the information-fusion technique. Moreover, ESL is characterized by its ability to detect sources of disease at an early stage of the pandemic. Rather than focusing on a specific structure, we consider an arbitrary graph as our subject, rendering our method general enough for more applications. Experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate the superiority of ESL in efficiency and effectiveness with the comparison to other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {A non-singular fast terminal sliding mode control (NFTSMC) strategy is proposed for a permanent magnet synchronous motor control system susceptible to load disturbance. First, an NFTSM surface with fast convergence during the finite time is designed to circumvent the singular point in the TSM surface. Then, a novel reaching law (NRL) is presented to resolve the inconsistency between the system chattering and convergence rate in the traditional reaching law (TRL). Meanwhile, a non-singular fast terminal sliding mode disturbance observer (NFTSMDO) is developed to estimate the disturbance value and compensate the speed controller, further enhancing the system&#39;s anti-disturbance performance. Finally, the experiments are conducted jointly with MATLAB/Simulink and the dSPACE platform; accordingly, the experimental results indicate that when the system adds load disturbances, the PI overshoot is 38.7 rpm and the adjustment time is the longest. In addition, when the NFTSMC-TRL and NFTSMC-NRL-NFTSMDO overshoots are 37.4 and 22.1 rpm, respectively, the adjustment time is the shortest and the overall anti-disturbance is the best. Compared to SMDO, NFTSMDO improves the observer&#39;s response speed and estimation accuracy while suppressing sliding-mode chattering. It can be inferred that the control strategy proposed in this study can effectively suppress the chattering of the sliding mode control system and improve the anti-disturbance ability of the control system.},

The human brain supports a wide range of models, algorithms and coding schemes. Inspired by this point, we propose a novel neural network model, the parallel merge neural network (PMNN), which processes spatial and temporal information in parallel with two streams: a spiking neural network (SNN) and an artificial neural network (ANN). The information learned through these two streams is finally merged and flows to the final output layer. Unlike existing wide networks that process a single type of information, the PMNN can learn from the rich spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal information underlying training samples in a manner that is similar to that of the human brain. The experimental results with five UCI datasets and the MNIST dataset demonstrate that the PMNN is very efficient in terms of convergence and generalizable in terms of accuracy, generation, macro-recall, macro-precision and macro-F1.},

  abstract     = {The architecture of multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks dictates the network&#39;s performance. However, aiming at the specific classification problems, suitable architectures of MLPs must be determined beforehand. More often, the design decisions rely on a trial and error learning and the experience knowledge. To automatically design an MLP&#39;s network architecture and optimize network parameters, a multiobjective bilevel programming model is built. In this model, a multiobjective optimization problem is constructed in the upper level for obtaining a set of Pareto optimal architectures of the MLPs, considering network complexity , training error rate, and validation error rate, while a single-objective optimization problem is established in the lower level to search for the optimum network parameters for a given network architecture . For dealing with this model efficiently, a novel multiobjective hierarchical learning algorithm (MOHLA) is proposed, in which an integer-coding NSGA-II is developed as the upper-level optimizer for a set of Pareto optimal network structures of the MLPs, while a non-iterative method is regarded as the lower-level solver for the MLPs&#39; connection parameters. After a set of trained MLPs is obtained finally by using MOHLA, a selective ensemble strategy is adopted for improving identification accuracy. Three types of multiobjective bilevel programming models are investigated and compared in the experiments. Moreover, the proposed MOHLA is compared with several state-of-the-art learning approaches on various classification problems. The experimental results confirm that MOHLA performs well.},

We conducted an online survey with 228 participants to assess the impact of different explanation designs on understanding DP and data-sharing decisions. Our study found that the visual illustration was more effective than the text-based description in helping individuals comprehend Local DP&#39;s privacy protection against large organizations, with the illustration group exhibiting an increase of 51.4\% in comprehension test scores. The study also found that improved knowledge of privacy-enhancing technologies does not guarantee willingness to share protected data.

However, the majority of transfer subspace learning techniques now in use cannot decrease intra-class differences while increasing inter-class differences. In addition, when reconstructing samples, the contribution of each reconstructed sample is not considered. In this paper, we propose a L abel R elease and C ontribution D egree D istinction (LRCDD)-based transfer subspace learning strategy to enhance recognition performance to solve these problems. Specifically, LRCDD reduces the intra-class differences and expands the inter-class differences by introducing the label release model into subspace learning. Assigning an unknown weight coefficient to the representation coefficient of each sample and performing weight learning makes the reconstructed sample in the subspace learning process more accurate, and thus a better transformation matrix or subspace is learned. We introduce a constraint of null diagonal to prevent the data sample from being represented by itself. This avoids multiple representations for each data point. Experimental result demonstrates that the average recognition rate of LRCDD on the EYB, AR, IJB-C, MegaFace, RFW, CPLFW, Flickr-Faces-HQ and Tufts-Face databases are 62.51\%, 70.58\%, 81.69\%, 83.66\%, 82.26\%, 73.22\%, 84.97\% and 90.91\%, respectively, which are higher than those of the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Due to the development of new non-volatile storage technologies, bridging the access delay gap between storage and memory has been promoted. Therefore, since the volume of data continues to increase, the need for new types of non-volatile storage for high-performance computing and database management systems significantly increases. As a basic algorithm of the database management system, external sorting is widely used but suffers from numerous I/O operations caused by the frequent data exchange between the memory and external memory. Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a promising solution. However, the traditional external sorting algorithm is only designed for disk storage and cannot be used for NVM. To solve this issue, we propose LazySort, which is a novel external sorting algorithm that exploits the NVM byte addressing mechanism and the orderly distribution of data to improve the sorting efficiency. Specifically, LazySort first detects the ordered data segment in the memory and then records the storage location of the data segment as well as its maximum/minimum values in an index table named ITable . Next, to reduce memory usage and accelerate the sorting procedure, LazySort performs an optimization strategy RunMerge to merge non-intersecting data blocks according to the range of ITable records. To verify the performance of LazySort, we built an experimental platform with the NVM-DRAM storage architecture combining NVM and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and conducted a series of experiments. The experimental results show that LazySort is more efficient than the traditional external sorting algorithm, since the sorting time of LazySort is shortened by 93.08\% and the number of NVM write operations is reduced by 49.50\%. Moreover, the advantage of LazySort over traditional algorithms is more significant when the data amount increases.},

This paper explores the state-opacity-based privacy verification and synthesis problems for finite-state machines from an algebraic perspective. First, the dynamics of a finite-state machine can be established as an algebraic expression using the semi-tensor product of matrices. Beginning with this novel representation, we propose an algebraic criterion to verify whether the privacy state is opaque to intruders. Subsequently, we investigate the opacity-enhancement synthesis problem from two perspectives. On one hand, we design a feedback supervisory controller by disabling controllable events such that the closed-loop system is opaque with respect to privacy states; on the other hand, we investigate the editing of an observable function simply by assigning specific events in the observation channel instead of changing the transition behavior of the system. We observe that these synthesis problems can be addressed by calculating a system of algebraic equations , and we further develop two algorithms to obtain the controller or function. Finally, an interesting example is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algebraic method. Taken together, these results are conducive to a systematic understanding of privacy enhancement problems.},

In real scenarios, the user&#39;s choice of items depends not only on static preferences (long-term interests) but also on recent dynamic preferences (short-term interests). In recent years, micro-video sharing platforms have been very favorable, and correspondingly, more efficient recommendation method will be needed to support users in finding their interested micro-videos (items). Compared to traditional online videos (such as YouTube), micro-videos are created by grassroots users, shot by smartphones, are short (typically tens of seconds), and have fewer tags or descriptive text, which makes recommending it a challenging task. In this work, we explore how to model users&#39; historical behavior sequences at multiple scales to predict their click-through rates on micro-videos and then determine whether to recommend them to users. We present a novel Multi-scale Modeling Temporal Hierarchical Attention (MMTHA) method for modeling users&#39; behavior sequences inspired by recent deep network-based approaches. Specifically, firstly, we capture users&#39; short-term dynamic interests using temporal windows; secondly, we utilize a category-level attention mechanism to describe the coarse-grained interests of users and an item-level attention mechanism to capture the fine-grained interests of users; thirdly, we employ a forward multi-headed self-attention mechanism to identify and integrate long-term correlations between previously segmented temporal windows. We conducted extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets to verify their effectiveness.

  abstract     = {Modality representation learning is a critical issue in multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA). A good sentiment representation should contain as much effective information as possible while being discriminative enough to be better recognized. Previous attention-based MSA methods mainly rely on word-level feature interactions to capture intra-modality and inter-modality relations, which may lead to the loss of essential sentiment information. Furthermore, they primarily focus on information fusion but do not give enough importance to feature discrimination. To address these challenges, we propose a modal-utterance-temporal attention network with multimodal sentiment loss (MUTA-Net) for learning discriminative multi-relation representations, where the modal-utterance-temporal attention (MUTA) and multimodal sentiment loss (MMSL) are the two core units. First, we propose MUTA incorporate utterance-level feature vectors into the interactions of different modalities, which can help extract more useful relationships as the utterance-level vectors may contain sentiment information complementary to word-level vectors. Second, MMSL is designed to achieve a large inter-class distance and a small intra-class feature distance simultaneously in multimodal scenes to enhance the discriminative power of feature representations. Our experiments on four public multimodal datasets show that MUTA-Net outperforms previous baselines significantly.},

Here, we adopt an extension of the multi-scale, mesoscopic approach – hereafter referred to as a recurrence network – to represent text narratives, in which only the recurrent relationships among tagged parts of speech (subject, verb and direct object) are considered to establish connections among sequential pieces of text. The characterization of the texts was then achieved by considering scale-dependent complementary methods: accessibility and symmetry. To evaluate the potential of these concepts, we approached the problem of distinguishing between meaningful and meaningless texts and different literary genres (namely, fiction and non-fiction). A set of 300 books was considered and compared by using the above approaches. The recurrence network characterization was able to discriminate to some extent between real and meaningless and between the two genres assessed. Thus, our results indicate that recurrence networks are able to capture subtleties in book plots, suggesting that a similar methodology can be used in related networked applications.},

  abstract     = {Image denoising is a fundamental task in low-level computer vision. The well-known CNN-UNet model with encoder and decoder has shown excellent denoising performance. The encoder adopts downsample modules such as pooling, convolution and patch merging to reduce the feature map size. The downsample module is very important for feature transformation between adjacent feature layers. However, these plain downsample modules are incapable of removing noise during feature transformation. It is expected that the downsample module can play the role of removing noise while executing feature transformation. Therefore, we design a patch merging refiner (PMR) downsample module, which utilizes subspace projection to learn a set of restoration basis from the feature space and projects the patch merging feature onto such space, to remove noise and retain the authentic information of feature space while executing feature transformation. Subsequently, from the perspective of the non-local mechanism, we carry out group convolution (GC) block module on PMR to restore high-frequency detail. Finally, by integrating the two modules into the commonly-used UNet model, we construct a PMR-UNet architecture. Experiments on synthetic and real-world noise images demonstrate that our architecture has stronger anti-noise power and surpasses the state-of-the-art denoisers in both quantitative measure and visual perception.},

In safety-critical applications that require a certain level of human supervision, human and AI engine errors can be costly. However, modeling human behavior in collaborative human-AI decision setup is not straightforward. Humans use cognitive mechanisms and decision heuristics to process information and make decisions under uncertainty. This paper, for the first time, presents a systematic framework for modeling, tracking and adaptation of behavioral biases in a collaborative decision environment within an “Active Learning” context. The proposed framework is validated using experiments conducted on a real-world pancreatic cancer dataset. We consider five different learning scenarios based on different grades of human experts and compare the performance of bias-aware decision models with naive models. It is observed that bias-aware models improve the classification accuracy of decision models by upto 16\%.},

  abstract     = {Spectral clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters. The method generally works by modeling pair-wise data points as input similarity matrices , and then performs their eigen-decomposition. Clustering is then carried out from this high-dimensional representation by utilizing spectral properties . Here, several eigen-points are mapped and merged to a lower dimensional sub-space iteratively. In contrast to traditional methods, spectral clustering is well poised to solve problems involving complex patterns. However, the approach is sensitive to outliers, measurement errors, or perturbations in the original data. These then appear in the form of increased levels of spectral noise , especially in the higher ordered eigen-vectors. Consequently, the application of pre-processing and noise reduction techniques are important for its performance. In this article, we address this issue by introducing a three-way decision based approach to spectral clustering in order to make it insensitive to noise. Three-way decisions are classically applied to problems involving uncertainty and follow a ternary classification system involving actions of acceptance, rejection, and non-commitment. The proposed approach is tested on various standard datasets for verification and validation purposes. Results on the basis of these datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms classical spectral clustering by an average of 30\%.},

To address the first issue, a novel non-singular terminal sliding surface is proposed, and to address the second, a new adaptive reaching law that may accelerate system response without resulting in chattering is developed. In addition, this article proposes a novel fractional disturbance observer for rejecting severe and time-varying disturbances. Several simulated industrial case studies and a real-time application based on a cart pendulum setup are used to show the practical benefits of the proposed controller. The suggested approach outperforms the published methods for regulatory and servo responses, according to simulation results and the integral of squared error values used to evaluate the performance of the proposed and reported methods. The proposed method successfully handles time-varying disturbances, in contrast to other reported methods, which lose stability for the mentioned types of disturbances despite the inclusion of an additional mechanism for rejecting disturbances.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) searching for a moving target is a complex search optimization problem that aims to find a path with maximum probability of observing the target. However, as the area where the target may be located increases in size, existing methods tend to cause easy entrapment into local optima, resulting in poor performance. Hence, we propose a Convex Combination Multiple Populations Competitive Swarm Optimization algorithm (CDCSO) in this paper. First, we suggest applying the multiple population strategy to enhance the search ability of the algorithm. The population of interest is divided into two subgroups that each conduct the CSO. Second, we propose a novel convex combination update strategy to coordinate the two subgroups to search jointly for the global optimal solution . At each iteration, this strategy allows the two subgroups to compete and learn from each other, which prevents the population from falling into the local optimum. We then designed new scenarios containing 3 to 6 probability areas to investigate the performance of our proposed algorithm in multiple and complex scenarios. Results: To demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed algorithm, we compared it with several swarm optimization algorithms from different perspectives. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm has superior performance in following and intercepting a high-probability area. To further demonstrate the generality of the convex combination update strategy, we evaluated the strategy in several developed particle swarm optimization algorithms. The results demonstrated that the convex combination update strategy can be integrated into other algorithms to better address the moving target search problem.},

The cost functions are designed separately for leader and followers, enabling the output coordination of the leader and followers under the consideration of the formation configuration. The necessary and sufficient condition for stability and consensus is derived through the detailed analysis of closed-loop CPMASs with DPFC scheme. The control performance of the designed DPFC scheme is validated by the presented numerical simulations, which is extended to a formation control experiment of three-degree-of-freedom air-bearing-simulator (ABS) systems.},

Due to the inherent structural particularity of IVD, in addition to the skewed distribution classes, another imbalance for IVD is the biased range distribution on each interval-valued data. This internal imbalance depicts the internal distribution of IVD in detail, but is usually ignored in representation. This work proposes an adaptive general unified representation frame (AGURF), which may expand the representation frame of IVD. Based on the unified representation frame (URF) proposed in previous work, an adaptive general unified representation frame is constructed firstly. Then the offset-center is defined to re-measure the location of each interval-valued data more accurate. Meanwhile, a rule to set the adaptive factors for each class automatically, which serves as base factors to balance the relationship between offset-center and radius, is proposed. Finally, several general classifiers are also used to verify AGURF. The experiment results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can better represent imbalanced IVD, obtain good classification performance and reduce time cost simultaneously.},

Firstly, KP-ABE can realize access control to resources and protect the security of resources through encryption.

The system to be discussed is suffering from dynamical bias and unknown but bounded noise. The binary encoding schemes (BESs) are utilized in the data transmission through SNs from neighbors to the intelligent sensor nodes , which exhibit robustness to some degree due to usage of the binary data. Both random bit errors caused by channel noises and denial of service (DoS) attacks reflecting network vulnerability are considered that may arise and lead to signal distortion in the transmission process of the binary bit string. In the framework of adopting BESs, our aim is to realize the distributed set-membership filtering for TVSs over SNs limited by dynamical bias and DoS attacks. Sufficient conditions, relying on the solvability of a class of recursive linear matrix inequalities, are obtained for the presence of the expected time-varying distributed set-membership filters. Furthermore, an additional optimization issue is constructed to find the minimal ellipsoids (on the basis of matrix trace) to obtain the best filtering performance. Eventually, a numerical simulation instance is provided to verify the availability of the presented design strategy of finite-horizon distributed set-membership filters.},

To address this challenge, this study introduces a novel adaptive points selecting iterative fast gradient sign method, named AI-FGSM, which leverages temporal neighborhoods to enhance transferability performance in black-box environments. AI-FGSM is unique in that it extracts gradients from additional points in the temporal neighborhood and adjusts the current gradient using previous gradients to maintain the updated trend&#39;s stability. This gradient correction enables faster optimization and restricts falling into local optima. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset show that AI-FGSM outperforms advanced gradient-based attack methods such as MI-FGSM and NI-FGSM in terms of attack success rate and transferability. Moreover, in black-box environments, AI-FGSM achieves an average attack performance improvement of 44.2\% for some models with adversarial training and 32.9\% for several models without adversarial training . These results confirm the performance and effectiveness of AI-FGSM, underscoring its potential as a powerful tool for improving the transferability of adversarial attacks.},

With consideration of the limited communication bandwidth and the malicious network attack behavior, a distributed event-triggered mechanism is considered for the sensor network under DoS attacks . Different from the implicit assumption of many previous results that detail information of the non-periodic DoS attacks is available, a switching-like distributed event-triggered mechanism is introduced under the 2-D framework, which could schedule the triggering strategy flexibly in the attack silent or active regions. By means of the switching system analysis method and the discontinuous Lyapunov functions , this paper aims to develop a proper distributed attack-resilient H ∞ H∞ consensus filter based on the information from the local sensor and its neighbors. A set of sufficient conditions are presented so that the estimation error system can reach exponential stability and meet an expected H ∞ H∞ performance.

With large-scale group participation, competitive behaviors resulted from competition relationship of the decision makers represent one of the important influences. In this case, the effects of competitive behaviors also have an impact on consensus reaching process (CRP) of GDM. Thus, considering the individual competition behaviors in large-scale group social networks, this paper deeply investigates large-scale group consensus decision with increased complexity of GDM in the framework of three-way decision (TWD). More specifically, we firstly improve the K-L algorithm by considering the frequent connections between leaders and followers as well as few connection in own sub-networks under the condition of large-scale group social networks and partition networks for classifying the social roles of leaders and followers. Then, we design the identification rules of competition relationship with consideration of social roles and interest conflict. With respect to the competition relationship, referring to the decision styles of the dependent, biased and rational decision makers, this paper further explores the corresponding competitive behaviors in information interaction of social networks. According to the competitive behaviors, we construct a new optimization consensus model in CRP for the evaluation adjustment of large-scale group TWD and obtain the decision result with Bayesian decision procedure. Finally, we apply our proposed model to analyze an example of product promotion and verify its effectiveness.},

At present, the slow cluster consensus and poor control strategy in the stochastic environment are still serious problems faced by the flocking control algorithms. Focusing on the problems, we propose a leader-follower flocking algorithm based on a novel reinforcement learning (RL) model. We construct a homogeneous graph neural network (GNN) based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (herein HGNN-MADDPG) algorithm model for multi-agent flocking control system. In HGNN-MADDPG, we design a GNN with loss weight to complete the feature extraction of the structural information and improve the perception ability of agents to the system structure. Furthermore, in order to improve training efficiency, we also propose a new cooperative reinforcement learning architecture in which the network and experience between agents are shared. Simulation results show that the HGNN-MADDPG has a better learning effect and faster convergence than the traditional RL algorithms. In addition, the comparative experiments demonstrate the leader-follower flocking algorithm based on HGNN-MADDPG has a faster cluster consensus and more stable control than the traditional and other RL-based leader-follower algorithms in the stochastic environment.},

By assigning an especial cost function associated with SMS for each nominal subsystem, the original control issue is equivalently converted into designing a number of optimal controllers updating under an event-triggered manner, which considerably saves the communication resources. To derive these optimal event-based control policies, the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations are solved via the reinforcement learning algorithm. Different from traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, the identifier-critic network framework can obviate the requirement for the knowledge of system internal dynamics, and remove the errors generated by approximating actor networks. The weight vector in the critic network is updated through the gradient descent method and the experience replay technology, such that the persistence of excitation condition is relaxed. Under the proposed SMS-based decentralized control scheme, the considered system has a faster control response while minimizing the cost function. After that, according to the Lyapunov stability theory , all signals of the interconnected nonlinear systems are strictly proved to be bounded.

We propose a multi-objective binary particle swarm optimization algorithm, called MPBPSO, with three new components to optimize a bi-objective FS model of maximizing the geometric mean (GM) measure and minimizing the number of selected features. First, MPBPSO uses a modified probability-based solution update (PSU) mechanism which utilizes a flipping vector to update particles. A mutation operator with three basic operations, i.e., add, eliminate, and interchange, is also utilized in MPBPSO to improve the exploration performance. Second, a strategy combining the Pareto dominance concept with a distance measure is proposed for MPBPSO to update p b e s t pbest (personal best position). Finally, a selection strategy based on the roulette wheel selection is proposed to determine the g b e s t gbest (global best position) from the non-dominated set during iterations. The experimental results on four datasets have shown that the proposed FS method can identify a small number of KQFs that have good predictive ability for product quality. Further analysis indicates that MPBPSO obtains better search performance than eight benchmark optimization algorithms and the new components in MPBPSO are effective for improving its search performance.},

Some studies have recognized that correlations among sensors change gradually and have constructed dynamic graphs to reflect this change. However, they ignored the temporal dependencies among dynamic graphs, resulting in an inability to capture the deep dynamic dependencies among sensors. Few studies have explored the hybrid interaction patterns of static and dynamic graphs, hindering the adequate exploration of spatial dependencies. Therefore, a novel deep learning model is proposed in this study to address these problems and produce accurate traffic speed forecasting. First, a new graph generation method is proposed to capture the deep dynamic dependencies among sensors, which exploits historical information of dynamic graphs to develop temporal dependencies among dynamic graphs. Then, a new fusion strategy is proposed to investigate the hybrid interaction patterns of static and dynamic graphs, which effectively mines hidden information in graphs to fully extract spatial dependencies. Finally, a new spatiotemporal network architecture is proposed, which unifies the proposed graph generation method and fusion strategy into a consistent framework and yields the final forecasting results.

In order to address control issues in a given region, UAV charging infrastructure is urgently needed. To better achieve this task, an investigation into the T–S fuzzy modeling for Sustainable Hypersonic Vehicles (SHVs) with Markovian jump parameters and H ∞ H∞ attitude control in three channels was conducted. Initially, the reentry dynamics were transformed into a control–oriented affine nonlinear model . Then, the original T–S local modeling method for SHV was projected by primarily referring to Taylor&#39;s expansion and fuzzy linearization methodologies. After the estimation of precision and controller complexity was assumed, the fuzzy model for jump nonlinear systems mainly consisted of two levels: a crisp level and a fuzzy level. The former illustrates the jumps, and the latter a fuzzy level that represents the nonlinearities of the system. Then, a systematic method built in a new coupled Lyapunov function for a stochastic fuzzy controller was used to guarantee the closed–loop system for H ∞ H∞ gain in the presence of a predefined performance index. Ultimately, numerical simulations were conducted to show how the suggested controller can be successfully applied and functioned in controlling the original attitude dynamics.},

Knowledge representation learning methods deal with embedding components of a knowledge graph (i.e., entities and relations) into a low-dimensional vector space with the aim of predicting the missing links. The KG Embedding models use gradient descent-based optimization techniques to optimize their parameters, but they suffer from late convergence, making them inefficient for dynamic knowledge graphs. Moreover, generating and modeling negative samples has a great impact on the accuracy of the prediction model. To address these challenges, we propose a correlation-based knowledge representation learning (CKRL) method. We utilize three semantic spaces, namely entity, relation, and canonical spaces. The parameter values of these spaces, including transformation matrices and embedding of KG components, are determined by defining four optimization problems. Adapting least-squares and Lagrange multiplier techniques, these optimization problems are solved by time-efficient direct methods. To model positive and negative samples, we use two distinct relation spaces. Negative samples are generated by defining the concept of relational patterns used to measure the similarity between positive and negative samples. Evaluation results on link prediction task and training time analysis demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Several efforts are devoted to reducing costs to make FCV technology more accessible. Most research addressing the optimization of FCVs focuses on energy management, sizing of the subsystems, and cost. However, reducing cost conflicts with increasing reliability. This paper addresses the multi-objective reliability and cost optimization of FCVs. Due to inherent uncertainties, this work treats the feasibility of increasing the reliability of the subsystems as fuzzy values and introduces two defuzzification procedures to convert fuzzy values to crisp values, namely the ranking function and the graded mean integration value procedures. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used with penalty functions to generate the Pareto fronts; then, a fuzzy decision method is adopted to find the best compromise solution. A numerical application of the proposed approach is illustrated. The results obtained show that the graded mean integration value procedure provides superior outcomes. The optimal reliability allocation of the subsystems in the FCV is determined.},

In CSP, graph modules are initially identified by a combination of criteria such as the clustering coefficient, degree, and common neighbors of nodes. Nodes with the same label are then clustered together into modules using label diffusion. Subsequently, only the most influential modules are selected using a filtering method based on their diffusion capacity. The algorithm then merges neighboring modules into distinct modules and extracts a candidate set of influential nodes using a new metric to quickly select seed sets. The number of selected nodes for the candidate set is restricted by a defined limit measure. Finally, seed nodes are chosen from the candidate set using a novel node scoring measure. We evaluated the proposed algorithm on both real-world and synthetic networks, and our experimental results indicate that the CSP algorithm outperforms other competitive algorithms in terms of solution quality and speedup on tested networks.},

  abstract     = {Network training error and sparsity are two critical factors in optimizing the model parameters of existing neuro-evolution algorithms. Alleviating the curse of dimensionality in optimizing large-scale neuro-evolution algorithms is one of the most serious challenges. Furthermore, different from existing algorithms, compressibility is considered and combined with the sparsity as the joint sparsity-compressibility to indicate the network’s complexity in the paper. An objective-hierarchy-based neuro-evolutionary algorithm is proposed to comprehensively improve training error performance and joint sparsity-compressibility. First, a multi-directional neuro-evolution is constructed using a Tucker-based tensor decomposition to greatly compress the decision space and generate the subordinates of the decision variables. Afterwards, each subordinate is circularly updated by a multi-linear neuron-spired search in the compressed decision sub-space. Finally, the superior is constructed by concatenating all subordinates and updated by the sparse evolutionary scheme. Compared with other eight state-of-the-art algorithms on seven classification problems in the fields of image/video processing, industrial engineering, biomedical signal, and smart grid, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an assessor-guided learning strategy for continual learning where an assessor guides the learning process of a base learner by controlling the direction and pace of the learning process thus allowing an efficient learning of new environments while protecting against the catastrophic interference problem. The assessor is trained in a meta-learning manner with a meta-objective to boost the learning process of the base learner. It performs a soft-weighting mechanism of every sample accepting positive samples while rejecting negative samples. The training objective of a base learner is to minimize a meta-weighted combination of the cross entropy loss function, the dark experience replay (DER) loss function and the knowledge distillation loss function whose interactions are controlled in such a way to attain an improved performance. A compensated over-sampling (COS) strategy is developed to overcome the class imbalanced problem of the episodic memory due to limited memory budgets. Our approach, Assessor-Guided Learning Approach (AGLA), has been evaluated in the class-incremental and task-incremental learning problems. AGLA achieves improved performances compared to its competitors while the theoretical analysis of the COS strategy is offered. Source codes of AGLA, baseline algorithms and experimental logs are shared publicly in https://github.com/anwarmaxsum/AGLA for further study.},

In this work, to make SNP systems have the ability to adjust synaptic weights according to changes in the environment and boost SNP systems&#39; learning ability and intelligence, long-term potentiation/depression mechanisms in the signal transmission of two neurons are abstracted from biological neural systems and introduced into SNP systems. As result, a type of novel SNP system, called SNP systems with long-term potentiation and depression (LTPD-SNP systems), is developed. Based on novel synaptic weight learning rules in LTPD-SNP systems, the weights of synapses change dynamically depending on the intensity and timing of the spikes passing through them and their own properties. The universality of LTPD-SNP systems as number generation and acceptance devices is proved. A uniform solution to SAT problem is designed to study the computational efficiency of the LTPD-SNP systems. Simultaneously, an anomaly detection method for AC engines based on LTPD-SNP systems is constructed to show how the system can solve a learning task. This work improves the learning ability and intelligence of SNP systems, and offers some ideas for creating brain-like intelligent computational models .},

To address this problem, we propose a new Small and iNcomplete Dataset Analyser (SaNDA) to process such datasets in a meaningful way. Due to the characteristics of these datasets and the criticality of the domain, an explainable method is mandatory to facilitate decision-making interpretation. Thus, SaNDA prioritises explainability over efficiency by design. We evaluated our proposal against Random Forest as a baseline for explainable methods, and against gcForest as state-of-the-art for small datasets. We observed that our proposal outperforms Random Forest when there is more missing data and/or lower number of entries in the dataset, obtaining less favourable results over larger, well-curated datasets. It is also preferable than gcForest due to its explainability and privacy protection capabilities. Given the difficulties in obtaining complete, reliable data in the healthcare field, we consider that our proposal could be useful for practitioners.},

Based on the explicit duration recurrent network (EDRN), a recurrent neural network , a new microblog information-propagation model for the early detection of popular information was presented. In this model, the observation is constructed based on the forwarder&#39;s influence level and the time interval between two adjacent forwarders. The influence level of the forwarder was estimated using the support vector machine classifier. To evaluate this model, experiments were conducted using Twitter and Weibo datasets.

Despite their reliability and precision, they suffer from high computational cost and which make them improper for deploying in edge devices that are limited resources. This paper addresses this drawback by employing a knowledge distillation (KD) paradigm which maps tri-axial multi signals into single axis signals, thus; it can recognize activities with fewer number of signals and consequently less computation. In this method, a big teacher model is trained in advanced with three IMU sensors each of which have tri-axial signals. Then, a small student model is trained with just one of the axes of these sensors under monitoring of teacher which reduces the number of signals. Tucker decomposition is also exploited in order to improve KD performance by separating a core tensor from feature maps that has more informative knowledge. Evaluation of our method on REALDISP dataset demonstrates that the student model could achieve accuracy of 92.90\% with much less complexity making it suitable for embedded devices. Moreover, it outperforms in comparison to other state-of-the-art KD approaches.},

In the agent allocation, the improved K-means algorithm is designed to divide the multi-agent system and dynamic targets into multiple independent single-target hunting subsystems. In the subsystem, the single-target hunting problem is decomposed into multiple subtasks and an auction algorithm is used to establish the correspondence between subtasks and agents. In hunting control, a controller is presented based on the backstepping method, which enables the agent to complete the subtasks. The command filter is introduced to address differential explosion. The stability of the controller is proved by the designed Lyapunov function .

  abstract     = {Attribute reduction is one of the core steps of data analysis. The attribute reduction method based on neighborhood rough sets (NRS) is widely used. However, the time complexity of this method is excessively high because its radius selection relies on grid search. Granular ball neighborhood rough sets (GBNRS) can generate different neighborhoods adaptively and has more generality and flexibility than the NRS method. Nevertheless, due to the purity of granular ball is required to be 1, the GBNRS algorithm will generate many granular balls with the sample number of 1 at the boundaries of classes. These granular balls will be regarded as outliers and deleted, resulting in the loss of class boundary information. Moreover, due to the strict reduction conditions of GBNRS, the reduction effect cannot be achieved on some datasets. To solve the above problems, the fuzzy granular ball is defined by relaxing the generation conditions of the granular ball, and an extended rough sets model is proposed on the basis of the fuzzy granular ball (FGBERS). In this model, we retain as much class boundary information as possible by preserving the fuzzy granular ball of class boundary. A new forward heuristic attribute reduction algorithm is designed on the basis of this model. To demonstrate the performance of FGBERS, we conducted sufficient experiments on 18 real datasets from different fields. The experimental results show that FGBERS not only compensates for the shortcomings of GBNRS, but also demonstrates higher classification accuracy , especially on the KNN classifier , the classification accuracy of the FGBERS algorithm is 5\% higher on average, and the highest improvement is 20\% on high-dimensional dataset ALLAML. In addition, compared with the comparison algorithms, FGBERS has excellent reduction performance in both large-scale datasets and high-dimensional datasets.},

To achieve this objective, the study develops two bi-level simulation-based optimization (SO) models and solves them using an improved biobjective robust simulation-based optimization (IBORSO) algorithm. The attack-defense process is formulated as a Stackelberg game , where the lower level attacker aims to find optimal attack plans to degrade traffic efficiency and safety indices, while the upper level defender adjusts the signal control plan to compensate for the effects of the attack on traffic efficiency and safety indices. The proposed approach is evaluated on an urban road network in Changsha, China. The results show that the developed robust signal control plans can withstand risk-averse and worst-case attacks and perform better than the counterpart ones in terms of biobjective performance. The proposed bi-level modeling framework and solution algorithm can be used to build robust traffic signal control systems that are resilient to cyberattacks.},

Although some recent approaches consider dangerous driving behavior as a process containing multiple instantaneous points, which is ignored by traditional methods, they fail to take into account the loss of temporal information due to the reasonable division of instantaneous points. Therefore, this paper proposes a Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Attention Fusion method (SLAFusion) to detect dangerous driving behavior more accurately. This method evaluates various granularity of driving processes and explores the association between adjacent processes. First, a D-value Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (DPAA) is designed to model the change of vehicle state in mining driving processes with diverse granularity . Then, the features of multiple driving processes are fused to enhance each other to solve the problem of information loss due to segmentation of driving processes. Further, the auxiliary information is fused to incorporate the environmental features of the vehicle during driving. Finally, the experimental results on real datasets indicate that the proposed SLAFusion method improves the recall and F-score by 3.2\% and 2.6\% respectively in comparison with the existing benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {To retrieve data in form of encryption, Boneh et al. proposed a primitive called the public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS). Unfortunately, PEKS is inherently vulnerable to the keyword guessing attack (KGA). To resist such an attack, Huang et al. introduced an authenticated version of PEKS (i.e., PAEKS), in which the sender not only encrypts the keyword, but also uses his/her secret key to authenticate it. Since then, many PAEKS schemes have emerged to improve the security model of the PAEKS system. However, none of these PAEKS schemes consider frequency analysis attacks (FAA) . This attack works by tabulating the frequency distribution of trapdoors generated by user when searching, i.e., placing trapdoors embedded with the same keyword in the same category and recording the number of trapdoors in each category. These frequencies are then compared with the priori knowledge of the frequency of keyword searched by user to extract the keyword embedded in the trapdoor, thereby corrupting the user&#39;s search privacy. This work formally analyzes how frequency analysis attacks lead to the leakage of keyword information of the trapdoor in the PAEKS system. Then, to resist against this attack, we propose the first PAEKS scheme with frequency analysis attack resistance to protect the user&#39;s search privacy. In order to simplify the management of the sender/receiver&#39;s public keys , we further propose our second PAEKS scheme based on the first scheme. Finally, we show that both of these two schemes are proven secure under static assumptions.},

  abstract     = {Class imbalance and group (e.g., race, gender, and age) imbalance are acknowledged as two reasons in data that hinder the trade-off between fairness and utility of machine learning classifiers. Existing techniques have jointly addressed issues regarding class imbalance and group imbalance by proposing fair oversampling techniques. Unlike the common oversampling techniques, which only address class imbalance, fair oversampling techniques significantly improve the abovementioned trade-off, as they can also address group imbalance. However, if the size of the original clusters is too small, these techniques may cause classifier overfitting. To address this problem, we herein develop a fair oversampling technique using data from heterogeneous clusters . The proposed technique generates synthetic data that have class-mix features or group-mix features to make classifiers robust to overfitting. Moreover, we develop an interpolation method that can enhance the validity of generated synthetic data by considering the original cluster distribution and data noise. Finally, we conduct experiments on five realistic datasets and three classifiers, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in terms of fairness and utility.},

  abstract     = {The collection and statistical analysis of simple data types (e.g., categorical, numerical and multi-dimensional data) under local differential privacy has been widely studied. Recently, researchers have focused on the collection of the key-value data, which is one of the main types of NoSQL data model. In the collection and statistical analysis of key-value data under local differential privacy , the frequency and mean of each key must be estimated simultaneously. However, achieving a good utility-privacy tradeoff is difficult, because key-value data has inherent correlation, and some users may have different numbers of key-value pairs. In this paper, we propose an efficient sampling based scheme for collecting and analyzing key-value data. Note that the more valid data collected, the higher the accuracy of statistical data under the same disturbance level and disturbance algorithm. Therefore, we make full use of probability sampling and the inherent correlation of key-value data to improve the probability of users submitting valid key-value data. Moreover, we optimize the budget allocation on key-value data, so that the overall variance of frequency and mean estimation is close to optimal. Detailed theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme is superior to existing schemes in accuracy.},

In consideration of the cost, legal and institutional constraints on the study of social systems in real world, the computational experiment method has emerged as a novel and powerful computational theory and tool for the quantitative analysis of complex social systems. However, how to map the dynamic network features of the real world into artificial society models is an urgent issue confronting the computational experiments method. In this paper, based on the theory of complex networks and complex adaptive systems , we propose a dynamic self-evolving network-based artificial society modeling method to achieve the autonomous evolution of the whole social network. The method abstracts the artificial society into an individual node model and a global network model: the individual model evolves autonomously through individual behavior rules, which continuously changes the topology of the global network model, and then presents the emergent phenomenon of the artificial society system. And then, the validity of the model is demonstrated by using the world trade network as the case study. The experiment results show that the self-evolving network-based artificial society modeling method proposed in this paper provides a new perspective and tool for studying the network evolution characteristics of complex social systems.},

However, it performs poorly in link prediction, node clustering, and graph visualization task when isolated nodes are involved or when the raw data representation is weak. Based on the perspective of improving the capability of the latent embedding representation and the robustness of the model, we propose an Adversarial Learning based Residual Variational Graph Normalized Autoencoder (ARVGNA). We introduce a residual network to augment the raw data representation, use L 2 L2 -normalization to derive better node embeddings , and add adversarial learning to promote the activation of the node representation and enhance the generalization of the model. The experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed ARVGNA greatly outperforms the baselines in the tasks of link prediction, node clustering, and graph visualization, and exhibits strong competitive power and high robustness in network representation.},

This method can recognize all acceptable partitions with well-separated clusters. Among such partitions, our minimal distance index may identify the most appropriate one. The proposed index is compared with other most frequently used indexes in numerous examples with spherical and ellipsoidal clusters. It turned out that our proposed minimal distance index always recognizes the most appropriate partition, whereas the same cannot be said for other indexes found in the literature. Furthermore, among all acceptable partitions, the one with the largest number of clusters, not necessarily the most appropriate ones, has a special significance in image analysis. Namely, following Mahalanobis image segmentation , our index recognizes partitions that might not be the most appropriate ones but are the ones using colors that significantly differ from each other. The minimal distance index recognizes partitions with dominant colors, thus making it possible to select specific details in the image. We apply this approach to some real-world applications such as the plant rows detection problem, painting analysis, and iris detection. This may also be useful for medical image analysis.},

It has shown exceptional ability in capturing both the attribute and structural information in network, that provides a new way for network representation. In this paper, we propose the enhanced contrastive representation in network (ECRN). First, we recognize the issue that contrastive learning ignores the network structure in calculating the similarity of the joint distribution. To address the problem, ECRN proposes a feature combination method with additional structure information. Second, we retain the connection relationship of nodes in the low-dimensional embedding by constraining each layer of neural network . Third, we propose a new graph neural network framework, which independently compares each layer, and realizes hierarchical contrastive learning. ECRN obtains information-rich node representations by accumulating representations in each layer, enhancing the performance of downstream tasks. We tested the ECRN model on real datasets and compared its performance with well-known algorithms. Experiments show that the ECRN outperforms state-of-art methods in link prediction, clustering, and node classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {Learning representations of both user interests and item characteristics is essentially important for recommendation tasks. Although graph neural network-based methods have significant advantages, there are still two inherent limitations: (i) users or items are often modeled as single embedding points in the vector space, and (ii) these methods usually focus more on the graph structure of user–item interactions, rather than the attribute-related information and useful attribute interactions. These limitations make it difficult to model complex user interests and learn high-quality representations, thus fail to obtain high recommendation accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a variational inference-based graph autoencoder (VIGA) model to explore a multivariate distribution over latent representations for recommendation. In brief, to identify both of the complex users&#39; interests and their interactive behaviors, VIGA first encodes users and items into latent variables, and subjects them to a multivariate Gaussian distribution via a graph autoencoder framework based on Bayesian variational inference. Then a feature fusion layer is established for the exchange and integration of both the topological structure and nodes attributes in the user–item interaction graph. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that the proposed VIGA method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods on recommendation accuracy.},

Moreover, our model seeks a consensus similarity matrix with optimal cluster structures by simultaneously approximating the affinity graphs reconstructed from multiple views. As a result, both intrinsic subspace structures and the global cluster structure could be mutually optimized by exploiting the consistent information shared among view-specific available samples.

To produce adversarial examples, the proposed BHI scheme is implemented by embedding invisible watermarks into original images based on a data-hiding technique. Specifically, the BHI scheme determines the corresponding coordinates of host images and watermark sizes. By considering the specific coordinates and size, the BHI scheme invisibly embeds the watermarks into the host images to generate adversarial examples. Experimental results show that the attack success rate of the BHI scheme reaches 93.5\%.

However, these two objectives cannot be accomplished simultaneously or are constrained by the same projection matrix . To handle these problems, we propose a generalized robust 2DPCA method called 2DPCA-2-Lp, which joins 2-norm and lp -norm metrics in the objective function. It aims to maximize the ratio of projected vectors to image row vectors and to fulfill the dual objectives of directly maximizing projection distances and indirectly minimizing reconstruction errors. 2DPCA-2-Lp measures the distances between row vectors of matrices rather than the distances between matrices, thus remarkably enhancing the robustness. Furthermore, the relationship between reconstruction errors and projection distances for different parameter values is analyzed theoretically under the joint-norm metric. Then, the closed greedy iterative algorithm is developed for obtaining optimal solutions. Finally, extensive experimental results on four datasets show that 2DPCA-2-Lp outperforms most existing 2DPCA methods in terms of reconstruction and classification performances and has better robustness against noise.},

Thus, a multi-surrogate-assisted stochastic fractal search algorithm (MSASFS) is proposed in this paper. Several improvements are integrated into the algorithm design : (1) By combining the original coordinate system with the eigencoordinate system, an improved surrogate-assisted differential evolution (SDE) updating mechanism is proposed to ameliorate the generalization ability of the algorithm and extend the scope of exploration. (2) A new expected improvement (EI) pre-screening strategy based on the Gaussian process (GP) model is employed to select promising candidate solutions. (3) Two different surrogate models are applied to enhance the robustness of the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of MSASFS is further demonstrated by numerical experiments on some widely used benchmark problems with dimensions ranging from 30 to 200 and parameter estimation problem of fractional-order chaotic systems. The results reveal that, compared with state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs), the proposed algorithm can effectively solve high-dimensional expensive problems.

  abstract     = {In order to incorporate linguistic information into decision making, it is necessary to apply computing with words (CW) techniques. Traditional CW models use only single and simple linguistic terms to represent both input and output, which limits the flexibility in information processing. Recent researches on computing with comparative linguistic expression, including extension models, has partially overcome this limitation. Nonetheless, the flexibility of linguistic information expression remains limited due to the discrete distributions of primary terms. A complete CW framework should include both encoding and decoding technologies for linguistic information, but previous researches have primarily focused on fuzzy encoding approaches, while ignoring fuzzy decoding techniques for linguistic expressions. To improve the accuracy and interpretability of CW in dealing with linguistic expressions, this research proposes a novel model called 2-tuple comparative linguistic expression (2-TCLE). To establish a framework for studying fuzzy representations of linguistic expressions, both fuzzy encoding and decoding approaches for 2-TCLE will be presented in a systematic manner that are performed to match each other. A novel linguistic computational model for dealing with 2-TCLE is presented and then applied to solve a multi-criteria group decision making case study.},

The transition probability in the systems is time-varying and dependent on a higher-level Markov Chain . In addition to quantization, the Round-Robin protocol, by which the sensor nodes are allowed to gain access to the network in a fixed order, is taken into account for bandwidth saving. It is assumed that deception attacks exist in the communication channels of the network, and are unknown but energy bounded. With the help of a hidden Markov model, an asynchronous filtering system is established. Then, a filter is designed such that the filtering error dynamics is mean square stable with a prescribed H ∞ H∞ performance index. Two examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new design method developed.},

Compared with the existing methods, RRNMF-MAGL can extract robust low-dimensional features and adaptively learn a manifold structure to well reflect the data distribution. Specifically, to alleviate the influence of outliers and noises, a robust non-negative matrix factorization (RNMF) approach with L 21 -norm loss function is first constructed. Then, a multi-constraint adaptive graph learning (MAGL) model is designed based on low-dimensional features to reduce the computational complexity and avoid the adverse influence of redundant information. Moreover, multiple constraints (i.e., sparsity and locality) are incorporated into graph learning for enhancing the discrimination ability of graph structure. Next, to make the learned low-dimensional features well maintain the local geometric structure information of data, a graph Laplacian regularization (GLR) is designed. Finally, an iterative update strategy is proposed to optimize RRNMF-MAGL and its convergence is verified by numerical experiments. The superior effectiveness and robustness of RRNMF-MAGL is demonstrated by extensive experiments on eight publicly available datasets.},

  abstract     = {Self-supervised learning on heterogeneous graphs has gained significant attention as it eliminates the need for manual labeling. However, most existing researches focus on predefined meta-paths that relies on domain knowledge, and they cannot handle the noises in graphs effectively. To address these problems, we propose a self-supervised contrastive learning method on heterogeneous graphs with mutual constraints of structure and feature called HeMuc . Specifically, in the high-order relation view, we exploit graph reachability to obtain the sequence of target nodes traversed by source nodes. Furthermore, we design degree and feature constraints to reduce the noises in topological structure . In the feature view, we reconstruct the graph structure using the similarity between node features and eliminate the dependence on the original graph. Finally, we propose a contrastive learning method by designing a new sampling strategy that combines the structure and feature information. The experimental results on the tasks of node classification and node clustering demonstrate that the proposed HeMuc outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

However, transferring only the class probability knowledge would limit the distillation performance. Therefore, several approaches have been proposed to transfer the teacher&#39;s knowledge at the feature map level. In this paper, we revisit the feature distillation method and have found that the larger the teacher&#39;s architecture/capacity becomes, the more difficult it is for the student to imitate. Thus, the feature distillation method is unable to achieve its full potential. To address this, a novel end-to-end distillation framework, termed Customizing a Teacher for Feature Distillation (CTFD), is proposed to train a teacher to be more compatible with its student. In addition, we apply the customized teacher to three feature distillation methods. Moreover, data augmentation is used as a trick to train the student to improve its generalization performance .

After that, an adaptive convolution model integrates parallel multiple convolution kernels, which can cover the defect feature variation. Then, a confidence sieve learning scheme is developed to filter the label noise, and the adaptive convolution is fine-tuned on the high-confidence data to achieve better detection accuracy. Finally, experimental studies on three industrial datasets have verified that the edge-separated wavelet transform method can accurately predict image noise.

However, reinforcement learning still faces a challenge of the low exploration efficiency problem in practice, limiting its widespread application. To address this issue, in this paper, a novel exploration policy based on Q value and exploration value is proposed. The exploration value adopts action confidence limit to measure the uncertainty of the action, which guides the agent to adaptively explore the uncertainty region of the environment. This method can improve exploration efficiency and is beneficial for the agent to make optimal decisions. Then, in order to make our proposed policy applicable to discrete and continuous environments, we combine the proposed policy with classic reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning and deep Q-network), and propose two novel algorithms, respectively. Moreover, the convergence of the algorithm is analyzed. Furthermore, a deep auto-encoder network model is used to establish the mapping relationship on state-action in discrete environments, which can avoid a large number of state-action pairs stored in Q-learning stage. Our proposed method can achieve adaptive and effective exploration, which is beneficial for the agent to make intelligent decisions. Finally, the results are verified in discrete and continuous simulation environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the average reward value and reduces the number of catastrophic actions.},

  abstract     = {Kidney stone disease is a serious public health concern that is getting worse with changes in diet, obesity, medical conditions, certain supplements etc . A kidney stone also called a renal calculus, is a hard buildup of urine minerals that form in the kidneys. Computed tomography (CT) is one of the imaging models used to identify kidney stones by clinical experts. Due to the low resolution of these images, sometimes detecting kidney stones is tedious with the naked eye, which may lead to false alarms. In this work, a computer-based diagnosis system with a deep learning technique has been developed as a practical solution to aid clinicians in their diagnosis. The traditional convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning technology can detect stones in the kidney. Still, it suffers from the performance and standard implementation of the convolution operations in convolution layers. A Kronecker product-based convolution technique is incorporated in the proposed deep learning architecture to reduce the redundancy in feature maps without convolution overlapping. Our proposed method helps to make the network more effective by extracting abstract and in-depth features from the input images. The publicly available GitHub kidney stone CT scans are utilized to develop the proposed architecture. Our automated model detected kidney stones with an accuracy of 98.56\% utilizing CT images. Our system is more effective than the most recent and cutting-edge techniques developed for identifying kidney stones of any size, including the smallest ones.},

First, a multimode clustering method based on a Gaussian mixture model is designed to divide and locate industrial multimode operational data. Second, to address the limitations of traditional deep network models in accurately capturing the complex relationships between process variables and KPI, a graph structure is used to model multi-sensor time series data. Subsequently, a novel DAGAT is proposed to improve node prediction performance and interpretation of industrial graph data. Considering the cumulative effect of large-scale equipment, the DAGAT incorporates knowledge of the industrial process, enabling it to capture the influence of chemical-reaction variables. Simultaneously, the Huber loss function is used to further optimize the prediction results. Moreover, the model can calculate in real-time the contribution of each individual process variable to KPI, providing guidance for optimal control.

For protection of flow identifiers, we propose a partial identifier protection approach applying randomization and anonymization respectively on desired bit positions to conceal sensitive information , and show their expected-case performance guarantee. For protection of flow attributes, we propose a perturbation-based scheme that first selects the representative attributes by deploying an entropy-based attribute selection method to filter out redundant and insignificant attributes and reduce the problem space, then partitions the attribute domains into either equal-depth or equal-width intervals and perturbs attribute values in these intervals by swapping them with those in adjacent intervals and intervals with same value distribution respectively. We analyze the performance guarantee of the proposed methods and show the experiment results of classification accuracy obtained by implementing popular machine-learning based benchmark classifiers on our selected attributes against that on raw attributes, and on our perturbed attribute values against that on raw values, respectively.

Extensive experiments are carried out on a standardized wastewater treatment platform, and the regulation results on the key component concentrations indicate that the proposed control scheme can ensure excellent control performance and reduce the impact of sensor failures.},

All these measures aim to quantify the uncertainty associated with a given basic probability assignment . As a preliminary step, we offer a study of the literature, which shows a recent resurgence of interest in the quantification of uncertainty in the evidence theory. Then, we compare a number of uncertainty measures by means of numerical simulations and analyze their similarities and differences using rank correlation coefficients , hierarchical clustering , and centrality analysis. The results show that uncertainty measures with similar formulations do not necessarily have similar numerical properties, and some original results are obtained.

For the identification of fake news, several classification systems are available, but no such system was found fast, secure and reliable as per the need of the hour. In this work, an efficient framework based on the federated architecture for the classification of fake news was proposed, while maintaining the data privacy constraints for sensitive text news datasets. The proposed federated-Fake New Classification (f-FNC) framework utilized the distributed client–server architecture with data privacy of all client or connected edge devices. For the testing and evaluation of the proposed f-FNC framework, the non-identical data was gathered from several online resources and was disseminated in a pre-processed format. To test the validity of federated deep learning models, the experiments were performed under various scenarios such as traditional learning, federated learning single client, and federated learning multi-clients. The performance of f-FNC framework was evaluated through various computational parameters such as accuracy and loss validation along with available resource parameters including CPU and RAM utilization. It was observed from the resultant outcome that the proposed f-FNC framework worked significantly well in both single-client and multi-client ( N -clients) scenarios in comparison to traditional distributed deep learning based classifiers. The additional features of low cost and data-privacy of edge devices with limited resources made this proposed framework unique and the best alternative to existing fake news classifier tools.},

To maintain feasibility, the RBF-based local search models are constructed by comprehensively considering the orthogonal distance difference and constraint satisfaction information for guiding infeasible solutions of the infeasible subproblems into feasible regions. To maintain convergence, the RBF surrogates of the aggregated objective and constraints are employed to construct local search models for locating better feasible solutions. To maintain diversity, the subregions of unexplored subproblems are effectively explored by utilizing the valuable information of their neighboring elite solutions. Moreover, the solution with the maximum overall uncertainty of RBF surrogates is selected for progressively increasing the prediction accuracies of surrogates. Therefore, ASA-MOEA/D strikes an adaptive balance among diversity, feasibility and convergence with the assistance of RBF surrogates as the optimization progresses. Empirical studies on three classical test suites demonstrate that ASA-MOEA/D with tchebycheff approach achieves highly competitive performance over other four state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The ad hoc retrieval task aims at ranking relevant documents to a user query such that the most relevant documents are ranked higher compared to less relevant ones. Given the performance of the ad hoc retrieval task can vary across a range of queries, researchers have extensively explored the interrelated task of query performance prediction, which aims at estimating the quality of the search results for a user query without having access to relevance judgments. Traditionally and to-date, the two tasks have been explored as separate tasks where ad hoc retrieval and query performance prediction have been performed in isolation. In this paper, we propose to learn joint tasks that would perform ad hoc retrieval and at the same time predict the quality of the produced rankings. More specifically, we propose a multi-task learning approach, called Multi-task Query Performance Prediction Framework (M-QPPF), which learns document ranking and query performance prediction tasks simultaneously. In M-QPPF, we adopt a shared BERT layer, which is fine-tuned to learn representations for query-document pairs in the embedding space such that the representations effectively encode the cross-interaction between the query and documents. In addition, we include additional yet separate layers to capture task-specific characteristics. We perform comprehensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods in the query performance prediction and ranking tasks over large-scale datasets including the MS MARCO and TREC DL datasets. The improvements measure up to 18.8\% on MS MARCO dataset with a Pearson correlation of 0.604, which is superior to the performance of any state-of-the-art baseline in the query performance prediction task.},

Three-way regions generated from tolerance rough set model play an increasingly crucial role in decision making and intelligent data analysis. Nevertheless, the dynamic change of attributes often exists in incomplete information systems. With this dynamic characteristic, three-way regions must be effectively updated for potential decision-making processes. Therefore, we develop incremental algorithms for maintenance of three-way regions in incomplete information systems when adding or deleting attributes, accelerating the calculation by making use of prior information. First, we put forward an effective matrix-based approach to calculate three-way regions in incomplete data. With the dynamic change of attributes, we further investigate the updating strategies of related matrices for constructing three-way regions. Accordingly, matrix-based algorithms for incrementally updating three-way regions are developed and discussed while the attributes vary over time. In addition, the complexity comparisons of non-incremental and incremental algorithms are illustrated. Finally, empirical experiments are performed to reveal the efficiency of the incremental algorithms compared with matrix-based non-incremental and related incremental algorithms.},

However, due to the data scarcity in FSL, existing methods still face severe challenges in obtaining high-quality sample features for the improvement of classification performance. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical metric FSL model with comprehensive feature fusion driven by data and knowledge (HFFDK), which is based on intra-layer channel-feature and hierarchical class structure perspectives. First, we utilize the network hierarchy to construct an intra-layer channel feature fusion, which transfers the intra-layer fused features of the higher layer to the lower layer. The model can extract high-quality sample features in a data-driven manner. Moreover, we focus on different levels of granularity to obtain various levels of information, while hierarchical class structures can provide both coarse- and fine-grained information in a knowledge-driven manner. Then, we utilize the coarse-grained information to assist fine-grained recognition. Finally, we optimize hierarchical FSL with coarse- and fine-grained relational constraints and similarity measures among samples. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that HFFDK achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

While almost all ground truth inference algorithms show good performance when the number of crowd labels is large, few algorithms can perform well with few crowd labels. This paper considers how to deal with noise in multiple crowd labels as a key to good ground truth inference. This paper solves ground truth inference using robust classifiers. This paper proposes two versions of ground truth inference algorithm based on robust logistic regression to solve the following two problems: (1) how to embed noise level into the loss function of logistic regression and (2) how to estimate the parameters that model noise level in the crowdsourcing scenario. We call our algorithms robust logistic regression inference (RLRI). By employing the idea of robust classifiers, RLRI can still perform well in the case of a small number of labels. We also theoretically compare the advantages and disadvantages of the two versions of RLRI. Finally, the performance of our algorithms is verified on benchmark and real-world datasets.},

For this, we propose a multi-feature based network (MF-Net). First, MF-Net uses the global-local block to acquire local features through the attention-based mechanism. Next, the sparse self-attention mechanism captures global features. Finally, MF-Net integrates the local features and global features to capture the spatial dependency features using the spatial-local block. Therefore, we can mine the spatial dependency features of multivariate time series while incorporating both local and global features.

However, human-labeled datasets often produce misleading information due to mistakes in manual labeling. Most previous works fail to control well the overfitting of the trained model to noisy labels. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework for learning with noisy labels, called the Two-stage training method with Contradictory loss and Co-teaching based on meta-learning (TCC-net). First, a novel robust loss function called contradictory loss is designed for pre-training, which is proved to be sufficiently robust both in the experimental results and theoretical foundation. During the training stage, we co-teach two pretrained networks based on meta-learning without any auxiliary clean subset as meta-data. Unlike other co-teaching methods, we introduce two multilayer perceptron to assist in weighting the selected samples, meaning each network updates itself with weighted-selected samples by its peer network and self-perceptron. Experimental results on corrupted datasets, such as Cifar10, Cifar100, Animal10N, and Clothing1M, demonstrate that TCC-net is superior to other state-of-the-art methods on shallower layers. Specifically, we achieve 12.59\% improvement on synthetic Cifar10 with 80\% symmetric noise and 0.27\% on the real-world Animal10N dataset.

  abstract     = {Incremental recommendation systems have garnered significant research interest since they ideally adapt to users&#39; ongoing events (such as clicking, browsing, and reviewing) and recommend items without retaining the model. Many methods have tracked the event generation sequences for incremental recommendation. However, most existing models treat the event as a static snapshot or a black box, ignoring the underlying factors that may trigger the event generation. Underlying such inner factors can help RS reasonably and foreseeingly evaluate the potential items for the user next time. Along this vein, we propose the Factors Mixed Hawkes Process (FMHP) for event-based incremental recommendations. First, we extend each event to a notion of factor-driven event sequence. Next, we consider three factors that may influence the occurrence of an event: intrinsic intensity, external intensity, and historical intensity. An intrinsic intensity function , multi-type temporal attention, and a hybrid time decay function are incorporated in FMHP to evaluate the intrinsic, external, and historical intensity, respectively. In addition, an incremental updating strategy is implemented in FMHP, continuously updating event intensity as new events occur. We conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets (e.g., Amazon Beauty, LastFM, Movielens, and Amazon Book). Compared with state-of-the-art incremental recommendation methods, our proposed FMHP model achieves superior performance, with up to 9.77\%, 9.35\%, 9.32\%, 10.10\% w.r.t.

Recent studies show two weaknesses of SCNs. One is the redundancy of added hidden layer nodes while the other is the lack of interpretability to the designed constraints. Motivated by overcoming these weaknesses, this paper proposes a new model named Evolving SCN to increase the interpretability of the design for constraints from the viewpoint of evolution by a sampling mechanism and to promote the model compactness by optimizing random weights within the space of constraint parameters. Surprisingly, although an evolving method is used in our model, the effectiveness and efficiency are significantly improved with respect to running time and prediction accuracy in comparison with the existing versions of SCNs. This work makes a first attempt to enhance the interpretability of incrementally adding nodes and simultaneously reduce the redundancy of hidden nodes in SCNs, which brings some new insights to understand the model compactness from the view of Occam&#39;s razor and further to the nature of incremental learning.},

To solve the problem, we propose the scattered centroids initialization clustering algorithm based on Stratification (SCICS). First, based on the concept of influence space, a method for modeling the cluster-level location of any object is presented, according to which we can obtain well-defined cluster decision boundaries through stratification. On this basis, by extending the seed thought, we propose a semi-supervised subclustering algorithm that can break through the limitations of partitional clustering methods that rely on strict assumptions on particular cluster distributions.

Moreover, few studies are dedicated to solving LSMOPs under limited function evaluations. This article proposes a Chaotic Differential Evolution and Symmetric Direction Sampling for large-scale multiobjective optimization (CDE-SDS). First, based on the decision variable information of nondominated solutions , a chaotic differential evolution strategy is adopted to accelerate the convergence of the population towards the Pareto front . Second, a symmetric direction sampling strategy is employed, which generates sampling solutions by constructing symmetric search directions in a large-scale decision space. Thus, the high-dimensional decision space can be explored more fully. The two strategies optimize the population alternately to balance exploitation and exploration. The performance of CDE-SDS is compared with seven state-of-the-art large-scale multiobjective evolution algorithms on an artificial test suit LSMOP with 500 to 5000 decision variables and a real-world time-varying ratio error estimation problem with 3000 decision variables. Experimental results show that the performance of CDE-SDS significantly outperforms the seven compared algorithms in terms of both diversity and convergence of solutions under limited function evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Social recommendation refers to recommendation technology taking social relations as additional input to improve merchandise sales and user satisfaction. It has been widely used in various social networking services. Social recommendation requires the collection of each user&#39;s social relations to build a social graph, posing the risk of user privacy intrusion caused by untrusted servers. Local differential privacy is a widely adopted approach for providing privacy protection while allowing acceptable utility of the protected data for analytics. Growing research interest has been applying local differential privacy protection to social graph analysis. However, local differential privacy is suitable for analyzing coarse-grained statistics from perturbed user data, and it is difficult to obtain the fine-grained user relations needed for social recommendation. This paper proposes a novel locally differentially private social recommendation method. It first perturbs the degrees of users in a given interval and discovers coarse-grained communities from them, then generates a fine-grained social graph according to the features of intra-community and inter-community relations, thus ensuring the accuracy of the recommendation results. Experimental results show that the social recommendation accuracy of our proposed method improves by about 20\% compared to existing methods in a community-structured ego-network dataset, and by about 10\% in two non-community-structured page-page network datasets. The experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art methods such as LDPGen, LFGDPR, and AsgLDP, the social recommendation accuracy of our proposed method is improved by about 20\% in one community-structured ego-network dataset, and 10\% in two non-community-structured page-page network datasets.},

  abstract     = {Although the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has a significant interest these days, its implementation within cyber security applications still needs further investigation to understand its effectiveness in discovering attack surfaces and vectors. In cyber defence, especially anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), the emerging applications of machine/deep learning models require the interpretation of the models&#39; architecture and the explanation of models&#39; prediction to examine how cyberattacks would occur. This paper proposes a novel explainable intrusion detection framework in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We have developed an IDS using a Short-Term Long Memory (LSTM) model to identify cyberattacks and explain the model&#39;s decisions. This uses a novel set of input features extracted by a novel SPIP (S: Shapley Additive exPlanations, P: Permutation Feature Importance, I: Individual Conditional Expectation , P: Partial Dependence Plot) framework to train and evaluate the LSTM model. The framework was validated using the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15 and TON_IoT datasets. The SPIP framework achieved high detection accuracy, processing time, and high interpretability of data features and model outputs compared with other peer techniques. The proposed framework has the potential to assist administrators and decision-makers in understanding complex attack behaviour.},

Thus, one family of community detection algorithms uses random walks to measure distance between nodes, and then applies clustering methods to these distances. Interestingly, information processing in the brain may suggest a simpler method of learning clusters directly from random walks. Drawing inspiration from the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in navigation, we propose a two-layer neural learning framework. Neurons in one layer are associated with graph nodes and are activated by random walks. These activations cause neurons in the second layer to become tuned to graph clusters through simple associative learning. The system can be modelled as Online Spherical K-Means clustering applied in a novel walk-space where all graph nodes are equidistant from each other. In tests on benchmark and real-world graphs, our framework achieved high normalized mutual information scores, executed faster than comparator algorithms, and showed high data efficiency by requiring as few as 6 random walks per graph node. Biological information processing systems are known for high efficiency and adaptability; here, drawing inspiration from the brain has provided a graph clustering method with these properties.},

For gene databases of tumors with high-dimensional attributes and small sample sizes, tumor classification based on gene analysis is a significant step in the intervention and treatment of tumors. The existing research on the tumor classification of gene data has one prevalent disadvantage: gene obtained via the classification performance evaluation has weak interpretability and universality. This paper presents a concept-cognitive learning system with the three-way analysis (CCL3S) in the fuzzy context for the problem of tumor diagnosis with high-dimensional data, a new fuzzy classifier good at tumor diagnosis. The main steps of the CCL3S include: designing fuzzy recognition to extract the core gene, constructing a fuzzy three-way concept space via the core gene, and finally completing the tumor diagnosis based on the minimum recognition degree. Experimental results on nine tumor gene expression datasets demonstrate that CCL3S achieves better classification performance than some related methods.},

Therefore, MMOPs with local PSs are challenging. To resolve this issue, this study proposes a multimodal multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm based on two-stage species conservation (MMOEA/TSC). MMOEA/TSC divides the evolutionary process into two stages: diversity-oriented species conservation and convergence-oriented species conservation. The former is aimed at locating promising regions in which global and local PSs may exist. To balance the distribution of solutions, a Gaussian variation strategy is used to iteratively generate diverse offspring in regions that contain the smallest number of solutions. The latter mainly focused on obtaining one PS with good convergence in each promising region. To help the solutions converge to the global and local PSs uniformly, a species stratification strategy was adopted according to the Pareto level of the well-converged solution for each species. The proposed algorithm was compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms. For the CEC 2020 MMOP test problem set, the experimental results show that MMOEA/TSC has the capacity to find global and local PSs.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on solving the problem of performance assessment for nonstationary processes without significant cointegrated correlations, which is a basic assumption of traditional methods. The time axis is replaced by indicator axis of working condition. Thus, the irregular non-stationarity along time axis could turns to be typical piecewise stationarity along indicator axis of working condition. The proposed method provides a general tool to deal with non-stationarities and relax the cointegrated restriction on variable correlations. Since a nonstationary process has specific working patterns under different conditions, the process can thus be divided into multiple segments along the axis of working condition. To characterize the properties of different performances within a segment meticulously, random sampling-based stationary subspace analysis (SSA) is conducted to separate the Gaussian and non-Gaussian subspaces. Since the operating performance is mainly distinguied by the non-Gaussian information, the non-Gaussian subspace obtained by SSA is further characterized by Gaussian mixture model (GMM). For online application, the segment model is selected by the indicator of working condition, and then the performance is assessed using Bayesian inference to provide a probabilistic result. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated by a coal mill from a real thermal power plant.},

Due to the existence of the Markovian chain and uncertain time-varying coefficients, the traditional difference method is no longer applicable. In this paper, an approach combining the robust control technique is adopted to avoid the difference. An augmented error system (AES) is built to deal with the preview information, in which an integrator is introduced to mitigate the static error. The SMPC problem is thereby transformed into a stabilization problem. A mode-independent sliding surface is designed for the AES. Then, a sliding mode preview controller based on the sliding surface is synthesized by which the stochastic stability of the quasi-sliding motion (QSM), as well as the reachability of a sliding region around the specified sliding surface, can be guaranteed simultaneously. Finally, we give two examples to show that the original system output can track the reference signal well by the proposed sliding mode preview controller.},

  abstract     = {Network function virtualization-enabled industrial edge computing is a promising service paradigm. In industrial edge computing (IEC), virtual service functions (VSFs) are used to implement basic functionalities and deliver concrete services. To improve the service response speed, VSFs are organized into service function graphs (SFGs) to process service data parallelly. The main challenge is to select proper edge servers for SFG deployment and minimize latency. However, finding an optimal solution to the SFG deployment problem is an NP-hard problem. This paper proposes a matching-game-based algorithm to deploy a large number of concurrent SFGs in an IEC environment. In the proposed algorithm, the deployment of concurrent SFGs is formulated as a college admission problem where SFGs propose to edge servers expecting a low service latency, and then the edge servers decide whether to accept the SFG proposals according to the possible service gain. A distributed matching procedure is introduced to solve the matching game problem between the SFGs and edge servers. The simulations are conducted to verify the SFGs and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in concurrent SFG deployment. Simulation results show that proposed algorithm performs well in reducing average service latency and improving service acceptance rate.},

To remedy this issue, this paper proposes a Pearson correlation-based adaptive variable grouping method, which not only consumes no additional computational budget, but also is able to adaptively divide variables with the evolvement of solutions. According to our observation, variables with similar effects on objectives exhibit similar evolutionary trends. Therefore, the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to measure the similarities of the evolutionary trends of variables. Based on the Pearson correlation-based adaptive variable grouping method, this paper further designs a weighted optimization framework based on Pearson correlation-based adaptive variable grouping. Experiments and analyses are conducted on three popular test suites with up to 5000 decision variables. Extensive comparisons demonstrate that the proposed Pearson correlation-based adaptive variable grouping method is superior to existing grouping methods and the weighted optimization framework based on Pearson correlation-based adaptive variable grouping outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers.},

This paper represents a further stage within this topic in the field of operators defined on a finite chain. Mainly, two families of discrete operators are studied: discrete conjunctions that are smooth (a property that is usually considered the equivalent to continuity in discrete settings) and commutative discrete conjunctions with n n , the greatest element of the chain, as neutral element, so that only associativity is missing to become discrete t-norms. To determine the cardinality of the first family, we study its explicit representation by alternating sign matrices, obtaining that the cardinality is preserved between both structures and allowing us to relate intrinsic properties of the family of discrete operators with intrinsic properties of such class of matrices. For commutative discrete conjunctions with n n as neutral element, we have considered the concepts of n n -Gog y n n -Magog triangles, allowing us to transform properties of these operators into properties of these triangular arrays ; in particular, their cardinality. In this way, an upper bound for the cardinality of discrete t-norms is achieved.},

  abstract     = {Many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) have received significant achievements in recent years. Maintaining a balance between convergence and diversity becomes a key challenge for many-objective evolutionary algorithms when the number of optimization objectives increases. To address this issue, we propose a many-objective evolutionary algorithm using the indicator preselection and auxiliary angle selection (PSEA). In PSEA, a unit vector-based indicator is proposed to pre-select the population region for increasing selection pressure and maintaining diversity simultaneously, which is utilized to identify a promising region in the objective space. Due to the poor quality of individuals outside the promising region, these individuals in the current population can be temporarily discarded. Then, to ensure the diversity of the population, a new strategy based on the second auxiliary angle strategy is designed to calculate the neighborhood density. Finally, in the environmental selection, these strategies are employed for selecting individuals with good convergence and diversity from the candidate set one by one to enter the next generation. The experimental results on commonly used benchmark test problems and many-objective traveling salesman problems with objectives varying from 5 to 20 have demonstrated that PSEA outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Introducing a handful of pairwise constraints into fuzzy clustering models to revise memberships has been proven beneficial to boosting clustering performance. However, current pairwise constraints-based semi-supervised fuzzy clustering methods suffer from common deficiencies, i.e., the insufficient and imprecise revisions of memberships, by which the further improvement of clustering performance may be encumbered. To yield more pleasurable results, this paper proposes a new pairwise constraints-based semi-supervised fuzzy clustering method with multi-manifold regularization (MMRFCM), which can overcome the above deficiencies simultaneously. Firstly, data are regarded as located in various manifolds, and the multi-manifold regularization is delicately designed to sufficiently revise memberships for all data objects to guarantee good overall clustering performance. Secondly, local structural information is incorporated into designed multi-manifold regularization to ensure the precision and stability of the revisions on memberships. Thirdly, the approximated non-linear similarities evolving from ensemble p -Laplacian are applied to discover implicit local structures more thoroughly to further strengthen the effect of the multi-manifold regularization. Based on these strategies, MMRFCM efficiently exploits pairwise constraints to sufficiently and precisely modify memberships during the clustering process and thus achieves excellent results. Like most fuzzy clustering methods , MMRFCM is solved by alternative updates and the solutions are locally optimal. In the comprehensive experiments conducted on different types of datasets, MMRFCM successfully outperforms several classical and state-of-the-art fuzzy clustering methods in terms of clustering accuracy (CA), normalized mutual information (NMI), and adjusted rand index (ARI). The excellent results demonstrate the superiority, stability, and reliability of the proposed method.},

How to set the random subspace dimensionality d s ds in decision forests is a considerable issue that impacts classification quality and efficiency, especially for high dimensional cases. To obtain effective and efficient decision forests that are generally suitable for various classification cases, this paper proposes a novel framework, named Efficient Random Subspace decision forest (ERS). A Half-Range Discrete Uniform distribution-based Varied Dimensionality setting (HRDUVD) method is provided for determining the random subspace dimensionality, and the ERS is formed based on the HRDUVD method. In more detail, a simple discrete uniform distribution in a specific range is employed to set with a given probability the number of randomly selected features for each tree in random subspace decision forests. The HRDUVD method removes the hesitation which appropriate d s ds value one should preset for different datasets, while also achieving adequate classification performance along with a relatively short running time. Therefore, setting d s ds using the discrete uniform distribution is a highly useful strategy for the proposed ERS.},

  abstract     = {The fuzzy regression functions approach is a fuzzy inference system that is not rule-based and not based on expert knowledge, unlike classical fuzzy inference systems. The fuzzy regression functions approach can be defined as a fuzzy inference system based on regression analysis using the ordinary least squares method and fuzzy clustering method . As is known, the ordinary least squares method is not effective when there is an outlier in the data set. So, the fuzzy regression functions approach is affected by the outliers. Since the fuzzy regression functions approach is affected by the outlier in the data set, it is inevitable that the intuitionistic fuzzy regression functions approach, which is a generalization of the fuzzy regression functions approach, is also affected by the outliers in the data set. In this study, robust intuitionistic fuzzy regression function approaches that are not affected by the outliers in the data set are proposed. In the proposed approach, the parameter estimation is made using the robust regression-based Welsch, Bisquare, Talwar, Huber, Logistic, and Cauchy functions instead of the ordinary least squares method. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated over Bitcoin and gold time series in different years. The analysis step is carried out separately for the original case of the relevant time series and for the case where they contain outliers. As a result of the analysis, it is concluded that the proposed method gives successful forecasting results both for the case where the time series contains outliers and for the original case. According to the statistical test results, the proposed method creates a statistically significant difference compared to other methods when the data contains outliers.},

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm (GC-ADS), which is based on the idea of grid clustering and Gaussian distribution . Specifically, the data space is first segmented using the grid structure, then the data points are mapped to grids and finally grids are clustered. The anomaly can be preliminarily judged according to the cluster density. To solve the problem that clustering cannot distinguish between noise and anomaly, based on the idea of data similarity and Gaussian distribution , a noise recognition model is designed. In addition, a data filtering model based on grid and sliding window is designed to save memory and retain valid information. The proposed method is compared with the state-of-the-art methods on the Numenta anomaly benchmark. Experimental results indicate that GC-ADS detects anomalies more accurately than other methods with less time cost.},

  abstract     = {Quantile regression neural network (QRNN) model has recently become popular in solving complex nonlinear problems , but the quantile curves achieved by QRNN model may cross each other, leading to unreliable results. To remedy this defect, monotone composite quantile regression neural network (MCQRNN) model is more attractive with non-crossing quantile predictions. However, few works have been involved in the literature to apply MCQRNN model for censoring issues. Based on the data augmentation algorithm, this study presents an iterative estimation method, which is a three-step alternating process, for censored MCQRNN model. Step 1 imputes the censored data through a data augmentation procedure. Step 2 updates the MCQRNN model with the imputed data. Step 3 makes predictions by the updated MCQRNN model. Simulation studies and real data application demonstrate that our proposed method is not only superior to the available censored methods with respect to quantile loss and C-index, but also yields very close prediction results to those obtained by full uncensored data. Avoiding the quantile crossing problem, the proposed method is more flexible to cope with different types of censoring, overcoming the limitation that the existing censored methods only work for single censoring type with unbelievable predictions caused by the crossing phenomenon.},

Moreover, directly using the anchor affinity matrix to approximate the full Laplacian matrix cannot guarantee the best low-rank approximation , which affects the clustering results . To address these problems, this paper proposes a large-scale non-negative subspace clustering method based on Nyström approximation. Firstly, we modify the objective function of the anchor affinity matrix by adding the local structure term, taking into account both the local and global data characteristics for better affinity learning. Secondly, a matrix iterative update rule is derived to optimize the objective function according to the non-negative Lagrangian relaxation, and its rationality and convergence are proved. Finally, two effective Laplacian matrix decomposition methods based on Nyström approximation are designed to obtain more accurate eigenvectors to improve the clustering quality .

It is common to model the human operator as an optimal controller with an unknown weighting matrix which depicts the tradeoff between multiple control objectives. Our aim is thus to learn the weighting matrix of the human objective function using only the system state measurement. Accordingly, for the HiTL system, a composite adaptive inverse optimal control (IOC) approach, which integrates concurrent learning (CL) based composite adaptive estimation and linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization techniques, is proposed to learn human behavior online. The proposed composite adaptive IOC method consists of two steps: first, a composite adaptive update law is proposed to online estimate the human feedback gain matrix , which removes the persistent excitation condition required by traditional adaptive estimation methods, and then, an LMI optimization problem is solved to retrieve the weighting matrix of the human objective function with the learned feedback gain.

On these sophisticated networks, information spreads in an interactive way, and this coevolution spreading may cause emergence. When emergence is out of control, it may lead to some negative effects. So how to forecast emergence by stability monitoring is one of the most important bases for related issues. Most existing studies have focused only on separate macro-level factors or on the spreading principles of only one piece of information at a time. However, the coevolutionary spreading of several pieces of information leads to far greater monitoring and prediction difficulties. In this paper, by integrating mutual influencing factors (e.g., personal preferences, information acceptance, save endowment, and connection strength) a well-established two-stage feedback member model is proposed to reflect real situations of MICSNs. Based on this model, as an indicator of their states, a fixed point of MICSNs, stored information vector sum, is formally deducted. And the validity is verified by well-designed simulations, which compare value fluctuations of this fixed point with those of the irrational population and information existence time. Furthermore, the proposed fixed point can be used to monitor the states of MICSNs, alert administrators to potentially negative events, and provide theoretical guidance for public opinion analysis.},

Based on the relative estimator state between neighbors at triggering instants, the time-varying coupled weight of each agent is used to compensate the global information via designing the adaptive laws. Meanwhile, the integral-type term in event-triggering condition can further enlarge the inter-event times and avoid Zeno behavior. To reduce the switching frequency, the combined switching rules constituted by the dwell time and agent-dependent switching strategies are then established based on time-varying multiple Lyapunov functions .

While some crowdfunding platforms use third-party auditors to verify projects before publishing, this also runs the risk of collusion between crowdfunders and auditors. The recent introduction of blockchain has increased the transparency of crowdfunding, but they, too, lack fraud prevention measures. Obviously, existing crowdfunding trust management schemes are not applicable under a zero-trust scenario. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based trust management mechanism for crowdfunding to address the fraudulent behavior in the existing crowdfunding systems. We introduce an auditor committee to audit crowdfunding projects credibly. A random selection algorithm on the blockchain enables the distributed generation of auditor committees with a trade-off between the randomness of selection and auditor expertise. The audit results are based on independent auditing by the audit committee members and are presented by the smart contract , avoiding the influence of third parties. In addition, we also provide an incentive mechanism to encourage auditors who perform accurate audits. Theoretical analyses and experiments show that our scheme can effectively deal with malicious behaviors and has an acceptable overhead.},

  abstract     = {Multi-object tracking has been extensively studied in pedestrian behavior analysis and vehicle analysis, but has yet to be well extended to the more challenging horse racing scenarios. This work makes the first attempt to systematically analyze challenges for horse racing tracking problems, including occlusion, trajectory staggered, often switching of cameras (i.e., angles of views), and blurred sprint caused by horse competition. An augmentation-based multi-object tracking method (GMOT) is proposed to solve the above-mentioned challenges. The auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network is adopted in GMOT to augment the horse racing data to enhance target detection and re-identification results. Horse racing videos recorded in day and night scenes are both tested in our experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields good results.},

  abstract     = {Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) provides clients with well-trained neural networks for predicting private data. Conventional prediction processes of MLaaS require clients to send sensitive inputs to the server, or proprietary models must be stored on the client-side device. The former reveals client privacy, while the latter harms the interests of model providers. Existing works on privacy-preserving MLaaS introduce cryptographic primitives to allow two parties to perform neural network inference without revealing either party&#39;s data. However, nonlinear activation functions bring high computational overhead and response delays to the inference process of these schemes. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism by which activation functions enhance model expressivity, and design an activation function S - cos that is friendly to secure neural network inference. Our proposed S - cos can be re-parameterized into a linear layer during the inference phase. Further, we propose an inference-time linear model called Beyond Linear Neural Network (B-LNN) equipped with S - cos , which exhibits promising performance on several benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Estimating sequences introduced by Nesterov is an efficient trick to accelerate gradient descent (GD). The stochastic version of estimating sequences is also successfully used to speed up stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In solving the non-smooth convex optimization problems , the convergence rate of SGD with stochastic estimating sequences is O ( 1 / k ) O(1/k) . Here k is the number of iterations. In this paper, we present a new way of constructing estimating sequences. The characteristic of the new estimating sequences is to replace the subgradient with the proximal stochastic gradient. The novelty of the new estimating sequences is to replace the fixed learning rate with the adaptive learning rate . The adaptive learning rate is calculated by the exponential moving average of past squared stochastic gradients. Based on the new estimating sequences, we propose an adaptive proximal SGD algorithm, called ES-APSGD, for solving the large-scale ℓ 1 ℓ1 -norm regularized empirical risk minimization (ERM). The proposed ES-APSGD simplifies the calculation and can obtain a convergence rate of O ( 1 / k 2 ) O(1/k2) . The significant advantage of ES-APSGD is to strengthen the sparsity of solution by adaptively adjusting the threshold magnitude. Experimental results on Lasso and ℓ 1 ℓ1 -norm regularized logistic regression show that ES-APSGD speeds up convergence and obtains the sparser optimal solutions.},

  abstract     = {Group influence evaluation is the fundamental research in social network analysis , whose main task is evaluating the influence of the group consisting of arbitrary nodes in the social network. Many methods have been proposed to measure group influence, such as centrality-based, Monte Carlo, and path-based methods. Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has profound success in social network node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks. GRL integrates nodes, edges, and other information in the network structure to calculate the nodes&#39; embeddings jointly and provide embedding features with richer information than traditional methods. Group influence is related to many factors; existing methods only focus on a single aspect but ignore the various properties. This paper proposes a Subgraph Reconstruction Feature Aggregation Graph Representation Learning based (SRFA-GRL) framework to evaluate the group influence. In the SRFA-GRL framework, a subgraph reconstruction method is proposed to capture the node distribution of the group, and a vector similarity method is proposed to compute the relative distance between the maximal connected subgraph and group embeddings. Vast experiments are conducted on eight real social networks to analyze the effectiveness of the SRFA-GRL model, and the experimental results show that the SRFA-GRL framework outperforms baseline methods .},

In addition, three-way decisions (TWDs), an emerging theory of simulating human decision-making behavior, play an increasingly important role in the study of conflict problems. In order to solve conflict problems under q -rung orthopair fuzzy information ( q -ROFI), we propose a three-way conflict analysis and resolution model based on TWDs and decision-theoretic rough sets (DTRSs) theory, which provides another answer for Deja&#39;s fundamental questions about Pawlak&#39;s conflict model, namely, “what are the inherent causes of conflict?” and “how can a viable strategy be found?” different from the existing ones. To be specific, firstly, we define new conflict distances and conflict function for q -ROFI system using aggregation functions and weight determination method, and prove some of their properties. On this basis, the concepts of three-level of contention set and agent set, a trisection of conflict set under individual contention and contention set, and maximum doughty coalition of q -ROFI are introduced. Secondly, after introducing the rough approximation threshold calculation method on the basis of standard evaluation set, to find the optimal viable strategy under the given q -ROFI, we calculate and sort the score function by the upper and lower approximation operators in the proposed q -rung orthopair fuzzy decision-theoretic rough sets ( q -ROFDTRSs) model. Thirdly, we use the proposed model to study a land-use conflict case in a metropolitan area to verify the feasibility. Finally, from sensitivity and comparative analysis, we verify the stability and validity of the q -ROFDTRSs model.},

  abstract     = {The legal field is generally burdened by paper-heavy activities, and the management of massive amounts of legal judgments without the adoption of computational tools may compromise the effectiveness and efficiency of administration processes. In this paper, we propose MOSTA, a novel unsupervised method to support the automated identification of groups of legal judgments with similar characteristics, with the goal of reducing the manual effort necessary for the management of legal judgments. Methodologically, MOSTA learns two different embedding models for legal judgments. The first aims to represent the semantics of the textual content, while the second aims to represent co-citations of legal acts, also considering the granularity of the citations. Such representations are then fused through a multi-view approach based on an autoencoder , and the obtained representation is finally exploited by a novel overlapping clustering algorithm . The latter is an additional strong point of MOSTA, since, contrary to existing approaches, does not rely on additional input parameters that inherently influence the degree of overlap of the resulting clusters. Our experiments, performed on three textual datasets, including a real-world legal dataset provided by EUR-Lex, proved that the proposed representation of cited legal acts, the adopted multi-view fusion strategy, and the novel overlapping clustering algorithm implemented in MOSTA provide a positive contribution to the quality of the identified clusters. Finally, MOSTA demonstrated to be able to outperform by a great margin existing complete solutions based on fine-tuned BERT embedding models and existing overlapping clustering algorithms.},

The prevailing approach to harnessing unstructured data involves the utilization of Artificial Intelligence ; however, there exist simpler alternatives capable of yielding valuable information. This article introduces a methodology grounded in information theory to quantify the semantic disparity between the consumer community and product descriptions. This disparity can result in potential misunderstandings in the dialogue among consumers, and incidental costs in the dialogue between consumers and vendors. One plausible explanation for this disparity is that the terminology employed by consumers may possess different meanings compared to that utilized by product description writers. Our methodology employs large corpora of consumer reviews and product descriptions to quantify this semantic disparity across multiple electronic commerce domains through the implementation of random word exchanges and compression. Furthermore, we utilize neural word embeddings to identify specific words exhibiting the greatest semantic drift between reviews and descriptions, thereby providing lexical examples of these gaps. Our findings indicate that lower levels of lexical-semantic gap are associated with better consumer satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {Since machine and deep learning have made accurate solutions possible, the search for explainable predictors has begun. Decision trees are competitive in tasks that require transparency, but have been underestimated due to their insufficient prediction performance, often caused by generalization issues. It is especially noticeable in the case of model trees, designed to solve regression tasks . Evolutionary tree induction can to some extent counteract this over and under-fitting problem with its global approach. In this paper, we examine whether integrating the lasso estimator in the tree induction process, can help to control the interpretability of the decision tree and/or improve its overall performance. We propose a new evolutionary model tree inducer called Global Lasso Tree. Its novelty lies in regularization of linear models coefficients , in the leaves during the evolutionary search. To reduce the tree&#39;s tendency to misfit, a weighted fitness function is used to dynamically balance the trade-off between conflicting objectives which is the tree error and overall complexity. The proposed method was validated on 26 publicly available regression data sets. The empirical study showed that by using the lasso-based regularization technique, we were able to steer the tree&#39;s interpretability and thus generate simpler and significantly more accurate trees.},

While the former ignores the preferences (individual values) of decision-makers (DMs), the latter is most often based on the implicit assumption that DMs are mutually independent, which results in the loss of a large amount of decision-making information about the actual interactions between DMs. Moreover, numerous studies on GDM did not pay enough attention to individual participation and satisfaction in the decision-making process. To overcome these defects, in this paper, we construct a new kind of consensus models for group utility optimization. We employ 2-additive Choquet integral to aggregate the utilities of individual DMs interacting pairwise. Linear programming is used to learn fuzzy measures (weights) that are consistent with a partial preorder of DMs. Moreover, we describe the coordinator&#39;s fairness preference and tolerant behavior with the help of Gini coefficient and orness operator, thus exploring the impacts of coordinator&#39;s psychological behaviors on consensus reaching. The orness operator of the Choquet integral is generalized to a particularly useful 2-additive form with Möbius representation.

Under this model, federated learning integrated with blockchain is used to implement a co-trust mechanism for distributed learning while guaranteeing the credibility of data through blockchain traceability. Our model can guarantee both data security and authenticity with no need of generalization for privacy protection and coordination of centralized servers for distributed controls. Experiments are performed on the two classic datasets, MovieLens and Amazon, with different sparsity . The results have shown that MuKG improves the recommendation accuracy by 1.5\% and diversity by 18\% while ensuring data security and credibility in sparse data. We also verify that different data characteristics have different influence on the recommendation results.},

Secondly, the asynchronous H∞ controller is designed to ensure that HNHSSs are p th moment finite-time stochastically stabilizable ( p -MFTS stabilizable) and satisfy H∞ performance. When designing the asynchronous H∞ controller, deterministic asynchrony and stochastic asynchrony are considered simultaneously. Moreover, since the coefficients of HNHSSs have highly nonlinear structures without satisfying the linear growth condition (LGC), the Lyapunov function U and the operator LU are bounded by polynomials of degree higher than p , which means that weaker conditions of p -MFTS stability are proposed.

  abstract     = {Perpetually improving mortality prediction in intensive care units (ICUs) via the implementation of eHealth evaluation approaches has become a major research hotspot in the field of medical data mining for the purpose of saving lives. Recently, researchers have attempted to achieve improved prediction accuracy by using only deep learning-based techniques. However, some problems remain. (1) Most of the existing methods utilize independent clinical features to predict mortality by eliminating the correlations between the latent features, but this technique may fail to comprehensively capture and evaluate the statuses of patients. (2) Several clinical features are needed to ensure strong prediction accuracy, but most methods only use static features that are not extendable. (3) An effective practical framework that unifies traditional ICU scoring systems and state-of-the-art deep learning methods to predict mortality is also lacking. (4) Moreover, the interpretability of existing deep learning-based methods needs to be further improved. Therefore, we propose a novel d ual-core m utual l earning f ramework (DMLF) between ICU scoring systems and clinical features for mortality prediction. In particular, we mutually utilize s equential o rgan f ailure a ssessment (SOFA) scores and clinical measurement features to learn a unified model for enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of our DMLF. Experiments conducted on five real-world disease datasets show that the DMLF achieves significantly better prediction accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values than six baselines and four state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, clinicians utilize a familiarized SOFA system to conduct mortality prediction and achieve increased interpretability, which benefits the adoption of the proposed framework in real clinical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Isolation Forests (IF) and improved algorithms about anomaly scores are commonly used to detect global, local, or clustered anomalies. However, these algorithms are limited in considering all three anomalies simultaneously. To solve this problem, we propose a novel detection algorithm called KDF-IF. The KDF-IF algorithm redesigns the calculation of the anomaly score based on the Kernel Density Fluctuation (KDF) factor. By focusing on the density fluctuation of each instance neighborhood, the KDF draws the global, local, and clustered features for detecting the three types of anomalies. With the support of the Isolation Trees, the distance between instances in the traditional KDF is replaced by the path length to reduce the computational cost. Simulation results denote that the KDF-IF performance for three types of anomalies is significantly better than IF under the UCI datasets. Besides, the KDF-IF is used to effectively detect anomalies in the environmental dataset of intelligent networks, extending its application range.},

  abstract     = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is made up of sequences of three distinct waves, including the P-wave, QRS-complex, and T-wave. These sequences may contain several different varieties of feature representation, which means various appearances represent different attribute knowledge of heart activity. Consequently, delicate analysis of the ECG attribute knowledge is critical, which focuses on empowering computers to understand ECG signals in a way physicians do. Traditional ECG systems usually only focus on the key wave detection or sub-sequences morphological classification, and the complex ECG features make the analysis process difficult to handle both tasks. In this paper, our goal is to propose a novel ECG analysis technique for ECG medical attribute knowledge feature extraction, termed ECG-MAKE method. The ECG-MAKE method mainly addresses two challenging issues—ECG signal key points detection and morphological delineation—by introducing four modules: signal preprocessing, key point detection, adaptive error correction, and attribute knowledge extraction. Signal preprocessing is based on a wavelet multi-resolution algorithm, which extracts both time and frequency domain information simultaneously, and achieves the goal of enhancing raw signals by filtering signals below 1 Hz and above 100 Hz. The key point detection combines mean-value difference and sliding window to detect R-peak. And according to the R-peak, further utilizes the ECG rules and threshold to detect the onset, peak, and offset of different heartbeat waveforms such as the P-waves and T-waves. Then, for standard 12-lead ECG, the adaptive error correction can automatically correct the spatial position of certain leads missed and false detection key points. Finally, the attribute knowledge extraction module is based on the statistical features of key points to obtain the ECG attributes knowledge of clinical diagnosis of ECG. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available database QT database (99.57\% F1-score) have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed ECG-MAKE method. The proposed method has a higher classification performance than current state-of-the-art methods with an F1-score performance of 94.30\% on the ZZU-ECG database.},

  abstract     = {Recently, as a particle-based Bayesian inference method, Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) has attracted much attention due to its strong approximation power and efficiency compared to traditional variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods. However, the original SVGD method assumes the descent direction to be within an reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which on one hand limits its expressive power , and on the other hand suffers from the curse of dimensionality . To address this issue, we propose to parameterize the descent direction using a flexible neural network . With this parameterization strategy, the descent direction can be possibly optimized in each step for updating the particles, such that the target distribution can be expected to be better approximated. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, especially in the high-dimensional situations, as compared with the original SVGD.},

Two novel algorithms utilizing the framework of moving horizon estimation (MHE) are proposed, which are fully distributed, scalable and allow for taking into account constraints on the noises and the system states. The proposed methods estimate the state by minimizing a local quadratic objective function, which can be efficiently solved by quadratic programming (QP). Consensus technique is employed to fuse information to construct the local quadratic objective function for each node. The first algorithm, which minimizes a quadratic function involving consensus on measurement costs (CM), approaches the centralized MHE with a sufficiently large number of consensus steps. The second one involving consensus both on arrival costs (CA) and measurement costs , enjoys the benefits of both the CA and CM. To avoid directly running consensus on some functions, a novel consensus strategy for the CM is developed. The estimation errors of the proposed methods are proven to be stochastically ultimately bounded under certain conditions. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Deploying person re-identification (Re-ID) models in edge devices is of great importance in the field of intelligent surveillance. It can not only relieve the computational pressure on cloud data centers , but also effectively protects data privacy (e.g., pedestrian identity). However, current Re-ID methods mostly rely on the large-scale backbone with huge parameters, making them impossible to deploy in edge devices. To solve this problem, light-weight Re-ID backbones came into being. The current proposed light-weight Re-ID backbones are all multi-branch parallel structures based on multi-scale ideas. Nonetheless, an excessive number of parallel branches tend to extract redundant information, which takes up too much storage resources and easily leads to overfitting of the model structure. These problems limit the performance of the current models. In this paper, we innovatively propose a blocks-by-blocks combine-and-expand (BB-CE) training method. First we construct a base architecture using the proposed single-branch multi-scale (SMS) module. Then, by combining and expanding the blocks in the base architecture stage by stage during training, BB-CE training method can reduce the redundancy of the structure, utilize the multi-scale information more efficiently, and thus improve the matching accuracy of re-identification. Extensive experimental results on four generic person Re-ID datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Most of the existing forensic methods are aimed at detecting a specific manipulation. However, due to the superimposed processing artifacts caused by using different operations to forge images, the image global processing operator chain identification, which is composed of multiple global manipulations in a certain order, remains a challenge. In this paper, we focus on detecting multiple manipulations and identifying the order of these manipulations. By analyzing the relationship between blind signal separation and operator chain identification, we find that the independent source features of different operations will be coupled when the image is processed by multiple operations, which is similar to what in blind signal separation . Therefore, it is reasonable to formulate the problem of operator chain identification with blind signal separation. Then, a feature decoupling method is proposed to estimate the source feature from the coupled features by optimizing a decoupling matrix. These estimated decoupled features are valid evidence for operator chain identification. For the realistic scenario where images are saved in JPEG format, the comparison with some state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that the proposed method could identify operator chains with better performance.},

The methodology we propose is relying on Formal Concept Analysis for the creation of the hierarchical structure used for determining the similarity of tags&#39; usage in different ODPs.

Further, we apply semantic similarity measures to reduce the complexity of the cross-portal data structure while preserving all its characteristics. We demonstrate how our approach can be used for determining dataset category across multiple ODPs aligned using the data structure our approach generates. We envision our approach to improve cross-portal search and metadata enrichment through open data categorization.

Combining niche techniques with evolutionary algorithms significantly improve their ability to solve MMOPs. Clustering algorithms are useful niche techniques divide the population into subpopulations based on different characteristics. Second, we propose two new mutation operators based on nbest. Last, an adaptive species redistribution mechanism based on the opposition-based learning (OBL) mechanism is proposed during the evolutionary iteration of NDC-DE to enhance the diversity of niches.

  abstract     = {Class imbalance and class overlapping problems can exist simultaneously in the imbalanced learning. However, most of the existing algorithms mainly focus on the former. Although some recent algorithms focus on the class overlapping problem, they do not effectively identify the overlapping region, resulting in a loss of sample information, and they are always applied to the original samples with low quality. To address these problems, this paper proposes an imbalanced ensemble learning algorithm based on weighted projection clustering grouping and consistent fuzzy sample transformation (PCGDST-IE). Firstly, a weighted projection clustering combination framework (WPCC) guided by Davies-Bouldin clustering effectiveness index (DBI) is designed to obtain high-quality clusters and the clusters are combined to form cross-complete subsets (CCS) with low overlapping. Secondly, a stage-wise hybrid sampling algorithm is designed to realize the de-overlapping and balancing of subsets. Finally, a local–global structure consistency mechanism (LGSCM) is constructed by fuzzy clustering and domain adaption, thereby reducing class overlapping and improving the quality of samples in subsets. Weak classifiers are trained on the balanced subsets, and fused. More than 30 public datasets and over ten representative algorithms are chosen to verify the proposed method. The experimental results show that the PCGDST-IE is significantly better in terms of anti-overlapping, Recall, F1-M, G-M, AUC, and diversity. The major originality of the paper is: (a) proposing the WPCC to realize weighted projection clustering for subsets generation; (b) proposing the SHS to balance class imbalance and overlapping better;(c) proposing the LGSCM for sample transformation to address the quality of subsets; and (d) forming an imbalanced algorithm to better solve the class imbalance and class overlapping problems simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Online target update excels in helping a visual tracking algorithm adapt to variations in target appearance during inference, and thus is preferred by recent advances. However, this technique typically operates in a heuristic manner by updating numerous network parameters with large amounts of online-collected data. This poses a distinct challenge: can the online target update be effectively executed without using the aforementioned approach? To this end, we propose a novel target feature update scheme to reduce the need for tedious data collection and computation-intensive parameter updates. This scheme operates on the principle of causal intervention and is just as effective as default parameter updates in visual tracking. Besides, we explore a novel video-specific target label to capture the context of a specific target in video frames for feature discrimination. This makes target features better fit for appearance changes. Such schemes together with the off-shelf pre-trained classification backbone form a novel online intervention siamese tracker (OIS). When equipped with an unsupervised pre-trained backbone, OIS outperforms current state-of-the-art unsupervised trackers on the OTB and VOT. When exploiting a supervised trained backbone, it competes with typical supervised trackers trained on massive offline training and online tracking data.},

Considering the physical conditions/requirements in practical applications, the sampling period of sensors is assumed to be different from the state updating period of the system. For the purpose of facilitating digital communications over networks, a group of encoders is utilized to convert the measurement signal into codewords with limited bit lengths. A so-called bit rate constraint is introduced to capture the bandwidth-limited nature of communication network. To handle the unknown nonlinearity of the multirate system , both the NN-based observer and NN-based controller are designed to generate the desired state estimates and control input signals, respectively. Then, a unified framework is established to analyze the boundedness of the estimation error and system state as well as the neural network weights. The effects of the bit rate constraint on the resultant control performance is also analyzed. Subsequently, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the existence of the required NN-based output feedback controller . A particle-swarm-optimization-based (PSO-based) algorithm is developed to co-design the desired controller parameter and the bit rate allocation strategy.

  abstract     = {Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a technique that improves the training of deep neural networks, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It has been empirically demonstrated that BatchNorm increases performance, stability, and accuracy, although the reasons for such improvements are unclear. BatchNorm includes a normalization step as well as trainable shift and scale parameters. In this paper, we empirically examine the relative contribution to the success of BatchNorm of the normalization step, as compared to the re-parameterization via shifting and scaling. To conduct our experiments, we implement two new optimizers in PyTorch, namely, a version of BatchNorm that we refer to as AffineLayer, which includes the re-parameterization step without normalization, and a version with just the normalization step, that we call BatchNorm-minus. We compare the performance of our AffineLayer and BatchNorm-minus implementations to standard BatchNorm, and we also compare these to the case where no batch normalization is used. We experiment with four ResNet architectures (ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and ResNet101) over a standard image dataset and multiple batch sizes. Among other findings, we provide empirical evidence that the success of BatchNorm may derive primarily from improved weight initialization.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the distributed resilient fusion filtering (DRFF) issue under inverse covariance intersection (ICI) fusion criterion and dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (DETMs), where the physical plant is described by stochastic nonlinear multi-sensor networked systems (MSNSs) with time-varying system parameters and multiple missing measurements (MMMs). The measurements from various sensor nodes to the fusion center may undergo the missing data, where this phenomenon is depicted by means of random variables governed by certain statistical principles. In addition, the DETM is adopted to regulate the communication process from each sensor node to fusion center, which can alleviate the network transmission situations with communication overload and energy consumption limitation. The purpose of the addressed issue is to construct a set of local resilient filters (LRFs) for stochastic nonlinear MSNSs with MMMs via the DETM, which can guarantee that the minimized upper bounds are derived and the desirable filter gain with easy-to-implementation form is given. Subsequently, via the obtained LRFs, a unified framework of the DRFF approach is formulated through using the ICI fusion criterion. In addition, the monotonicity analysis of the obtained upper bound in regard to the triggered parameter is examined by providing rigorous theoretical proof. Finally, the simulations with comparison experiment are provided to illustrate the validity of presented DRFF technique.},

  abstract     = {In cluster analysis, a problem often addressed is finding a consensus on a set of hierarchical classifications of the same set of objects, named primary hierarchies (dendrograms). A unique consensus of the primary hierarchies, called a secondary hierarchy, is sufficient to synthesize the relevant clustering information only when the primary dendrograms are similar to one another. In contrast, when several differences are observed, more than one consensus secondary hierarchy is required to clearly synthesize the different primary hierarchies. Our methodology, PARoDENo3WD (PARtition of DENdrograms of a 3-Way Data array), aims to obtain a secondary fuzzy partition of the primary hierarchies, where hierarchies belonging to the same class are perceived as similar. Each class is associated with a consensus hierarchy. The fuzzy approach allows each primary hierarchy to contribute to the definition of all classes of the secondary partition, according to different membership degrees. In this way, the ‘ clustering uncertainty ’ is taken into account. Indeed, in several realistic applications, primary dendrograms belonging to different classes of the secondary partition may share some similar features. The performance of PARoDENo3WD is evaluated by an extended simulation study, generating 1800 three-way datasets. An application of PARoDENo3WD on a real data set is given.},

High-utility sequence mining as a novel hot issue is more challenging and has generally attracted plenty of attention. Our paper focuses on mining high-utility sequences in a more complicated environment with high efficiency. Most of the previous methods for utility mining aim to find high-utility sequences suitable for items with positive values, but most real-world situations contain items with both positive and negative values. Several algorithms have been applied to the above sophisticated situation and can be used as our comparing algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the FHUSN ( F ast mining H igh U tility S equences with N egative item ) algorithm to mine high-utility sequences in situations with or without negative utility values.

  abstract     = {News recommendation systems represent a critical solution to the problem of information overload, as they can suggest news that may be of interest to a particular user. Traditional recommendation systems require the collection of private information, which can lead to serious privacy concerns. Federated learning is a privacy-preserving framework that allows multiple users to train a global model without sharing their private data. In federated learning, users keep their private data locally and calculate the local gradients. In recommendation systems, however, the situation is the opposite, as users need to share their preferences with the server. Notably, user preferences are highly relevant to user privacy. The difference between recommendation systems and federated learning may lead to user privacy leakage . Accordingly, in this paper, we propose RD-FedRec, which follows a paradigm commonly used in real-world recommendation systems. First, we propose a randomized decomposition method to protect the privacy of user preferences, which has good compatibility and can preserve the privacy of recommendation results. Second, to improve recommendation efficiency, we introduce a recall phase that roughly filters news, thereby reducing the time overhead of the ranking phase. We implement RD-FedRec and evaluate its performance on two real-world datasets. Experimental results show that the accuracy and efficiency of RD-FedRec are comparable to state-of-the-art recommendation systems that do not provide privacy guarantees, and moreover that our proposed randomized decomposition method is compatible with most recommendation systems.},

  abstract     = {The increasing utilization of medical imaging technology with digital storage capabilities has facilitated the compilation of large-scale data repositories. Fast access to image samples with similar appearance to suspected cases in these repositories can help establish a consulting system for healthcare professionals, and improve diagnostic procedures while minimizing processing delays. However, manual querying of large repositories is labor intensive. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) offers an automated solution based on quantitative assessment of image similarity based on image features in a latent space. Since conventional methods based on hand-crafted features typically show poor generalization performance , learning-based CBIR methods have received attention recently. A common framework in this domain involves classifier-guided models that are trained to detect different image classes. Similarity assessments are then performed on the features captured by the intermediate stages of the trained models. While classifier-guided methods are powerful in inter-class discrimination, they are suboptimally sensitive to within-class differences in image features . An alternative framework instead performs task-agnostic training to learn an embedding space that enforces the representational discriminability of images. Within this representational-learning framework, a powerful method is triplet-wise learning that addresses the deficiencies of point-wise and pair-wise learning in characterizing the similarity relationships between image classes. However, the traditional triplet loss enforces separation between only a subset of image samples within the triplet via a manually-set constant margin value, so it can lead to suboptimal segregation of opponent classes and limited generalization performance . To address these limitations, we introduce a triplet-learning method for automated querying of medical image repositories based on a novel Opponent Class Adaptive Margin ( OCAM ) loss. To maintain optimally discriminative representations, OCAM considers relationships among all image pairs within the triplet and utilizes an adaptive margin value that is automatically selected per dataset and during the course of training iterations. CBIR performance of OCAM is compared against state-of-the-art loss functions for representational learning on three public databases (gastrointestinal disease, skin lesion, lung disease). On average, OCAM shows an mAP performance of 86.30\% in the KVASIR dataset, 70.30\% in the ISIC 2019 dataset, and 85.57\% in the X-RAY dataset. Comprehensive experiments in each application domain demonstrate the superior performance of OCAM against competing triplet-wise methods at 1.52\%, classifier-guided methods at 2.29\%, and non-triplet representational-learning methods at 4.56\%.},

Second, the proposed method utilizes a consistent representation module to ensure consistency and obtains a consistent graph. Furthermore, we also extend the proposed method to incomplete multi-view scenarios. The designed contrastive fusion module utilizes the complementarity of multiple views to fill in the missing view graphs. Moreover, the consistent feature representation module adds a maxpooling layer on CCR-Net to explore a shared local structure and extract a latent low-dimensional embedding. Finally, the proposed method presents end-to-end training and flexible task interfaces for multi-view learning.

  abstract     = {Despite impressive capabilities and outstanding performance, deep neural networks (DNNs) have become a growing concern among the public due to their frequently-appearing erroneous behaviors. As a result, it is urgent to test the security issues with DNNs systematically before they are deployed to the real world. Fine-grained metrics based on neuron coverage have been provided by existing testing approaches, and various approaches have been proposed to enhance these metrics. However, it has been gradually realized that a higher neuron coverage does not necessarily represent better capabilities in identifying defects that lead to errors. Besides, coverage-guided methods cannot hunt errors due to faulty training procedure. So the robustness improvement of DNNs via retraining by these testing examples are unsatisfactory. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the concept of excitable neurons based on Shapley value and design a white-box testing framework for DNNs, namely DeepSensor . It is motivated by our observation that neurons with larger responsibility towards model loss changes due to small perturbations are more likely related to incorrect corner cases due to potential defects. By maximizing the number of excitable neurons that correspond to various incorrect behaviors of models, DeepSensor can generate testing examples that effectively trigger more erroneous security issues caused by malicious inputs (both adversarial and polluted data) and incomplete training. Extensive experiments implemented on both image classification models and speaker recognition models have demonstrated the superiority of DeepSensor. Compared to the state-of-the-art testing methods, DeepSensor has the ability to find more wrong model behaviors due to malicious inputs (i.e., ∼×1.2 for adversarial and ∼×4.7 for polluted data) and incompletely-trained DNNs. Additionally, it can help DNNs build larger l 2 -norm robustness bound (∼×3) via retraining according to CLEVER&#39;s certification. Furthermore, we provide interpretable certifications for effectiveness of DeepSensor by identifying excitable neurons and visualizations via t-SNE.

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, such as node classification , link prediction and graph classification. However, graph-structured data is usually imbalanced in many real-world scenarios. When trained on an imbalanced dataset, the performance of GNNs is distant from satisfactory for nodes of minority classes. Due to the small population, these minority nodes have less engagement in the objective function of training and the message passing mechanism behind GNNs exacerbates this problem further, as the information from minority nodes can be overwhelmed by majority nodes in the process of information propagation. To tackle the problems of imbalanced node classification based on GNNs, the most effective way is to promote the engagement of minority nodes during propagation. Therefore, inspired by self-supervised learning on exploring useful information from unlabeled data samples, we propose a novel model-agnostic framework in this paper, named INS-GNN, which tackles the imbalanced node classification problem. Specifically, self-supervised pre-training is firstly used as a pretext task to pre-train the model without label information, which can effectively alleviate the phenomenon that imbalanced labels naturally impose label bias during learning. Then, self-training is exploited to assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled nodes and conduct self-supervised learning to help model training. It can effectively alleviate the problem that obtaining numerous annotation nodes is time-consuming and resource-costly. Finally, self-supervised edge augmentation is utilized to change the structure information of the minority nodes for enhancing the contribution of minority nodes. Experimental results on various real-world datasets demonstrate INS-GNN is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on solving the imbalanced node classification problem.},

  abstract     = {Current sequence labeling systems are typically based on CNNs-BiLSTM-CRF, which has been viewed as a standard method. However, on one hand, the standard method often uses static word embedding to embed input words without considering the polysemy. On the other hand, BiLSTM has limitations in modeling the global context information, which further makes the standard method hard to correctly recognize the label of words that are ambiguous. In this paper, we propose a multi-level topic-aware mechanism to obtain word-level and corpus-level topic representations for sequence labeling tasks. The word-level topic representation can capture different word sense to some extent and enhance the discriminative of each word. The corpus-level topic representation is a kind of global semantic information which is helpful for the understanding of a word in different contexts. Both of the word-level and corpus-level topic representations are adaptively fused with sequential information extracted by BiLSTM via a proposed fusion gate. Experimental results validate the superior performance of the proposed model compared with state-of-the-art variants of the standard methods. In particular, the multi-level topic-aware mechanism is helpful for achieving better performances on words that are ambiguous.},

While there have been numerous attempts to predict HF, many have failed to consider the coexisting risk factors and their complex relationships with one another. In this research paper, we present an early warning and prediction method for HF using deep learning approaches. Our proposed method involves a risk factor selection method to identify significant risk factors that contain relevant and valuable information for HF prediction. Additionally, we present an anomaly detection method to eliminate abnormal data that may be caused by mood changes or environmental factors.

  abstract     = {Recent works on providing proper sparse or low-rank priors have shown to result in good quality image restoration performance. The nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) of images indicates that groups stacked by similar patches not only have low-rank characteristic, but also have sparse characteristic. However, many of the existing methods for image modeling use one or the other of these characteristics, but not both, which may limit the performance of image denoising . We propose in this paper a novel model for image denoising , designated as the bilateral weighted sparse coding and low-rank (BWSCLR) model, which exploits simultaneously the low-rank property and the bilateral weighted sparse coding under the NSS prior to better restore the texture and the edges of images contaminated by noise. Furthermore, a block coordinate descent algorithm involving three steps is proposed to obtain the solution for our model. A number of experiments on denoising different image scenarios, including gray-scale and color images are carried out, and the results clearly show the superior performance of the proposed BWSCLR method over that of the state-of-the-art algorithms not only in terms of the quantitative metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, but also in perceptual quality .},

  abstract     = {Recent research on adversarial attacks has highlighted the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to perturbations. While existing studies generate adversarial perturbations spread across the entire image, these global perturbations may be visible to human eyes, reducing their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To alleviate this issue, recent works propose to modify a limited number of input pixels to implement adversarial attacks . However, these approaches still have limitations in terms of both imperceptibility and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel plug-in framework called Sensitive Region-Aware Attack (SRA) to generate soft-label black-box adversarial examples using the sensitivity map and evolution strategies. First, a transferable black-box sensitivity map generation approach is proposed for identifying the sensitive regions of input images. To perform SRA with a limited amount of perturbed pixels, a dynamic l 0 l0 and l ∞ l∞ adjustment strategy is introduced. Furthermore, an adaptive evolution strategy is employed to optimize the selection of generated sensitive regions, allowing for the execution of effective and imperceptible attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that our SRA achieves an imperceptible soft-label black-box attack with a 96.43\% success rate using less than 20\% of the image pixels on ImageNet and a 100\% success rate using 30\% of the image pixels on CIFAR-10.},

However, GANs training is still challenging, often leading to mode-collapse, where a certain type of samples dominates the generated output. To address this issue, we propose a novel training algorithm based on bidirectional GANs (BiGANs) that can be generalized to any implicit generative model . Our algorithm relies on a non-uniform sampling scheme, where data points in a minibatch are sampled with probability inversely proportional to their log-evidence. However, estimating log-evidence is computationally expensive. Instead, we propose to use the reconstruction error, which directly correlates with the log-evidence and only requires a BiGAN network evaluation. Additionally, we combine the aforementioned method with a regularization in the empirical distribution of the encoder that further boosts the performance. Our empirical results show that the proposed methods improve both the quality and diversity of the generated samples.},

Blockchain technology is essential to achieving decentralized trust management, its consensus mechanism is useful in addressing large-scale data sharing and data consensus challenges. Herein, an n-party quantum detectable Byzantine agreement (DBA) based on the GHZ state to realize the data consensus in a quantum blockchain is proposed, considering the threat posed by the growth of quantum information technology on the traditional blockchain. Relying on the nonlocality of the GHZ state, the proposed protocol detects the honesty of nodes by allocating the entanglement resources between different nodes. The GHZ state is notably simpler to prepare than other multi-particle entangled states , thus reducing preparation consumption and increasing practicality. When the number of network nodes increases, the proposed protocol provides better scalability and stronger practicability than the current quantum DBA. In addition, the proposed protocol has the optimal fault-tolerant found and does not rely on any other presumptions. A consensus can be reached even when there are n − 2 traitors. The performance analysis confirms viability and effectiveness through exemplification. The security analysis also demonstrates that the quantum DBA protocol is unconditionally secure, effectively ensuring the security of data and realizing data consistency in the quantum blockchain.},

The Robustness, Correlation, and Standard Deviation (ROCOSD) method assigns weight values according to three objectives. The first objectives are intended to minimize the overall maximum deviation from the ratio that the criteria deserve and are based on calculated standard deviations and correlation coefficients. The final one maximizes the minimum change in any criteria weight which leads to a rank reversal on alternatives. We focused on four cases and examined the proposed method, and later created a comparative analysis based on the application of five well-known methods. The average rank correlation consistency and weighting accuracy indicated that ROCOSD achieved better statistics in various ranges (0.0365\% to 37.3393\%), (4.6292\% to 28.4925\%) respectively. Compared to other well-known techniques, the average results for robustness, the primary tenet of ROCOSD, demonstrated that the proposed approach yielded far better results (ranging from 1.6407 to 6.4706 times).

An elite selection mechanism is developed to select elite individuals from the memory pool when the environment changes. Subsequently, an elitism-based transfer learning method is proposed to predict individuals by leveraging the knowledge from the selected elite individuals, thereby improving the computational efficiency and quality of the solutions. Subsequently, a random diversity maintenance strategy is developed to generate diverse individuals within the regions where the predicted individuals are located to defy the loss of diversity in the population. Finally, the generated diverse and predicted individuals are merged to form an initial population to adapt to the new environment. The experimental results have demonstrated the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm for most DMOP test instances in terms of convergence, diversity, and computational efficiency.},

Our method is inspired by partitioning, which divides the homogeneous network into community subgraphs and bridging subgraphs. Then, we use differential privacy and random perturbations to achieve the coding rearrangement and decoding of the subgraph uncertain trees. Next, we perturb the node degree sequence based on the generalization idea and design different reconstruction strategies to perturb the subgraph structure features. Finally, we perform postprocessing to fuse the subgraphs by measuring the sensitivity of the bridging nodes. We conducted extensive experimental analysis on real datasets, and the results show that our privacy protection method can simultaneously guarantee the privacy and availability of homogeneous network data publishing.},

First, a discrete-time consensus-based control protocol is constructed, and the necessary and sufficient condition to achieve queue consensus is presented.

This paper presents an efficient and flexible online service platform architecture for data classification and delves into an in-depth study on pricing design to maximize revenue. To construct this online service platform, we address three significant challenges. Firstly, we focus on efficiently modeling accurate classifiers while minimizing consumption. Secondly, we design a flexible pricing mechanism with multiple levels. Lastly, we maximize online revenue based on incomplete information. Through comprehensive consideration of these three challenges, this paper proposes a query-based D ata class I fication ser V ice with onl I ne prici N g m E chanism, named DIVINE, which determines the transaction price of data classification services by learning buyers&#39; valuations online. The theoretical analysis of this paper illustrates that DIVINE can ensure a constant ( 1 + ϵ ) (1+ϵ) competitive ratio compared to the maximal offline revenue with complete information. Finally, DIVINE is evaluated on UCI databases. The experimental results show that it not only exhibits low consumption, multiple levels, and two kinds of robustness but also outperforms existing state-of-the-art pricing mechanisms in terms of revenue, which can achieve about 90\% of the optimal offline revenue and validates the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Gait recognition is an emerging long-distance biometric technology applied in many fields, including video surveillance. The most recent gait recognition methods treat human silhouettes as global or local regions to extract the gait properties. However, the global approach may cause the fine-grained differences of limbs to be ignored, whereas the local approach focuses only on the details of body parts and cannot consider the correlation between adjacent regions. Moreover, as a multi-view task, view changes have a significant impact on the integrity of the silhouette, which necessitates considering the disturbances brought about by the view itself. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel gait recognition framework, namely, gait aggregation multi-feature representation (GaitAMR), to extract the most discriminative subject features. In GaitAMR, we propose a holistic and partial temporal aggregation strategy, that extracts body movement descriptors, both globally and locally. Besides, we use the optimal view features as supplementary information for spatiotemporal features, and thus enhance the view stability in the recognition process. By effectively aggregating feature representations from different domains, our method enhances the discrimination of gait patterns between subjects. Experimental results on public gait datasets show that GaitAMR improves gait recognition in occlusion conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.},

The inherent non-stationarity of time series obtained from actual projects may make it difficult to predict accurately. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, a Double Incremental Learning algorithm via Adaptive Ensemble, termed as AE-DIL for short, is proposed for non-stationary time series prediction . AE-DIL provides a general online prediction framework consisting of two modules. The first detects changes based on the statistical hypothesis test and self-adaptive sliding window technology. The second updates the prediction model based on double incremental learning and adaptive ensemble learning . The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is empirically underpinned by the experiments conducted on seven benchmark time series datasets, compared with several baselines and state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {Indoor gesture recognition technology is concerned with making the machine accurately recognize dynamic gestures within a certain range. Remarkably, most of this technology is based on passive recognition methods. This is quite striking because the high cost is a crucial factor in active recognition methods and ignoring this aspect can increase the reality gap. In this paper, we tend to use the fine-grained channel state information (CSI) in Wi-Fi to build a dynamic CNN-GRU-Attention (CGA) model to implement a gesture recognition system and thus alleviate this problem. Firstly, we study the influence of gestures on the amplitude and phase difference in CSI, and prove the feasibility of proposed method by analyzing the fluctuation of amplitude and phase difference under different conditions. Then, we use data processing methods such as phase correction and unwrapping with a new proposed adaptive gesture action truncation algorithm to extract the phase difference and remove redundant information, thus ensuring the validity of data. Finally, we propose to segment gesture fragment into 3-channel CSI images as input information of model. Extensive comparison experiments are conducted under the influence of different people, different indoor environments, and different sampling rates. The results show that the system has high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The various variants of the classical least square regression (LSR) have been extensively utilized in numerous applications. However, most previous linear regression methods only consider the fitting between the original features and the corresponding label information. They ignore the correlations among data points. Another problem with these methods is that the strict zero-one binary label matrix is utilized as the final regression target. The degree of freedom is minimal, and the binary label information cannot be adequately fitted. A semi-supervised learning discriminative sparse least square regression (DSLSR) algorithm with some notable characteristics is presented to address the above mentioned issues. Firstly, we utilize the estimated label of the observed samples to design a new objective function in the generalized regression form, further generalizing the previous least square regression framework. Secondly, a novel jointly sparse regularized term is designed to take full use of the estimated label information, which is expected to force the extracted features of each class to be jointly sparse instead of the learned projection being jointly sparse. Thirdly, Label estimation, label relaxation, locality, and joint sparsity are seamlessly integrated into the least square regression (LSR) framework. This property can make the margins of the observed data with the same class label as minimal as feasible while concurrently maximizing the margins of observed data from other classes. The experimental findings reveal that DSLSR outperforms state-of-the-art linear regression-based approaches.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) are mainly reflected in objective changes with changes in the environment. To solve DMOPs, a transfer learning (TL) approach is used, which can continuously adapt to environmental changes and reuse valuable knowledge from the past. However, if all individuals are transferred, they may experience negative transfers. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel knowledge transfer method for the dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (T-DMOEA) to solve DMOPs, which consists of a multi-time prediction model (MTPM) and a manifold TL algorithm. First, according to the movement trend of historical knee points, the MTPM model uses a weighted method to effectively track knee points after environmental changes. Then, the knowledge of the suboptimal solution is reused in the non-knee point set using the manifold TL technique, which yields more high-quality individuals and speeds up the convergence. In the dynamic evolutionary process, the knee points and high-quality solutions are combined to guide the generation of the initial population in the next environment, ensuring the diversity of the population while reducing the computational cost. The experimental results show that the proposed T-DMOEA algorithm can converge rapidly in solving DMOPs while obtaining better-quality solutions.},

The extracted HI exhibits a high correlation with the standard capacity, thus facilitating RUL estimation. (2) By introducing a masked multi-head self-attention module into the time-series prediction model based on LSTM, critical information in the sequences is captured and the prediction performance is improved. (3) An online self-tuning mechanism for the weights and biases of neural networks is designed to correct cumulative estimation errors in long-term predictions and reduce the effects of local fluctuations and regeneration. The proposed prediction model enables the HI values in future cycles to be iteratively estimated using the one-step-ahead method, and the RUL can be forecast once the predicted signal falls.

  abstract     = {We are currently in a network era which enables us to communicate more widely and more easily via the social networks. Meanwhile, negative information, such as fake news, rumors and computer viruses, often spread in social network. In order to restrain the propagation of such negative influence, we must find its sources in the network. But in real-world applications, we usually only know the scope of the negative influence spreading, and do not know who first propagates the negative influence. However, we can identify the sources of the negative influence based on the information of some observed nodes which are negatively influenced. This is the problem of influence sources locating. To tackle this problem, we present a latent space mapping-based method for identifying the multiple influence sources in the independent cascade model. The method first detects the candidate sources of the observed nodes based on message passing in a reversed network. An algorithm is presented to calculate the activation probability between nodes according to the influence spreading pattern in the independent cascade model. To evaluate each node’s rationality as the propagation source, we use the difference between the length of the path influencing an observed node and its activation time. We define two latent spaces, namely the influence senders and receivers’ latent spaces, and map the nodes into these two latent spaces to form a model describing the influence propagation. An estimation-maximization-based algorithm is proposed to optimize the propagation model. Based on this model, we propose a latent space mapping-based algorithm to identify the influence sources. The probability for each node to be a source is calculated by its positions in the latent spaces. Finally, k nodes with the largest probabilities are selected as the sources. Empirical results demonstrate that the influence sources identified by the proposed method can influence more observed nodes at more accurate time than other methods.},

Furthermore, it is possible to add customs clearance agencies, insurance companies, banks, and relevant institutions and organizations to the system. Effective logistics systems must sustainably provide customers with quality and satisfactory logistics services using data shared over advanced technologies. Nevertheless, data and information on logistics are usually challenging to collect, process, and understand, as they are primarily unstructured, unreachable, and unstandardized. Blockchain is a new and advanced technology promising to eliminate or mitigate the adverse effects of these difficulties. However, blockchain technology practices in the logistics industry are extraordinarily scarce; and a few blockchain platforms have attempted to produce solutions for a few large-scale and global logistics firms. Hence, the digital transformation process involving blockchain technology for a logistics company encounters the challenge of selecting an appropriate blockchain platform for the logistics industry&#39;s needs. Although studies have been carried out in the relevant literature to select a suitable blockchain platform for various industries, few of these studies dealt with selecting the best blockchain platform for the logistics industry . Hence, experimental studies on choosing the proper blockchain platform in the logistics industry that tries to manage outstandingly complicated relations and linkages among stakeholders are currently inadequate. The current study presents a novel, robust, practical, and powerful decision-making tool that can also overcome highly complex uncertainties to identify the most feasible blockchain technology for the logistics industry.

To address these issues, the current study proposes an algorithm that enhances the exploration capability of GSA using a disruption strategy with chaotic dynamics. If no significant change is observed in diversity values during the initial stages of the search process, disruption is performed using a sigmoid function . Then, the search process executes gradual exploitation using a sigmoid function without chaotic dynamics. The proposed algorithm is tested with GSA, CGSA, and PSO (particle swarm optimization) on 28 benchmark functions . It is observed that the algorithm outperforms GSA and PSO in 19 cases and CGSA in 20 cases. Diversity analysis shows that the algorithm generates superior exploration versus exploitation percentage with improved mean diversity values. To determine its robustness, the algorithm is applied to four unconstrained engineering problems. The results suggest that the algorithm can solve practical engineering problems in a reasonable number of iterations.},

To address this limitation, we propose to explore the relationship patterns hidden in feature space using the techniques of network science, and based on the exploration, we develop a new differential evolution (DE) and a new multiobjective DE (MODE) for single-objective and multiobjective FS problems, respectively. In particular, we construct a feature network to represent the complex relationships between features and propose to explore the relational patterns from the perspective of the network. After that, the features with rich information are highlighted as high-degree nodes, and some features are grouped together as clusters in the feature network. Motivated by these observations, we further propose to improve the search processes of DE and MODE and produce two network-based DEs, namely, NetG-DE and NetG-MODE. Experimental results over several datasets demonstrate that the proposed NetG-DE and NetG-MODE outperform the baseline.},

The established fairness-aware large-scale collective opinion generation model advocates an adjusted bi-objective optimization model that maximizes the confidence level and fairness utility within the decision group for opinion aggregation on both intra-group and inter-group levels. It is endowed with the flexibility to be combined with context-specific expert classification and criterion weight assignment techniques to generate powerful large-scale group decision making prototypes that accommodate with diversifying decision-making scenarios.

We further theoretically analyze the mean and mean-square performance of the resilient distributed estimation, and propose an optimal reference neighbor selection scheme to enhance the network estimation performance. Illustrative simulations validate the superior performance of both FDI attack detection and parameter estimation of the proposed distributed algorithms for adversarial networks, especially under heavy and time-varying FDI attacks. The theoretical results well predict the performance of the proposed resilient distributed estimation algorithm .},

The adaptive fully distributed state observers with quantization information are designed to eliminate the dependence on the Laplacian matrix . For MASs with unknown model matrix , a novel fixed-time observer-based regulator equation is employed, which avoids repeatedly getting the unnecessary solution of universal one in the time-varying cooperation-competition communication topology. In this case, both fixed-time state-feedback and output-feedback controllers are constructed such that the output consensus tracking is achieved regardless the state value is available or unavailable. Besides, the upper bound of convergence time can be adjusted only by parameters without initial states. Lyapunov functions are established to derive conditions of achieving consensus tracking by mathematical analysis. Eventually, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is manifested by simulation results.},

Firstly, a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed to obtain the less conservative stability results. Then, in order to cooperate with the introduced LKF, the free-matrix-based inequality (FMBI) is employed in the estimation of the integral quadratic terms . Next, by utilizing the new negative definite conditions (NDCs) of matrix-valued cubic polynomials , the stability conditions are presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In addition, in the establishment process of these conditions, no extra state variables are introduced and the positive definite constraint on the LKF is relaxed. Finally, the validity and advantages of the proposed conditions are illustrated with some classical numerical examples.},

Furthermore, many traditional classification models make arbitrarily overconfident predictions outside the range of the training data. These issues severely impact the deployment and usefulness of these models in real life. In this paper, we propose the boundary regularizing out-of-distribution (BROOD) sampler, which adds artificial data points on the edge of the training data. By exploiting these artificial samples, we are able to regularize the decision surface of discriminative machine learning models and make more prudent predictions. Next, it is crucial to correctly classify many positive instances in a limited pool of instances that can be investigated with the available resources. By smartly assigning predetermined nonuniform class probabilities outside the training data, we can emphasize certain data regions and improve classifier performance on various material classification metrics. The good performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated in a case study that consists of both benchmark balanced and imbalanced classification data sets.},

Unlike previous researchers, we designed a corpus-level sentiment knowledge fusion mechanism with storage, update, and sharing functions, which can help the model to better understand the sentiment information of various opinion words in the dataset. Specifically, we first constructed a dependency graph for each sentence and refined the weights of the edges by the relative distance between the aspect terms and context words. We then introduced two special sentiment knowledge nodes in the graph to establish connections with opinion words by leveraging external sentiment lexicons. We set these two nodes to be globally shared and updatable, which allowed the model to learn corpus-level and domain-specific sentiment knowledge. This knowledge can help the model to generate a better aspect representation that contains rich contextual information and sentiment knowledge. Extensive experiments were conducted on several public datasets, and the experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.

A change to code clone may result in a consistent-defect if the developers forget to verify the consistency of the code after the change. To reduce such change-related maintenance costs, researchers have proposed a number of methods for predicting clone consistency in advance. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these cross-project models is unsatisfactory, and performing such predictions with insufficient data remains a challenge. Meanwhile, cross-project defect prediction via transfer learning method is prevalent in the software engineering community. Consequently, we first construct an empirical study to explore whether transfer-learning techniques could well be utilized for clone cross-project consistent-defect prediction in the initial stages of software development. In this paper, we employ transfer-learning techniques to predict clone consistency at both the time of clone creating and clone changing in order to avoid clone consistent-defects and maintenance. We conduct an experiment on open-source projects to evaluate the effectiveness of various transfer-learning methods. Our investigation demonstrates that transfer-learning techniques have a beneficial impact on predicting cross-project clone consistent-defect, and that the size of the dataset also has a positive effect on prediction.

We add Just Noticeable Difference (JND) as prior information into adversarial attacks , making image changes in areas that are insensitive to the human eyes. By integrating the JND matrix into the L p norm, PS Attack projects perturbations onto the JND space around clean data, resulting in more imperceivable adversarial perturbations. PS Attack also mitigates the trade-off between the imperceptibility and transferability of adversarial images by adjusting a visual coefficient. Extensive experiments manifest that combining PS attacks with state-of-the-art black-box approaches can significantly promote the naturalness of adversarial examples while maintaining their attack ability. Compared to the state-of-the-art transferable attacks, our attacks reduce LPIPS by 8\% on average when attacking typically-trained and defense models.},

The dual QPPs of the ETSVM do not involve matrix inversion , in contrast to conventional TSVM. As a result, ETSVM can avoid the ill-conditioning case. We theoretically discuss its properties, including exploring the violation tolerance upper bound for the two QPPs of ETSVM. In order to increase computing efficiency, we derive a sequence of safe screening rules using variational inequalities to quicken the ETSVM parameter tuning process (SSR-ETSVM).

Recently, researchers have proposed self-supervised methods, especially the contrastive learning approach, which can build a universal representation framework for downstream tasks through data augmentation and contrastive loss. Although it alleviates the shortage of labeled data, the data augmentation approach directly transferred from computer vision is not appropriate for the time domain due to noise vectors and unrelated variables that may interfere with the accuracy of representation. In this paper, we propose a novel time series forecasting model based on disentangled seasonal-trend representation named ACST. It employs an improved cycle generative adversarial data augmentation method to generate samples close to real data for contrastive loss. Moreover, we apply gated residual networks and a noise decomposition module to reduce the impact of different noise vectors and feature variable weights on the results. Extensive experiments show that ACST achieves an average improvement of 26.8\% on six benchmarks.},

However, increasing ITS devices impose grand challenges in privacy-preserving and efficient data sharing. Recent research has demonstrated that integrating searchable symmetric encryption in blockchain enables privacy-preserving data sharing among ITS devices. However, existing solutions focus only on single-keyword searches over encrypted ITS data on the blockchain and suffer from privacy and efficiency issues when extended to multi-keyword scenarios. This work proposes a bloom filter-based multi-keyword search protocol for ITS data with enhanced efficiency and privacy preservation . We design a bloom filter to select a low-frequency keyword from the multiple keywords input by the ITS data owner. The low-frequency keyword can filter out a large portion of the ITS data from the search result, thus significantly reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, each identifier-keyword pair is attached with a pseudorandom tag that enables the completion of a search operation in only one round. In this manner, privacy is preserved because there are no intermediate rounds and results. In addition to the multi-keyword search protocol, we specify the addition and deletion protocols to enable dynamic updates of data records. We conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation of the protocols. The experimental results indicate that the proposed multi-keyword search protocol saves 14.67\% query time and 59.96\% financial cost.},

However, most existing methods assume a specific distribution for image noise estimation, which is intractable to handle complex variations. Besides, they usually use convex norm to describe the noise sparse and low-rank property, and it is a biased approximation . To address these problems, we propose a novel nonconvex regularized robust mixed error coding (NRRM) method, which uses mixed norms from both 1D and 2D perspectives to model the complex image noise without convex relaxation . In specific, we use weighted ℓ 2 ℓ2 -norm based robust coding to characterize the sparse noise in images, and weighted matrix nuclear norm to characterize the low-rank noise. Compared with traditional regression approaches, our method can more fine-grained and accurate to capture noise and alleviate its negative influence for robust recognition. Besides, we constrain the representation component in a group-wise manner to weigh the roles of different classes. The NRRM model is solved efficiently by adopting an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Comprehensive experiments on some benchmark face image databases validate the superiority of NRRM over several state-of-the-art linear representation based methods.},

This paper proposes a quantum support vector machine based on the amplitude estimation (AE-QSVM) which gets rid of the constraint of repetitive process and saves the quantum resources. At first, a generalized quantum amplitude estimation is introduced in which the initial state can be arbitrary instead of being |0〉. Then, AE-QSVM is trained by the quantum singular value decomposition and a query sample is classified by the generalized quantum amplitude estimation. In AE-QSVM, a high accuracy can be achieved by adding auxiliary qubits instead of repeating the algorithm. The time and space complexity of AE-QSVM are reduced compared with other algorithms. Finally, we ran experiments on the IBM&#39;s quantum computer and experimental results demonstrate that classification with a 95\% probability of success only uses 12 qubits.},

Thus, how to effectively reconcile highly-conflicting evidence in DSET is still an open issue. To address this problem, in this paper, a novel belief divergence, higher order belief Jensen-Shannon divergence is proposed to measure the discrepancy between BPAs in DSET. The proposed higher order belief Jensen-Shannon divergence is the first method to dynamically measure the discrepancy between BPAs over the time evolution, i.e., to measure the discrepancy between BPAs with different time scale in the future. Besides, the proposed higher order belief Jensen-Shannon divergence has benefits from the perspective of measurement. It satisfies the properties of nonnegativeness and nondegeneracy , symmetry, and the triangle inequality of root form. Based on the proposed higher order belief Jensen-Shannon divergence, a novel multi-source information fusion algorithm is proposed. Eventually, the proposed algorithm is applied to a pattern classification experiment with real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {Preference relation is an effective tool in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). The fuzzy best-worst method (FBWM), which is an extension of the BWM, is proposed to determine weights for criteria. In the FBWM, the Fuzzy Best-to-others Vector ( FBV ) and Fuzzy others-to-Worst Vector ( FWV ) are given. The FBV and FWV can intrinsically formulate one incomplete reciprocal preference relation (IRPR), which we call the FBWM matrix. As the FBWM is designed mainly to determine the weights, and the existing FBWM only uses the min–max problem to derive the weights. Therefore, it is important to develop other effective methods to derive the weights from the FBWM matrix. Deriving the weights from FBWM matrix is converted into deriving the priorities from the corresponding IRPR. In this view, two groups of methods are proposed. One group is for a single FBWM matrix, and the other group is for a group of FBWM matrices. To show the effectiveness and performance of the developed methods, Monte Carlo simulations were implemented. Finally, two examples were used to show how these methods are applied in real decision-making problems. Comparative analyses were performed to show the differences and usefulness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Traffic accident prediction based on dashboard cameras is of great significance for ensuring the guaranteed-safety of self-driving systems and reducing the occurrence of accidents. Due to complexity of traffic scenarios and wide range of object&#39;s motion, early prediction of accidents remains a challenge. However, the existing methods process all traffic objects and all video frames indiscriminately, thus leading to poor prediction performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel traffic accident prediction framework, namely two-layer hidden state aggregation based two-stream network (THAT-Net). The proposed method first fuses the spatial and temporal flow to capture complementary spatio-temporal information, which filters out irrelevant objects in traffic scenes to reduce the influence of the object&#39;s motion state. Furthermore, a two-layer hidden state aggregation structure is designed to reintegrate the hidden state weights of gated recurrent units. It captures contextual information through frame-level and segment-level aggregation and decreases the influence of irrelevant frames to reduce the complexity of traffic scenes. Experiments based on two real-world datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of THAT-Net. Our proposed method achieves the highest accuracy by predicting accidents 0.48 sec to 2.8 sec earlier compared to the baseline methods in more challenging situations.

Specifically, transforming time series into granularity time series (GTS) for forecasting is usually perceived as an efficient way to address the long-term forecasting of time series. Although some long-term forecasting models have been explored to granulate time series information, the extraction of time series trend information is always accompanied by information losses. In order to address this challenge, a Back Propagation neural network (BPNN) time series long-term forecasting model is established via information granules under the framework of three-way decisions (TWD), which is conducive to greatly preserving the trend information of time series. First, significant points in the time series are extracted to initially extract the trend information of time series. Second, a reasonable loss function and conditional probability of TWD are defined, and a TWD-based method is proposed to compress the information and extract the trend information. Third, information granules are used as input for the prediction via BPNN. Notably, the proposed model not only retains the trend information, but also reduces errors due to the segmentation of information particles and extends the application range of forecasting problems with TWD. Finally, experimental outcomes with several data sets reveal that the proposed model owns better performance than existing long-term forecasting models .},

The use of soft computing techniques in the development of these forecasting models makes it possible to detect non-linear trends but has the disadvantage of increasing the computational complexity of the model. In this paper we present a GIS-based framework in which a fast soft computing forecasting model based on the multidimensional Fuzzy Transform (for short, MF-transform) is applied to evaluate the spatial distribution and the time evolution in a study area of a measurable entity (the feature). The study area is divided into homogeneous zones (the subzones) in which the feature was measured in each time frame. The time series of the feature are analyzed to assess the trend of the feature in subsequent time frames; furthermore, those sub-areas are detected in which the feature is higher than a maximum threshold (hot spots) or lower than a minimum threshold (cold spots) in this time range. A process of fuzzifying the values of the feature is carried out in order to facilitate the interpretation of the results by expert users. The framework was tested on a study area provided by the province of Naples (Italy) to predict and analyze the spatial distribution and temporal trend of the monthly rate of births compared to deaths. Furthermore, the thematic map of the hot and cold spots detected in the three months following the time period of measurements was built. The results show that our method provides reliable results both in terms of forecast error and similarity between the detected hot and cold spots and those who have really formed.},

IEA-GNN first calculates the information entropy of nodes and constructs candidate sets of anchors. We define the calculation method of the distance from any node to the anchor points and incorporate the relative distance information between nodes at initialization. The nonlinear distance-weighted aggregation learning strategy based on the anchor points of candidate sets is used to obtain the nodes&#39; feature information, which can be captured more effectively by fusing the global location information to the node representation with the selected anchor points. Selecting anchor points based on information entropy avoid the aggregation of anchor points in the graph, highlighting the positional differences between nodes and making it easier to distinguish homogeneous neighborhood nodes. Experimental results of node classification and link prediction on five datasets show that IEA-GNN outperforms the baseline model .},

Although related work in the literature targets only a single type, in this paper, we study Dynamic Multi-objective Optimization problems (DMOPs) contaminated with stochastic noises by dealing with the two types of uncertainty simultaneously. In such problems, handling uncertainty becomes a critical issue since the evolutionary process should be able to distinguish between changes that come from noise and real environmental changes that resulted from different forms of dynamism. To study both noisy and dynamic environments, we propose a flexible mechanism to incorporate noise into the DMOPs. Two novel techniques called Multi-Sensor Detection Mechanism (MSD) and Welford-Based Detection Mechanism (WBD) are proposed to differentiate between real change points and noise points. The proposed techniques are incorporated into a set of Dynamic Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (DMOEAs) to analyze their impact. Our empirical study reveals the effectiveness of the proposed techniques for isolating noise from real dynamic changes and diminishing the noise effect on performance.},

Finally, the proposed design method is compared with the previous one using an objective function based on the estimated disturbance to confirm the improvement of the disturbance rejection properties at the plant output.

This paper revisits the training process of existing pruning methods and observe that dead connections , which do not contribute to model capacity, occur in existing pruning methods. To this end, we propose a novel pruning method, namely all-alive pruning ( AAP ), which produces the pruned networks with only trainable weights with no dead connections . Notably, AAP is broadly applicable to various pruning methods and model architectures. We demonstrate that AAP equipped with the existing pruning methods ( e.g. , iterative pruning, one-shot pruning, and dynamic pruning) consistently improves the accuracy of the original methods at high compression ratios on the various image- and language-based tasks.},

Most of the existing multi-view clustering methods are based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which can achieve dimensionality reduction and interpretable representation. However, there are following issues in the existing researches: (1) The existing methods based on NMF using Frobenius norm are sensitive to noises and outliers. (2) Many methods only use the information shared by multi-view data, while ignoring the diverse information between views. (3) The data graph constructed by the conventional K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method may misclassify neighbors and degrade the clustering performance. To address the above problems, we propose a novel robust multi-view clustering method. Specifically, l 2 , 1 l2,1 -norm is introduced to measure the factorization error to improve the robustness of NMF. Additionally, a diversity constraint is utilized to learn the diverse relationship of multi-view data, and an adaptive graph method via information entropy is designed to overcome the shortcomings of misclassifying neighbors. Finally, an iterative updating algorithm is developed to solve the optimization model, which can make the objective function monotonically non-increasing. The effectiveness of the proposed method is substantiated by comparing with eleven state-of-the-art methods on five real-world and four synthetic multi-view datasets for clustering tasks .},

In our paper, a new technique is proposed to identify the anomalies in a network from a global perspective by using the network community structure. In general, state-of-the-art outliers detection algorithms mainly focus on the individual nodes and their direct neighborhood. But our technique considers only those nodes which tend to belong to multiple communities or whose neighbors belong to the same community or do not belong to any community. Results after experiments on synthetic and real-world networks show an improvement of 7-10\% and 29\% in F-Score and Jaccard similarity , respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.

  abstract     = {Recent researches show that deep learning model is susceptible to backdoor attacks. Many defenses against backdoor attacks have been proposed. However, existing defense works require high computational overhead or backdoor attack information such as the trigger size. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor detection method based on intentional adversarial perturbations. The proposed method leverages intentional adversarial perturbation to detect whether an image contains a trigger, which can be applied in both the training stage and the inference stage (sanitize the training set in training stage or detect the backdoor instances in inference stage). Specifically, given an untrusted image, the adversarial perturbation is added to the image intentionally. If the prediction of the model on the perturbed image is consistent with that on the unperturbed image, the input image will be considered as a backdoor instance. Compared with most existing defense works, the proposed method is faster and introduces less computational overhead during backdoor detection process. Moreover, the proposed method maintains the visual quality of the image (as the ℓ 2 ℓ2 norm of the added perturbation is as low as 2.8715, 3.0513 and 2.4362 on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets, respectively). Experimental results show that, for general backdoor attack, the backdoor detection rate of the proposed defense method is 99.63\%, 99.76\% and 99.91\% on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets, respectively. For invisible backdoor attack, the backdoor detection rate of the proposed defense method is 99.75\% against blended backdoor attack and 98.00\% against sample-specific backdoor attack. It is also demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve high defense performance against backdoor attacks under different attack settings (trigger transparency, trigger size and trigger pattern). In addition, the experimental comparison with related work demonstrates that the proposed method has better detection performance and higher detection efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Geological drilling is an important means for exploration of the earth. Due to the nonlinearity and coupling, geological drilling is accompanied by low efficiency and safety, and difficult to accurately predict the drilling states. Moreover, the vertical well trajectory needs to follow the plumb line . A novel optimization method is proposed to solve these problems. First, working conditions are identified by fuzzy C-means clustering method and corresponding adjustment ranges of operating variables are refined for optimization. Meanwhile, support vector regression and hybrid bat algorithm are employed to construct reliable models for mud pit volume (MPV) and rate of penetration (ROP). Then, how to improve safety and efficiency is converted to a two-objective problem, that is to suppress MPV fluctuations and improve ROP with vertical well constraints. Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II is invoked to solve this problem, and the appropriate solution is selected by two references points. Moreover, a short-time scale and long-time scale optimization strategy is introduced to cope with different adjustment interval of operating variables. Finally, the simulation results based on actual drilling data, application results in a semi-physical experiment system and comparison results from a vertical well verify the effectiveness and practicability for the developed method.},

The situation that some communication channels used to transmit sub-information between two nodes may fail is considered, which causes the receiving node to be unable to obtain complete state information. Moreover, due to less information transmission between nodes, the analysis of finite-time synchronization problem becomes more difficult. Therefore, several questions naturally arise here: Under this communication restriction, how to remodel the complex network, and can the network achieve finite-time synchronization? To better solve these questions, the complex network model with partial communication channels failure is established first. Then, based on the finite-time stability theory and state layered method, two finite-time synchronization criteria for complex networks are provided. Finally, the effectiveness of obtained results are verified by numerical simulations.},

To achieve that, a novel co-evolutionary algorithm based on problem analysis (CAPA) is proposed in this paper. CAPA is designed to solve DMOPs from decision space and objective space simultaneously, which is achieved by the combination of adjustable prediction (AP) and precise mapping strategy (PM). In decision space, the proposed multi-model prediction can estimate the location of new population based on the historical median points. In objective space, a novel sampling method is developed to search for sample points with better convergence or diversity. Then, mapping these sample points back to decision space based on inverse model. Through the problem analysis mechanism, the proportion of the new solutions produced by each strategy changes adaptively. CAPA is incorporated into the dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (DMOEA) based on decomposition (MOEA/D) to construct a novel algorithm. The efficacy of CAPA is validated by comparison with five state-of-the-art algorithms on 28 benchmarks. Experimental results show that CAPA has the ability to generate high quality population uniformly along PF.},

For this type of data, traditional rough set models cannot well represent the distribution of objects in real data. This limits effective decision-making and classification of the data. Replacing the missing labels with prediction labels can compensate for the absence of labels to some extent. Then, multiset-valued data with prediction labels is considered. This paper studies semi-supervised attribute reduction for partially labelled multiset-valued data via a prediction label strategy. First, the distance between information values in a multiset-valued decision information system (MSVDIS) is constructed, and the tolerance relation on the object set of an MSVDIS is introduced. Then, a partially labelled multiset-valued decision information system (p-MSVDIS) is defined. Next, a prediction label strategy (i.e., the existing labels in a p-MSVDIS remain the same, and the missing labels are replaced with the prediction label) is proposed. Incidentally, a new MSVDIS is obtained, and the object set is reclassified by the decision attribute . Moreover, the dependence and conditional entropy in the obtained MSVDIS are proposed, and some properties are discussed. Semi-supervised attribute reduction algorithms in a p-MSVDIS via dependence and conditional entropy are designed. Finally, experiments on real datasets show that the prediction label strategy outperforms the traditional rough set approach and that the designed algorithms have better classification and outlier detection performance than the existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Classification with incomplete data is practically challenging since missing data hinders classification. The two-stage strategy of filling missing values first and then classifying complete data degenerates performance due to the separate optimization of classification and imputation. While efforts have been made to classify incomplete data directly without imputation, the benefits of imputation on classification have been sacrificed. To this end, this paper proposes a Category-Aware Optimal Transport Neural Network (CAOT-NN) for incomplete data classification . Specifically, we design a category-aware optimal transport method conditioned on intra-category data distribution, which explicitly employs the category information of each sample and fills in discriminative values for the downstream classification module. Moreover, we reconstruct the observed values during the imputation process when performing classification learning , thus implicitly utilizing the category information of the classifier for missing values estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 real-world and 30 synthetic datasets from the UCI repository demonstrate the superiority of CAOT-NN against existing state-of-the-art methods. Also, the visualization analysis reveals that CAOT-NN enables a tighter intra-category distribution of the imputed data, implying that the missing mechanism may be utilized as a data augmentation strategy to boost accuracy.},

Finally, both performance-based and distribution-based infill criteria are utilized to determine the most promising offspring from the high-level group for expensive evaluation.

Thus, this study proposes a dynamic MCGDM method with automatic reliability and weight calculation. First, we introduce a generalized combination rule into MCGDM and propose methods for automatically determining experts’ weight and reliability by mining evidence. Here, experts’ weight can be calculated according to the entropy of evidence, while experts’ reliability can be calculated according to evidence distance from the perspectives of horizontal comparison and longitudinal comparison. Then, the consensus-reaching process is taken into account in MCGDM; experts are allowed to modify and change their judgments, and experts’ weight and reliability can be automatically updated in each round of interaction.

The proposed ensemble system employs the very sparse random projection technique to compress the consequent parts of the learned fuzzy rules by individual base models to a more compressed form, thereby reducing redundant information and improving computational efficiency. To improve the overall prediction performance, a dynamical base model pruning scheme is introduced to the proposed ensemble system together with a novel inferencing scheme, such that less accurate base models will be removed from the ensemble structure at each learning cycle automatically and only these more accurate ones will be involved in joint decision-making.

The graph convolution operation is widely used in traffic flow prediction with its effective modeling ability on graph structures. However, in this method, it ignores the roles of external factors and historical data from fixed period is used that inevitably will lead to exclusion of detailed dynamic spatial–temporal correlation. To this end, we propose a novel method based on prior knowledge enhanced time-varying graph convolution network (PKET-GCN). First, we characterize factors affecting the traffic flow into dynamic and static features. The dynamic features include data correlation and external interference, while the static features consist of physical distances. Then we design a prior knowledge based module to extract the correlation of nodes and combine it with graph convolution to obtain dynamic spatial features . Next, a time-varying feature extraction module is designed to derive dynamic and long-term temporal features from periodic and adjacent sequences. Finally, the projection module is established to fuse the multiple modules and give the prediction value. The experimental results on five real-world datasets indicate that PKET-GCN is more effective than several existing methods.},

In our study, we classify ensembles as either collaborative or coordinated, depending on how the rules are used. In the first case, all the rules contribute to the creation of the same solution, while in the second case, each rule works independently on its own solution, and the best of them is selected as the solution of the ensemble. We found that each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, which leads us to use them in combination.

The algorithm involves a projection operator to deal with these three constraints simultaneously. Further, we implicitly control transaction costs thanks to a rebalancing constraint handled by a suitable exact penalty function. In addition, we develop an ad hoc mutation operator to modify candidate exemplars in the highest level of the swarm. The experimental results, using three large-scale data sets, show that including this procedure improves the accuracy of the solutions. Then, a comparison with other variants of the LLSO algorithm and two state-of-the-art swarm optimizers points out the outstanding performance of the proposed solver in terms of exploration capabilities and solution quality.

  abstract     = {With the proliferation of mobile technology and IT development, people can use social network services anywhere and anytime. Among many social network mining problems, identifying cohesive subgraphs has attracted extensive attention from different fields due to its numerous applications. The most widely used among many cohesive subgraph models is k -core, because of its simple and intuitive structure. In this paper, we formulate ( p , n ) (p,n) -core in signed networks by extending the k -core model. ( p , n ) (p,n) -core is designed to guarantee sufficient internal positive edges and deficient internal negative edges. We formally prove that finding an exact ( p , n ) (p,n) -core is NP-hard. Hence, we propose three efficient and effective algorithms to find a solution. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms using real-world and synthetic networks.},

  abstract     = {Batch-constrained reinforcement learning constrains the learned policy to be close to the behavior policy, which holds a tremendous promise for alleviating the distributional shift in offline reinforcement learning . Existing batch-constrained techniques rely on perturbation models to adjust the actions generated from the generative model to maximize the estimated value function. However, the perturbation model deviates from the distribution of the offline datasets and introduces a new distribution drift problem, which affects the performance of the learned policies. In addition, since offline reinforcement learning cannot learn by trial and error , the final policies are often prone to failure in reality or make unsafe decisions when trained with a noisy or small size dataset. To address the above issues, this paper employs constrained generative adversarial network to generate actions with given states. Specifically, we train the generator to maximize the estimated value and constrain the state-action pairs to follow the dataset distribution. The perturbation model is trained to maximize the probability of the perturbed actions belonging to the dataset and minimize the likelihood of taking dangerous actions. Moreover, we utilize safety critics to predict the risk of the actions under a state. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and can choose safe actions while maintaining a high performance in offline settings.},

Although many multi-view clustering methods have achieved a lot of successes based on the assumption that the data is integrity, in fact, these data may exist the case of missing instances in real applications, resulting in incomplete multi-view data. Thus, incomplete multi-view clustering has been proposed to handle this issue, which has gained considerable attention. However, for the most of existing approaches, there still have the following limitations: (i) the latent common representation information within views is not well exploited. (ii) the potential information hidden in missing views are ignored to some extent. Therefore, we proposed a novel Learning Latent Embedding via weighted projection matrix alignment for Incomplete Multi-view Clustering, termed as LLE-IMC. Specifically, a view completion model is introduced in latent embedding learning to infer the missing information. To further explore the consistency information of different views, different projection matrices are enforced to align to cluster centers by ℓ 2 , 1 ℓ2,1 norm regularization . Furthermore, an efficient optimization algorithm is presented to resolve the proposed model with convergence guarantee. On several incomplete multi-view datasets, experimental results show that our proposed LLE-IMC performs better in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of many metrics.},

Maintaining this balance becomes more challenging for existing algorithms when dealing with complex CMOPs, as various complex feasible regions often result in CMOPs with very different characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a more flexible two-stage evolutionary algorithm based on automatic regulation (ARCMO), which can effectively control evolutionary trends to adapt to complex CMOPs. Specifically, the first stage performs a fast global search and passes the population information to the second stage. The second stage consists of two dynamically complementary sub-processes: the exploration subprocess and the convergence subprocess. The ratio of these two subprocesses is dynamically adjusted based on information from the first stage, allowing ARCMO to adapt to CMOPs with different complexities. Experiments on several recently proposed benchmark suites and real-world application problems show that ARCMO is more adaptable than the contender algorithms when solving different complex CMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Facial expression recognition (FER) is embedded in many real-world human-computer interaction tasks, such as online learning, depression recognition and remote diagnosis. However, FER is often hindered by privacy concerns and low recognition accuracy due to inadequate data transfer restrictions on public clouds, insufficient quantities of effective labeled samples and class imbalance. To address the above challenges, we have developed an automatic privacy-preserving learning state recognition system for supervising the quality of online teaching with the cooperation of edge servers and cloud servers to reduce the risk of privacy exposure. In particular, we propose few-shot facial expression recognition with a self-supervised vision transformer (SSF-ViT) by integrating self-supervised learning (SSL) and few-shot learning (FSL) to train a deep learning model with fewer labeled samples. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) is jointly pretrained with four self-supervised pretext tasks, including image denoising and reconstruction, image rotation prediction, jigsaw puzzle and masked patch prediction, to obtain a pretrained ViT encoder. Then, the pretrained ViT encoder is used on a lab-controlled labeled FER dataset to extract the spatiotemporal features and implement the FER task to fine-tune the parameters. Finally, we construct prototypes to verify the few-shot classification method for specific expression recognition. Support and query sets are divided in the wild FER dataset, and few-shot classification episodes are constructed. The fine-tuned ViT encoder is used as the feature extractor to build the prototype for each support set category, and the expression classification results are obtained by computing the Euclidean distance between the query samples and the prototypes. The extensive experimental results show that SSF-ViT can achieve recognition accuracies of 74.95\%, 66.04\%, 63.69\% and 90.98\% on the FER2013, AffectNet, SFEW 2.0 and RAF-DB datasets, respectively. In addition, SSF-ViT can improve the recognition performance of specific expression categories on these datasets.},

  abstract     = {Usually, manual labeling of large-scale electrocardiograms (ECGs) for deep learning is always expensive, as it requires considerable effort and time from cardiologists . Currently, contrastive learning can utilize unlabeled ECGs to improve deep learning using insufficient labels. However, this field may still lack instructive literature. In this paper, a dense lead contrast (DLC) is proposed for effective contrastive learning on multilead ECGs. It develops contrastive learning between any two leads from different views to explore intralead and interlead invariance. A joint loss combining intralead and interlead contrastive loss guides the DLC pretraining. Moreover, DLC introduces a multibranch network (MBN) for contrastive learning, generates a representation for each lead, and fuses all the leads for a global representation. In the downstream tasks, DLC outperforms the standard contrastive learning paradigm of multilead ECGs by 2.78\%∼6.59\% in AUROC (linear probe). Using only 10\% of the labeled training data, it still outperforms standard contrastive learning by a significant margin in AUROC. Compared with existing methods, DLC shows obvious advantages in all the experiments. Therefore, DLC may be more suitable for the contrastive learning of multilead ECGs. Its good performance based on insufficient labels can alleviate the cardiologists&#39; burden from data labeling.},

Its methodology consists of several steps: Firstly, a network reconstruction method is suggested, based on infection potential energy, to make the constructed information diffusion path more accurate. Afterwards, a network pruning method is identified to reduce the search space of candidate sources. Finally, considering the minor differences in the Gaussian density values of multiple nodes and the tendency of the rumor to spread, a distance centrality method is proposed.

  abstract     = {Our daily lives have been profoundly changed over the past few years owing to the growing presence of the Internet of Things (IoT). Importantly, IoT makes our lives more convenient, simpler, and more efficient; however, gadgets are vulnerable to a wide variety of cyberattacks due to the lack of robust security mechanisms and hardware security support. This paper presents an alternative deep learning model known as DeepAK-IoT to detect cyberattacks against IoT devices. DeepAK-IoT uses three blocks as its foundation: the residual-based-spatial representation (RSR) block, the temporal representation block (TRB), and the detection block (DB). The RSR block uses five residual blocks to extract a feature representation from the output of the preceding layer. The four convolutional layers are connected in parallel with a skip connection within each block to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients. Then, the second block uses the extracted spatial representation to learn a temporal representation to detect cyber threats. The final block decides how to classify the input record. We evaluated the accuracy and generalization ability of DeepAK-IoT using three well-known public datasets: TON-IoT, Edge-IIoTset, and UNSW-NB15. The proposed model was compared to three state-of-the-art deep learning models to demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting cyber threats in IoT systems. According to the experimental results, DeepAK-IoT was found to be a powerful alternative model for managing cyber threats in IoT networks, as it provided 90.57\% accuracy for TON IoT, 94.96\% for Edge-IIoTset, and 98.41\% for UNSW NB15.},

To this end, we propose a novel progressive target-into-source multi-target domain adaptation with representation-decoupled learning, which we call MTDA-PDT. Specifically, we develop a progressive strategy based on the degree of divergence between each target and source domain, and augment the source domain with these high-confidence target samples gradually in easy-to-hard manner. In addition, we adopt the domain shift and the matching degree to the source pre-trained model as similarity measurement of the target domains. Particularly, we construct the cross-domain representation-decoupled adaptation to decouple the feature representations into three semantic components, as well as the mutual information and mainstream sample gathering to guide domain alignment. Finally, extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed progressive decoupled target-into-source multi-target domain adaptation and its performance superiority.},

Here, we proposed a Siamese network with spatio-temporal awareness called SiamST. The standard square convolutional kernels and the single feature matching operation hardly represent the targets with different shapes accurately. Therefore, we designed a refined region fusion module that combines multiple convolutional kernels to fit targets with different aspect ratios . Furthermore, we proposed a multi-granularity matching module to obtain more robust feature matching results by combining fine-grained and coarse-grained matching results. However, most existing Siamese trackers do not adequately employ target temporal states . They usually only update the templates, which automatically causes motion information loss. Therefore, we built dynamic templates by screening high-quality samples to describe the target appearance changes accurately. In addition, we designed a trend guidance module to adjust the location prior constraint appropriately to match the tracking results to the target&#39;s motion trajectory. Extensive experimental results on eight tracking benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of SiamST compared to many advanced trackers.},

This paper studies the joint optimization of the CBM policy and spare components inventory for the multi-component system in large state and action spaces. We use Markov Decision Process to model it and propose an improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the stochastic policy and actor-critic framework. In this algorithm, factorization decomposes the system action into the linear combination of each component&#39;s action. The experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has better time performance and lower system cost compared with other benchmark algorithms. The training time of the former is only 28.5\% and 9.12\% of that of PPO and DQN algorithms, and the corresponding system cost is decreased by 17.39\% and 27.95\%, respectively. At the same time, our algorithm has good scalability and is suitable for solving Markov decision-making problems in large-scale state and action space.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-integer optimisation problems can be computationally challenging. Here, we introduce and analyse two efficient algorithms with a specific sequential design that are aimed at dealing with sampled problems within this class. At each iteration step of both algorithms, we first test the feasibility of a given test solution for each and every constraint associated with the sampled optimisation at hand, while also identifying those constraints that are violated. Subsequently, an optimisation problem is constructed with a constraint set consisting of the current basis—namely, the smallest set of constraints that fully specifies the current test solution—as well as constraints related to a limited number of the identified violating samples. We show that both algorithms exhibit finite-time convergence towards the optimal solution. Algorithm 2 features a neural network classifier that notably improves the computational performance compared to Algorithm 1. We quantitatively establish these algorithms&#39; efficacy through three numerical tests: robust optimal power flow, robust unit commitment, and robust random mixed-integer linear program.},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a promising algorithm for traffic signal control (TSC), and graph neural networks make a further improvement on its learning capacity. However, these state-of-the-art algorithms adopt fine-granularity information (i.e., current step-states) to get traffic-network embeddings, but ignore great-granularity information (e.g., previous multiple step-states); In addition, these algorithms are optimized by loss functions in the viewpoint of MARL, but ignore the correlation between input information and output embeddings. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Multi-agent Mutual Information (HG-M2I) algorithm for TSC. Specifically, HG-M2I algorithm is developed based on: 1) Multi-granularity fusion employs a proposed Hierarchical Graph representation learning (HG) algorithm, which fuses both current step-states of multiple agents and previous multiple step-states of each agent , thus facilitates to produce optimal final embeddings; 2) Joint optimization employs a proposed Multi-agent Mutual Information (M2I) framework, which measures the correlation between input step-states and output embeddings by maximizing mutual information, the corresponding mutual-information and MARL loss jointly optimize the whole algorithm, thus facilitates to derive optimal traffic-signal policies. HG-M2I is compared against these state-of-the-art algorithms on synthetic-road and real-road datasets. Experimental results not only show the superior performance of HG-M2I over other compared algorithms, but also illustrate its advantageous transferability.},

In order to improve the stability of BB step size and the output quality of network model in deep learning , this paper presents two improved optimization algorithms based on the BB method: BBbound and AdaBBbound. BBbound reduces the floating BB step size by generating the upper bound of the step in the current iteration. It avoids the occasional occurrence of long steps; AdaBBbound is an adaptive gradient method based on BB method with dynamic bound. The algorithm has a fast convergence effect in the early stage, then calculates learning rate and smoothly transitions to SGD by setting the better conditions of the BB method. We analyzed the performance of the two algorithms based on the initial conditions and the learning rate change curve. Meanwhile, we tested our algorithms on popular network models such as ResNet and DenseNet. The results showed that the new optimization algorithms have achieved high stability and significantly improved the performance of the network model.},

  abstract     = {To further enhance the reliability of Machine Learning (ML) systems, considerable efforts have been dedicated to developing privacy protection techniques. Recently, membership privacy has gained increasing attention, with a focus on determining whether a specific data point is present in the confidential training set of an ML model. However, most current attacks only prioritize attack accuracy and fail to extend their range to the evidence that contributes to the member/non-member classification. This limitation greatly reduces the practicality of Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), as real-world data typically includes multiple features, making it challenging to identify which features are involved in the sensitive training set. Therefore, this paper targets one of the fundamental challenges in membership inference attack: measuring the distance between an attack sample and a member sample. Specifically, we propose a novel threat model called Membership Reconstruction Attack (MRA), which aims to reconstruct the exact distribution of the target training set. MRA achieves this by marking each input dimension (e.g., pixels) according to its similarity to the target dataset in feature space. Our attack demonstrates its effectiveness across various settings, including different major datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and different model architectures (AlexNet, ResNet , DenseNet, and generative models). Additionally, we evaluate MRA from the defenders&#39; perspective and test several defense approaches against our attack.},

It is common to forge the statements of influential leaders or entrepreneurs called key populations forgery and spread them on the Internet, which causes bad influence. The number of key populations forgery belongs to a small group in the huge deep forgery number, and the conventional deep forgery detection methods have a great gap in the detection efficiency and performance of small group samples. Therefore, we use the forged information of a large number group to judge the forged information of a small number group, and propose a deep forgery detection method of information construction and comparison under information measurement. Firstly, we propose a sample coverage analysis method for the sample library boundary to explore the difference in the feature space between the small number of key population samples and the large number samples, so as to determine the sample boundary of small number groups from the information level. Secondly, we construct information of key groups and expand the sample scale to meet the data needs of improving the detection accuracy. Finally, we compare the forged features of the large number group with the feature of the expanded small number group, and measure the information coincidence of the two types features by the complexity of feature clusters. When the coincidence degree is high, it is considered that the small number group samples have gone through the forgery process and carried forged information. We have analyzed and tested the current mainstream deep forgery databases and collected a small number of population sample, and compare with some popular methods. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA).},

As functional programming paradigm has mathematical reference transparency, refinement to functional programs contributes to improving the reliability of the transformation process and simplifying the refinement steps. However, it is a challenge to generate functional programs from specifications. Most existing transformation methods refine specifications into abstract algorithm-level programs based on loop invariants rather than functional programs. This paper proposes a novel functional program generation method based on the partition-recursion refinement rule. It establishes a novel program refinement framework based on functional theory for the first time. This is the first study to regard the whole program refinement process as a composition of abstract functions. This paper designs a recurrence-based algorithm design language (Radl + ) and implements a software prototype to map Radl + algorithms into executable Haskell programs. To prove the feasibility and efficiency of this method, this paper transforms the polynomial multiplication problem from a specification into an executable Haskell program. This case shows that compared with existing approaches, the proposed method can simplify the transformation steps and reduce the number of lines of generated code from 38 to 10.},

In order to relieve the communication limitation, a bit rate allocation scheme is made using data transmitted from sensors to estimators. Next, distributed estimators are designed in terms of the obtained decoded measurement outputs such that an upper bound of estimation error covariance (EEC) is ensured by resorting to the well-known mathematical induction approach. Moreover, the desired gains of constructed estimators are calculated at each iteration by minimizing the upper bound. Subsequently, a sufficient condition is presented to check the uniform boundedness of the designed recursive approaches of the distributed FE. Moreover, the monotonicity with respect to the bit rate is discussed for the fixed estimator gains. An example of Chua&#39;s circuits is finally presented to check the applicability of the developed distributed strategy.},

  abstract     = {As a robust online learning approach, adaptive filtering based on correntropy has attracted more attentions. Recently, researchers have made efforts to develop complex correntropy to deal with adaptive filtering issues in complex domain. However, most of the literature on complex correntropy lack details regarding the processing of noncircular signals. Up to now, the maximum improper complex correntropy criterion (MICCC) algorithm for noncircular and widely-linear (WL) adaptive filtering utilizes the gradient descent method to find the maximum of the objective function. However, the MICCC algorithm fails to guarantee both low steady-state weight error power and fast convergence. To overcome this defect, this paper proposes a class of adaptive filtering algorithms which are based on fixed-point instead of gradient descent. It is worth noting that we manage to avoid the massive calculation of matrix inversion in traditional fixed-point based methods by utilizing the lemma of matrix inversion properly and further provide two alternative recursive algorithms. Finally, the local convergence analysis of mean and mean square is performed, and the simulated results offer strong evidences for the superior performance of the proposed algorithms over widely-linear complex least mean square (WL-CLMS), widely-linear recursive least square (WL-RLS) and MICCC.},

A transitivity equation with parametric fuzzy elements is introduced and combined with the existence of parameter values to define consistency of TFRPMs. To cope with the challenge of identifying the existence, computational formulas are developed to directly obtain values of parameters from the fuzzy judgments in a TFRPM, and an equivalent consistency concept is proposed for TFRPMs. Properties of consistent TFRPMs are presented and a logarithmic deviation based formula is provided to compute consistency indices of TFRPMs. A new framework of normalized vectors with trapezoidal fuzzy elements is introduced. A logarithmic goal programming model is established and transformed into a linear program for acquiring normalized trapezoidal fuzzy utility vectors from TFRPMs. An analytical solution is found for optimized trapezoidal fuzzy utility vectors of consistent TFRPMs. The developed models are validated by three numerical illustrations possessing comparative studies.},

  abstract     = {Phrases represent independent semantics in natural language but usually have indeterminate lengths and different combinations. So, extracting meaningful phrases from unstructured texts will substantially reduce semantic ambiguity and lay the foundation for downstream natural language tasks. Most existing research obtains candidate phrases by N-grams, which includes meaningless word sequences and degrades algorithm performance. In this paper, we propose a novel phrase-mining algorithm, called ParsingPhrase, which effectively extracts combination phrases from text and improves phrase quality by syntactic features. It consists of three stages. Firstly, all sentences in texts are represented as parsing trees by PCFG (Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar). We propose PBMP (Parsing-Based Phrase mining) to obtain candidate phrases from those parsing trees. Then, we introduce a new phrase evaluation indicator, called Significance, that relies on the role of phrases to measure their importance. We integrate the Significance with conventional evaluation indexes for a more reasonable phrase evaluation. Finally, we optimize the phrase quality again by exploiting the optimal phrase composition features of sentences. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to employ parsing for combination phrase mining and evaluation, meanwhile offering a solution for syntactic disambiguation. Experiments on three real corpora demonstrate that the ParsingPhrase exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, is 7\% higher in the candidate phrase conversion rate, and is 6\% better in terms of Precision.},

To this end, a neural network learning-based approximation algorithm is first proposed to separate the coupling influence, and then estimate the lumped uncertain nonlinearities . This is done by using the separated data as the input of the neural networks. Second, Nussbaum-type functions are presented to settle the unknown sign of the time-varying attack injection signal. Third, an event triggering mechanism is developed to reduce the communication load. Under the developed secure control laws, all the signals of the resulted closed-loop CPS are bounded.

Most of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D adversarial attacks perform perturbation to 3D point clouds. To reproduce these attacks in the physical scenario, a generated adversarial 3D point cloud needs to be reconstructed to mesh , which leads to a significant drop in its adversarial effect. In this paper, we propose a strong 3D adversarial attack named Mesh Attack to address this problem by directly performing perturbation on mesh of a 3D object . In order to take advantage of the most effective gradient-based attack, a differentiable sample module that back-propagate the gradient of point cloud to mesh is introduced. To further ensure the adversarial mesh examples without outlier and 3D printable, three mesh losses are adopted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms SOTA 3D attacks by a significant margin. We also achieved SOTA performance under various defenses.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an approach for the analysis and comparison of stochastic solvers based on the statistical distribution of their variables. The observed variables of the stochastic solvers are the runtime and number of function evaluations required to reach a (sub)-optimal solution. These variables were measured using a target approach. We extended the conventional approach, which usually predicts the average value of variables, by predicting their statistical distributions. If possible, we can predict, not only the average value, but also all the values of the observed variables according to the identified distribution and given probability . We can also predict the probability of reaching (sub)-optimal solutions according to the variable&#39;s values. The approach was empirically validated by comparing solvers for discrete and continuous problems. In our experiment, the differences between predicted and measured values of runtime, number of function evaluations and probability are 10\% or less. This proves that the proposed approach is useful and can be used for the analysis and comparison of stochastic solvers. Although, the approach has some limitations, it can mitigate the issue of stochastic solvers being unable to provide (sub)-optimal solutions, and can be used to determine the stopping optimization criteria .},

Additional feedbacks (or partial feedbacks) on some arms are usually possible to be collected in many networking applications but with certain costs. Though a variety of algorithms were proposed to utilize such feedbacks to speed up MAB learning, it is still unclear regrading: (1) How to schedule the budgets across the MAB learning period? (2) Which feedbacks to select from the additional feedback set? To fill in this gap, we design AF-UCB algorithm. The contribution of AF-UCB is a generic additional feedback processing algorithm, which is composed of an elimination module, a schedule module and a selection module . The elimination module eliminates additional feedbacks that may slow down the learning speed. It is inspired by findings from an in-depth numerical analysis , which shows that some feedbacks may slow down the learning speed (slower than not using any additional feedback at all) of two latest representative algorithms. The schedule module adaptively schedules budgets and the selection module selects appropriate feedbacks from the additional feedback set. We derive a sub-linear regret upper bound for AF-UCB. Extensive numerical experiments validate the superior performance of AF-UCB.},

  abstract     = {In today&#39;s fuzzy community, the blending of fuzzy model and deep learning has become one hot topic for the development of more sophisticated and high-powered fuzzy systems. In this study, a rule-based deep fuzzy system with nonlinear fuzzy feature transform for data classification named by NFFT-DFSC is proposed, borrowing the “hierarchically stacked thought” originated from deep learning . Firstly, two fuzzy models with nonlinear fuzzy feature transform function and with decision-making function, and their neuro-fuzzy network implementations are proposed. Subsequently, we stack multiple fuzzy models with nonlinear fuzzy feature transform function and the fuzzy model with decision-making function together in a cascade way, which results in the formation of NFFT-DFSC. Here the stacked fuzzy models with nonlinear fuzzy feature transform function snoops and transforms features of raw data continuously to finally obtain the high-level latent fuzzy features, while the fuzzy model with decision-making function completes classification by exploring the multiple prototypes used to represent the high-level latent fuzzy features of each class. Besides, batch normalization operation and mini-batch gradient descent optimization rooted from the training of deep neural networks are also used to enhance the generalization of NFFT-DFSC and learn its parameters in end-to-end manner, respectively. Experiments between NFFT-DFSCs with three nonlinear mapping functions and 15 benchmark classifiers involving gaussian kernel support vector machine (GSVM), Takagi-Sugeno-Kang classifier (TSK), deep neural network (DNN) and state-of-the-art deep TSK ones on synthetic datasets and nineteen diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed NFFT-DFSC is a more competitive classifier on classification accuracy .},

  abstract     = {Current research on machine learning-based intelligent routing focuses on algorithm design and performance optimization . How to deploy it in practice remains a pressing issue. Existing deep learning-based intelligent routing algorithms suffer from a high computational cost, which is hard to be afforded by routers. Considering that the cloud can assist the routers with limited resources to handle complex computation, outsourcing deep learning-based intelligent routing computations to the cloud becomes a feasible solution to support intelligent routing. However, due to the untrustworthiness of the cloud, it is necessary for the routers to verify the truth of outsourced routing results. However, the literature has not yet explored this issue. In this paper, we proposed VeriORouting, a scheme to verify the correctness of outsourced deep learning-based intelligent routing results provided by the cloud. Facing a lazy cloud, VeriORouting allows routers to check the reliability of intelligent routing models by testing model accuracy, and to verify the routing results returned by the cloud without knowing the model by using verification functions generated with multilayer perceptron (MLP) and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in advance. We show the robustness of VeriORouting under two attacks raised by the cloud. We evaluate the performance of VeriORouting and compare it with a local intelligent routing scheme . The results show that VeriORouting outperforms the local scheme in terms of computational overhead and storage overhead , especially when the number of routers in the network increases. In terms of communication, VeriORouting reduces communication overhead between routers compared to the local scheme. In addition, we measure the verification performance of VeriORouting under a random attack. VeriORouting achieves a detection success rate of 73\% with a false positive rate of 3\%, and a detection success rate of 90\% with a false positive rate of 25\%.},

  abstract     = {Finding k -edge connected components ( k -ECCs) is widely used to investigate the major cohesive structures within a graph. Traditional methods utilizing global minimum cut to split the graph iteratively are too slow to deal with graphs of a large size. Recently, approximate algorithms based on a decomposition framework have been proposed to speed up the process. However, these algorithms produce low-quality results in graphs containing vertex pairs that are k -connected but do not belong to a k -ECC. In this paper, we propose a decomposition framework that utilizes a local edge connectivity check method to obtain high-quality results in a shorter period. The proposed method utilizes an improved maximum flow algorithm to detect k -ECCs from local k -cores by merging more vertices in each iteration than existing methods. Moreover, a pruning strategy is applied in the decomposition framework to reduce unnecessary branches in the decomposition tree . Our experimental results on both synthetic and real graphs show that our proposed algorithm is faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms in most datasets and achieves effective results among the approximate algorithms with a 96\% accuracy on our experimental datasets .},

To make full use of face landmark information, we propose a facial geometry prior module (FGPM) to extract facial geometry feature maps. Then the facial geometry feature maps are embedded into upsampling feature maps generated by the CNN-LSTM network. The proposed FGPM exploits facial maps and frequency domain correlation to analyze the discriminative characteristics between manipulated and non-manipulated regions by incorporating the CNN-LSTM network. Finally, a decoder is used to learn the mapping from low-resolution feature maps to pixel-wise to predict manipulation localization . Or a softmax classifier is used to predict real or fake face images. By experimenting on several popular datasets, the proposed detection model has demonstrated the capability of localizing manipulation at the pixel level and with a high prediction on real or fake face images.},

Meanwhile, deep learning technology has demonstrated tremendous potential in characterizing source code . As such, we explore whether deep learning technology can enhance the effectiveness of clone consistent-defect prediction. In this study, we investigate various neural networks for modeling clone consistent change. Specifically, our approach models code clones and their evolution to capture the semantic properties automatically from the perspectives of clone fragment, clone group, and clone evolution, as opposed to manually generated attributes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct an experiment on the dataset collected from 8 open-source projects. The results demonstrate that our neural network models are efficient both in cross-project and within-project scenarios, with F-measures of around 80\% and recalls of around 90\%. We conclude that deep learning technology may successfully assist developers in predicting clone consistent-defect, so helping to improve the security of code clones by alerting developers to confirm their consistency.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs) become increasingly ubiquitous but complicated in real-world scenarios. Confronted with such sophisticated optimization problems , most existing optimizers dramatically lose their effectiveness. To tackle this type of problems effectively, we propose a heterogeneous cognitive learning particle swarm optimizer (HCLPSO). Unlike most existing particle swarm optimizers (PSOs), HCLPSO partitions particles in the current swarm into two categories, namely superior particles ( SP ) and inferior particles ( IP ), based on their fitness, and then treats the two categories of particles differently. For inferior particles, this paper devises a random elite cognitive learning (RECL) strategy to update each one with a random superior particle chosen from SP . For superior particles, this paper designs a stochastic dominant cognitive learning (SDCL) strategy to evolve each one by randomly selecting one guiding exemplar from SP and then updating it only when the selected exemplar is better. With the collaboration between these two learning mechanisms, HCLPSO expectedly evolves particles effectively to explore the search space and exploit the found optimal zones appropriately to find optimal solutions to LSOPs. Furthermore, to help HCLPSO traverse the vast search space with promising compromise between intensification and diversification, this paper devises a dynamic swarm partition scheme to dynamically separate particles into the two categories. With this dynamic strategy, HCLPSO gradually switches from exploring the search space to exploiting the found optimal zones intensively. Experiments are executed on the publicly acknowledged CEC2010 and CEC2013 LSOP benchmark suites to compare HCLPSO with several state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental results reveal that HCLPSO is effective to tackle LSOPs, and attains considerably competitive or even far better optimization performance than the compared state-of-the-art large-scale methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of each component in HCLPSO and the good scalability of HCLPSO are also experimentally verified.},

Considering the sequential characteristics (related to evolution factors) of the evolution process, a Markov chain with special probability transition matrix is employed to characterize the switching of evolution state. With the help of the mean distance, the concept of population density is first put forward in the dynamic search region enclosed by all particles. Then, taking into account the change of the population density in different generations, two quadratic acceleration terms are introduced into the velocity update model based on the Hadamard product , where four evolution-state-dependent acceleration coefficients are also adopted. The positivity or negativity of the quadratic acceleration terms is retained by resorting to the matrix sign functions. Several widely utilized benchmark functions (including two unimodal and multimodal functions) are employed to evaluate the search capability of the studied SSQPSO scheme. The experimental consequences illustrate that the performance of the developed SSQPSO scheme is superior to that of some popular particle swarm optimization (PSO) schemes. To further demonstrate the effectiveness in practical engineering, the addressed SSQPSO scheme is successfully applied to achieve the fast parameter tuning of the proportional-integral-derivative controller in a spring-mass-damper system.},

In order to avoid repeated dangerous actions, the safeguard module will provide a negative reward to the agent as feedback whenever a dangerous action is replaced.

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on addressing the bipartite tracking control issue for stochastic nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) with unmeasured states, unknown external disturbances and actuator nonlinearity. During the design procedure, a category of distributed reduced-order extended state observers (RESOs) are constructed to compensate for the total disturbances and estimate unknown states. Moreover, in order to solve the adverse impacts caused by actuator nonlinearity (saturation and dead-zone), an auxiliary variable and the Nussbaum gain method are adopted. Compared with the existing results, the proposed scheme has a better approximation effect. Based on distributed RESOs, the command-filtered backstepping method, and stochastic Lyapunov stability theory , a bipartite tracking control protocol is designed such that all signals of the closed-loop system are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in probability . Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are verified via simulation examples and comparison results.},

  abstract     = {Outlier detection is a crucial task for identifying unexpected patterns, errors, and behaviors; therefore, maximizing the valuable information obtained from ubiquitous, incomplete, redundant, noisy, and mixed data poses a great challenge. To achieve efficient graph-based outlier detection, we enhance the connectivity between similar objects and weaken the connectivity between heterogeneous objects. The network structure proposed in this paper is called “an i ncomplete l ocal and g lobal n eighborhood i nformation (ILGNI) network.” In this network, incomplete mixed data can be exploited considering two aspects; single-attribute local information and multi-attribute global information. Specifically, we initially utilize unsupervised attribute reduction methods to improve data quality. Then, from the perspective of local and global information, we use the level of similarity of objects to design strong-neighborhood and weak-similarity relations to deal with incomplete data. On this basis, the topology reconstruction of a high number of fine-grained neighborhood information networks can be realized. Finally, the outlier scores are calculated considering the stationary distribution of the Markov random walk model over the ILGNI network. The experiments conducted on four real-telecom fraud datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve enhanced outlier detection performance with low time complexity. In addition, the proposed method can effectively mine the information obtained from incomplete data and has high applicability to feature-related and feature-independent datasets.},

  abstract     = {Spectral clustering aims to minimise inter-cluster similarity by constructing graph model , which possesses a significant effect in data of arbitrary shape. Nonetheless, there are still two limitations in the existing algorithms. First, spectral methods perform poorly if the densities of instances vary greatly. Second, they are challenging to handle the complex distribution that different objects of densities are mixed. To address the two limitations, in this paper, a novel spectral clustering algorithm is constructed to accommodate more complex multi-density data. The idea of density stratification is proposed through the probability density of Gaussian mixture model , and the number of layers can be automatically determined by the defined scatter index. Then, a new density ratio is established to effectively reduce the density imbalance of diverse instances based on mutual nearest-neighbour and density stratification, which is more advantageous in the clusters with less clear boundaries. Finally, the optimised adjacency matrix and multi-density spectral clustering algorithm are induced to improve the effect of multi-density data. As per experimental results, the proposed algorithm generally outperforms the popular representative algorithms for both synthetic and benchmark datasets, and works more effectively on multi-density as well as single-density data, which illustrates the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

Convolutional neural networks and data augmentation strategies are tuned, producing a model of 87.12\% accuracy for the verification of 2,640 human signatures. Two approaches are used to successfully attack the model with false-acceptance of forgeries. Robotic arms (Line-us and iDraw) physically copy real signatures on paper, and a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained to generate signatures based on the binary class of ‘genuine’ and ‘forged’. The 87.12\% error margin is overcome by all approaches; prevalence of successful attacks is 32\% for iDraw 2.0, 24\% for Line-us, and 40\% for the GAN. Fine-tuning with examples show that false-acceptance is preventable. We find attack success reduced by 24\% for iDraw, 12\% for Line-us, and 36\% for the GAN. Results show exclusive behaviours between human and robotic forgers, suggesting training wholly on human forgeries can be attacked by robots, thus we argue in favour of fine-tuning systems with robotic forgeries to reduce their prevalence.},

Ignoring the effects of these constraints can affect the performance of the system. In addition, the system often requires high convergence speeds to increase productivity. To cope with these problems, this study investigates the fixed-time event-triggered fuzzy adaptive control method . First, special barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs) are constructed to ensure that the full-state constraints are not violated. Furthermore, considering that the communication resources of practical systems are limited, a fuzzy based event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is designed. On this basis, a fixed-time fuzzy adaptive controller is constructed to achieve the fast convergence of the system. Finally, simulation results verify the feasibility.},

This modified p chart is able to support extreme quality levels, but it neglects to consider economy in production of units between both these extremes, i.e., gradual deterioration or gradual improvement of the product quality with respect to the average quality. With the aim of achieving a reasonable balance between both these extremes, we additionally introduce a modified p chart based on fuzzy-valued hypothesis testing . The fuzzy modified p chart is not only able to adequately meet the trade-off between the common and the modified p chart, but also enables to incorporate economic aspects of producing better/worse acceptable quality.

First, we compute the training data proximity to class separation surfaces , identified via a reference linear model. Each data point is associated with a risk index, which is used to partition the training set by an unsupervised technique . Then, we train a learner for each partition and combine the learners&#39; output in an ensemble. Our method treats the protected ML classifier as a black box and is inherently robust to transfer attacks. Experiments show that, for data poisoning rates between 6 and 25 percent of the training set, our method is more robust compared to benchmarks and to a monolithic version of the model trained on the whole training set.

In this paper, we apply the sentiment labels to the trust prediction process for the first time, and propose a deep trust prediction method based on sentiment polarity perception, S-DeepTrust. We first use transfer learning to generate sentiment labels for user review data and obtain a sentiment polarity matrix. Next, we design a rating matrix generation algorithm, which weights the sentiment polarity matrix and the original rating matrix to produce a new rating matrix. Then, the Siamese network architecture is used for the first time in the field of trust prediction to judge the trust relationships based on the extracted user preference vectors, which minimizes the representation of trust user pairs. Finally, the experiment results show that our method achieves higher prediction accuracy and is robust to trust relation sparsity compared with existing methods.},

Some recent works are devoted to addressing heterophily, which exists ubiquitously in real-world networks, breaking the homophily assumption that nodes belonging to the same class are more likely to be connected and restricting the generalization of traditional methods in tasks such as node classification . However, these heterophily-oriented methods still lose efficacy in some typical heterophilic datasets. Moreover, issues on leveraging the knowledge from both node features and graph structure and investigating inherent properties of the datasets still need further consideration. In this work, we first provide insights based on similarity metrics to interpret the long-existing confusion that simple models sometimes perform better than models dedicated to heterophilic networks. Then, sticking to these insights and the classification principle of narrowing the intra-class distance and enlarging the inter-class distance of the sample&#39;s embeddings, we propose a Similarity-Navigated Graph Neural Network (SNGNN) which uses Node Similarity matrix coupled with mean aggregation operation instead of the normalized adjacency matrix in the neighborhood aggregation process. Moreover, based on SNGNN, a novel explicitly aggregating mechanism for selecting similar neighbors, named SNGNN+, is devised to preserve distinguishable features and handle the heterophilic problem. Additionally, a variant, SNGNN++, is further designed to adaptively integrate the knowledge from both node features and graph structure for improvement. Extensive experiments are conducted and demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for both small-scale and large-scale graphs regardless of their heterophilic extent.

Recently, the interference effects of quantum theory have attracted a strong interest in applying some fields outside physics. It can be also used to explain the paradox in decision models. Existing some experiments and studies attribute the main reason for the existence of interference effects to uncertain information in decision process. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory extends the framework of discernment to power sets so it can describe unknown and imprecise information. This paper proposes evidential Markov decision-making model based on belief entropy to quantitatively predict and determine the value of interference effects. In new model, the frame of discernment is extended by introducing hesitant or unknown states which could be hidden by participants. Moreover, new model assumes there is no input of any information at initial states so it has the most chaotic states and is determined according to the maximum belief entropy.

The main challenge is how to address nonconvex constraints while satisfying the L 2 − L ∞ L2−L∞ performance index function. A distributed algorithm is proposed using only the local information, and the containment control problem with nonconvex constraints and L 2 − L ∞ L2−L∞ performance can be solved. Based on the properties of the projection operator and convexity, the constrained L 2 − L ∞ L2−L∞ containment control problem can be solved under the undirected connected graphs .

  abstract     = {Over the last decade, smart cities (SC) have been developed worldwide. Implementing big data and the internet of things improves the monitoring and integration of different infrastructure systems in SC and thus makes our cities more efficient, livable, and sustainable. However, big data is more vulnerable to attacks and hacking, posing significant challenges to the SC&#39;s privacy and security. Moreover, more regulations and rules about protecting user data are being enforced worldwide. Compared with centralized machine learning , federated learning (FL) provides a natural method to protect users&#39; privacy by distributing learning over decentralized data and offers artificial intelligence advantages for sensitive, heterogeneous data domains. Researchers have recently implemented FL, motivated by the improvement in privacy and security of integrated systems in SC. However, many technological problems and risks have been identified. This study provides a comprehensive review of FL&#39;s application to improve privacy and security in SC systems (i.e., transportation, healthcare, communication, etc.). The benefits, drawbacks, open research issues and future directions of the implementation of FL in SC are thoroughly discussed. The study concluded that the existing FL systems required comprehensive testing for different types of attacks, further improving the data protection and performance in SC.},

Forecasting the future of a time series behavior can be useful in planning ahead, saving time, resources, and helping avoid undesired scenarios. To make the forecasting, historical data is utilized due to the causal nature of the time series. Several deep learning algorithms have been presented in this area, where the input is processed through a series of non-linear functions to produce the output. We present a novel strategy to improve the performance of deep learning models in time series forecasting in terms of efficiency while reaching similar effectiveness. This approach separates the model into levels, starting with the easiest and continuing to the most difficult. The simpler levels deal with smoothed versions of the input, whereas the most sophisticated level deals with the raw data. This strategy seeks to mimic the human learning process, in which basic tasks are completed initially, followed by more precise and sophisticated ones. Our method achieved promising results, obtaining a 35\% improvement in mean squared error and a 2.6 time decrease in training time compared with the best models found in a variety of time series.},

By hybridizing two complementary surrogate-assisted strategies, this study proposed an efficient surrogate-assisted differential evolution algorithm to optimize expensive multi-objective problems under a limited computational budget. The two proposed surrogate-assisted strategies balance global and local search for multi-objective optimization. Specifically, one strategy is an improved surrogate-based multi-objective local search method that is based on maximin angle-distance sequential sampling. Compared with the previous local search method that is based on Euclidian distance-based sampling, the improved local search method is more efficient because it can mitigate the scale difference of different objectives. The other surrogate-assisted strategy is prescreening based on a diversity-enhanced expected improvement matrix infill criterion. The proposed infill criterion aims to improve the diversity of approximate Pareto optimal solutions by considering distribution of candidate individuals in the objective space in the infill function. Within a limited computational burden, the performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on a large set of multi-objective benchmark problems, as well as a real-world airfoil design problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better than some existing algorithms on most problems investigated in this study.},

First, art therapy in the current medical environment is discussed, and the security defenses of the IoMT supporting art therapy are studied. Then, a security defense method for IoMT is proposed by combining basic Blockchain knowledge with the Fuzzy Sets Theory. Specifically, a Density-awarded Fuzzy C-means (DFCM) algorithm is developed to solve the clustering issue of unbalanced data sets. Besides, the Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM) model is used to classify data points far from the sample center to increase classification accuracy. In the simulation experiment, the DFCM algorithm achieves a pleasing clustering effect on the four data sets, involving the data sets with density changes and imbalanced sample points within the cluster. Moreover, the combination of DFCM and FSVM (DFCM-FSVM) for attack detection in the Internet of Things (IoT) realizes the optimal accuracy in the detection of different behaviors compared with similar algorithms; the detection accuracy of normal behavior, scheduled attack, gray hole attack, and black hole attack is 99.8\%, 89.8\%, 99.4\%, and 91.5\%, respectively. This work creatively proposes a hybrid intrusion detection method based on fuzzy theory. As the second line of defense in security protection, it plays a critical role and is suitable for the network environment of the perception layer. In conclusion, the attack detection method based on Blockchain combined with the Fuzzy Sets Theory can precisely identify potential attacks in abnormal data, which has important practical value for maintaining data security and the regular operation of the IoMT.},

  abstract     = {Product design is essential in the product lifecycle. In product design, decision errors from designers are ineluctable due to the lack of sufficient knowledge and experience on design parameters. However, the penalties (e.g., expected risk loss costs) of design decisions have been overlooked as always. The result is that being risk-averse naturally becomes a major issue to be advocated. Meanwhile, the preferences of designers, representing rational cognition of product design, are crucial in product design. In response to the above two critical issues, a two-stage three-way enhanced multi-criteria classification optimization for risk-averse product design programming is proposed. In the first stage, the three-way decisions (3WD) theory is introduced to handle the relation between the penalties and design decisions, and provide an uncertain decision representing an intermediate attitude of designers on design parameters. Additionally, designers are endowed to preferentially consider design parameters that are profitable for the success of product design. The purpose of the first stage is to formulate multiple alternative design schemes. In the second stage, under the framework of the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE) TRI, a multi-criteria classification optimization is constructed to cater to designers’ preferences. Subsequently, we can identify the optimal design scheme from these multiple alternative design schemes. The effectiveness and merits of the proposed approach are demonstrated with two illustrative examples and a substrate design case. As shown from the case studies, the proposed approach has a stable performance in terms of identifying the optimal design scheme in a stochastic environment.},

The latter takes various forms. Domain-specific knowledge can constrain the space of candidate equations to those that make sense in the scientific or engineering domain of use. Cross-domain knowledge, on the other hand, imposes general rules for model acceptability, such as parsimony, understandability, or consistency of the equations with the dimensional units of the variables. In this paper, we propose using attribute grammars to ensure the induced equations&#39; dimensional consistency. Attribute grammars are flexible enough to combine cross-domain knowledge on dimensional consistency with domain-specific knowledge expressed as a probabilistic context-free grammar. At the same time, we show that attribute grammars can be efficiently transformed into probabilistic context-free grammars for equation discovery with existing algorithms. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that attribute grammars ensuring dimensional consistency of equations can significantly improve the performance of equation discovery on the standard set of a hundred Feynman benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Truth discovery is an efficient technique for tackling data conflict problems in crowd sensing for distributed data collection. As the sensory data to be collected may include sensitive information about users, privacy-preserving truth discovery has attracted significant attention in recent years. Most existing studies apply a centralized architecture based on a cryptographic system, which may be vulnerable to single-point attacks and also has a very high computational cost. In this paper, we propose DPriTD, a decentralized privacy-preserving framework for truth discovery in crowd sensing. The proposed approach leverages the additively homomorphic property of Shamir&#39;s Secret Sharing scheme to protect user&#39;s privacy. DPriTD provides a strict privacy guarantee for crowd sensing applications. Because each sensitive data point, considered to be a secret, is split into a batch of shares, and the secret cannot be recovered unless a sufficient number of shares are aggregated, DPriTD achieves effective truth discovery while protecting sensitive data from collusion attacks. Furthermore, DPriTD is independent of a centralized server and can perform reliably when not all participants are online in real time. It thus enhances the robustness of a crowd sensing system. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the high performance of our method compared with existing mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Data augmentation strategies have always been important in machine learning techniques and play a unique role in model performance optimization processes. Therefore, in recent years, these techniques have become popular in the artificial intelligence field. In this paper, a new data augmentation strategy is proposed based on the interpretation algorithm of deep convolutional neural networks , i.e., constructing new training samples by deeply exploiting key features extracted from interpretable networks to achieve sample augmentation. Thus, a novel supervised data augmentation approach known as Supervised Data Augmentation–Key Feature Extraction (SDA-KFE) was proposed. By introducing the Neural Network Interpreter-Segmentation Recognition and Interpretation (NNI-SRI) algorithm, an augmentation strategy is proposed that can balance the high accuracy and high robustness of the final model while ensuring a large amount of data augmentation. The advantages of the SDA-KFE algorithm are mainly reflected in the following aspects. First, it is easy to implement. This algorithm is implemented based on the lightweight NNI-SRI algorithm, which lays the foundation for the implementation of SDA-KFE so that it can be easily implemented on convolutional neural networks. Second, this model, which is widely applicable, can be applied to almost any deep convolutional network . Through research and experiments on this proposed algorithm, SDA-KFE can be applied in graphical image binary classification and multiclassification models. Third, SDA-KFE can rapidly construct data samples with diverse variations. Under the premise of determining the classification labels of the generated samples, the distribution of the feature unit composition of the samples can be controlled. Compared with traditional data augmentation methods, SDA-KFE can control the direction of the model performance, i.e., the balance between the pursuit of high accuracy and robust performance of the model. Therefore, the novel supervised augmentation approach proposed in this paper is relevant for optimizing deep convolutional neural networks, solving model overfitting, augmenting data types , etc. The data augmentation algorithm proposed in this paper can be regarded as a useful supplement to traditional data augmentation methods, such as horizontal or vertical image flipping, cropping, color transformation, extension and rotation.},

In particular, we first construct an orthogonal projection matrix to obtain the main characteristic information of the raw data of each view and learn the representation matrix in a clean embedding space. Then, we use tensor learning to couple the projection matrix and the representation matrix to mine the high-order information between views and construct a more suitable and optimal representation of the embedding space. A large number of experiments prove that PCTL can effectively suppress the interference of noise and redundant information, and the clustering performance is better than some existing excellent algorithms.},

Several useful properties and application characteristics of the EPG operator are investigated. Subsequently, the proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic normalized Manhattan distance is proposed, and it forms a basic concept to the construction of the proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic extended power geometric (PHFLEPG) operator. Combined with the clustering model for decision makers , a PHFLEPG-operator-based consensus reaching approach is provided to simplify and rationalize the decision-making process. Furthermore, the comprehensive LSGDM result is derived in the use of the PHFLEPG operator.

Some label correlation exploitation approaches such as GLOCAL have independent model prediction and label correlation stages, thus limiting their learning ability. This paper introduces LSTC, a new algorithm that generates label-specific features and exploits third-order label correlation. On the one hand, for each label, we choose the same number of positive and negative representative instances inspired by density peak. These instances are used to generate a new data matrix with label-specific features. On the other hand, we train a paired output prediction network for each label based on these matrices of its own and that of two auxiliary labels. In this way, third-order label correlations are implicitly exploited. Specifically, the two auxiliary labels are the most similar and least similar, respectively, to avoid getting stuck in local optima. Experiments are conducted on seventeen benchmark datasets in comparison with ten popular algorithms. Results on eight measures demonstrate the superiority of LSTC on data from various domains except the text-domain. The source code is available at github.com/fansmale/lstc .},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) is one of the widely studied algorithms in evolutionary computation. Recently, many adaptive mechanisms have been proposed for DE including adaptive operator selection and adaptive parameter control. Existing studies consider the two kinds of mechanisms independently. In this paper, we first propose a unified mutation operator with learnable parameters. With different parameter settings, the unified mutation operator degenerates into various classic mutation operators. As a result, by adapting the control parameters of the unified mutation operator, we can realize parameter control and operator selection simultaneously. We then present how to use a neural network to adaptively determine the control parameters. We use natural evolution strategies to train the neural network by modeling the evolutionary process as a Markov decision process . We then embed it into three DEs including classic DE, JADE and LSHADE. Experimental studies show that by embedding the learned unified mutation operator, the performances of these backbone DEs can be improved. Particularly, by embedding the unified mutation operator, LSHADE can perform competitively among state-of-the-art EAs including the winner algorithms in the past CEC competitions. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness of the unified mutation operator through analyzing the population diversity theoretically.},

Fortunately, existing studies have shown that activation functions are essential for Neural ODEs in governing intrinsic dynamics. Motivated by a family of weight functions used to enhance the stability of dynamical systems , we introduce a new activation function named half-Swish to match Neural ODEs.

Experiments show that our model consistently outperforms Neural ODEs with basic activation functions on robustness both against stochastic noise images and adversarial examples across Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, which strongly validates the applicability of half-Swish and suggests that half-Swish function plays a positive role in regularizing the dynamic behavior to enhance stability.

To more accurately express the difference between objects in an HIS, a novel distance function on the object set is first constructed. Then, fuzzy symmetric relations on the object set based on this function are established and fuzzy rough approximations are defined. Next, some evaluation functions that represent the classification ability of attribute subsets , such as fuzzy positive regions, dependency functions and attribute importance functions are introduced. After then, FRIC-model is given and an attribute reduction algorithm for hybrid data based on this model is designed.

However, existing methods suffer from limited capability in capturing hierarchical temporal characteristics of the traffic time series. To be specific, they neglect the property that the time series is composed of trend-cyclical and seasonal parts. On the other hand, prior methods ignore the natural hierarchical structure of traffic road networks and thus fail to capture the macro spatial dependence of region networks. To address these issues, we propose a novel spatio-temporal hierarchical MLP network (STHMLP) for traffic forecasting. By adopting a decomposition architecture in the STHMLP, trend-cyclical and seasonal features are gradually grasped from multi-scale local compositions of traffic time series. For each scale of traffic time series, we design a fine module and a coarse module to extract spatio-temporal information from roads and regions, respectively. Specifically, the fine module utilizes spatial filters on the frequency domain features of traffic time series to efficiently capture fine-grained spatial dependencies. The coarse module adaptively coarsens road networks to region networks and captures coarse-grained spatial dependencies from region networks. Experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate the STHMLP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on traffic forecasting.},

However, the similarity metric methods used in them are typically based on linear cross-correlation, ignoring the matching of detailed information. Moreover, the feature extraction operators (e.g., RoI align) lead to a sub-optimal feature representation for matching. In this paper, we propose a novel similarity metric method called feature alignment-based multi-level similarity metric learning network to address these issues. Technically, we elaborate a feature alignment module to extract the features, suppressing the useless background information that affects the matching. Subsequently, using the aligned features, we design a learnable multi-level similarity metric learning network to implement the matching for detailed information at the channel and spatial levels, which effectively guides an accurate and discriminative similarity score. By integrating the above components as second stage, a two-stage robust tracking method FAML-RT is presented. Extensive experiments on the challenging benchmarks OTB100, LaSOT and VOT2018 show that FAML-RT achieves a competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods, while running at a high speed of 60 fps. Furthermore, a series of ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature alignment-based multi-level metric learning network.},

In the traditional dynamic model of CAID, players have identical learning abilities and ignore the influence caused by the environment, which is inconsistent with real society. Therefore, we study the limited learning ability of CAID and the unknown learning mechanism caused by the environment to overcome these problems. Firstly, we propose the dynamic model of limited learning ability for CAID to reveal the law of cooperative evolution in the case when the learning abilities of players are varied. Considering the unknown learning mechanism of players, we adopt the data-driven compensation network to confront the effects of unknown dynamics caused by the environment. In addition, based on the limited learning ability and data-driven compensation network of players, the Lyapunov function is designed to prove the convergence of the CAID, avoiding the high computational complexity caused by the eigenvalues of the Jacobin matrix. In this case, simulations based on two classical dynamic model of evolutionary game theory are carried out to show the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

In addition, existing LSGDM methods mainly adopted aggregation strategies such as the weighted average operator and arithmetic average operator to integrate the opinion of experts in a cluster, which makes the aggregation results cannot reflect the real opinion of the expert group. To address these issues, considering the empathetic network of experts, this study proposes an LSGDM method based on a new aggregation method for expert space information. Firstly, we determine objective weights of experts according to the objective empathetic relationships among experts. Then, the Steiner-Weber point problem is used as a prototype to establish an aggregation method called the spatial optimal aggregation (SOA) method to fuse the spatial information of experts. The model is solved by the genetic algorithm. Finally, an illustrative example about the selection of the most urgent risk in the transportation of COVID-19 vaccines is presented to show the validity and practicability of the proposed model.},

Therefore, this paper proposes knowledge degree to measure knowledge level of DM and develops a new social network driven CRP method for probabilistic linguistic MCGDM problems. Based on the similarity degree and knowledge degree, similarity degree-based social network (SDSN) and trust relationship-based social network (TRSN) are constructed successively. According to the constructed SDSN and TRSN, the proposed CRP method consists of two stages. In the first stage, pair-wise DMs in complementary social network adjust their evaluations. In the second stage, the evaluations of DMs who contribute less to group consensus are modified. To ensure that the group consensus index (GCI) is non-decreasing in the above two stages, the constructed programming models not only improve similarity degrees between DMs-to-adjust and reference DMs but also consider similarity degrees between DMs-to-adjust and other DMs. Finally, an investment selection example and comparison analyses demonstrate the applicability and advantages of the proposed method.},

In fact, the information system is also a non-Euclidean data structure, and there is serious information loss when using classical measurement methods to construct its data structure. Thus, the promotion of GCN is hindered in information systems. This paper applies GCN to the classification of information systems. Firstly, an intuitionistic fuzzy relation , called positive-negative relation, is established in the information system, and the physical meaning of this relationship is explained.

However, it is challenging to obtain accurate wind speed forecasting results since wind speed series contain complex fluctuations. In this paper, a novel wind speed forecasting model is proposed by using a genetic algorithm (GA) and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), where GA is used for evolving the architectures and hyper-parameters of the LSTM, called EvLSTM, because there is no clear knowledge to determine these crucial parameters. In the proposed EvLSTM forecasting model, a flexible gene encoding strategy, crossover operation, and mutation operation are proposed to describe the different architectures and hyper-parameters of the LSTM during the evolutionary process. In addition, to overcome the weakness of the single method for wind speed forecasting, the ensemble EvLSTM (EnEvLSTM) is proposed by using the no negative constraint theory ensemble learning strategy, whose weight coefficients are determined by the differential evolution algorithm . The proposed EvLSTM and EnEvLSTM forecasting models are evaluated on two real-world wind farms located in Inner Mongolia, China and Sotavento Galicia, Spain. Experimental results on two forecasting horizons demonstrate the superiority of EvLSTM and EnEvLSTM in terms of three performance indices and three statistical tests.},

  abstract     = {The fusion of multi-source monitoring information has become the main trend in the field of dam health diagnosis because of the increasing amount of monitoring data that can be obtained from different sensors. However, the Dempster–Shafer (D–S) evidence theory, an important method in multi-source information fusion, may produce counter-intuitive results when fusing conflicting pieces of evidence. To some extent, existing distance measures can deal with highly conflicting evidence, however, the fusion of completely conflicting evidence (indicated by the conflict coefficient K, K = 1) is typically ignored. This study mainly focuses on the fusion of pieces of completely conflicting evidence considering K = 1. The Wasserstein distance in the field of deep learning is introduced to the D–S evidence theory. Based on the foregoing, the belief Wasserstein–1 distance (BWD) method combined with basic probability assignment is proposed to measure evidence distance. The application of the BWD method in dam health diagnosis is presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of this method in multi-source fusion with completely conflicting evidence.},

The system is formed by mapping two sets of conceptual spaces through Institutional Repository (IR) and Core Resource Dataset (CRD) in 2018. The user knowledge pattern matching (UKPM) of EKRS has problems such as uncertain user knowledge text matching, slow update of expert knowledge, and inability to accurately track user knowledge. This paper establishes a user knowledge vector space reconstruction model (UKVSM) through the following steps to solve the above problems. Firstly, the text feature items of IR and CRD are reconstructed and the depth and density correction coefficient matrix of the original node of the text semantic meaning is calculated based on the similarity of feature items of the semantic layer. Secondly, in order to improve the efficiency of UKPM exact matching, the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm (LRA) is used to optimize the two sets of knowledge matching strategies. Finally, the real data set is extracted from the EKRS platform, and the model and algorithm proposed in this paper are tested and verified respectively, and compared with other methods. Experiments show that reconstruction model can improve the accuracy of user knowledge task assignment in EKRS, while LRA can improve the efficiency of model solving.},

In the literature, tensor decomposition-based models and matrix factorization-based models can handle large-scale sparse data well. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work that provides an explanation of the latent time factor embedded in the models. Moreover, conventional Frobenius norm-based models cannot well describe the dynamic changes in user preferences over time. To capture the dynamic changes in user preferences, we interpret the time latent factor vector as a transition matrix of user preferences. In addition, a novel temporal similarity measure is proposed accordingly, which considers dynamic user and item changes between two adjacent time slices. Moreover, we propose a generalized temporal similarity-based nonnegative tensor decomposition (GTS-NTD) model and provide the corresponding solution method. Experiments on three datasets suggest that our proposed method can improve recommendation performance under dynamic changes in user preferences.},

In this paper, a novel multi-view clustering model called AONGR is proposed, which integrates spectral clustering and nonnegative matrix factorization into a joint framework to reconstruct the similarity graphs . The reconstructed graph not only owns a clear structure but offers the interpretation for cluster assignment. The contribution of each view on clustering can also be obtained during the procedure of optimization. And an effective algorithm is designed to update the variables in AONGR. Experimental results on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our AONGR in comparison with the state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {The three-way decisions strategy has been employed to construct network topology in a single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SFNN). However, this model has a general performance, and does not consider the process costs, since it has fixed threshold parameters. Inspired by the sequential three-way decisions (STWD), this paper proposes STWD with an SFNN (STWD-SFNN) to enhance the performance of networks on structured datasets. STWD-SFNN adopts multi-granularity levels to dynamically learn the number of hidden layer nodes from coarse to fine, and set the sequential threshold parameters. Specifically, at the coarse granular level , STWD-SFNN handles easy-to-classify instances by applying strict threshold conditions, and with the increasing number of hidden layer nodes at the fine granular level , STWD-SFNN focuses more on disposing of the difficult-to-classify instances by applying loose threshold conditions, thereby realizing the classification of instances. Moreover, STWD-SFNN considers and reports the process cost produced from each granular level. The experimental results verify that STWD-SFNN has a more compact network on structured datasets than other SFNN models, and has better generalization performance than the competitive models.

People have always been more interested in the unweighted case where each node has the same cost, while there are few results for the weighted case when nodes have different costs. It is a much more challenging problem in network science. In this paper, we present a novel strategy for this generalized network dismantling problem by characterizing the relationship between blocks and cut nodes. We firstly construct an auxiliary block-cut tree T from the original network G , where the nodes in the tree T have two types which correspond to either blocks or cut nodes of G , and edges of T only exist between two different type of nodes. Then we transform the problem of partitioning G by removing nodes to the problem of partitioning T by removing edges, both at a minimum overall cost. Finally partitioning T can be solved by a weighted spectral clustering algorithm. When we apply this new strategy on real-world networks, it performs equally or even better than the current state-of-the-art methods.},

Based on the threat models we formulated, an XAI-aware model extraction attack (XaMEA), a novel attack framework that exploits spatial knowledge from decision explanations is proposed. XaMEA is designed to be model-agnostic: it achieves considerable extraction fidelity on arbitrary machine learning (ML) models. Moreover, we proved that this attack is inexorable, even if the target model does not proactively provide model explanations. Various empirical results have also verified the effectiveness of XaMEA and disclosed privacy leakages caused by decision explanations. We hope this work would highlight the need for techniques that better trade off the transparency and privacy of ML models.},

Our research, as a result of a comparative analysis performed on 7 state-of-the-art models, 5 performance measures and 3 datasets, has highlighted three main findings: (1) the majority of relational topic models are not able to offer a good trade-off between classification capabilities and topic interpretability ; (2) single-objective optimization of hyper-parameters, targeted on maximizing the F1-Measure, is able to create topics that are also optimal with respect to the Kullback Leibler divergence measure; (3) the Pareto frontiers across several performance metrics reveals that the most promising trade-off between the performance metrics can be obtained by Constrained Relational Topic Models.},

  abstract     = {Existing hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithms generally depend on the Euclidean characteristic metric (Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Chebyshev distance, etc.) on Euclidean space to describe the similarity between objects, which makes the clustering process oriented to data sets with uniform and regular distribution in Euclidean space . Although such methods can visually distinguish the cluster distribution of data, it is not effective for the data sets which are densely distributed, interlaced and complex in Euclidean space. As a scalable, efficient and robust method, granular computing generally analyzes data from the perspective of similarity and proximity. In consideration of the advantages of granular computing in extracting data information from a multi-level perspective, in order to reduce the limitations of HC methods based on Euclidean features on non-Euclidean data, this paper proposes a novel HC method based on non-Euclidean feature structure. First, this paper constructs the similarity between objects based on K -dominance granularity and neighborhood search, and considers the environmental information of data points from both global and local perspectives. Secondly, a new HC method based on non-Euclidean feature structure is designed on the basis of the similarity measurement constructed in this paper. Finally, through comparative analysis, the experimental results prove that our method can more accurately identify the densely distributed and interlaced data sets in Euclidean space; it is significantly better than comparison algorithms using different Euclidean features to measure similarity; it has good robustness when additional Gaussian noise is added.},

Conventional methods for controlling flatness are based on the first principles, empirical models, and predesigned rules, which are less adaptable to changing rolling conditions. To address this limitation, this paper proposed an offline reinforcement learning (RL) based data-driven method for flatness control. Based on the data collected from a factory, the offline RL method can learn the process dynamics from data to generate a control policy. Unlike online RL methods, the proposed method does not require a simulator for training, the policy can be potentially safer and more accurate since a simulator involves simplifications that can introduce bias. To obtain a steady performance, the proposed method incorporated ensemble Q-functions into policy evaluation to address uncertainty estimation . To address distributional shifts, based on Q-values from ensemble Q-functions, behavior cloning was added to policy improvement. Simulation and comparison results showed that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art offline RL methods and achieved the best performance in producing strips with lower flatness.},

First, a mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to reduce the total train traveling times and improve the passenger comfortability. The solutions of the model provide simultaneously the optimal train rescheduling strategies and train speed control strategies. Second, a rolling horizon algorithm is applied in consideration of the disruption uncertainties.

Therefore, the train rescheduling orders and speed control orders can be adjusted according to the real-time situation to guarantee effectiveness.

In this paper, a novel fuzzy large group decision making method is established using three-way clustering and an adaptive exit-delegation mechanism. Traditional clustering approaches group together individuals (isolated points) that deviate from the whole. The individuals (edge points) may exist and wander in between two or more classes. Both circumstances can lead to unstable and unreasonable clustering results . To overcome both setbacks, we propose a three-way clustering method based on the k -means clustering algorithm . The method first applies k -means clustering to perform an initial division of the universe of decision-makers. Then, in the spirit of three-way clustering, the edge points and outliers are separated from the clustering results by resorting to the three-way relationships between individuals and classes. The final clustering stems from an adaptive exit-delegation mechanism, and a consensus measure-based model determines the intra-group individual weight and inter-individual trust weight. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology that arises from the model designed in this paper are verified by comparative analyses.},

For example, a model trained to recognize animals can be reprogrammed to recognize digits by embedding an adversarial program in the digit images provided as input. Recent work has shown that adversarial reprogramming may not only be used to abuse machine-learning models provided as a service, but also beneficially, to improve transfer learning when training data is scarce. However, the factors affecting its success are still largely unexplained. In this work, we develop a first-order linear model of adversarial reprogramming to show that its success inherently depends on the size of the average input gradient, which grows when input gradients are more aligned, and when inputs have higher dimensionality . The results of our experimental analysis, involving fourteen distinct reprogramming tasks, show that the above factors are correlated with the success and the failure of adversarial reprogramming.},

  abstract     = {Effective shield attitude control is essential for the quality and safety of shield construction. The traditional shield attitude control method is manual control based on a driver&#39;s experience, which has the defects of hysteresis and poor reliability. This research proposes an intelligent method to predict the shield attitude based on a Bayesian-light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) model. The constructed model includes 29 parameters that impact the shield attitude and 6 parameters that represent the shield attitude. The developed the Bayesian-LGBM model can predict the shield attitude and support shield attitude control by adjusting construction parameters and conducting iterative prediction. Guiyang rail transit line 3 is selected as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that: (1) The developed Bayesian-LGBM model is able to effectively predict the shield attitude; (2) The importance ranking can clarify the key construction parameters that should be controlled; (3) The proposed method enables supporting the effective shield attitude control by continuously adjusting the shield construction parameters. The proposed attitude guidance control method based on the proposed Bayesian-LGBM model can be used to provide a reference for actual shield attitude applications and other similar problems.},

  abstract     = {Appendable-block blockchain was established in an effort to standardize a blockchain architecture for heterogeneous Internet of Things devices. In current constructions, the main disadvantage lies in the full trust of gateways, which can launch coordinated and individual eclipse attacks against IoT sensing devices without being caught. This paper introduces Hieraledger, a novel commitment protocol for exposing malicious gateways in appendable-block blockchain constructions. To minimize the likelihood of eclipse attacks, each sensing device selects more than one gateway based on a novel reputation scoring model and the self-valuation of its privacy. To expose malicious gateways, our protocol employs fail-stop signatures thwarting signature forging, cryptographic hash functions, and a novel Merkle appendable tree. For each sensing device, we generate a resource-aware repudiable cryptographic proof of origin evidence. For gateway nodes, we generate a chain of commitment-based non-repudiable cryptographic proofs of delivery evidence. To demonstrate the security and robustness of our scheme, we analyze it under a solid theoretical security model. Based on our findings, our protocol enables sensing devices to seek arbitration and expose malicious gateways to the network. The present study is a further addition to the growing body of research into privacy preserving blockchain solutions for the Internet of Things},

  abstract     = {Linear regression, the most basic and widely used machine learning algorithm , has played an essential role in many areas such as healthcare, economics, and weather prediction. However, in practice, regression training requires a large dataset, usually stored in a distributed form from multiple data owners. Moreover, it is difficult to federate data among users to train a global model because of privacy issues and communication limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a non-interactive privacy-enhanced training scheme for linear regression based on functional encryption - FELR. In particular, based on the secure aggregation scheme and Paillier inner-product functional encryption, two cloud servers can train the model on the ciphertext . The solution does not require any interaction between the cloud servers and data owners. Throughout the training period, the cloud servers do not know any local private data. A detailed security analysis demonstrates that FELR can provide high security for data owners. The experimental conclusions also demonstrate that the performance of the training scheme on the data owners&#39; side is approximately 25\% higher than that of the existing solution, which significantly decreases the computational costs.},

Depending on the demand for bicycles, stations may either become empty or full of bicycles. This problem is usually solved by means of a vehicle that exchanges bicycles among the stations following some balancing strategy. In this paper, we propose a model for PBSSs using generalized stochastic Petri nets with external control, a Petri net with an external agent that decides how to execute the balancing strategy. The main advantage of our model is that it allows different balancing strategies to be implemented without changing the Petri net structure. In addition, since the model is a Petri net, we can easily implement it by making a Petri net simulator built with the incidence matrix associated with the Petri net model. We also propose two balancing strategies and validate both the simulation algorithm and the balancing strategies by applying them to the performance evaluations of the model of a real system, named Integra UFRJ PBSS . The performance evaluation of the system under the balacing strategies have shown that both strategies considerably reduce the times, in average, that stations remain full or empty throughout the system operation, solving problems related to stations being empty of full; in particular, the first strategy reduced those times in such a way that no more than five percent of the users of each station had trouble returning their bicycles due to stations being full, whereas the second strategy reduced the percentage of lost users due to stations being empty to no more than five percent for each station.},

In this paper, a large-scale community detection method based on core node and layer-by-layer label propagation is proposed, which is further extended to the detection of overlapping community structures. First, the core nodes whose node degree is greater than the average degree in the graph are found to make effective use of the feature that the core node is the potential community center. This will also avoid the impact of nodes with low node degrees on community structure detection. Then, starting from the core node, label propagation is carried out layer-by-layer according to the node degree and node connection, which effectively improves the accuracy of community detection. The node labels after label propagation are calibrated according to the current attraction of the community to the nodes, which effectively improves the situation of misclassification in the early community detection. Finally, overlapping community detection is carried out based on the non-overlapping community structure. At this time, the overlapping community detection result is more accurate and interpretable. The community detection results on 3 synthetic networks and 12 real datasets show that the proposed algorithm has more advantages than four non-overlapping community detection methods and two overlapping community detection methods.},

In this paper, an ontology-based framework integrating machine learning and probabilistic planning within commonsense reasoning is proposed to recognize the user&#39;s context and abnormalities associated with it. The reasoning is performed using event calculus in answer set programming (ECASP); ECASP allows for abductive and temporal reasoning, which results in an eXplainable AI (XAI) approach. A context ontology is proposed to axiomatize the reasoning and introduce the notion of probabilistic fluents into the EC formalism in order to perform probabilistic reasoning . The reasoning incorporates probabilistic planning based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to solve knowledge incompleteness. To evaluate the proposed framework, real-life scenarios, based on the Orange4Home and SIMADL public datasets are implemented and discussed.},

This poses grand challenges to an algorithm in converging to the Pareto set . Numerous evolutionary algorithms (EAs) tailored for sparse LSMOPs have been proposed in recent years. However, the final population generated by these EAs is not sparse enough because the location of the nonzero decision variables is difficult to locate accurately and there is insufficient interaction between the nonzero decision variables&#39; locating process and the nonzero decision variables&#39; optimizing process. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic sparse grouping evolutionary algorithm (DSGEA) that dynamically groups decision variables in the population that have a comparable amount of nonzero decision variables. Improved evolutionary operators are introduced to optimize the decision variables in groups. As a result, the population obtained by DSGEA can stably evolve towards the sparser Pareto optimal that has a precise location of nonzero decision variables. The proposed algorithm outperforms existing up-to-date EAs for sparse LSMOPs in experiments on three real-world problems and eight benchmark problems.},

However, there are still some limitations in the existing GMC algorithm. In these algorithms, a graph is usually constructed to represent the relationship between the samples in a view; however, it cannot represent the relationship very well since it is often preconstructed. In addition, these algorithms ignore the robustness problem of each graph and high-level information between different graphs. Then, in the paper, we propose a novel MVC method , i.e., robust and optimal neighborhood graph learning for MVC (RONGL/MVC). Specifically, we first build an initial graph for each view. However, these initial graphs cannot represent the relationship between the samples in each view well, so we look for the optimal graph with k connected components in the neighborhood of each initial graph, where k is the number of clusters. Then, to improve the robustness of RONGL/MVC, we reconstruct the optimal graph with the self-representation matrix. Furthermore, we stack all the self-representation matrices into a tensor and impose the tensor low-rank constraint, which can maximize consistent features and explore the high-order relationship between optimal graphs. In addition, we provide an optimization strategy by utilizing the Augmented Lagrange Multiplier (ALM) method. Experimental results on several datasets indicate that RONGL/MVC outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

However, under extreme cases when very few labels are available ( e.g. , 1 labeled node per class), GNNs suffer from severe performance degradation . Specifically, we observe that existing GNNs suffer from unstable training process on few-labeled graphs, resulting to inferior performance on node classification . Therefore, we propose an effective framework, Stabilized Self-Training (SST) , which is applicable to existing GNNs to handle the scarcity of labeled data, and consequently, boost classification accuracy . We conduct thorough empirical and theoretical analysis to support our findings and motivate the algorithmic designs in SST. We apply SST to two popular GNN models GCN and DAGNN, to get SSTGCN and SSTDA methods respectively, and evaluate the two methods against 10 competitors over 5 benchmarking datasets . Extensive experiments show that the proposed SST framework is highly effective, especially when few labeled data are available.

  abstract     = {This paper concerns a new incremental approach to mining data streams. It is known that patterns in a data stream may evolve over time. In many cases, we need to track and analyze the nature of these changes. In the paper, the probabilistic neural networks are considered as basic models for tracking changes in data streams. We present globally convergent stream data mining algorithms applied to problems of regression, classification, and density estimation in a time-varying (drifting) environment. The algorithms are derived from the Parzen kernel-based probabilistic neural networks working in the online mode. For each problem, a theorem is presented ensuring the L 2 L2 convergence of the algorithm designed for tracking drifting regression, density, or discriminant functions . Illustrative examples explain in detail how to choose the bandwidth of the Parzen kernel and the learning rate of the online algorithm . The performance of all algorithms is shown in exemplary simulations. It should be noted that this paper is one of very few, in the existing literature, presenting mathematically justified stream data mining algorithms .},

Based on a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN), we present CNN-Fusion, an effective and lightweight phishing URL detection method. Our basic idea is to deploy multiple variants of one-layer CNN with various-sized kernels in parallel to extract multi-level features. Observing that differences between phishing and benign URLs might exhibit a strong spatial correlation , we choose SpatialDropout1D, making the model more robust and preventing it from memorizing the training data. To further reduce the probability of errors that may cause by irrelevant or noisy features, we apply a max-over time pooling technique over the feature map to pick only the most important feature. Finally, the model is evaluated using five publicly available datasets containing 1.85 million phishing and benign URLs. Other than that, we assess the model against AI adversarial attacks , known as “Offensive AI .” Compared to existing methods, experiments demonstrate that our approach enjoys advantages in 5 times less training time and much more in memory consumption, achieving an average accuracy above 99\% on five different datasets as well as on AI-generated malicious attacks .},

  abstract     = {With respect to an intelligent government questions &amp; answers (Q &amp; A) system, user intention recognition for government affairs is a key issue. Accurate intention recognition can effectively reduce manual participation and improve the user satisfaction. However, the intention recognition model in the field of government affairs not only requires the recognition accuracy, but also needs to meet the fairness demands of users. In order to improve the fairness of the model, this paper makes the model focus on the unrecognizable intention samples in each intention type as much as possible. Hence, we firstly design a two-stage intention recognition method based on the idea of three-way decision (TWD). In the first stage, we use the Bert model as the intention recognition model and divide the samples with insufficient classification confidence into the boundary region. In the second stage, we combine the divide-and-rule idea of TWD with focal loss to suppress the easily recognized samples in the non-boundary region, so as to reduce the contribution of these samples to the loss of the classifier. Meanwhile, we can enhance the contribution of samples with insufficient classification confidence in the boundary region to the loss of the classifier, and then optimize the recognition ability of the classifier. Then, by utilizing sequential three-way decision (STWD), we recognize the user&#39;s intention types at multiple granularity . According to the recognition results of coarser granularity , we can optimize the recognition ability of the classifier for the intention that is difficult-to-recognize by adjusting the loss function. On the premise of ensuring that it has little impact on the intention recognition ability of other types of users, we improve the recognition ability of the intention that is difficult-to-recognize. Based on the above-mentioned methods, we further propose a multi-stage training method that can make the model focus on the unrecognizable intention text and the unrecognizable intention type. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through some series of experimental analysis.},

At present, most of MTL methods are all based on one hypothesis that all learning tasks are related and approximate for joint learning. However, this hypothesis may not be held in some scenarios, which may further lead to the problem of negative transfer. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to deal with the negative transfer problem and simultaneously improve the generalization performance in the joint learning. Combining with the subspace learning, we proposed a calibrated multi-task subspace learning method (CMTSL) under the binary group constraint. With the low-rank constraint on subspaces and the binary group indicator, our model can identify “with whom” one task should share and perform the multi-task inference on the high-dimensional parameter space in the meantime. To better approximate the low-rank constraint, we introduce a capped rank function as the tight relaxation term. Last, an iteration based re-weighted algorithm is proposed to solve our model and the convergence analysis is also proved in theory. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.},

By proposing an anti-attack control method , the nonlinear MASs can achieve the bipartite secure control goal in an insecure network and physical environment. In addition, to save communication resources, a novel distributed adaptive self-triggered control (ASTC) mechanism is proposed. Different from the traditional self-triggered control, the trigger interval can be dynamically adjusted according to the situation that the followers converge to the convex hull formed by the leaders, which makes the proposed control protocol based on ASTC able to balance the system performance and communication resources under DoS attacks through scheduling the inherent system resources. Furthermore, in order to overcome the problem of complexity explosion, a command filter is introduced into the design process to simplify the design process. The validity of our control scheme is demonstrated through a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a unified event-triggered sliding-mode control framework to attain the finite/fixed-time reachability of practical sliding-mode band. In event-triggered sliding-mode control, the practical sliding mode makes the size of the sliding-mode band dependent on the event function rather than the disturbance bound and sampling interval and provides better control performance due to this advantage. Under this paper&#39;s unified framework, the predesigned practical sliding-mode band can be respectively reached within a finite/fixed time by choosing different parameters. Then, different from the asymptotical convergence obtained in other investigations, the ultimate finite-time stability of the controlled system can be guaranteed. In the sliding phase, by adjusting the initial value of integration for settling time from initial value of the controlled system to the point where the sliding phase starts, a more precise estimation to settling time is obtained and can be generalized to different kinds of systems. In addition, in comparison to other results in finite-time event-triggered sliding-mode control, signum function is subtracted from the measurement error which eliminates the Zeno phenomenon and ensures the reliable operation of the digital controller in reality. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

The purpose of this work was to investigate variable selection and classification methods by mining another, more general form of PNARs, one that is more suitable for binary classification and variable selection problems. The algorithm for mining such PNARs exploits the downward closure property of negative itemsets. It is built based solely on items in a transactional database and on equivalence classes under the support–confidence framework. The algorithm combines the process of mining frequent itemsets and rule generation and is both sound and complete. Experimental results on 10 binary datasets of the variable selection and classification methods using the PNARs mined by the proposed algorithm show that these methods are superior to variable selection methods that use the mutual information measure and the chi-squared test and 10 popular classification algorithms , respectively.},

No bidder is able to repudiate or change any bidding to outbid others and all public information comes with proof that even observers are able to validate the auction. Proofs post along the way to validate biddings and identify the winner are in the form of group elements with communication complexity O ( log ⁡ ( n m ) ) O(log⁡(nm)) , n , m n,m denoting the upper bound bit length of the bidding price and the number of bidders respectively. The logarithmic complexity significantly reduces the communication cost and makes it practical for large-scale auction. Moreover, our protocol can be easily extended to any type of ordinal-price sealed-bid auction such as second-price with privacy preserving. We provide detailed security proofs or analysis of the required security goals. The evaluation of time cost in off-chain operations and gas cost in on-chain functions demonstrate the practicality of our protocol in real-world applications.},

With this work, we propose an asymmetric image encryption scheme with an S-box generator that has provable security against linear attacks, which is an important first step toward developing such schemes. Our generator is based on an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation that is feasible if and only if there exists an S-box with a given level of nonlinearity. We design a pseudo random number generator based on elliptic curves (ECs) which is used in our scheme to create confusion and diffusion in the cipher-images. Our scheme is highly sensitive to the keys and the plain-images, and hence it offers high security against differential attacks. Furthermore, our scheme allows users to use any size of random numbers and ECs, which makes it more flexible than existing schemes. Finally, we confirm through computational experiments that compared to existing state-of-the-art schemes, our scheme has superior cryptographic properties with low computational complexity , and hence is a good candidate for application in real-time systems.},

  abstract     = {Streaming Recommender Systems (SRSs) have emerged to deliver recommendations based on pervasive data streams, which are a sequence of user-item interactions with multiple behavior types (e.g., purchase, add-to-cart, and view). However, existing SRSs all rely on a single behavior type (e.g., purchase) to make streaming recommendations, and commonly suffer from the data sparsity problem. To address this issue, the relatively more abundant multi-behavior interactions (i.e., interactions with multiple behavior types) could be well leveraged for more accurate streaming recommendations. However, it remains a challenge on how to effectively leverage the commonly-existing and complex multi-behavior interactions for improving the accuracy of streaming recommendations. Targeting at this challenge, we propose the first Multi-behavior Streaming Recommender System in the literature, called MbSRS, to elaborately exploit multi-behavior interactions for delivering accurate recommendations in streaming scenarios. In MbSRS, we first learn instant user preferences and unified item characteristics collaboratively from multi-behavior interactions. Then, we attentively learn long-term user preferences from the historical items interacted by the corresponding users. After that, we wisely fuse the learned instant and long-term user preferences via a gate mechanism. Finally, a novel multi-behavior-specific training process is devised for more effectively learning user preferences towards items from multi-behavior interactions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed MbSRS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

Firstly, this paper proposes a new multiplicative consistency of complete IVFPRs. It is proved that this new multiplicative consistency is robust and invariable to compared objects’ labels. Then, the definition of acceptable incomplete IVFPRs (In-IVFPRs) is presented. To make full use of all direct and indirect evaluations of decision-makers, an algorithm is devised to evaluate the missing elements of an acceptable incomplete In-IVFPR. To comprehensively describe the closeness between any two complete IVFPRs, the total deviation of two complete IVFPRs is defined based on the p -norm of a vector. By minimizing the total deviation of two complete IVFPRs, a programming model is built to determine an interval weight vector from a complete IVFPR. Subsequently, a novel decision-making method with an In-IVFPR is proposed. Lastly, three practical and numerical examples and simulation-based comparative analyses are provided to further validate the practicability and advantages of the proposed method.},

Previous research focused on collecting feature sets to predict netizens’ spreading behavior, and few of them went further into predicting information diffusion path cascade by cascade. To solve this problem effectively, we proposed a prediction method based on a topic-oriented relationship strength network. First, we analyzed a subset of historical interaction records and found the temporal correlations in interactive frequency and in interest topics between users. Second, we constructed a topic-oriented relationship strength network to indicate users’ spreading preferences, including frequency and interest. Third, we collected some features and applied machine learning models to predict information diffusion paths cascade by cascade in the network. The experimental results testified that our method could predict the information diffusion path effectively with fewer features. Moreover, our experimental network shows some interest communities and different roles of users in information diffusion.},

  abstract     = {Community search aims to provide efficient solutions for searching high-quality communities via given sample nodes from network. Much research effort has devoted to mining a single community based on the assumption of sample nodes are from the same community. Despite their effectiveness, the following two insights are often neglected. First, complex high-order structural relationship and attribute provide auxiliary information to represent nodes and offer meaningful information to compensate the incomplete and missing information of the network, it benefits to optimal results. Second, user usually assumes that sample nodes come from the same community without any prior knowledge. This stringent assumption limits the flexibility of algorithm in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel multi-community search method in attributed networks that is capable of effectively searching multi-communities where sample nodes locate. Specifically, we appoint complex structural information as internal attributes which explicitly encode node&#39;s interaction and combine it with node attributes. In order to better capture association between nodes and attributes, we construct a node-attribute graph and similarity enhanced random walk is performed based on it. The similarity enhanced random walk is developed to reinforce the walking path of each sample node so that they can better distinguish and capture the community structure for sample nodes. The multi-communities with densely connected and similar attributes can be found by parallel conductance. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world graphs verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, and show its superiority over many state-of-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Three-way decision, an essential granular computing research tool, provides an efficient solution to complex and uncertain problems. Behavioral decision theory can analyze the risk preferences of decision-makers effectively. Scholars have conducted preliminary exploration on the fusion of these two theories, but it is still challenging to describe the different types of risk preferences of decision-makers. This paper combines prospect theory with regret theory and studies the compound risk preference modeling of three-way decision to address this issue. Because three attitudes of conflicts coincide with three-way decision, many scholars have conducted multi-dimensional research on three-way conflict analysis and accomplished remarkable results. However, few relevant studies consider psychological factors and risk attitudes of decision-makers, and it is more appropriate to describe agents&#39; attitudes on issues using linguistic terms . This paper applies the proposed three-way decision model based on compounded risk preference and probabilistic linguistic term sets to the conflict analysis problem. We utilize examples to explain the decision-making process of the proposed model and three-way conflict analysis method with the influence of the compounded risk preference under the action of reference point and regret avoidance coefficient. The illustrative example illustrates that the proposed three-way decision model can effectively solve the software development conflict analysis problem for different decision-makers and the comparative analysis shows the advantages of the proposed model and method compared with the two existing methods. Finally, we verify the performance of the three-way decision model based on compounded risk preference by UCI data sets in parameter experiments. The changes of the reference point from 10 to 0 and regret avoidance coefficient in 0, 0.15 and 0.3 respectively demonstrate the trend rule of the model&#39;s thresholds and delay-decision rate index.},

When the nodes exhibit a skew distribution, the imbalanced graph data and the message-passing way of GNNs may significantly influence the decision boundary. Existing methods, generating additional nodes and edges or assigning weights of nodes to balance the training scenario, generally have a complicated implementation and a high time complexity. To this end, we propose Balanced Neighbor Exploration (BNE), an algorithm to improve training efficiency and classification performance in a fundamentally different way without generating nodes and computing weights. Intuitively, nodes highly influenced by nodes in one class should have a higher probability of belonging to the class. Inspired by this intuition, BNE incorporates more nodes highly influenced by minority nodes into the minority set to provide a balanced training scenario. The neighbor exploration involves sum and sort operations whose time complexities are O ( N ) O(N) and O ( N log ⁡ N ) O(Nlog⁡N) , respectively, with a fast operation process. Moreover, BNE conducts the message-passing and neighbor exploration processes simultaneously, with a straightforward implementation. Experiments on real-world imbalanced graph data demonstrate that BNE vastly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised node classification on imbalanced graph data.},

By introducing dynamic interval variables, a component-wise dynamic event-triggered strategy is utilized to reduce the consumption of communication resources. With considering the amplitude-bounded uncertainties and event-triggered scheme, a joint state-fault estimator is constructed to estimate the system state as well as possible system faults simultaneously, which are utilized to construct the fault-tolerant controller by compensating the effects of system faults. A co-design approach of the estimator, compensator, and event-triggered strategy is proposed to guarantee the stability and l 1 l1 performance of the system, based on which a zonotope-based interval estimation algorithm of system state and possible faults is provided to obtain the tight estimation of system state and faults.

  abstract     = {Payment channel networks (PCNs) are effective techniques for extending the scalability of cryptocurrencies . It achieves this by establishing a direct off-line channel from the sender to the receiver, going through one intermediary (aka. the hubs ). In such scenarios, the hubs know the origin and destination of each transaction flowing through them, which jeopardizes the privacy of the underlying systems. Unfortunately, former efforts in ensuring transaction unlinkability either rely on trusted mixing services, are inefficient constructed ( e.g., constructed inefficient cryptographic primitives), or have limited applicability. In this paper, we present ObliHub, an efficient payment channel scheme that conceals transaction direction information to the hubs. The core technique of ObliHub in achieving unlinkability is our tailored oblivious puzzle transfer protocol (OPT), which enables puzzle solving among the payer, the hub, and the receiver to be conducted in an oblivious manner – the hub center neither knows where a puzzle hint came from nor who acquired it. The implementation of ObliHub only requires efficient cryptographic primitives , and compared with A 2 L A2L (a state-of-the-art Bitcoin-compatible PCH using homomorphic encryption), ObliHub saves 0.2 seconds in computation time over previous solutions and improves transfer throughput. Besides, our scheme is in accord with Universal Composability (UC) framework and we provide a comprehensive security analysis of it.},

To this end, we propose a multitasking evolutionary framework based on adaptive solver selection, namely MTEA-SaO, where a suitable knowledge transfer strategy is embedded. The proposed method can be featured as 1) It explicitly assigns several solver subpopulations to each task and adaptively picks a best-fitting solver for each task, and 2) It enables knowledge transfer using the implicit similarities between tasks.

In the light of a major consideration for both stabilizing control and destabilizing input, the THAIC is capable of being manipulated to a wider range of intermittent control signals. Meanwhile, our proposed control strategy can not only deal with the problem that the intermittent control signals subject to external interferences, but also effectively avoid the possible damage of actuators caused by the sudden and rapid switching of control gain from a negative constant value to zero. The concept “average intermittent control gain” is introduced to quantify the gain of THAIC. As a generalization of the existing Halanay-type inequalities, several novel differential inequalities with time-varying and unbounded coefficients are established, based on which and Lyapunov method as well as graph theory, less conservative stability criteria of SDMNST are rigorously demonstrated. Subsequently, the theoretical results are applied to spring-mass-damper systems and numerical simulations are exploited with the design of control gain being shown.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel fast finite-time velocity observer-based terminal sliding mode controller is proposed for a class of multi-input multi-output nonlinear systems in the presence of unknown time-varying matched uncertainties and input saturation constraint. The considered nonlinear system is a chain of interdependent second-order nonlinear subsystems that can describe a multitude of real practical applications. The notion of an auxiliary system is introduced and utilized to deal with the input saturation. Due to the hardship of measuring and accessibility to all the system states, a robust output feedback sliding mode controller is designed based on nonsingular fast terminal sliding surfaces exploiting the estimated states and the auxiliary system’s states which is capable of alleviating the control signal gains and enhancing the convergence rate. By noticing that the separation principle does not hold in nonlinear systems , analyzing the finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is a challenging problem and will be assured via an innovative Lyapunov function candidate. Moreover, an explicit adjustable finite convergence time is derived.

  abstract     = {A key challenge of physiological signal processing in the Internet of Medical Things is that physiological signals usually have dynamic distribution changes. Another challenge is that patients&#39; data is vulnerable to disclosures. To address these problems, we propose a meta continual learning method, called MetaCL. MetaCL consists of a shared feature extractor, a knowledge base, a micro classifier module and a blockchain module. The shared feature extractor adopts a horizontal federated learning mechanism to prevent data leakage. The knowledge base is built and updated based on a Splite-based method to overcome catastrophic forgetting. The micro classifier module uses a mean-based model transfer method to adapt to the emergence of new classes. It integrates a Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization to the loss function to deal with fuzzy boundaries of classes. The blockchain module is designed based on the Alliance chain to protect the privacy of the classification results . Experiment results show that refinement classification performance of MetaCL is 98.35\%, which outperforms the compared state-of-the-art works. The backward transfer under four increment scenarios is all within -2.6\%. At last, a blockchain-based engineering application is presented to show that MetaCL can prevent privacy protection in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT).},

  abstract     = {Sparse learning is essential in mining high-dimensional data. Iterative hard thresholding (IHT) methods are effective for optimizing nonconvex objectives for sparse learning. However, IHT methods are vulnerable to adversary attacks that infer sensitive data. Although pioneering works attempted to relieve such vulnerability, they confront the issue of high computational cost for large-scale problems. We propose two differentially private stochastic IHT: one based on the stochastic gradient descent method (DP-SGD-HT) and the other based on the stochastically controlled stochastic gradient method (DP-SCSG-HT). The DP-SGD-HT method perturbs stochastic gradients with small Gaussian noise rather than full gradients, which are computationally expensive. As a result, computational complexity is reduced from O(nlog(n)) to a lower O(blog(n)) , where n is the sample size and b is the mini-batch size used to compute stochastic gradients. The DP-SCSG-HT method further perturbs the stochastic gradients controlled by large-batch snapshot gradients to reduce stochastic gradient variance. We prove that both algorithms guarantee differential privacy and have linear convergence rates with estimation bias. A utility analysis examines the relationship between convergence rate and the level of perturbation, yielding the best-known utility bound for nonconvex sparse optimization. Extensive experiments show that our algorithms outperform existing methods.},

However, most POARM methods have been applied to post-event analysis, which has poor timeliness and a low efficiency. Therefore, the real-time monitoring of public opinion association rules is lacking. To address this problem, we propose the parallel Incremental POARM Framework (IPOARM), which improves the timeliness of association rule mining in two ways: 1) using an incremental merge method to consider both inserted and deleted public opinion transaction sets and reuse previous frequent itemsets to reduce redundant computation and 2) employing a parallel implementation of big data process platforms. Moreover, the flexible association rule mining (ARM) algorithm selection structure of IPOARM enables users to freely select suitable ARM algorithms. We represent four classic transaction sets as public opinion transaction sets and compare the IPOARM framework with two novel incremental association rules mining algorithms. Our evaluations indicate that the IPOARM framework can discover Internet public opinion association rules quickly, implying that it can be easily integrated into existing big data processing platforms and that it significantly improves the mining accuracy and efficiency by 12.756\% and 29.371\%, respectively.},

To overcome this limitation, many existing studies rely on unsupervised deep metric learning (UDML) to make full use of the similarity of unlabeled pest images. However, they still have two limitations: (i) the clustering using only image modalities has performance bottlenecks and there is no semantic similarity in learned metric space; (ii) the taxonomic structure of pests has not been fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a novel UDML-based pest image classification method called Multi-modal Pseudo-Information guided unsupervised deep metric learning (MmPI) for agricultural pest images, where reliable and effective pseudo-labels are extracted from unlabeled multi-modal agricultural data. Specifically, we use the joint features of ground-truth images and pseudo-captions for clustering to generate highly reliable pseudo-labels. Moreover, to generate pseudo-labels with different levels of granularities , we propose an improved Hierarchical Pseudo-Label Generation Algorithm (HPLGA) in which split intervals of different granularities are obtained by re-clustering the merging distances generated in the process of hierarchical clustering . We compare MmPI with ten state-of-the-art (SOTA) UDML-based methods on the multimodal pest dataset APTV-99. The results show that compared with the that ten methods, our proposed method improves by 4.88\%, 4.24\% and 10.26\% in terms of NMI, Recall@1 and F1, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is a predominant paroxysmal neurological disturbance that is usually recognized as the incidence of impulsive seizures rarely seen in medicine. Automatic detection of epileptic seizures from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is viewed as an effective diagnosis of patients on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). To design a robust detection service in an IoMT environment, the EEG signals of different patients are collected from geographically distributed patients to a centralized server. However, this makes the patient’s privacy prone to exposure and adds to the energy and communication costs. Also, the central server can be subject to malevolent attacks, resulting in non-efficient solutions. In this regard, for the first time, this paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for epileptic seizure detection (called Fed-ESD) from EEG signals in the fog-computing-based IoMT. A lightweight and efficient spatiotemporal transformer network is introduced to collaboratively learn spatial and temporal representations from the local data of each participant. The proposed Fed-ESD employs geographically situated fog nodes as local aggregators to enable sharing of location-based EEG signals for comparable IoMT applications. Moreover, a greedy method is introduced for deciding on the ideal fog node to be the coordinator node responsible for global aggregation during the training, thereby decreasing the reliance on the central server in the IoMT. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed Fed-ESD in terms of detection performance, resource-efficiency, stability, and scalability for deployment in the IoMT.},

The two thresholds for rumor propagation are obtained by mathematical analysis of the model. Based on the Jordan matrix theory and Routh-Hurwitz judgment, two rumor-free equilibriums (RFE) and four rumor-spread equilibriums (RSE) are obtained, and the stability of the equilibria is proved. The theoretical results and the influence of key parameters are verified by numerical simulation, and the validity of the model is verified through comparative experiments . Using the simulation data for function fitting, the results showed that the initial values of the media reports and the counter individuals are exponentially related to the peak of rumor propagation, respectively. Finally, based on two real rumor datasets of Twitter, the least square method is used to fit the model parameters. Through the comparison experiment with other similar works, the R-squared of the SICMR is 0.8811 and 0.9469 on two real datasets, respectively, which is the best result.},

Although methods based on global and local features have been combined, their performance is typically determined by feature fusion . This study proposes enhanced discriminative global-local feature learning with priority (EDGL-FLP), which focuses on feature extraction without auxiliary information and feature fusion based on priority. The proposed uniform mixing multiscale module traverses all subset combinations for global features to solve the insufficient information mixing problem in the existing multiscale module. A novel saliency and statistics-aware attention module is proposed for local features to extract the channel and spatial attention of saliency and statistics in two subbranches. It avoids information confusion caused by the early channel attention fusion in the convolutional block attention module. The global features are enhanced with core face area features and fused with half-face features for additional discriminative guidance because faces are symmetrical and their center is crucial. EDGL-FLP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FER benchmarks RAF-DB, SFEW, AffectNet, FED-RO, and MMI with accuracies of 89.63\%, 62.31\%, 61.09\%, 71.42\%, and 86.47\%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Micro-videos have gained popularity on various social media platforms because they provide a great medium for real-time storytelling. Although micro-videos can be naturally characterized by several modalities, for situations with uncertain missing modalities, a flexible multimodal representation learning framework that integrates complementary and consistent information has been difficult to develop. To better deal with the issue regarding incomplete modalities in multimodal micro-video classification, in this paper, we propose a self-supervised deep multimodal adversarial network (SDMAN) to learn comprehensive and robust micro-video representations. Specifically, we first consider a parallel multi-head attention (MHA) encoding module that simultaneously learns the representations of complete and incomplete modality groupings. We then present a multimodal self-supervised cycle generative adversarial network module, in which multiple generative adversarial networks are explored to transfer the information obtained from the complete modality grouping to the incomplete modality groupings. As a result, complementarity and consistency are mutually promoted among the modalities. Furthermore, experiments conducted on a large-scale micro-video dataset demonstrate that the SDMAN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Facial micro-expressions play a significant role in revealing concealed emotions. However, the recognition of micro-expressions is challenging due to their fleeting nature. Moreover, the visual features of the face and the visual relationships between the facial sub-regions have a strong influence on the presence of micro-expressions. In this work, a novel end-to-end facial micro-expression detection framework, called Deep3DCANN , is proposed to integrate these components for effective micro-expression detection. The first component of our framework is a deep 3D convolutional neural network that learns useful spatiotemporal features from a sequence of facial images. In the second component, a deep artificial neural network is utilized to trace the useful visual associations between different sub-regions of the face. Furthermore, a carefully crafted fusion mechanism is built to combine the learned facial features and the semantic relationships between the regions to predict the micro-expressions. We also construct a new loss function to jointly optimize both modules of our proposed architecture. Our proposed method performs favourably on five benchmark spontaneous micro-expression databases compared to existing micro-expression recognition baselines on videos. In addition, through an extended experiment, we show that our proposed approach can effectively recognize the frame-wise micro-expression changes in a sequence of video frames.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we deal with the problem of judging the credibility of movie reviews. The problem is challenging because even experts cannot clearly and efficiently judge the credibility of a movie review and the number of movie reviews is very large. To tackle this problem, we propose historical credibility that judges the credibility of reviews based on the historical ratings and textual reviews written by each reviewer. For this, we present three kinds of criteria that can clearly classify the reviews into trusted or distrusted ones. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed historical credibility through extensive analysis. Specifically, we show that characteristics between the trusted or distrusted reviews are quite distinguishable in terms of three viewpoints: 1) distribution, 2) statistics , and 3) correlation. Then, we present a multimodal-based classification model incorporating the historical credibility-based features with the textual review-based features in a weakly supervised manner to classify a given review as a trusted or distrusted one. Through experiments, we first show that our model is quite efficient because the entire data set is annotated according to the predefined criteria. Indeed, it can annotate 6,400 movie reviews only in 0.09 seconds, which occupies only 0.01\% of the total learning time of the proposed classification model . Second, we show that our multimodal-based classification model outperforms the existing textual review-based classification model by 5.99\%∼10.53\% in terms of the average accuracy. In addition, we clearly confirm that our classification model shows higher accuracy as more data accumulates.},

The existing methods for ensuring nonblocking control of modular supervisors either exploit favorable structures in the system model to guarantee the nonblocking property of modular supervisors or employ hierarchical model abstraction methods for reducing the computational complexity of designing a nonblocking coordinator. The nonblocking modular control problem is, in general, NP-hard. This study integrates supervisory control theory and a model-based deep reinforcement learning method to synthesize a nonblocking coordinator for the modular supervisors. The deep reinforcement learning method significantly reduces the computational complexity by avoiding the computation of synchronization of multiple modular supervisors and the plant models.

  abstract     = {One of the significant problems in data stream classification is the concept drift phenomenon, which consists of the change in probabilistic characteristics of the classification task . Such changes in posterior probability destabilize the classification model performance, seriously degrading its quality. It is necessary to design appropriate strategies to counteract this phenomenon, allowing the classifier to adapt to the changing probabilistic characteristics. It is tough to propose such an approach with limited access to data labels. A human bias of high quality is usually costly, so to minimize the expenses related to this process, it is also necessary to propose learning strategies based on semi-supervised learning. Such strategies employ active learning methods indicating which of the incoming objects are valuable to be labeled for improving the classifier&#39;s performance. This paper proposes Active Weighted Aging Ensemble algorithm, a novel chunk-based method for non-stationary data stream classification . It employs a classifier ensemble approach and utilizes the changing ensemble lineup to react to concept drift appropriately. It also proposed a new active learning method, considering a limited budget that may be applied to any data stream classifier. AWAE has been evaluated through computer experiments using real and synthetic data streams, confirming the proposed algorithm&#39;s high quality over state-of-the-art methods. The research conducted on benchmark data streams confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed solution and highlighted its strengths in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {The broad learning system (BLS) based on the random vector functional link neural network is a new versatile non-iterative neural network for rapidly selecting models. One of its fascinating features is the broad expansion, a dynamic adjustment strategy in the changing environment. However, the added enhancement nodes often suffer from information redundancy and loss, a failure in the broad expansion. Therefore, the factorization of enhancement nodes, which makes each code independent of others and achieves minimal redundancy and loss representation, is critical to successful broad expansion. Inspired by this idea, in this study, a factorial broad expansion (FBE) strategy is proposed to aid BLS (FBE-BLS) during broad expansion. The strategy is proposed as a component for reducing the information redundancy and loss in the classical BLS. This strategy is an adversarial framework to learn the factorial codes at the enhancement layer. The factorial and predictor networks adversarially learn factorial codes by chasing independence, minimizing predictability among enhancement nodes. In experiments, considering that few works focused on information redundancy and loss in the broad expansion of BLS, the FBE-BLS is compared with the classical BLS, and state-of-the-art methods are selected. The results of FBE-BLS on UCI and real-world image data are very promising, exhibiting higher accuracy during broad expansion.},

Recommender methods generally adopt only one type of behavior data for single-task learning. Multitask learning is commonly used to simultaneously address multiple tasks utilizing as much information as possible. We propose a knowledge distillation-enhanced shared-bottom model for recommender multitask learning. The postview click-through rate, postview conversion rate and average transaction value are learned together to determine the final gross merchandise volume. First, a mixture of experts with gate networks is used as a shared bottom to learn task-specific representations for all tasks, while a tree distillation framework is designed as an expert for better feature selection. Then, we design a neural factorization machine as a task-specific prediction network to estimate individual goals. Finally, an objective function is designed based on task outputs to optimize the gross merchandise volume. Our proposed framework can enhance recommender preferences while avoiding generating a large number of parameters. This model serves the e-commerce scenario, with the following specific use scenario: building personalized GMV predictions for small scenarios on e-commerce platforms at low cost, which is a 0 to 1 process that is often highly rewarding. Ultimately, we propose to improve the reliability of e-commerce scenarios.},

However, it heavily relies on features used for clustering and localization, e.g. , features implying potential background information would degrade the localization performance . To address this problem, we propose a novel Action-positive Separation Learning (APSL) method. APSL follows a novel “feature separation + clustering + localization” iterative procedure. First, we introduce a novel feature separation learning (FSL) module. FSL employs separation learning to identify action and background features in a video, and then refines and removes potential action-negative and background-negative features ( hard-to-locate ) from the identified features employing contrastive learning , thus obtaining action-positive features ( easy-to-locate ). Next, in “clustering” step, we apply clustering to the separated action-positive features to obtain action pseudo-labels. In “localization” step, with action pseudo-labels and action-positive features, we employ a temporal action localization module to locate action instance regions, in turn, improving the performance of clustering and FSL. The three steps learn iteratively and reinforce each other during training. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the THUMOS&#39;14 and ActivityNet v1.2 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms cutting-edge weakly supervised and unsupervised methods , obtaining state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Recently, hyperbolic embedding has successfully demonstrated its superiority over Euclidean analogues in representing hierarchical data . As the scale-free network that usually exhibits rich hierarchical structures, knowledge graphs naturally become a field where hyperbolic embedding shows its talents. Furthermore, hyperbolic embedding is also an expected solution to comprehensively reproduce the semantic features and underlying structures of KGs in the embedding space, which will significantly optimize the interpretability and performance of embedding models. However, most of the several existing hyperbolic studies only individually learn semantic information indicated by triples individually, making the embedding space relatively one-sided and simplified. In addition, many issues that limit reasoning performance are still ignored and unresolved in the context of hyperbolic geometry , like the response to complex relations and relation patterns. Motivated by these concerns, we propose the hyperbolic embedding model for KG reasoning, HyGGE. It is based on an innovative hyperbolic graph attention network . Furthermore, the response to complex relations, which is a well-known problem that constrains reasoning performance is also discussed in HyGGE. On the one hand, the focus on neighborhood structures and relation features makes up for the singularity that the embedding space is completely induced by triples individually, thereby optimizing the expressiveness of the embedding space. On the other hand, they cooperate with the effect of hyperbolic geometry to capture hierarchical features contained in local structures, and thus giving the hyperbolic embedding a fuller play to its advantages. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness and advantages of HyGGE.},

Based on the variational Bayesian (VB) method and the cubature information filter (CIF), two adaptive filters , namely centralized adaptive CIF (CA-CIF) and distributed adaptive CIF (DA-CIF), are proposed respectively. First, a series of Bernoulli random variables are introduced as the indicators of measurement loss, and the loss probabilities are modeled as Beta distributions . By transforming all distributions into exponential family form, the CA-CIF can approximate the posterior distributions of the state, loss indicators and loss probabilities by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. To reduce the computational cost and improve the reliability, the DA-CIF is further derived by utilizing the average consensus algorithm. Compared with the existing results which rely on the knowledge of the loss indicators or the loss probabilities, the proposed two filters require no information about the measurement loss, and are thus more applicable for practical scenarios. Finally, two examples of target tracking and permanent magnet synchronous motor are included to validate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed two filters.},

Differential privacy is a promising solution to the above problem due to its small computational overhead. At present, differential privacy-based federated learning generally focuses on the trade-off between privacy and model convergence. Even though differential privacy obscures sensitive information by adding a controlled amount of noise to the confidential data, it opens a new door for model poisoning attacks: attackers can use noise to escape anomaly detection . In this paper, we propose a novel model poisoning attack called Model Shuffle Attack (MSA), which designs a unique way to shuffle and scale the model parameters. If we treat the model as a black box, it behaves like a benign model on test set. Unlike other model poisoning attacks, the malicious model after MSA has high accuracy on test set while reducing the global model convergence speed and even causing the model to diverge. Extensive experiments show that under FedAvg and robust aggregation rules, MSA is able to significantly degrade performance of the global model while guaranteeing stealthiness.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic online learning has been given great concerns as real-time and non-stationary systems develop and it can be used for solving many practical sequential decision problems like dynamic recommendation systems for online advertisement. Due to the large volume of big data in online learning, dynamic online learning is required to be deployed under the distributed framework where the communication among agents is time-varying and real-time. Meanwhile, since the information sharing among agents is vulnerable to interception by the adversary, the privacy protection problem is significant, but to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to consider privacy-preserving distributed online learning under dynamic circumstances. Specifically, based on a differentially private distributed online gradient descent algorithm, we minimize the regret of the network. Moreover, via the rigorous mathematical analysis, we achieve the sublinear regret bound under ϵ -differential privacy, that is, we respectively obtain O ( T + V T ) O(T+VT) and O ( log ⁡ T + V T ) O(log⁡T+VT) for convex and strongly convex function , where T is the time horizon and the path-length V T VT reflects the variation of the minimizer sequence. The experiments performed on the real datasets validate that the presented algorithm achieves acceptable optimization performance even when privacy protection is relatively strict.},

  abstract     = {Extracting various types of event relations in financial texts can benefit many downstream applications supporting financial analysis. This paper addresses the multi-type event relation extraction problem in the finance domain focusing on handling several issues in existing studies, including (1) limited event relation types involved, (2) insufficient feasibility when handling non-annotated data, (3) ineffectiveness in recognizing multi-type event relation, and (4) the asynchronous event and event relation extraction process. To tackle these limitations, we carefully define six types of event relations based on the characteristics of financial texts (e.g., abundant numerical words) and further devise an integral framework for Chinese financial event relation extraction. The framework is capable of handling unsupervised event extraction and event relation recognition jointly. Specifically, according to linguistic characteristics, a Core Verb Chain is employed for the event identification. Then, by constructing a Syntactic Semantic Dependency Parsing graph, scattered events are combined into pairs, and event ellipsis elements can be completed to prevent event information loss. Also, to capture more sentence semantics, we formulate an Event Restore module that converts the structured event pairs into event restore sentence pairs and pour the pairs into the BERT model for relation type identification. Finally, to enhance the embeddings for event core elements, an Event Core Embeddings layer is augmented in BERT , and we fine-tune the model on our annotated financial corpus. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method, and the results confirm its superiority over the state-of-the-art baselines.},

However, their performance is poor when dealing with noisy images and images involving complex variations such as large pose variations and occlusions. In this paper, a novel noise-related face image recognition method based on double dictionary transform learning (DDTL) is proposed. On the one hand, DDTL introduces the L 2 , p L2,p -norm to remove the redundant information in the dictionary and the noise involved in the training images, which makes the learned dictionary more discriminative. On the other hand, DDTL introduces the analysis dictionary and performs double dictionary transform learning with the synthetic dictionary. This can better reveal the relationship between the samples and the representation coefficients, and improve the accuracy of the learned dictionary and representation coefficients. Besides, DDTL introduces a linear regression term in the model learning process, which can distinguish and expand the differences between classes. Experimental results on six databases show that DDTL is superior to existing methods.},

To address them, the article proposed a neighborhood evolutionary sampling framework with dynamic repulsion, termed DR-NESO, which consists of two main parts. On one hand, DR-NESO uses neighborhood evolutionary sampling strategies to generate candidate solutions for real fitness evaluation, balance exploration and exploitation, and accelerate population rapidly converge to multiple global optima. On the other hand, when potential global optimal solutions are identified and archived during optimization, DR-NESO dynamically sets taboo areas based on them. Individuals located in taboo areas are moved to other promising areas by a surrogate-assisted elite restart strategy. Based on this framework, expensive multimodal optimization problems can be solved well in a limited real fitness evaluation budget. We compared the approach with state-of-the-art expensive multimodal and multimodal algorithms on the CEC2013 benchmark. The result shows DR-NESO has the best performance.},

We find that the geometrical and dynamical properties of synchronous orbits are in excellent agreement with that of the learned dynamical system. Remarkably, through this synchronization scheme, we successfully recover an almost identical bifurcation behavior of an observed system via merely its chaotic dynamics.

In addition, a series of Bernoulli random variables is employed to model the phenomenon of MMs and an AF relay is deployed in the sensor-to-estimator network channels with the purpose of achieving the task of remote data transmission. A recursive state estimator is constructed such that, for all quantized coupled signal, MMs and AF relay, a state estimation error covariance (SEEC) upper bound (SEECUB) is presented and then the estimator gain (EG) is parameterized by optimizing the trace of SEECUB. Subsequently, a rigorous theoretical analysis is given to establish the monotonicity relationship between the trace of the minimized SEECUB and the probabilities of MMs. Finally, a simulation study is carried out for the proposed RSE approach to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of such state estimation strategy.},

  abstract     = {N4-methylcytosine (4mC), as a DNA modification, plays a crucial role in epigenetic regulation . However, the existing experimentation methods for accurately identifying 4mC sites are inefficient and highly consumable, making them difficult to implement. Although a variety of new identification methods are continuously being proposed, existing techniques are not yet fully mature. Compared to traditional 4mC site predictors, based on support vector machine or convolutional neural network , we present an alternative computational approach. In this study, we propose a method based on a kernelized higher-order fuzzy inference system (KHFIS) and deep multiple kernel learning , called DMKL-HFIS, to improve the accuracy of 4mC site identification DNA sequences. We use PSTNP to process the benchmark datasets, and then apply KHFIS to obtain multiple fuzzy kernel matrices. A deep neural network is used to fuse multiple fuzzy kernel matrices. Finally, the predicted value is derived from the fused matrix. Our approach was compared with existing mainstream computational methods. On the benchmark datasets (G. subterraneus, D. melanogaster, E. coli, A. thaliana, and C. elegans), the accuracy of our approach exceeded that of a state-of-the-art method by 0.4\%, 0.44\%, 1.51\%, 0.55\%, and 0.25\%, respectively. Compared to mainstream methods, our approach exhibits a higher level of accuracy and can therefore be considered an effective prediction tool.},

The patterns are represented by information granules and a granular rule base with the purpose of developing explainable human-centered computational models of virtual and physical systems. Fundamentally, interval data are either included into wider and more meaningful information granules recursively, or used for structural adaptation of the rule base. An Uncertainty-Weighted Recursive-Least-Squares (UW-RLS) method is proposed to update affine local functions associated with the rules. Online recursive procedures that build interval-based models from scratch and guarantee balanced information granularity are described. The procedures assure stable and understandable rule-based modeling. In general, the model can play the role of a predictor, a controller, or a classifier, with online sample-per-sample structural adaptation and parameter estimation done concurrently. The IIL method is aligned with issues and needs of the Internet of Things , Big Data processing , and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence . An application example concerning real-time land-vehicle localization and tracking in an uncertain environment illustrates the usefulness of the method.

In DTDM, four technician scheduling modes are devised to flexibly disassemble the overtime work or reassigned it to other maintenance technicians according to work efficiency and progress, which could shorten the maintenance time and save the total cost. Moreover, a flexible time interval is designed to adjust the boundary of task disassembly. To further study the effectiveness of DTDM in reducing maintenance time and total costs, this paper divides both the AMTS and AMTS-DTDM models into three sub-models (i.e., two single-objective models and one multi-objective model), respectively. After that, we design solution methods as well as the encoding schemes compatible with both the AMTS model and the AMTS-DTDM model for different problem scales. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of DTDM, four groups of experiments are set up and particle swarm optimization (PSO) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) are applied to compare AMTS and AMTS-DTDM sub-models. The experimental results show that the AMTS-DTDM model can effectively shorten the maintenance time and reduce the total costs for different scaled problems. Furthermore, the flexible time interval can facilitate more options for airlines to adjust the two above objectives to a small extent. The increase in flexible time may weaken the advantages of the AMTS-DTDM model while improving the rationality of the ultimate technician scheduling scheme.},

In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic contrastive learning framework, called Relationship-aware Contrastive Learning (ReACL), to make recommendations to users. ReACL framework utilizes the relationship homophily among data to achieve a uniform distribution for node and align the relevant features to preserve personalized features and avoids the problem of popularity bias. We first combine a graph of user-item interaction with that of a social network to mine views on the relationships of users on social networks as well as those of item commonality. We then apply these two views to construct contrastive learning pairs on the user and item sides, respectively. We design two sample selectors and an augmented contrastive loss function to preserve personalized features. Furthermore, we jointly optimize the tasks of supervised learning and contrastive learning. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets, and the results show that the proposed ReACL framework outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The different means and standard deviations of the embedded type-1 fuzzy sets associated with a word are recognized as the origins of its inter-uncertainty, and the relations between them are taken into account in the construction of interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Importantly, the retained region approach is a versatile approach that does not impose redundant constraints on the selection of embedded type-1 fuzzy sets, and the capacity of the retained region can be flexibly adjusted along the two dimensions of the mean and the standard deviation.

We develop a graph-based heuristic algorithm for feature selection, named the graph-based description vector (GDV) algorithm, which is designed for fast search and has lower time and space complexities than four existing representative algorithms. Numerical experiments have shown that, compared with these four algorithms, the average running time of the GDV algorithm is reduced by a factor of 36.81 to 271.54, while the classification accuracy is maintained at the same level.},

  abstract     = {The security of the Internet of Things (IoT) is an integral research topic to support its applicability. With the rapid development of IoT technology, security threats have become increasingly serious. Attackers turn their attention to large IoT devices with many security vulnerabilities, and many infected IoT devices are used to form botnets to launch intrusions. Furthermore, IoT communication networks poses security risks. Therefore, it is necessary to design a model for the IoT intrusion detection . However, the current models are trained using big data samples. Moreover, IoT devices can only intercept a few-shot samples in special scenarios, resulting in lower efficiency and accuracy. In this study, we propose an adversarial domain adaptation (ADDA) approach with dual domain pairing strategy for IoT intrusion detection under few-shot samples. First, we design two data augmentation algorithms to construct a sample transfer model that conforms to the joint dual domain distribution. We then combine the dual domain pairing strategy and ADDA model to perform supervised domain adaptation. In addition, a lightweight network is designed to extract features. Finally, a new loss function and domain discriminator model are constructed to achieve IoT intrusion detection under few-shot samples. Different results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

Topic clustering methods could alleviate this issue. However, existing research employed words as topic representation units and could not express topic semantic relevance . In this paper, we propose a novel Topic Clustering framework based on the Graph Neural Network (called TCGNN) to alleviate topic diversity in Community Question Answering. Firstly, we separately consider the relationship representation of existing topics and unlabeled topics. For manually labeled topics, we count the frequency of topics in community questions and construct a topic co-occurrence matrix to represent the topic relation. For unmarked topics, we extract the core phrases from community questions and employ them to indicate the topics of questions. Then, we transform the topic co-occurrence matrix into a topic relation graph , optimizing the topic relevance and improving presentation efficiency. Next, we employ a graph neural network for embedding the topic connection graph and get the vector representation of each topic. Finally, an improved K-mean method is proposed for topic clustering based on the distance of topic vectors. Additionally, we briefly discuss the extended effect of topic clustering methods in other domains (bibliographic information and reviews). In the literature we have, it is a primary work that conders topic clustering in multiple situations and offers innovative cogitation to apply graph neural networks in topic clustering. Our experiment compared prevalent clustering methods and some combination methods of text representation and graph embedding . The outcome of experiments on four extensive and varied datasets (Stack Overflow, DBLP, Yelp, and Zhihu) illustrate that TCGNN leads the prevalent baseline in Entropy and Purity.},

  abstract     = {Tensor recovery and tensor compression, mainly relying on tensor decomposition (TD) techniques, find extensive applications in many visual applications. However, existing TD models neglect the inherent correlation within data modes, and there are problems with rank determination and latent factors arrangement. In this paper, we propose a data-adaptive TD model called adaptive tensor networks (ATN) decomposition, which constructs an optimal topological structure for TD according to the intrinsic properties of the data. Specifically, we leverage a generalized tensor rank to measure the correlation between two data modes, and then establish a multilinear connection among the corresponding latent factors with an adaptive rank. Moreover, ATN possesses the merits of permutation invariance, strong robustness, and less storage cost for representing high-order data. Beyond the above, we propose a unifying structured Schatten norm to bypass the poor local minima of TD-based applications and develop a scalable algorithm with a convergence guarantee that builds upon the linearized alternating direction method (LADM) framework. The effectiveness and superiority of ATN are verified sufficiently on four typical tasks: tensor completion, image denoising , neural network compression, and infrared small target detection. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that ATN outperforms state-of-the-art TD methods.},

Different from existing data-driven methods, PGRGAT combines prior knowledge with process data to improve the modeling performance and interpretability . Firstly, a physics-informed graph structure learning module is designed to explicitly model the dependencies among variables into a directed graph . This module learns the Bernoulli distribution on graph edges and generates a discrete graph using Gumbel-softmax sampling. Moreover, prior knowledge is introduced as graph regularization which constrains the graph to adhere to the underlying physics. Then, based on the learned graph structure, a novel gated recurrent graph attention unit network is proposed to simultaneously encode the inter-variable structural dependencies and intra-variable temporal dependencies for anomaly detection . By this means, the information of irrelevant variables can be discarded to improve the sensitivity to anomalies. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through two real-world industrial cases.},

  abstract     = {For the consumer lending industry, credit risk assessment is a crucial task for evaluating the default probability of loan applications given the potential loss caused by default. In particular, loan default prediction is a challenging classification problem due to the highly imbalanced class distribution and a model with both strong default identification ability and overall classification accuracy is exceedingly hard to achieve. Furthermore, most existing studies analyze loans with distinct credit ratings as a whole, ignoring the important relationship between class imbalance and specific credit rating categories. Meanwhile, considering loan companies&#39; different risk preferences when reviewing loan applications, this paper proposes a rating-specific multi-objective ensemble learning framework. Specifically, a credit rating-specific modeling strategy is used to construct candidate models for subpopulations of loans having similar default risk. A multi-objective ensemble learning method is developed using an effective imbalanced classification method, One-Class SVM , as the base learning algorithm. A multi-objective evolutionary process is employed for ensemble construction and an adaptive classification boundary adjustment process is proposed to improve the imbalanced classification performance. To validate the proposed methodology, we conduct comprehensive experimental studies and compare the proposed method with several benchmark algorithms on an industry provided data set. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantage of a rating-specific strategy and also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed multi-objective ensemble learning method.

First, a high-definition mask face is generated by the proposed Mask Generator model . Then, the mask face is put onto a protected face to obtain the masked face, in which the masked face is visually indistinguishable from the mask face. Finally, the mask face can be removed from the masked face and the recovered face can be obtained by authorized users, where the recovered face is visually indistinguishable from the protected face. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively protect the privacy of the protected face in subjective perception, the protection success rate is very high by the face recognition tool, and the proposed method can almost perfectly recover the protected face from the masked face.},

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel FCL framework, Federated Probability Memory Recall (FedPMR), to mitigate the probability bias problem and the imbalance in parameter variations. Firstly, for the probability bias problem, this paper designs the Probability Distribution Alignment (PDA) module, which consolidates the memory of old probability experience. Specifically, PDA maintains a replay buffer and uses the probability memory stored in the buffer to correct the offset probabilities of the previous tasks during the two-stage training. Secondly, to alleviate the imbalance in parameter variations, this paper designs the Parameter Consistency Constraint (PCC) module, which constrains the magnitude of neural weight changes for previous tasks. Concretely, PCC applies a set of adaptive weights to subsets of the regularization term that constrains parameter changes, forcing the current model to be sufficiently close to the past model in parameter space distance. Experiments with various levels of task similitude across clients demonstrate that our technique establishes the new state-of-the-art performance when compared to previous FCL approaches.},

Secondly, a settling-time regulator related to convergence time and tracking accuracy is constructed, then the prescribed time tracking problem boils down to the output error constraint problem. Furthermore, a new constraint transformation function is introduced to change the output error constraints to ensure the boundedness of the new error variables. Finally, combined with the velocity observer and backstepping technique, the position controller and hybrid position/internal force controller are designed respectively. The remarkable features include: (1) Both position control and internal force control are considered, which is helpful to realize the coordinated movement of the dual-arm system and the stable grasping of the object; (2) There is no requirement to measure the velocity of the object, which avoids the expensive velocity sensor and its interference; (3) Compared with the existing control methods , the convergence time and tracking accuracy in the position control can be preset manually.},

In practice, there are numerous domains for network data, but expensive semantical labels may only be available for some of them. This demands those embedding algorithms to be equipped with transferability, i.e., unsupervisedly adapting to other domains. However, the prevailing conventional discrete network embedding methods force on a single domain. This work bridges this gap by developing a transferable discrete network embedding method. We focus on solving two problems: knowledge transfer from a labeled domain to a new unlabeled domain and non-differentiable discretization in the discrete embedding. Specifically, for the former, we propose a hierarchical knowledge distillation strategy to mitigate the knowledge gap between the domains. At the same time, for the latter, we novelly treat the discretization as a classification problem instead of the conventional regression problem . Finally, we conduct a wide range of experiments to evaluate our method on a suite of tasks, including link prediction, node classification , and neighbor recommendation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our model performs better than the conventional discrete embedding methods over all the tasks.},

  abstract     = {The continuous advancement of visual object tracking (VOT) algorithms has made significant contributions to computer vision and video processing. Correlation filter (CF)-based trackers have achieved promising tracking performance in VOT, but still face some problems under scale changes, occlusion, and boundary effects. To deal with these constraints, the learning spatial variance-key surrounding-aware correlation filter (LSVKSCF) via multi-expert deep feature fusion is proposed in this work. Initially, we extract the surrounding samples from the input based on the target size and shape, which integrates the context information and maintains the integrity of the target. Then, we introduce selective spatial information to the filter for penalizing the background and preserving the valid information of the target. Additionally, the spatial variance information is utilized to find the second-order difference of the filter which avoids over-fitting problems. Furthermore, we introduce the keyframes by periodically selecting the surrounding patches which handle the background distractions and improve the tracking speed. Finally, a multi-expert strategy is used in the filter learning stage which shows the reliability of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on OTB2013, OTB2015, TempleColor128, UAV123, UAVDT and DTB70 datasets prove that our method performs well against several existing trackers.},

  abstract     = {The hash function is an efficient source of the integrity and authentication of input text and other data messages (image &amp; audio-video) in the cryptography field. Existing hashing algorithms are time-consuming and vulnerable to collision attacks, birthday attacks, meet-in-the-middle attacks, and key search attacks. In this context, we propose an innovative and secure hash algorithm that uses self-learning neurons during the implementation phase. Firstly, the proposed deep learning hashing algorithm accepts the variable length (ln) of the input text and image messages (im) at the input layer 0 and divides the whole input (M) into four characters, represented as message pair (MP) . If the last MP contains less than four characters, have been completed by the assumption of the special cases and processed via the OR logical operation. Subsequently, the proposed pattern matching-swapping methods have resolved the conflict of the repeated characters in each MP . Secondly, the proposed novel dynamic secret keys are generated for each MP by introducing a skip and select basic conditions by omitting the consecutive 0&#39;s or 1&#39;s in key selection. Thirdly, upon successfully processing the phases above, the proposed novel hashing algorithm generates collision-free hash values using forwarding and backward propagation. Experimental results show that our proposed hashing algorithm is efficient and significantly outperforms in terms of sensitivity generated in hash output, speed, and collision resistance compared to the existing state-of-the-art hashing algorithms .},

Recently, various extensions to factorization of ordinal data , or data with graded (fuzzy) attributes, have been proposed. We identify and describe a fundamental problem regarding quality of factors, which is non-existent in the Boolean case, but naturally appears in the more general setting of ordinal data . As we demonstrate, the problem gets more significant with growing size of the factorized data. We analyze the problem, propose a method to alleviate it, and evaluate experimentally our solution to the problem.

  abstract     = {Multiple modes are ubiquitous in current industrial processes, and the amount of historical data contained in different modes may vary considerably. Insufficient data can easily lead to cold start problems when building a fault detection model for a particular mode. To solve this problem, while considering the similarity and differences between multiple modes, a deep model using domain adaptation based on feature separation is proposed for nonlinear process monitoring with few samples. The model extracts common features from modes and the data deficiency is compensated by transferring the domain knowledge from the source to the common features. On the other hand, to avoid missing useful information by focusing only on common features, the model also extracts the specific features of the target domain. Thus, monitoring performance is improved with the help of domain adaptation while taking into account the specific characteristics of the target domain. Furthermore, three detection indices are designed to monitor the common feature subspace, the specific feature subspace, and the residual subspace, respectively. The benefit of this is allowing more diagnostic information to be obtained when a fault occurs. The proposed method was tested with a numerical example and a real industrial hydrocracking process to verify the detection effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Smart Health Care offers efficient, sustainable, along with real-time human services, and the concept of enhanced Internet of Things (IoT) lies behind the emergence of this smart Health Care (HC). Nevertheless, the association of these IoT-centric sensors with other organizations generates security threats that an illegal user might utilize it owing to the data’s openness. In the HC sector, data security and privacy are the prime concern in which the alteration in data values as sensors could modify the diagnosis process, which may cause serious health problems. The immutability and transparency of the blockchain make it a viable option for the safe storage and management of healthcare data. However, the Cloud Storage Server (CSS), consensus latency, majority attacks, Byzantine problem, uncomfortable data Throughput (TP), et cetera, make the blockchain vulnerable to healthcare data transmission. To solve the current disadvantages, a secure IoT was introduced in healthcare using Brooks Iyengar Quantum Byzantine Agreement-centered Blockchain Networking (BIQBA-BCN). This study ensures the sincerity and equity of health data exchange. Based on Blum Blum Shub and Okamoto Uchiyana Cryptosystem (OUCS) mutual authentica1tion, the proposed work provides an OUCS-based mutual authentication system (BBS-OUC). Attackers are prevented from entering the BCN, ensuring the storage remains trustworthy. In addition, the Key Weight Block Function-Quasi-Cyclic Moderate Density Parity Check (KWBF-QCMDPC) algorithm safeguards the confidentiality and dependability of IoT user data. The cryptosystem technique protects sensitive data when the blockchain platform is distributed. The proposed methodology, known as BIQBA-BCN, results in a security level that is\%94 effective. Finally, the BIQBA-BC consensus mechanism is used to distribute data to the corresponding Hospital Server (HS). By achieving a higher data TP, lower delay, higher Success Rate (SR), shorter consensus latency, and node communication time, the experimental results show that the proposed methodology is exceptionally safe against assaults and highly scalable.},

Some defense methods may trade off the algorithm complexity for robustness, such as adversarial training, whereas others may trade off clean example performance, such as smoothing-based defense. Most suffer from high complexity or low transferability. To address this problem, we proposed EGC 2 , an enhanced graph classification model with easy graph compression. EGC 2 captures the relationship between the features of different nodes by constructing feature graphs and improving the aggregation of the node-level representations. To achieve lower-complexity defense applied to graph classification models, EGC 2 utilizes a centrality-based edge-importance index to compress the graphs, filtering out trivial structures and adversarial perturbations in the input graphs, thus improving the model&#39;s robustness. Experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed feature read-out and graph compression mechanisms enhance the robustness of multiple basic models, resulting in a state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and robustness against various adversarial attacks .},

Existing knowledge extraction systems often use a supervised approach that relies on annotated data, inducing implicitly a fastidious annotation process. Current research is towards the definition of unsupervised or semi-supervised systems, allowing a wider range of knowledge extraction. The evaluation of such systems, performing knowledge extraction using natural language processing methods requires performance indicators. The indicators usually used in such evaluations have limitations in the specific context of knowledge extraction for unsupervised ontology population. Thus, the definition of new evaluation methods becomes a need arising from the singularity of the harvested data, especially when these are not annotated. Hence, this article proposes a method for measuring performance in unsupervised context where reference data and extracted data do not overlap optimally. The proposed evaluation method is based on the exploitation of data that serve as a reference but are not specifically linked to the data used for extraction, which makes it an original evaluation method. To apply the performance measure on concrete cases, this paper also presents an unsupervised self-feeding rule-based approach for domain-independent ontology population from textual data.},

The lack of negative samples poses a challenge for using machine learning to perform such tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based model to screen reliable negative samples from unlabeled samples , named SURE. The model has two modules: a sample selector and a sample inspector. The sample selector screens reliable negative samples from unlabeled samples by two reinforcement strategies (learn to identify positive samples and reduce sample noise) and feeds the screened samples into the sample inspector. The sample inspector classifier provides rewards to the sample selector. The two modules are trained together to optimize the sample selector and sample inspector strategies. In this paper, we focus on one popular issue in the bioinformatics field: the ncRNA-protein interaction (NPI) prediction task, which lacks reliable negative samples. Thirty datasets for NPI prediction are used to test the screening effect of SURE. The experimental results show that our model has a robust negative sample screening capability and is superior to all outstanding sample screening methods used in the NPI prediction task. In addition, we refine 5 NPI datasets containing reliable negative samples screened by SURE, and a web server ( ww.csbg-jlu.info/sure ) is available offering the NPI prediction refined by SURE.},

In order to alleviate the interference of network transmission , a fuzzy observer following the asynchronous premise variables as the system is constructed, and we design an observer-based switched fuzzy controller through a non-PDC scheme. And an event-triggered scheme (ETS) is designed to save the limited network bandwidth . Then, based on switching strategy and quantifying the DoS attacks signal indexes, the networked TSFSs can be converted into a new switched augmented system . Moreover, in virtue of piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) method, we propose sufficient conditions to guarantee that the networked TSFS is exponential stability (ES) with a desired H ∞ H∞ performance. Further, a collaborative design project is presented to obtain triggering parameters, observer gains, and controller gains , and we derive the quantitative relationship between sampling period, triggering parameters, system parameters, actuator fault matrix, and DoS attacks signal indexes. At last, two practical examples are employed to certify the effectiveness and superiority of the presented techniques.},

  abstract     = {Inconsistency in classification and regression problems occurs when instances that relate in a certain way on the condition attributes, do not follow the same relation on the decision attribute . It typically appears as a result of perturbation in data caused by incomplete knowledge (missing attributes) or by random effects that occur during data generation (instability in the assessment of decision attribute values). Inconsistencies with respect to a crisp preorder relation (expressing either dominance or indiscernibility between instances) can be handled with set-theoretic approaches like rough sets and by using statistical/machine learning approaches that involve optimization methods. In particular, the Kotłowski-Słowiński (KS) approach relabels the objects from a dataset such that inconsistencies are removed, and such that the new class labels are as close as possible to the original ones in terms of a given loss function. In this paper, we generalize the KS approach to handle inconsistency determined by a fuzzy preorder relation rather than a crisp one. The method produces a consistent fuzzy relabeling of the instances and may be used as a preprocessing tool with algorithms for binary classification and regression. As the obtained fuzzy sets can be represented as unions of meaningful simple fuzzy sets or granules, we call them granular approximations . We provide statistical foundations for our method, develop appropriate optimization procedures , provide didactic examples, and prove several important properties.},

The comparable property (CP for short), i.e., the lower approximation is included in the upper approximation , is fundamental in Pawlak rough sets since many theories and applications rely on this property. However, the CP is lost in many existing variable precision (fuzzy) rough sets. Therefore, a novel variable precision fuzzy rough set model with CP is proposed and an associated three-way decision model is developed. Firstly, a pair of variable precision fuzzy upper and lower approximation operators are defined and studied through fuzzy implication and co-implication operators. We show that this pair of approximation operators satisfy various properties (including CP) that the existing variable precision fuzzy approximation operators do not possess. Secondly, new methods for constructing loss functions and conditional probabilities are given by using CP, and then a new three-way decision model with three strategies (optimistic, pessimistic, and compromise strategies) is established. Finally, an explanatory example is provided to examine validity, stability and sensitivity of the proposed three-way decision model.},

We prove that this problem is NP-hard. We also prove that the computation of objective is #P-hard and then propose an efficient method to estimate the objective. We show that κ -GJIM is a non-submodular optimization problem , and then design two algorithms to solve it.

  abstract     = {Imbalanced data distribution is the main reason for the performance degradation of most supervised classification algorithms . When dealing with imbalanced learning problems, the prediction of traditional classifiers tends to favor the majority class and ignore the minority class which is often much more important. Therefore, it is necessary to balance majority data and minority data before classification. A popular strategy for balancing the two data classes is synthesizing minority data. In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have shown great potential in fitting sample distributions. Based on this, this paper proposes a model combining improved GAN and transfer learning , RVGAN-TL, to solve the imbalanced learning problem of tabular data. As for the improvement of GAN, variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to generate latent variables with a posterior distribution as the input of GAN, and similarity measure loss is introduced into the generator to improve the quality of the minority data generated by GAN. In addition, a roulette wheel selection method is applied to the training data selection in GAN to rebalance data in the overlapping area. When data is balanced, the generated data is used as the source domain and the original data as the target domain, and the transfer learning method is used to train the final classifier. Experiments on 20 real datasets show that the classification performance of the proposed method is significantly improved compared with other popular methods.},

  abstract     = {Most knowledge graph completion methods focus on predicting existing relationships in the knowledge graph but cannot predict unseen relationships. To solve this problem, knowledge graph zero-shot relational learning (KGZSL) has gotten more and more attention in recent years. The common method of KGZSL is to leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to build the connection between existing relation descriptions and knowledge graph domains. However, the traditional KGZSL method ignores the gap between relation text description and relation structured representation. To bridge this gap, we propose a Structure-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (SEGAN). SEGAN adopts a structure encoder to introduce knowledge graph structure information into the generator and guide the generator to generate knowledge graph embeddings more accurately. In addition, in the KGZSL task, the representations of entities are closely tied to the existing relationships, which has a negative impact on the prediction of new instances. Therefore, we design a new plug-and-play feature encoder to decouple entities from existing relationships. Experimental results on the knowledge graph zero-shot relational learning dataset demonstrate that our method has better structure representation ability, and the model performance is improved by 36.3\% compared with the current optimal model .},

However, many existing graph-based methods are designed for low-order node interactions in homogeneous graphs, ignoring different types of atomic nodes or edges. In this paper, we propose to model a molecule as a heterogeneous graph and leverage metapaths to capture latent features for chemical functional groups. To preserve the chemical environments revealed by metapaths, we construct metapath-based connectivity and decompose the heterogeneous graph into subgraphs according to relation types. In addition, a hierarchical attention strategy is designed to aggregate heterogeneous information at the node level and relation level. Consequently, our approach is more natural and suitable for learning the complex interactions among atomic nodes and effective molecular fingerprints. We evaluate our model on public molecular datasets, and the experimental results exhibit the effectiveness of our model with competitive performance against the existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel algorithm twice optimization for interval type-2 fuzzy neural networks with asymmetric membership functions (TOIT2FNN-AMF), for nonlinear system identification problems. The proposed TOIT2FNN-AMF uses an asymmetric Gaussian interval type-2 membership function to enhance the network’s ability to describe and solve nonlinear and uncertain problems. The twice optimization algorithm consists of structure learning and parameter learning. Firstly, this paper proposes a multi-strategy adaptive differential evolution (MSADE) algorithm as the first optimization algorithm , which is used to determine the structure and the initial values of the parameters of the TOIT2FNN-AMF. It applies the root mean square error (RMSE) of the TOIT2FNN-AMF as the fitness function to determine the structure (number of rules) and initial parameters of the IT2FNN by searching for the RMSE values under different structures. When the fitness value reaches the minimum, that is, the RMSE value of the TOIT2FNN-AMF, the corresponding number will become the optimal one of fuzzy rules of the TOIT2FNN-AMF. Then, the second optimization algorithm of the TOIT2FNN-AMF turns into a hybrid optimization algorithm composed of an adaptive moment estimation (Adam) algorithm and recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. Adam is used to optimize the antecedent parameters of TOIT2FNN-AMF rules, so as to maintain rapid convergence without generating oscillation during the training process; RLS is used to optimize the consequent parameters of TOIT2FNN-AMF rules, so that the network parameters can be optimized rapidly. In this way, the problems of excessive parameters to be adjusted and excessive slow convergence of the network can be solved. Finally, this paper evaluates the proposed TOIT2FNN-AMF by testing on problems of nonlinear system identification and chaotic time-series prediction. The simulation results are compared with those of similar methods in the existing literatures, which demonstrates that the proposed TOIT2FNN-AMF model yields a lower RMSE value and a simpler network structure than the other type-2 fuzzy neural networks (T2FNNs).},

A sampled-based event-triggered control protocol is employed to save the communication resources of MASs. To achieve the goal of containment control under the DoS attack, a backup topology is employed to repair the communication channels that have been compromised by the DoS attacks. Then, a new adaptive controller is proposed to synchronize the MASs with a polluted communication network caused by unbounded AAs. This controller can eliminate the chattering phenomenon of the system and enable the containment error among the agents to reach a uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) convergence.

  abstract     = {Cluster ensemble (CE) integrates multiple clustering solutions to effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of unsupervised clustering. To reduce the impacts of low-quality solutions, existing CE methods often design heuristic criteria to appraise these clustering solutions and allocate weights for them. However, such heuristic-based weighting methods rely on human experience and lack knowledge of the relation between weights and data characteristics, failing to adaptively adjust weights for various datasets. To address this, we propose Meta -learning-based W eighted C luster E nsemble (MetaWCE), which learns the weights-data relation automatically and sets adaptive CE weights. Specifically, metadata is employed to describe data characteristics at a dataset level. To bridge metadata and weights, a meta-learning strategy is introduced to simulate the weighting process to ensure that relation between weights and metadata can be learned to directly optimize the ensemble performance in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on three datasets indicate that MetaWCE significantly improves ensemble performance and achieves obvious improvements over strong baseline methods .},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) is one of the most efficient evolutionary algorithms for solving numerical optimization problems ; however, it still suffers from premature convergence and stagnation. To address these problems, we propose a population state evaluation (PSE)-based improvement framework that can be freely embedded into various existing DE variants and population-based metaheuristic algorithms . The PSE framework comprises two population state evaluation mechanisms: one for tracking the optimization state of the population during evolution and the other for evaluating the distribution state of individuals in the population to identify the specific problem (premature convergence or stagnation) encountered by the corresponding algorithm. In addition, we design two intervention operations (dispersion and aggregation) to address premature convergence and stagnation. To verify the effectiveness of the PSE framework, we conduct comparison experiments using nine algorithms (including two basic DE algorithms , six state-of-the-art DE variants, and one non-DE algorithm) to optimize four real-world problems and 59 test functions from the IEEE CEC 2014 and IEEE CEC 2017 testbeds . The experimental results show that the PSE framework can significantly improve the optimization performance of the existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Next-location prediction is a special task of the next POIs recommendation. Different from general recommendation tasks, next-location prediction is highly context-dependent: (1) sequential dependency, i.e., the sequential locations checked in by a user have high correlation; (2) temporal dependency, i.e. check-in preferences are identified as different days or nights; (3) spatial dependency, i.e. users prefer to visit closer locations. Recent studies have been very successful in predicting users&#39; next location by comprehensively considering user preferences. Nonetheless, these methods not only fail to capture temporal dependencies but also fail to capture location topology information. To fill this gap, we propose a GNN-based model which converts POIs into a low-dimensional metric and integrates users&#39; long-term and short-term preferences to comprehensively represent dynamic preferences. The model consists of graph neural networks for long-term preference modeling and LSTM for short-term preference modeling. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets, and results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art methods for next-location prediction.},

This study proposes a fixed instance selection algorithm based on simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation that works in conjunction with any supervised machine learning method and any corresponding performance metric, which we call SpFixedIS. This algorithm provides an approximate solution to the NP-hard instance selection problem and additionally serves as a way of intelligently selecting a specified number of instances within a training set with regards to a machine learning model. The shape of the objective function obtained from the test accuracy against the number of instances selected is examined extensively for our instance selection algorithm. The SpFixedIS algorithm was tested on 43 diverse datasets across 6 different machine learning classifiers. The results show that in over 90\% of cases SpFixedIS provides a statistically significant improvement at a 5\% level with intelligent selection over random selection for the same number of instances. Furthermore, with respect to probabilistic models, specifically Gaussian Naive Bayes, SpFixedIS provides a statistically significant improvement compared to models that utilise the entirety of the training set in 84\% of the experimented values ranging from 50 to 1000 instances.},

  abstract     = {Human activity recognition (HAR) is an emerging field that identifies human actions in different settings. This activity is recognized by sensors placed in the room or residence where we wish to observe human action. Real-world applications and automation employ activity recognition to detect anomalous behavior. For example, the anomalous behavior of patients such as walking while advised to rest in bed and falling elderly people need to be monitored carefully in hospitals as well as in home-based monitoring systems. Security, healthcare, human interaction, and computer vision use it. The activity is monitored through sensors and cameras. There is no general, explicit approach for inferring human activities from sensor data. Sensor data and heuristics present technological challenges. Several elements must be evaluated to build a reliable activity recognition system. Factors such as storage, connectivity, processing, energy efficiency, and system adaptability are important. Deep learning systems can better recognize human activities from earlier datasets. In this study, the hybrid One Dimensional Convolution Neural Network with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) classifier is employed to improve the performance of HAR. It offers a method for automatically and data-adaptively removing reliable characteristics from raw data. This model proposes a two-way classification for abstract and individual activity monitoring. Human activities such as walking, sitting, walking downstairs, walking upstairs, laying, and standing along with mobile phone usage are considered in this study. We also compare state-of-the-art algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The UCI-HAR dataset is used for recognizing human activity in the proposed work. Features such as mean, median, and autoregressive coefficients are derived from the raw data and processed with principal component analysis to make them more reliable. The LSTM model accepts a series of activities, whereas the CNN accepts a single input. The CNN takes the single input data and each of the outputs is forwarded to the LSTM model, which classifies the activity. The Hybrid model achieves 97.89\% accuracy with the new feature selection methods, whereas the CNN and LSTM individually produce 92.77\% and 92.80\% accuracy.},

In this paper, we focus on three-way conflict analysis based on hybrid situation tables. First of all, we propose the conception of hybrid situation tables. By aggregating conflict distances for a single type of rating, we give the conception of hybrid conflict distances in a hybrid situation table. On this basis, we establish a three-way conflict analysis model w.r.t. multiple issues based on hybrid situation tables. Secondly, we define (maximal) strong alliances, (maximal) weak alliances, and maximal alliances, which can help to find a conflict resolution method in a hybrid situation table. In order to resolve conflict, we define feasible strategies in a hybrid situation table and use interval-valued decision-theoretic rough sets to approximate maximal strong alliances w.r.t. feasible strategies. Besides, we propose the conception of evaluation functions for finding an optimal strategy . Finally, we explore a governance problem of government to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed method.},

Nevertheless, such a center detection idea cannot work well on multi-peak clusters of complex shapes. Besides, DPC needs the distances between data, making it prohibitively time-consuming. To overcome these problems, a Main Density Peak Clustering algorithm (MDPC+)—clustering by fast detection of main density peaks within a peak digraph—is proposed, where a main density peak is the highest density peak in a cluster. MDPC+ can easily detect the real centers of multi-peak clusters based on its new center assumption. In MDPC+, the clustering problem is viewed as a graph cut problem and a specific graph structure is designed for non-peak and density peak allocation, respectively, so it can reasonably reconstruct clusters of complex shapes. Meanwhile, a satellite peak attenuation technique is embedded into MDPC+ to give it a high resistance to the interference of satellite peaks (i.e., non-center density peaks). Besides, MDPC+ only needs kNN distances of data as its input, so it is suitable for large datasets. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MDPC+ in center detection, complex shape reconstruction , and running speed.},

The multi-sensor measurements are quantized by a bank of logarithmic quantizers before entering into communication networks. The denial-of-service attack is, from the defenders&#39; perspective, regarded to be randomly occurring and such an occurrence is governed by a Bernoulli-distributed sequence of certain probability distribution. To suppress effects from measurement outliers onto innovations, tailored saturation functions are dedicatedly introduced to filter structures at both local and fusion stages, thereby keeping satisfactory fusion performance. By finding solutions to a set of matrix difference equations, upper bounds are initially acquired on estimator error covariances , and associated estimator parameters are subsequently secured via minimizing these acquired bounds. Two examples are finally presented to showcase the applicability of this outlier-resistant sequential fusion algorithm.},

As a result, the realistic is still suffering from new waves of COVID-19 by its new variants. How to control the transmission or even eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic remains a critical issue for the whole world. This work presents an epidemiological framework for mimicking the multi-directional mutation process of SARS-CoV-2 and the epidemic spread of COVID-19 under realistic scenarios considering multiple variants. The proposed framework is used to evaluate single and combined public health interventions, which include non-pharmaceutical interventions, pharmaceutical interventions, and vaccine interventions under the existence of multi-directional mutations of SARS-CoV-2. The results suggest that several combined intervention strategies give optimal results and are feasible, requiring only moderate levels of individual interventions. Furthermore, the results indicate that even if the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 decreased 100 times, the pandemic would still not be eradicated without appropriate public health interventions.},

In addition to protecting data privacy, it also avoids a single point of failure , and reduces the communication traffic congestion due to the central server. However, there are still many inherent privacy and security issues, e.g., training samples could be revealed by inferring gradients and malicious participants tend not to execute federated learning tasks as intended. Even worse, existing works rarely simultaneously consider a fundamental issue that data owners may join in and drop out of a DFL task at any time. In this paper, we propose PTDFL, a privacy-enhanced and trustworthy decentralized federated learning scheme. Specifically, we firstly design an efficient gradient encryption algorithm to protect data privacy, and then devise a succinct proof without trapdoors to ensure the correctness of the gradients. Meanwhile, we design a novel local aggregation strategy without trusted third party to ensure that the aggregated result is trustworthy. Moreover, our PTDFL is also supportive of data owners joining in and dropping out during the whole DFL task. Finally, we provide privacy and security analysis, implement a prototype of the PTDFL, and conduct extensive experiments on a real dataset. The results show that our PTDFL achieves more efficiency than prior works.},

In addition, this structural information is based on manually defined relations and is not potentially optimal for downstream tasks. In this paper, we utilize the knowledge from node features to enhance the expressive power of GCN models in a plug-and-play fashion. Specifically, we build a node-feature bipartite graph and exploit the bipartite graph convolutional network to model node-feature relations. By aligning results from the original graph structure and node-feature relations, we can make a more accurate prediction for each node in an end-to-end manner.

To reduce the negative effect of noise samples near category boundary, the noise reduction soft boundaries are defined based on the introducing of extension distance, intension distance and corresponding noise reduction process. Then the sample space is divided into in-class, mixed-class and out-of-class areas corresponding to each category. For online new coming samples, three strategies of automatic labeling by model, active labeling by expert and multi-class collaborative labeling will be adopted respectively according to different areas they located in. Automatic model labeling does not need to update the model, which may improve the learning efficiency. Expert active labeling will help with difficult samples in mixed-class area. Multi-class collaborative labeling can change the sample label dynamically during online learning. The experimental results show that the proposed method can reflect the character of dynamic evolution of streaming data well and detect the concept evolution effectively.},

  abstract     = {With the aid of advancing technologies, the healthcare sector is improving more swiftly than ever, yet there are still many unexplored areas and there is always potential for improvement. Deep Learning (DL), blockchain and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), three of the most revolutionary technologies, have aided replace conventional practice employed in the healthcare industry with more sophisticated and efficient procedures. In this research, we propose DON-B-STRESSED (DBS), an innovative framework which integrates DL, blockchain and IoMT technologies to provide a method for the early detection of stress in users donning IoMT devices. Long-term stress, indeed, is well-known to have profound consequences on human wellbeing; hence the need for automated solutions for continual stress monitoring. DON-B-STRESSED stands for DON a Blockchain-based, Secure, Timely, REliable System for StrEss Detection: the premise behind this is that if the above-mentioned technologies can be combined, a system that employs IoMT for users&#39; data collection, DL to properly predict patients&#39; stress levels, and smart contracts deployed on blockchain to ensure secure transactions and health checks, the well-known concerns of harmful effects of long-term stress might be avoided. By using multimodal data from both a chest- and a wrist-worn IoMT device, we have developed a tailored, secure, accurate yet fast real-time system for the early detection of stress signs. The DL part has been evaluated on WESAD, a publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection, reaching an accuracy of more than 99\% with LOSO generalization scheme. Furthermore, the scalability and reliability of DON-B-STRESSED are shown by comparison with the findings of past research.},

Existing work mainly focuses on intention recognition in a single-agent setting and uses a descriptive model, e.g. Bayesian networks, in the recognition process. In this article, we develop a new approach of identifying intentions for multiple agents through analysing their behaviours over time. We first define a prescriptive, behavioural model for a single agent that represents the agent’s behaviours where their intentions are hidden in the plan execution. We introduce landmarks into the behavioural model therefore enhancing informative features to identify common intentions for multiple agents. Subsequently, we refine the model by focusing only on action sequences in their plans and provide a light model for identifying and comparing their intentions. The new model provides a simple approach of grouping agents’ common intentions upon partial plans observed in agents’ interactions. After that, we transform the intention recognition into an un-supervised learning problem and adapt a clustering algorithm to group intentions of multiple agents through comparing their behavioural models. We conduct the clustering process through measuring similarity of probability distributions over potential landmarks in the behavioural models so as to discover agents’ common intentions. Finally, we examine the new intention recognition approaches in two problem domains. We demonstrate importance of recognising common intentions of multiple agents in achieving their goals and provide experimental results to show performance of the new approaches.},

Therefore, the dynamics of NS affects the dynamics of LS, and vice versa. In this paper, two vector differential equation (VDE)s are employed to describe the dynamics of NS and LS, respectively, in which the dynamics of NS is proposed as the VDE with the second derivative term (SDT) for more realistic engineering applications . Compared with the existing literature, the key advantage is that the dynamics of links is utilized to assist synthesizing the tracking controller of NS. The results show that when the state of LS tracks asymptotically the synthesized auxiliary tracking goal (ATG), the state of NS tracks asymptotically the given reference signal. Observing the eventual topology of CDN, all eventual links between nodes depend on the proposed ATG when NS achieving the tracking target, in which one special case is that if all target signals determined by ATG are not zero, all nodes are not isolated. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by a numerical simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is an effective neural architecture search algorithm based on gradient descent . However, there are two limitations in DARTS. First, a small proxy search space is exploited due to memory and computational resource constraints. Second, too many simple operations are preferred, which leads to the network deterioration. In this paper, we propose a uniform-space differentiable architecture search, named U-DARTS, to address the above problems. In one hand, the search space is redesigned to enable the search and evaluation of the architectures in the same space, and the new search space couples with a sampling and parameter sharing strategy to reduce resource overheads. This means that various cell structures are explored directly rather than cells with same structure are stacked to compose the network. In another hand, a regularization method, which takes the depth and the complexity of the operations into account, is proposed to prevent network deterioration. Our experiments show that U-DARTS is able to find excellent architectures. Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.59\% with 3.3M parameters on CIFAR-10.

One of the fastest and the most effective algorithms of anomaly detection is Isolation Forest. This solution is based on building isolation binary trees by randomly splitting the dataset elements. In this manuscript, we propose an innovative approach modifying this technique. In particular, we replace random divisions in the base mechanism with divisions based on Minimal Spanning Tree clustering. Additionally, we improve the evaluation process by introducing a two-component score function . The first component is related to the level of the test element in the isolation tree. The second term is calculated as the distance between specific points in the last split node. Namely, between the value of the evaluated attribute and the partition center stored in the node. In a series of comprehensive experiments, the proposed approach was compared with other Isolation Forest-based algorithms as well as state-of-the-art competing solutions. Our enhancement has proved its advantage in classification quality. In addition, the implementation operation times of selected solutions were measured. The results clearly demonstrate high effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks easily suffer from weak generalization caused by overfitting on biased data. One popular remedy to alleviate this issue is sample reweighting methods that adaptively adjust the importance of biased samples . Separate from the effort to reduce bias, recent works show that the generalization power can be improved by auxiliary tasks. Inspired by the two lines of works, we extend the sample reweighting methods to auxiliary tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel auxiliary learning framework that improves the primary task by adaptively adjusting the weights of samples from multiple tasks rather than samples from a single task using a weighting function. The weighting function is optimized by meta-learning along the gradient of the loss for meta-data, which is a small unbiased validation data. We also present a task-activation score that indicates the correlation between the learning tendency of the training samples and meta-data samples. This score is utilized as a regularizer for meta-learning objective. Our framework can obtain powerful representations for the primary task on biased data by automatically identifying effective combinations of tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms all baselines and state-of-the-art methods on both corrupted labels and class imbalance settings.},

Furthermore, to reduce communication burden and save coupling resources, a sampled-data-based event-triggered coupling mechanism is established. In this situation, the triggering condition is supervised only at discrete sampling instants. By employing Lyapunov theory and some inequality techniques, sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the synchronization against link attacks with multiple patterns.

The model consists of three sections: the first section defines the degree of stationarity of the demand time series, the second section develops a guided attention mechanism for improving the feature recognition of neural networks ; the third section generates forecasting results of tourism demand, in the meanwhile, the developed fully connected recurrent neural network is adopted to identify complex features of tourism demand time series. The proposed model is helpful in identifying the features of seasonality and non-linearity in tourism demand data, the model maintains good forecasting accuracy with the appropriate training process.

To address this problem, the distance between RPSs is first presented in this paper. Based on a geometrical interpretation of RPS, the distance between RPSs is measured by considering the similarity between their permutation sets, both in the number and order of elements. Numerical examples demonstrate the behavior of the proposed RPS distance. Thereafter, based on the proposed RPS distance, a Data-Driven Reliability Determination (DDRD) algorithm is put forth and applied in threat assessment. The experimental results show that the proposed DDRD algorithm can effectively identify the fusion order of RPSs.

The issue will be exacerbated in a speaker-independent setting, where the model will encounter samples from unseen speakers during the testing stage. To mitigate personal style&#39;s impact, we propose a framework named SIMR for learning speaker-independent multimodal representation. This framework separates the nonverbal inputs into style encoding and content representation with the aid of informative cross-modal correlations. Besides, in terms of integrating cross-modal complementary information, the classical transformer-based approaches are inherently inclined to discover compatible cross-modal interactions but ignore incompatible ones. In contrast, we suggest simultaneously locating both through an enhanced cross-modal transformer module.

Training a deep learning model for commercial use requires plenty of private data, expert knowledge, and computing resources. The huge commercial value of such trained models has attracted the attention of attackers. Attackers can construct a dataset by repeatedly querying the target model for the output of the requested samples and then train a substitute model on this dataset that functions similarly to the target model. In this paper, we propose a defense scheme based on physical unclonable function (PUF) against such black-box model extraction attacks. We deploy a PUF on the user side and the corresponding PUF model on the service provider side to ensure that only legitimate users can obtain the correct model predictions. Our experimental results show that by choosing a suitable fuzzy extractor threshold d , legitimate users can recover more than 99.5\% of the prediction results with a little additional computational overhead to the service provider. We perform a model extraction attack in the most favorable case for the attacker, and the prediction accuracy of the obtained substitute model is only about 10\%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. Compared to existing defenses, our scheme not only effectively prevents black-box model extraction attacks but also ensures that the accuracy of the prediction service for legitimate users is not affected.},

  abstract     = {To identify influential nodes in real networks, it is essential to note the importance of considering the local and global information in a network. In addition, it is also key to consider the dynamic information. Accordingly, the main aim of this paper is to present a new centrality measure based on return random walk and the effective distance gravity model ( C RRWG CRRWG ). This new metric increases the relevance of nodes with a dual role: i) at the local level, they are important in their community or cluster, and ii) at the global level, they give cohesion to the network. It has advantages over other traditional models of centrality since it considers the global and local information, as well as the information of the dynamic interaction between the nodes, as recent studies on community-aware centrality measures demonstrate. Thus, the combination of dynamic and static information makes it easier to detect influential nodes in complex networks. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed centrality measure , it is compared with classic measures, such as Degree, Closeness, Betweenness , PageRank, and other measures based on the gravity model, effective distance and community-aware approaches. The experimental results show the effectiveness of C RRWG CRRWG through a set of experiments on different types of networks.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven AI is rapidly gaining importance. In the context of AI planning, a constraint programming formulation for learning action models in a data-driven fashion is proposed. Data comprises plan observations, which are automatically transformed into a set of planning constraints which need to be satisfied. The formulation captures the essence of the action model and unifies functionalities that are individually supported by other learning approaches, such as costs, noise/uncertainty on actions, information on intermediate state observations and mutex reasoning. Reliability is a key concern in data-driven learning, but existing approaches usually learn action models that can be imprecise, where imprecision here is an error indicator of learning something incorrect. On the contrary, the proposed approach guarantees reliability in terms of perfect precision by using constraint propagation . This means that what is learned is 100\% correct (i.e., error-free), not only for the initial observations, but also for future observations. To our knowledge, this is a novelty in action model learning literature. Although perfect precision might potentially limit the amount of learned information, the exhaustive experiments over 20 planning domains show that such amount is comparable, and even better, to ARMS and FAMA , two state-of-the-art benchmarks in action model learning.},

  abstract     = {Image saliency detection , to which much effort has been devoted in recent years, has advanced significantly. In contrast, the community has paid little attention to video saliency detection . Especially, existing video saliency models are very likely to fail in videos with difficult scenarios such as fast motion, dynamic background, and nonrigid deformation. Furthermore, performing video saliency detection directly using image saliency models that ignore video temporal information is inappropriate. To alleviate this issue, this study proposes a novel end-to-end spatiotemporal integration network (STI-Net) for detecting salient objects in videos. Specifically, our method is made up of three key steps: feature aggregation, saliency prediction, and saliency fusion, which are used sequentially to generate spatiotemporal deep feature maps, coarse saliency predictions, and the final saliency map . The key advantage of our model lies in the comprehensive exploration of spatial and temporal information across the entire network, where the two features interact with each other in the feature aggregation step, are used to construct boundary cue in the saliency prediction step, and also serve as the original information in the saliency fusion step. As a result, the generated spatiotemporal deep feature maps can precisely and completely characterize the salient objects, and the coarse saliency predictions have well-defined boundaries, effectively improving the final saliency map&#39;s quality. Furthermore, “shortcut connections” are introduced into our model to make the proposed network easy to train and obtain accurate results when the network is deep. Extensive experimental results on two publicly available challenging video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art saliency models.},

  abstract     = {Many real-life problems can be formulated as numerical optimization problems . Such problems pose a challenge for researchers when designing efficient techniques that are capable of finding the desired solution without suffering from premature convergence. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm that blends the exploitative and explorative merits of two main evolutionary algorithms, namely the Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) and a Differential Evolution (DE) variant. This amalgam has an effective interaction and cooperation of an ensemble of diverse strategies to derive a single framework called Iterative Cyclic Tri-strategy with adaptive Differential Stochastic Fractal Evolutionary Algorithm (Ic3-aDSF-EA). The component algorithms cooperate and compete to enhance the quality of the generated solutions and complement each other. The iterative cycles in the proposed algorithm consist of three consecutive phases. The main idea behind the cyclic nature of Ic3-aDSF-EA is to gradually emphasize the work of the best-performing algorithm without ignoring the effects of the other inferior algorithm during the search process. The cooperation of component algorithms takes place at the end of each cycle for information sharing and the quality of solutions for the next cycle. The algorithm&#39;s performance is evaluated on 43 problems from three different benchmark suites. The paper also investigates the application to a set of real-life problems. The overall results show that the proposed Ic3-aDSF-EA has a propitious performance and a reliable scalability behavior compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Although a large number of PSO variants have been proposed so far, they suffer from the shortcomings of the original PSO. This paper proposes PSO with Elite Learning, enhanced Parameter updating, and exponential Mutation operator (PSO-ELPM) to balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of PSO. In this algorithm, the best-performing particles in the population, known as the elites, are used as exemplars to guide the optimization process. The elitism scheme helps to discover valuable knowledge about the solution space. The adopted elites are also used to compute self-cognition coefficients of particles. Additionally, the inverse of the cube root function is applied to ensure a smooth distribution of weight among the elites. The final improvement is to apply an exponential mutation operator , which determines the mutation probability per particle based on the current iteration and its history. The comparisons among PSO-ELPM and 10 state-of-the-art PSO variants on the CEC 2017 benchmark functions reveal that the proposed algorithm yields higher accuracy with acceptable time complexity. According to the Wilcoxon rank sum test, PSO-ELPM at-least outperforms the competitive algorithms on six and seven functions in 30 and 50-dimensional problems, respectively.},

Existing UDA methods designed the pseudo-labeling strategy using the label information from a single source (sample or center information), which ignored the joint effect of the center and sample information on improving the robustness of pseudo-labeling. To address this issue, we propose Pseudo-labeling Integrating Centers and Samples with Consistent Selection mechanism (PICSCS) for UDA. First, PICSCS assigns the label vector with (1 + K) pseudo labels to the target sample. Specifically, the 1 pseudo label represents the center information, which is determined by its nearest class center. The K pseudo labels symbolize adequate sample information, and they are determined by its K nearest source samples. Second, to use the label information from different sources in pseudo-labeling, PICSCS defines the consistent selection mechanism by judging whether (1 + K) pseudo labels in the label vector are the same. Then, label vectors can be identified as consistent or inconsistent, and only target samples with consistent label vectors are adopted in the iteration. Finally, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (ImageCLEF-DA, Office-31, Office-Caltech, and Office-Home) show that PICSCS makes the iteration stable, and PICSCS outperforms the state-of-the-art UDA methods.},

However, when the content similarity of two closely related nodes is small in the heterogeneous attributed network, we find that the embedding vectors obtained by combining network structure information and content information are bad. To tackle this problem, we propose a new robust representation learning model for Heterogeneous Attributed Networks Embedding with Dual-Space (HANE-DS), whose idea is to embed heterogeneous attributed network into dual spaces. Firstly, a heterogeneous attributed network is converted to a heterogeneous structure network and a heterogeneous content network. Secondly, the network nodes of the heterogeneous structure network are embedded into the structure space by using our proposed the structure embedding model, while the network nodes of the heterogeneous content network are embedded into the content space by applying our proposed the content embedding model. Finally, by utilizing the learning embedding vectors for downstream tasks, our approach can capture more comprehensive, more prosperous, and more reasonable information. Up to present, this is the first paper that focuses on the heterogeneous attributed network embedding based on Dual-Space. Three real-world networks and five synthetic networks to evaluate the HANE-DS model, and experimental results show that the HANE-DS can outperform baselines. For classification and clustering, the HANE-DS is superior to the baseline methods . For link prediction, the HANE-DS is in the top three of the baseline methods . For recommendation, the HANE-DS is also ahead of the baseline methods in terms of HR@K . On the synthetic networks, it is verified that the baseline models are sensitive to the content similarity of two closely related nodes. In comparison, our model is insensitive to that situation. In summary, the HANE-DS is a robust model for the heterogeneous attributed network embedding.},

However, most existing works trying to detect anomalies on attributed networks only considers a single kind of interaction, so they cannot deal with various kinds of interactions on multi-view attributed networks. It remains a challenging task to jointly consider all different kinds of interactions and detect anomalous instances on multi-view attributed networks. In this paper, we propose a graph convolution-based framework, named AnomMAN , to detect Anom aly on M ulti-view A ttributed N etworks. To jointly consider attributes and all kinds of interactions on multi-view attributed networks, we use the attention mechanism to define the importance of all views in networks. Since the low-pass characteristic of graph convolution operation filters out most high-frequency signals (abnormal signals), it cannot be directly applied to anomaly detection tasks. AnomMAN introduces the graph auto-encoder module to turn the disadvantage of low-pass features into an advantage. According to experiments on real-world datasets, AnomMAN outperforms the state-of-the-art models and two variants of our proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Given a system that does not work as expected, sequential diagnosis aims at suggesting a series of system measurements to isolate the true explanation for the system’s misbehavior from a potentially large set of possible explanations. To reason about the best next measurement, sequential diagnosis methods usually require a sample of possible fault explanations at each step of the iterative diagnostic process. The computation of this sample can be accomplished by various diagnostic search algorithms. Among those, Reiter’s HS-Tree is one of the most popular due to its desirable properties and general applicability. Usually, HS-Tree is used in a stateless fashion throughout the diagnosis process to (re)compute a sample of possible fault explanations per iteration, each time given the latest (updated) system knowledge including all so-far collected measurements. At this, the built search tree is discarded between two iterations, albeit often large parts of the tree have to be rebuilt in the next iteration, involving redundant operations and calls to costly reasoning services . As a remedy to this, we propose DynamicHS, a variant of HS-Tree that maintains state throughout the diagnostic session and embraces special strategies to minimize the number of expensive reasoner invocations. DynamicHS provides an answer to a longstanding question posed by Raymond Reiter in his seminal paper from 1987, where he wondered if there is a reasonable strategy to reuse an existing search tree to compute fault explanations after new system information is obtained. We conducted extensive evaluations on real-world diagnosis problems from the domain of knowledge-based systems—a field where the usage of HS-Tree is state-of-the-art—under various diagnosis scenarios in terms of the number of fault explanations computed and the heuristic for measurement selection used. The results prove the reasonability of the novel approach and testify its clear superiority to HS-Tree wrt. computation time. More specifically: (1) DynamicHS required less time than HS-Tree in 96\% of the executed sequential diagnosis sessions. (2) DynamicHS exhibited substantial and statistically significant time savings over HS-Tree in most scenarios, with median and maximal savings of 52\% and 75\%, respectively. (3) The relative amount of saved time appears to neither depend on the number of computed fault explanations nor on the used measurement selection heuristic. (4) In the hardest (most time-intensive) cases per diagnosis scenario, DynamicHS achieved even higher savings than on average, and could avoid median and maximal time overheads of over 175\% and 800\%, respectively, as opposed to a usage of HS-Tree. Remarkably, DynamicHS achieves these performance improvements while preserving all desirable properties as well as the general applicability of HS-Tree.},

  abstract     = {The evolution and development of social systems are always accompanied by social emergencies, which affect people’s ordinary lives and even life safety. This study attempts to solve the problem of social system modeling and emergency prediction. First, the complex social relations in the social system are abstracted through the hierarchical inference model on temporal networks. Then, based on the critical transition theory in the dynamical system , the temporal network sociomarkers (TNS) method is proposed to perceive the tipping point of social emergencies. Experiments on two social system datasets verify that the bifurcation phenomenon also exists in social systems. The TNS method captures early warning signals (EWSs) before social emergencies and the sensitive groups that may be responsible for them. To our best knowledge, this study constructs a bridge between critical transition theory and complex social systems, providing theoretical and methodological support in security management, crisis intervention, and even battlefield situations with broad application prospects and great promotion value.},

However, there is an issue that the global convergence is often absent for most of them. This paper proposes a partition-based convergence framework for population-based optimization algorithms to solve this troubling problem. In this framework, regular partitions and evolutions of populations are implemented alternatively. Specifically, the initial population is generated from a regular partition on the search space; after several generations of evolution of the population, the evolution result is returned to join in the regular partition again, and a new population is generated. Repeat such progress until some stop condition is satisfied. Global convergence is guaranteed for the framework. Then this convergence framework is applied to particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and genetic algorithm. The modified algorithms are globally convergent and perform better than the original version.},

Hence, it is important to contemplate customized linguistics in collective decisions that involve linguistic variables , because the same linguistic term set may have totally different individual numerical scales. This research develops a consensus model taking into consideration the personalized individual self-confidence and trust semantics in dynamic social network group decision-making scenarios. Firstly, an optimization model driven by best additive consistency is proposed to derive the personalized self-confidence and trust semantics of individuals. Subsequently, a trust aggregation technique supporting the shortest path is outlined for weight distribution. The proposed technique not only considers the personalized individual trust linguistics but can also effectively decrease the risk of information distortion caused by trust decay. Moreover, a consensus feedback strategy is developed that combines opinion adjustment and dynamic trust interaction to enhance the potency of consensus. Totally different from most existing consensus models supported static trust network, the bestowed consensus feedback mechanism considers the inverse driving result of opinion adjustment on trust interaction within the consensus reaching processes. Finally, numerical examples and comparisons are provided to justify the practicability of the proposed model.},

While the distributions of credit data are very complex, the representations of such data are less studied. This study proposes a new representation learning approach based on a neural network called NyströmNet, which represents the credit data to benefit credit evaluation and sub-pattern analysis. The NyströmNet is developed to utilize the advantages of the Nyström method – a kernel approximation method in credit evaluation, yet overcomes its two limitations: distance distortions in kernel functions, and parameter tuning. The two main modules contained in NyströmNet, i.e., the Distance Metric Learning module and the Nyström module, can benefit each other and yield an overall optimum. Experiments using six real-life large-scale credit data showed that the AUC of the distance-based classifiers and the linear classifiers were improved by 2–11\% and 2–14\% with the newly generated distributions. The proposed approach also has certain practical advantages over traditional approaches because it is free from complex parameter tuning, consumes fewer memories, and is easy to utilize automatic differential frameworks such as PyTorch. The proposed approach is highly suitable for large-scale credit evaluation.},

We develop a simple but effective mask mechanism that helps reduce noise influence in time series and reduces the redundancy of FMLA by probabilistically selecting and masking the positions of each given series. We use incremental ablation studies on 85 UCR2018 datasets to evaluate the performance of the main techniques developed. Experimental results demonstrate that FMLA outperformed 11 state-of-the-art TSC algorithms, obtaining a mean accuracy of 89.37\%.

  abstract     = {Consensus reaching is essential in group decision-making (GDM) since it can mitigate conflicts between expert opinions and promotes the further implementation of decision-making results. Meanwhile, interaction between experts commonly occurs within social networks and in practical GDM problems. Therefore, it neecessary to consider the trust relationship between experts and utilize it to facilitate the consensus-reaching process (CRP). However, most existing social network-based GDM studies mainly use local measures (e.g., degree centrality) to determine the importance of experts, which cannot reflect their actual influence on a global topological structure . To address this issue, we propose a novel consensus-reaching strategy from the perspective of complex network analysis . First, the Extended Comparative Linguistic Expressions with Symbolic Translation (ELICIT) is adopted to flexibly facilitate the expression of experts’ uncertain evaluations. The hybrid centrality is then defined to determine the influence of experts in the social network by considering both node importance and edge weight. Since experts with greater influence have stronger information propagation capabilities, hybrid centrality is utilized to guide the CRP, which can better reflect information flows in the social network. Additionally, the BWM-CRITIC weighting method is developed to reflect the significance and relationship among criteria. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method by means of a case study on a sustainable supplier selection problem.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is an important data analysis technique. However, due to the diversity of datasets, each clustering algorithm is unable to produce satisfactory results on some particular datasets. In this paper, we propose a clustering optimization method called HIAC ( H ighly I mproving the A ccuracy of C lustering algorithms). By introducing gravitation, HIAC forces objects in the dataset to move towards similar objects, making the ameliorated dataset more friendly to clustering algorithms ( i.e. , clustering algorithms can produce more accurate results on the ameliorated dataset). HIAC is independent of clustering principle, so it can optimize different clustering algorithms. In contrast to other similar methods, HIAC is the first to adopt the selective-addition mechanism, i.e. , only adding gravitation between valid-neighbors, to avoid dissimilar objects approaching each other. In order to identify valid-neighbors from neighbors, HIAC introduces a decision graph, from which the naked eye can observe a clear division threshold. Additionally, the decision graph can assist HIAC in reducing the negative effects that improper parameter values have on optimization. We conducted numerous experiments to test HIAC . Experiment results show that HIAC can effectively ameliorate high-dimensional datasets, Gaussian datasets, shape datasets, the datasets with outliers, and overlapping datasets. HIAC greatly improves the accuracy of clustering algorithms, and its improvement rates are far higher than that of similar methods. The average improvement rate is as high as 253.6\% (except maximum and minimum). Moreover, its runtime is significantly shorter than that of most similar methods. More importantly, with different parameter values, the advantages of HIAC over similar methods are always maintained. The code of HIAC is available at https://github.com/qiqi12/HIAC .},

The experimental results demonstrate that, regardless of the number and type of low-level metaheuristics available, the learning automata based hyper-heuristics outperform each constituent MOEA individually, and an online learning and random choice selection hyper-heuristic from the literature.

Based on the complex coordinate representation, a novel bearing-only distributed localization algorithm for sensor networks is proposed. The algorithm combines the orientation estimation and the position estimation to solve the orientation alignment problem, which makes the compasses no longer needed for the localized networks. The localization for the mobile MASs is also studied and the corresponding localization algorithm is designed, which is more general and more challenging. The key to obtaining positions of moving agents, is the velocity estimator in the proposed localization algorithm which makes the estimated positions and velocities converge to the true value simultaneously. A distinctive advantage of the localization framework proposed in this paper is that the bearing-only localization algorithms can be applied to more general systems, such as sensor networks and MASs. Simulations and experiment are presented to verify the proposed algorithms.},

Methods for improving anomaly detection performance have been widely studied. However, no studies utilizing test-time augmentation (TTA) for anomaly detection in tabular data have been performed. TTA involves aggregating the predictions of several synthetic versions of a given test sample; TTA produces different points of view for a specific test instance and might decrease its prediction bias. We propose the Test-Time Augmentation for anomaly Detection (TTAD) technique, a TTA-based method aimed at improving anomaly detection performance. TTAD augments a test instance based on its nearest neighbors; various methods, including the k-Means centroid and SMOTE methods, are used to produce the augmentations. Our technique utilizes a Siamese network to learn an advanced distance metric when retrieving a test instance’s neighbors. Our experiments show that using our TTA technique significantly improves the performance of anomaly detection algorithms, as evidenced by the higher AUC results achieved on all datasets evaluated. Specifically, we observed average improvements of 0.037 AUC (3.7\%) using Autoencoder , 0.016 AUC (1.6\%) using OC-SVM, and 0.023 AUC (2.3\%) using LOF .},

  abstract     = {Smoothing rugged and rough fitness landscapes by machine learning (ML) models is a feasible approach to improve the global optimization performance of evolutionary algorithms (EA). However, systematic studies on the smoothing performance of ML models are rare. Moreover, existing model management methods have a relatively low efficiency and can cause the error propagation problem. In this paper, we empirically evaluate and compare the performance of common ML models in smoothing high-dimensional fitness landscapes. Based on the experimental results, we design a novel framework called data-driven multi-task optimization (DDMTO) to enhance EAs’ search abilities in complex solution spaces with ML smoothing models. The proposed framework firstly smooths the fitness landscape by a ML model. Then, it models the original fitness landscape optimization and the smoothed fitness landscape optimization as a two-task optimization problem and solves them with an evolutionary multi-task optimizer (EMTO). Coordinated by EMTO, the easy task can help optimize the difficult task through the proposed knowledge transfer operator, and the error propagation problem can be solved by the proposed knowledge transfer control scheme. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we design several example algorithms by embedding different EAs and ML models into the DDMTO framework and compare their optimization performance on high-dimensional continuous benchmark functions with rugged and rough fitness landscapes and a real-world optimization problem . Experimental results show that, by embedding an EA into the DDMTO framework with an appropriate smoothing model, its exploration ability and global optimization performance in complex solution spaces can be significantly enhanced without increasing the total computational cost.},

Recent studies have adopted deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze corrupted ECGs during CPR for shockable rhythm detection, however, none of them provided restored ECG signals using only the ECG waveform. In this study, a self-supervised UNet deep learning network is designed to restore the underlying ECG signals during chest compressions without additional reference signals. The UNet is pretrained using a large dataset created by combining 12-lead clean ECG signals with simulated CPR artifacts generated by a mathematical model . Transfer learning is applied to fine-tune the UNet parameters based on combined ECG signals from OHCA patients. Finally, an independent dataset extracted from OHCA patients is used to test the model. Compared with the artifact corrupted ECG signals, the overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved from −5.3 (-11.2, 0.8) dB to 1.9 (0.7, 3.9) dB after the restoration, and the accuracy of the rhythm detection is improved from 65.8\% to 90.8\%. The proposed method not only effectively restores the underlying ECG signals but also provides accurate shock advice without interrupting CPR using only the ECG.},

The key is to learn effective latent feature representations for classifying the already known classes as well as detecting new emerging ones. In this paper, we learn multiple Gaussian prototypes to better represent the complex classes distribution in both generative and discriminative ways. With the generative constraint, the latent variables of the same class clusters compactly around the corresponding Gaussian prototypes, preserving extra space for the samples of unknown classes. The discriminative constraint separates the Gaussian prototypes of different classes, which further improves the discrimination capability for the known classes. Importantly, the entire framework can be directly derived from the Bayesian inference , thus providing theoretical support for open-set recognition.

Luckily, the intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval-valued fuzzy sets can effectively deal with this uncertain and incomplete data information when selecting evaluation criteria and facing with the ambiguity of human thinking, whereas providing us with a helpful tool to resolve fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems in a more flexible way.

A case study from the sustainable recycling supplier selection of e-bike sharing is studied to illustrate applicability of the proposed method.

The feature extraction module maps the data from low-dimensional to high-dimensional space by fusing the representations of different dimensional spaces through convolutional layers with cross-connections. For some convolutional layers , we use the depthwise separable convolution to replace the original convolution to reduce the number of parameters. Besides, we use SelectDropout to improve its generalization capability. The classification module uses a soft margin support vector machine for classification.

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms have proven to be extremely effective at tackling multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). However, when dealing with many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), their performance frequently degrades, especially when the Pareto marking irregular shapes. The population pressure to choose the Pareto optimal front and address the generalizability of different Pareto front shapes becomes more challenging as the number of objectives increases. We present a strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm based on adaptive reference points (SPEA/ARP) to address this problem. First, the reference points are updated using current and historical population information. The angles between the current demographic information and the predefined uniform reference points are used to select the active reference points, and the adaptive reference points are selected from the historical population information projected onto the reference plane. Second, the fitness function values are applied to classify the environmental selection criteria into two categories: 1) The angle distance scaling function using adaptive reference points is utilized to increase selection pressure, and the diversity of non-dominated solutions is balanced using the angle-based secondary selection technique. 2) Otherwise, the fitness function values are employed to choose the next generation of non-dominated solutions. Third, an aggregate fitness r-value generated by the angle distance scaling function is employed to construct matching pools that produce valid offsprings. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate SPEA/ARP performance by comparing it with six state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms on 5-, 10-, 15-objective of 31 benchmark MaOPs. The experiments show that SPEA/ARP outperforms the compared algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Traditional class imbalanced learning algorithms require training data to be labeled, whereas semi-supervised learning algorithms assume that the class distribution is balanced. However, class imbalance and insufficient labeled data problems often coexist in practical real-world applications. Currently, most existing class-imbalanced semi-supervised learning methods tackle these two problems separately, resulting in the trained model biased towards majority classes that have more data samples. In this study, we propose a deep metric learning based pseudo-labeling (DML-PL) framework that tackles both problems simultaneously for class-imbalanced semi-supervised learning. The proposed DML-PL framework comprises three modules: Deep Metric Learning, Pseudo-Labeling and Network Fine-tuning. An iterative self-training strategy is used to train the model multiple times. For each time of training, Deep Metric Learning trains a deep metric network to learn compact feature representations of labeled and unlabeled data . Pseudo-Labeling then generates reliable pseudo-labels for unlabeled data through labeled data clustering with nearest neighbors selection. Finally, Network Fine-tuning fine-tunes the deep metric network to generate better pseudo-labels in the subsequent training. The training ends when all the unlabeled data are pseudo-labeled. The proposed framework achieved state-of-the-art performance on the long-tailed CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet127 benchmark datasets compared with baseline models .},

To cover this issue, this work studies a diversity-based multi-objective differential evolution approach to feature selection. During the environmental selection process, each of the solutions in the candidate pool will have a diversity score, and solutions with large diversity score values will be preferred so as to improve the population diversity. To reduce the search space, irrelevant and weakly relevant features are detected and removed in the proposed method. A new binary mutation operator using the neighborhood information of individuals is also proposed, aiming to produce better feature subsets. Experimental results on 14 datasets with varying difficulties show that the proposed feature selection method can obtain significantly better feature selection performance than current popular multi-objective feature selection methods.},

In contrast, deep multi-view clustering methods for implicit optimization have excellent feature abstraction ability but are inscrutable due to their black-box problem. However, very limited research was devoted to integrating the advantages of the above two types of methods to design an efficient method for multi-view clustering. Focusing on these problems, this paper proposes a differentiable bi-level optimization network (DBO-Net) for multi-view clustering, which is implemented by incorporating the traditional optimization method with deep learning to design an interpretable deep network. To enhance the representation capability, the proposed DBO-Net is constructed by stacking multiple explicit differentiable block networks to learn an interpretable consistent representation. Then all the learned parameters can be implicitly optimized through back-propagation, making the learned representation more suitable for the clustering task. Extensive experimental results validate that the strategy of bi-level optimization can effectively improve clustering performance and the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art clustering methods.},

Unlike the membership-function-independent (MFI) approaches, the membership-function-dependent (MFD) approaches carry the information of the MFs for the relaxation of the stability constraints. Corresponding stable constraints in sum-of-squares (SOS) form are given to hold the asymptotic stability of the fault detection system with H ∞ H∞ performance γ γ . A numerical example with many cases illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in uncertainty handling and conservativeness reduction, while an inverted pendulum example verifies the feasibility of the method on physical systems.},

  abstract     = {Differential privacy (DP) is a general approach to defend against inference attacks, but hard to balance the privacy-utility trade-off for some complex data analysis tasks. To improve the utility of data analysis , a weaker privacy definition with a more accurate estimate of privacy risk may be a straightforward and effective solution. Total variation distance (TVD) privacy is an appropriate tool for this issue, but it has not been adequately studied. In this paper, we systematically study TVD privacy and explore its applications. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of TVD privacy and demonstrate its advantage in measuring privacy risks with the example of membership inference attacks. Our work indicates that TVD privacy is a helpful tool in estimating privacy risks and has the potential to be widely used as a general privacy definition.},

However, when the output of the system can not completely track the reference signal, there is no result to show how to deal with this situation. To solve such problem, we investigate the optimal output tracking problem of Boolean control networks (BCNs) with a constant reference signal in this paper, that is, to design an appropriate control scheme such that each state will evolve to their optimal output tracking trajectory. Firstly, the optimal output tracking cycle (OTC) of each state is defined. Secondly, a method is presented to compute the cycle with certain length in the system, and the least upper bound of the length for the optimal OTC is derived. Finally, a constructive algorithm is presented to design the state feedback controllers that enable the system to realize optimal output tracking. Moreover, an illustrative example is given to show the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Over the last three decades, several researchers have been putting their efforts into developing non-deterministic fuzzy time series (FTS) models using the traditional fuzzy set. However, considering a set of membership values to each element of the time series, the hesitant fuzzy set glorifies the chances to capture the fuzziness and uncertainty due to randomness better than the traditional fuzzy set. Motivated by this, the present study proposes a novel hesitant FTS forecasting model employing a support vector machine (HFTSF-SVM). In this model, to diminish the computational complexity and increase the forecasting accuracy, we have addressed three key issues by proposing three new methods such as (a) a length-based discretization technique is developed to compute the number of intervals, (b) two sets of universe of discourse are determined for the same time series to compute the non-membership and membership value for each observation (c) each observation along with its mean aggregated membership values are adopted to construct the fuzzy logical relationships (FLR). To assess the competency and reliability of the proposed HFTSF-SVM model, six promising FTS models from the recent literature and four promising time series forecasting (TSF) models are considered for comparison using sixteen time series datasets. Extensive statistical analyses of obtained results confirm the supremacy of the proposed HFTSF-SVM model.},

  abstract     = {Appropriate product classification can not only promote the sale of products but also highly improve the profits of manufacturers and retailers. To derive a desirable clustering of products, we need to consider qualitative (e.g., customers’ evaluation) and quantitative (e.g., product sales) information simultaneously. However, traditional methods such as K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering , and density-based clustering fail to depict the fuzzy cognitions of decision makers (DMs) in real cases. This article investigates clustering methods to aid DMs in their classification management of products. To do so, an intuitionistic multiplicative set (IMS), a new form of information expression, is applied to express the DMs’ evaluations of products due to its strong ability to handle unbalanced or asymmetric information. This study includes an in-depth analysis of inclusion measures of IMSs to measure the inclusion relationships between products under the given evaluation criteria. We propose two types of clustering techniques—the intuitionistic multiplicative (IM) transitive closure clustering method and the IM netting clustering method—to tackle the clustering problem with IMS information. Lastly, a case study of product classification management is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methods. Furthermore, the validity and superiority of these clustering methods are verified by theoretical and practical comparisons.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) in data mining and machine learning has attracted extensive attention. The purpose of FS in a classification task is to find the optimal subset of features from given candidate features. Recently, more and more meta-heuristic algorithms have been used to deal with the FS problems. However, meta-heuristic algorithms suffer from certain issues, such as large search space for solutions and huge time consumption. Moreover, most of existing meta-heuristic algorithms focus only on the selection of an optimal feature subset, and pay little attention to the optimal design of the classifier. In this article, we propose a joint multiobjective optimization method for both feature selection and classifier design , called JMO-FSCD. The proposed approach uses neural network as a classifier and introduces a non-iterative algorithm for training the classifier so as to ensure good performance and fast learning. A new coding scheme is also designed for optimizing FS and classifier simultaneously. For demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach, its performance is compared with those of six state-of-the-art FS algorithms . Experimental results on thirty-five benchmark data sets reflect the superior performance of the proposed JMO-FSCD.},

However, since the processing object of OSN P systems is a spike, where information is encoded by the timing of spikes or the number of spikes in neurons, OSN P systems are limited for solving continuous optimization problems . To break this limitation, an extended numerical spiking neural (ENSN P) system is proposed based on numerical spiking neural P (NSN P) systems and multiple (ENSN P) systems, called optimization numerical spiking neural P systems (ONSN P systems or ONSNPS), are designed to solve continuous constrained optimization problems . More specifically, in ENSN P systems, the production functions are selected by probability to achieve updated parameters. In OSN P systems, a guider algorithm is introduced to finish individuals’ crossover and selection. The extensively experimental results in five benchmarks, thirty-two optimization problems including five benchmark problems, seventeen manufacturing design optimization problems and ten benchmarks from CEC show that ONSN P systems in this paper outperform or are competitive to twenty-eight optimization algorithms . Finally, algorithm complexity and Holm-Bonferroni procedure based on statistical results is used to test the complexity changing when we use different dimensionality of the search space and the difference in terms of statistical performance. The testing results indicate that the time complexity of ONSN P systems grows linearly with problem dimensions and ONSN P systems are better performance than the most algorithms.},

Not only does the considered system contain unknown nonlinear functions and multisource disturbances, but parameter matrix in the system varies with the semi-Markov progress, which create difficulties in the design of the controller. Firstly, to handle the non-Lipschitz nonlinear terms , an adaptive control law based on reinforcement learning has been designed. Secondly, according to the reinforcement learning result, an adaptive disturbance observer has been constructed to offset the adverse influence generated by the multiple disturbances in the considered system. Finally, aiming at the parameter matrixes in the system varying with semi-Markov progress, a novel adaptive tracking controller integrating the reinforcement learning approximation , the adaptive disturbance observer and the tracking control law, has been proposed. With the given adaptive tracking control law based on reinforcement learning, through the Lyapunov direct method, it has been proven that the closed-loop system are stable and convergent and the tracking errors are ultimately uniformly bounded. In addition, several numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed reinforcement learning based adaptive tracking control law.},

In order to make full use of the bandwidth in communication networks, the weighted try-once-discard protocol is adopted to connect only one sensor with communication networks at a instant via the maximum-error-first policy. It is worth noticing that via using the weighted try-once-discard protocol, the information received by the controller becomes less such that the gains of the controller may be more susceptible to the internal and external environment. Therefore, the non-fragile output-feedback fuzzy control scheme is employed for maintaining the performance of controllers under such a protocol. Then, based on suitable augmented multiple Lyapunov-like functions, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the stochastically globally uniform exponential stability and a fixed H ∞ H∞ performance for the resulted closed-loop system. Furthermore, through solving those conditions, the design approach of the desired controller can be developed. The feasibility of the established approach is illustrated via a example and a truck-trailer model.},

GSD-IJ is based on geometric mean and geometric standard deviation and allows aggregation of individual scalar valued judgments into interval group judgments. The width of the group interval judgments is controlled by the parameter λ λ , which ensures the acceptable degree of uncertainty of interval judgments, while providing the highest possible value of the group satisfaction index. Fuzzy preference programming is used to derive scalar-valued group weights from group interval pairwise comparison matrix. Three examples are given to evaluate and validate GSD-IJ.

How to select the high-confidence samples is a crucial step for algorithms based on self-training framework. To alleviate the impact of noise data, researchers have proposed many data editing methods to improve the selection quality of high-confidence samples. However, the state-of-the-art data editing methods have high time complexity, which is not less than O ( n 2 ) O(n2) , where n n denotes the number of samples. To improve the training speed while ensuring the quality of the selected high-confidence samples, inspired by Ball- k k -means algorithm, we propose a fast semi-supervised self-training Algorithm based on data editing (EBSA), which defines ball-cluster partition and editing to improve the quality of high-confidence samples. The time complexity of the proposed EBSA is O ( t 2 kn + n log n + n + k 2 ) O(t2kn+nlogn+n+k2) , where k k denotes the number of centers, t t denotes the number of iterates. k k is far less than n n , EBSA has linear time complexity with respect to n n .

The algorithm has the following features: ( i ) supports both pool-based and population-based sampling; ( ii ) is not tailored to a particular class of predictors; ( iii ) can handle known and unknown constraints on the queryable feature vectors; and ( iv ) can run either sequentially, or in batch mode, depending on how often the predictor is retrained. The potentials of the method are shown in numerical tests on illustrative synthetic problems and real-world datasets.

  abstract     = {Smart remote patient monitoring and early disease diagnosis systems have made huge progresses after the introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts. This paper proposes an AI-enabled IoT system to monitor and adjust the depth of anesthesia via network channels. More precisely, fuzzy learning systems are employed to develop a control system for the depth of anesthesia in surgeries. This scheme is composed of variable structure control and adaptive type-II fuzzy systems. Therefore, the controller is adaptive and robust to any perturbations and disturbances that may happen during a patient’s surgery. The adaptive type-II fuzzy system is designed as an intelligent online estimator to approximate patient model uncertainties. This estimation helps in boosting the performance of the variable structure control system. An artificial neuron is also designed to reduce chattering for the proposed control system. The designed control system can efficiently adjust the anesthesia drug infusion rate and regulate the Bispectral index. The networked structure of the proposed system makes remote tuning of drug infusion possible. Performance of the designed controller is evaluated on several patient models. Simulation results confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed remote drug delivery system.},

While traditional methods predict relations between users by considering hand-crafted features, recent studies first perform representation learning using network embedding or graph neural networks (GNNs) for downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, those approaches fail to capture behavioral patterns of individuals ingrained in periodical visits or long-distance movements. To better learn behavioral patterns, this paper proposes a novel scheme called ANES (Aspect-oriented Network Embedding for Social link inference). ANES learns aspect-oriented relations between users and Point-of-Interests (POIs) within their contexts. ANES is the first approach that extracts the complex behavioral pattern of users from both trajectory data and the structure of User-POI bipartite graphs . Our extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that ANES outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {With the supplement of texture and geometry cues in depth maps, salient object detection (SOD) shifts from 2D to 3D, aiming to detect the most attractive object in a pair of color and depth images. Previous work primarily focused on regional integrity. Few methods are used to improve the edge quality of prediction results, resulting in a final prediction with a complete structure but blurred edges. Moreover, due to the complexity of real-life scenarios, the problem of effectively separating the salient object from complex background has become a hot potato. Aiming to address these issues, we propose a novel network, EGA-Net, to improve the edge quality and highlight the main features of the salient object. Specifically, in the EGA-Net, we propose a feature interaction (FI) module and an edge feature enhancement (EFE) module, respectively. Among them, the FI module is used to remove unimodal feature redundancy, capture multi-modal feature complementarity, and reduce the contamination of low-quality depth maps. The EFE is used to improve the edge quality of the final salient object prediction results. Furthermore, a Global Information Guide Integration (GIGI) module has been proposed to suppress the background noise and effectively highlight the salient objects’ main features. It uses interleaving and fusion methods to automatically select and enhance the vital information in the original input features under the guidance of global features. We put the training of EGA-Net under the supervision of a new hybrid loss function that can simultaneously take global pixel point, foreground, and depth map quality into account. Quantitative and qualitative experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms the 19 advanced methods on eight publicly available RGB-D salient object detection datasets with five evaluation metrics.

The implicit assumption of GNNs being able to work is that all nodes have adequate information for meaningful aggregation. However, this is not easy to satisfy because the degrees of a real-world graph commonly follow the power-law distribution, where most nodes belong to low-degree nodes with limited neighborhoods. In this paper, we argue that to make GNNs better handle the low-degree node representation learning is the key to solving the above problem and propose a pluggable framework named Adversarial Information Completion Graph Neural Networks (AIC-GNN). It introduces a novel Graph Information Generator to fit adaptively the node missing information distribution. Then, the Graph Embedding Discriminator distinguishes between the node embeddings with the ideal information and the node embeddings after information completion. The representational capacity of the model is enhanced by adversarial training between the Generator and Discriminator. Meanwhile, the dual node embedding alignment mechanisms are employed to guide the high quality of predicted information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AIC-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four real-world graphs.},

The multi-view subspace clustering has achieved a better clustering quality than the single-view subspace clustering, mainly because of the complementarity of multi-view information. First, for not directly pursuing a block diagonal representation matrix of previous ℓ 1 ℓ1 or ℓ 2 ℓ2 regularizers in a deep subspace clustering network, a k -block diagonal regularizer is proposed to replace traditional regularizers. This block diagonal representation module is integrated into this multi-view subspace clustering network, and it can improve the clustering quality. Secondly, there exists some redundancy among the representation matrices, and a diverse representation module can be introduced into this network. This can boost the diversity of representation matrices, and make learned representation matrices more discriminative and help improve the clustering performance. In this paper, based on the deep subspace clustering network, we integrate the block diagonal and diverse representation into the network, and a multi-view subspace clustering network with the block diagonal and the diverse representation is proposed. The experimental results on the UCI Digit, Caltech101-20, COIL100 and Caltech101-7 datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over other popular multi-view algorithms.},

Currently, most researchers studying replica placement algorithms consider only a single attribute or a few multiple attributes. However, a single attribute cannot accurately express the performance of a node. Therefore, this paper proposes a replica placement algorithm based on the entropy weight TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) method, called TS-REPLICA. First, a multi-attribute matrix that comprehensively reflects the performance and load of nodes is defined. Then, a TOPSIS-based algorithm is proposed to calculate the performance score of each data node. In addition, the entropy weight method is introduced to derive the weights of attributes for balancing the influence of weights of multiple attributes. Next, the comprehensive load score of each data node in the Spark cluster, the average comprehensive load score of each rack, and the average comprehensive load score of the entire cluster are calculated, and replica placement is performed based on the obtained scores. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on various datasets and test cases. The experimental results show that the TS-REPLICA algorithm outperforms the better comparison algorithm in execution number in Spark cluster.},

To this end, considerable efforts have been made to strengthen the security and privacy of these applications, where a major goal is to capture the forward secrecy of asynchronous messaging without sacrificing other reasonable security properties. In this paper, we mainly focus on forward-secure zero round-trip time (0-RTT) key exchange protocols. Such a protocol enables a user to send the encrypted application data along with the first protocol message, and thus is especially suitable for securing asynchronous messaging. Concretely, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive dubbed as puncturable identity-based matchmaking key encapsulation mechanism (PIB-MKEM). It captures the authenticity of ciphertexts, and also allows a receiver to repeatedly update his/her secret key with a puncture algorithm. Based on PIB-MKEM, we further put forth a generic construction of 0-RTT key exchange protocol that enjoys forward secrecy and mutual authentication as well as replay resistance in parallel. We also present a concrete construction of PIB-MKEM, which immediately instantiates the above generic 0-RTT key exchange protocol. Moreover, we implement the proposed PIB-MKEM construction, and provide extensive evaluations to demonstrate its practicability.},

Therefore, an appropriate graph topology is crucial for effective graph representation learning in GNNs. However, most existing GNNs assume that the initial graph is complete and accurate, and utilize the fixed initial graph structure in the entire network, which may limit the learning representation capability of the model. In this work, we propose a novel differentiable graph structure learning neural network (DGSLN), which learns suitable graph structures for GNNs. Specifically, our DGSLN presents a general graph generation scheme that integrates various useful graph prior messages to generate normal structures. We describe the generation process with homophily, node degree, and sparsity as examples. Moreover, we develop a hybrid loss function to ensure the quality of learned graphs, which combines task-specific loss and graph regularization loss to optimize graph structures from both structural adaptive and task-driven aspects. Extensive experiments on graph classification and node classification have shown that our approach significantly improves performance on different benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art GNNs methods.},

  abstract     = {Graph-based clustering is a basic subject in the field of machine learning , but most of them still have the following deficiencies. First, similarity graph construction and data division into corresponding classes are always divided into two independent steps. Second, noise contained in real data may cause the learned similarity graph to be inaccurate. Third, the traditional metrics based on Euclidean distance is difficult to tackle non-Gaussian noise. In order to eliminate these limitations, a noise-aware clustering based on correntropy and adaptive graph regularization method (NCCAGR) is proposed. 1) In order to change the problem from two-steps to single-step, we formulate a joint clustering learning framework that simultaneously learns a robust similarity graph and performs data clustering ; 2) To overcome the influence of noise, we construct a Laplacian matrix and perform adaptive graph regularization based on clean data; 3) By introducing the correntropy to solve the problem of non-Gaussian noise and heavy tail in the original data. Furthermore, a half-quadratic optimization method is used to transform the problem into a quadratic form to facilitate subsequent solutions. Finally, experiments show that the proposed method not only has high performance, but also outperforms both classical methods and state-of-the-art methods in robustness.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the approximate synchronization problem of two coupled multi-valued logical networks, including global and local cases. Three new notions: approximate synchronization state set (ASSS), the maximum approximate synchronization basin (MASB) and the shortest approximate synchronization time (SAST) are introduced and analyzed. Based on ASSS, several necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for global and local approximate synchronization. MASB, the set of all possible initial states from which the systems are approximately synchronous, is investigated combining with the maximum invariant subset . Meanwhile, the calculation method of the SAST, associated with the transient period, is presented. By virtue of MASB and SAST, pinning controllers are designed to make the coupled systems achieve global approximate synchronization. Furthermore, the PSPACE-completeness of the approximate synchronization problem is proved. Finally, several examples are given to illustrate the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical feature selection has proven to be significant in reducing classification difficulty. Many existing hierarchical feature selection methods use the hierarchy in the class space as structural information to improve performance. However, these methods focus on the inter-class structural relations and ignore the intra-class feature correlations, which is challenging as the numbers of classes and features in current datasets are both growing rapidly. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical feature selection method that maximizes inter-class independence and minimizes intra-class redundancy using structure and feature relations. First, we investigate the class hierarchy dependency in the tree structure as the structural relation regularization , which maximizes the independence between unrelated classes in the class structure. Second, we transform the feature correlations into a mathematical representation as feature relation regularization , which minimizes the redundancy in each class on the premise of sparsity . Finally, we unify the two regularization terms into a hierarchical feature selection method to trade off the structural and feature relations. Our method exhibits excellent efficiency and effectiveness compared with other feature selection methods.},

Formal argumentation enables reasoning on arguments for and against a claim to decide on an outcome. In abstract argumentation frameworks, each argument can be associated with an acceptance condition that may be either implicit (e.g., Dung’s framework where they are encoded in the attack relation) or explicit (e.g., Dialectical Framework where propositional formulae are associated with arguments/statements). Explicit acceptance conditions allow for expressing reasoning tasks in a more natural and compact way. However, in some cases, current argumentation frameworks allowing explicit conditions do not permit to express in a compact and intuitive way some general acceptance conditions, such as those that could be expressed by first-order logic formulae. In this paper, we propose an argumentation framework where arguments’ acceptance conditions allow for checking general properties also concerning sets of arguments/statements by exploiting aggregate functions (e.g., is the number of nearby agents greater than 5?). Notably, though providing such versatile and easily understandable acceptance conditions, the complexity of credulous and skeptical reasoning does not increase w.r.t. that for Dung’s framework under the well-known non-deterministic semantics, i.e., preferred, stable, and least-undefined (a.k.a. semi-stable) semantics.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid recommender systems utilize advanced algorithms capable of learning heterogeneous sources of data and generating personalized recommendations for users. The data can range from user preferences (e.g., ratings or reviews) to item content (e.g., description or category). Prior studies in the field of recommender systems have primarily relied on “ratings” as the user feedback , when building user profiles or evaluating the quality of the recommendation. While ratings are informative, they may still fail to represent a comprehensive picture of actual user preferences. In contrast, there are other types of feedback data that differently or complementarily represent users and their preferences, including the reviews and the sentiments encapsulated within them. Such data can reveal important parts of a user’s profile that are not necessarily correlated with user ratings, and hence, they potentially reflect a different side of the user’s profile. In this paper, we propose a novel form of hybrid recommender system, capable of analyzing the reviews and extracting their sentiments that are incorporated into the recommendation process. We used advanced algorithms to generate recommendations for users capable of incorporating additional data, such as the review sentiment. We conducted analyses and showed that sentiments of user reviews are not always highly correlated with the ratings (e.g., in music domain). This might mean that sentiment can be indicative of a different aspect of user preferences and can be used as an alternative signal of user feedback. Hence, we have used both ratings and sentiments of reviews when evaluating our proposed hybrid recommender system. We selected two common datasets for the evaluation, Amazon Digital Music and Amazon Video Games , and showed the superior performance of the proposed hybrid recommender system compared to different baselines. The comparison were made in two evaluation scenarios, namely, when the ratings were considered the user feedback and when sentiments of the review were considered the user feedback.},

  abstract     = {As environmental awareness grow, many organizations seek to implement Electric Vehicle (EV) fleets. Nonetheless, EVs’ low driving ranges and high recharging times, and the limited Charging Stations (CS) availability make their management more challenging than conventional vehicles. The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (E-VRP) tackles these challenges. However, many E-VRP variants drop relevant operational constraints, use overly simple models, or do not address route update solutions during operation. This work introduces a strategy to compute EV routes and update them according to observed traffic scenarios. By using an event-based EV state-space model, the strategy tracks relevant variables to account for multiple realistic elements, including nonlinear recharging function, partial recharging, mass-dependent energy consumption, maximum CS capacities, and time-dependent travel times. First, an Offline E-VRP (Off-E-VRP) variant is solved to find initial route candidates. Then, routes are periodically updated during operation according to traffic and EV state measurements by solving an Online E-VRP (On-E-VRP) variant. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are implemented to solve the problems via novel encoding and genetic operators. Finally, simulation results show that the strategy enables the fleet to fulfil its delivery duties, the pre-operation stage provides adequate initial route candidates, and the online stage can improve performance and service quality.},

Most of these methods require a predefined graph as input, whereas in real-life multivariate time series problems, a well-predefined dependency graph rarely exists. This requirement makes it harder for GNNs to be utilised widely for multivariate forecasting problems in other domains such as retail or energy. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach combining neural networks and statistical structure learning models to self-learn the dependencies and construct a dynamically changing dependency graph from multivariate data aiming to enable the use of GNNs for multivariate forecasting even when a well-defined graph does not exist. The statistical structure modeling in conjunction with neural networks provides a well-principled and efficient approach by bringing in causal semantics to determine dependencies among the series. Finally, we demonstrate significantly improved performance using our proposed approach on real-world benchmark datasets without a pre-defined dependency graph.},

Previously, several approaches for evaluating concept similarity and relatedness based on WordNet or Wikipedia have been proposed. WordNet-based methods rely on highly precise knowledge but have limited lexical coverage. In contrast, Wikipedia-based models achieve more coverage but sacrifice knowledge quality. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on developing a comprehensive semantic similarity and relatedness method based on WordNet and Wikipedia. To improve the accuracy of existing measures, we combine various taxonomic and non-taxonomic features of WordNet, including gloss, lemmas, examples, sister-terms, derivations, holonyms/meronyms, and hypernyms/hyponyms, with Wikipedia gloss and hyperlinks, to describe concepts. We present a novel technique for extracting ‘ is-a ’ and ‘ part-whole ’ relationships between concepts using the Wikipedia link structure. The suggested technique identifies taxonomic and non-taxonomic relationships between concepts and offers dense vector representations of concepts. To fully exploit WordNet and Wikipedia’s semantic attributes, the proposed method integrates their semantic knowledge at feature-level, combining semantic similarity and relatedness into a single comprehensive measure. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art measures on various gold standard benchmarks.},

Then, a sequence of perturbed reachable sets is constructed, and several criteria are presented for the robust controllability of SBCNs under the multi-bit function perturbations. As a generalization, a perturbed position index matrix and a sequence of perturbed reachable sets are designed for the closed-loop system, based on which, a necessary and sufficient condition is presented for the robust state-feedback stabilization of SBCNs under arbitrary switching signal.

It encapsulates classification information in upper and lower approximations and pays attention to the boundary region of samples.

With the purpose of adapting to the evolution of the era, incremental learning is widely exerted in the field of data mining . In combination with incremental technique, it is not cumbersome to update the reduct in time. Enlightened by this, our work focuses on the mechanism of incremental feature selection due to the variation of objects in IvFDIS. Firstly, we construct λ λ -fuzzy similarity relation and introduce λ λ -fuzzy similarity self-information into IvFDIS based on relative decision self-information. Besides, with the assistance of matrix operation , we recommend static feature selection according to λ λ -fuzzy similarity self-information. Furthermore, two relevant incremental algorithms involving the insertion and removal of objects in IvFDIS are made a research. Finally, some comparative experiments are conducted on twelve public data sets to certify the validity of our incremental algorithms . Experimental results show that comparable to three tested algorithms, the proposed incremental algorithms lessen the computation time greatly, and they select fewer features in most instances without decreasing classification accuracy in IvFDIS.},

Thus, automated event detection mechanisms are invaluable to the community. However, a clear majority of the available approaches rely only on data statistics without considering linguistics. A few approaches involved linguistics, only to extract textual event details without the corresponding temporal details. Since linguistics define words’ structure and meaning, a severe information loss can happen without considering them. Targeting this limitation, we propose a novel method named WhatsUp to detect temporal and fine-grained textual event details, using linguistics captured by self-learned word embeddings and their hierarchical relationships and statistics captured by frequency-based measures. We evaluate our approach on recent social media data from two diverse domains and compare the performance with several state-of-the-art methods. Evaluations cover temporal and textual event aspects, and results show that WhatsUp notably outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also analyse the efficiency, revealing that WhatsUp is sufficiently fast for (near) real-time detection. Further, the usage of unsupervised learning techniques, including self-learned embedding, makes our approach expandable to any language, platform and domain and provides capabilities to understand data-specific linguistics.},

  abstract     = {Traditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based Generalized Zero Shot Learning (GZSL) methods usually suffer from a problem that these methods ignore the differences between classes when using the standard normal distribution to fit the true distribution of each category, and the incompleteness of a single adversarial training makes the model unable to capture all the characteristics of the samples. To address this problem, a data-driven recurrent adversarial generative network is proposed in this paper. We first synthesize visual prototypes for unseen classes using the transformation from semantic attributes to visual prototypes learned on seen classes. Then, some noise is generated from these prototypes to synthesize the unseen samples according to the corresponding semantic attributes. During the sample generation process, a recurrent generative adversarial network is designed to facilitate the generated visual features to be more representative. Extensive experiments on five popular datasets as well as detailed ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

Collecting and analyzing data from multiple parties becomes difficult. Federated learning can analyze multiple datasets while preventing the original data from being sent. However, existing federated learning frameworks are based on the Apriori property of mining frequent patterns , which has the disadvantage of low efficiency and multiple scanning datasets. Therefore, to improve mining efficiency, a federated learning framework (named FedFIM) is proposed in this paper. FedFIM collects the noisy responses sent by participants, which are used by the server to reconstruct the noisy dataset. After that, the noisy dataset is applied to the non-Apriori algorithm to mine frequent patterns . In addition, FedFIM incorporates a differential privacy-preserving mechanism into federated learning, which addresses the need for federated modeling and protects data privacy. Experiments show that FedFIM has a shorter running time and better applicability compared to the most advanced benchmark.},

Three aspects are taken into account to perform the present study in depth. Firstly, the multiple quantizations case is investigated. Second, a novel cost function is exploited to perform the GC analysis issue, which consists of the quantized state and quantized control input. At last, a new control scheme is developed to fulfill the design of GC controller, where an additional nonlinear term is also employed besides the quantized state. By introducing auxiliary scalars and matrices, new conditions with regard to designing the dynamic quantizers and robust GC controllers are derived, which are expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a practical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

Objectives in addition to the liking probability can be proposed to provide movie recommendations. However, there is a lack of recommenders that are aware of the benefit and that address the multi-objective nature of the problem. A profit-aware recommender system based on swarm intelligence in a multi-objective environment (multi-objective artificial bee colony, MOABC) has been designed, implemented, and applied. The proposed approach incorporates new intelligent operators that try to improve both objectives (liking probability and profit) simultaneously in each iteration instead of exclusively using randomness. This increases the quality of the recommendations with respect to the state-of-the-art algorithms. This new proposal has been evaluated using MovieLens datasets, covering different sizes (large, medium, and small). The experiments show that the MOABC performs better than collaborative filtering (CF, a standard in recommender systems) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II, the only multi-objective proposal in scientific literature that is profit aware) in terms of accuracy and global profit. Furthermore, statistical analysis shows that the proposed approach generates better and more robust results, also showing that the multi-objective nature of the problem must be exploited.},

Here, all uncertain parameters are represented as triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. We used an accuracy ranking function and variable transformation in the proposed method to convert an IFMOLFO problem into a crisp multi-objective linear optimization problem. Then, we formulated the first phase of the weighted intuitionistic fuzzy goal programming (WIFGP) model to obtain an intuitionistic fuzzy non-dominant (IFND) solution for the IFMOLFO problem. Several strategies for obtaining an IFND solution to the IFMOLFO problem have been proposed in the literature. However, in addition to constructing the phase-I WIFGP model, this study shows that the IFND solution may not be Pareto-optimal when some of the under-deviation variables are zero. As a result, the second phase of the WIFGP model is applied to address this issue. The benefits of both models are merged to provide a novel method, unlike any other method in the literature, for producing optimal solutions that satisfy both IFND and Pareto-optimal requirements. The suggested algorithm’s efficiency and reliability are demonstrated by addressing a real-life case study of an agricultural production planning problem and followed by solving a numerical example from literature.},

However, these models ignore the obstinacy of DMs to their initial opinions, which violates the sociological research results. Aiming at the consensus reaching of SNGDM where DMs are stubborn to their initial opinions, this paper proposes a novel consensus model based on the passive adjustment based on feedback mechanism (PA-FM) and active adjustment based on social interaction (AA-SI), which adaptively adopts AA-SI or PA-FM in each round according to the opinion distribution of DMs. Specially, the proposed consensus model assimilates the advantage of PA-FM and AA-SI, where adjustment intensity of DMs affects the consensus level of PA-FM, and stubbornness degree of DMs affects that of AA-SI. To elucidate the performance and advantages of the proposed consensus model, a hypothetical application and three simulation analyses are constructed. The results show that (1) In the decision-making group that is stubborn to the initial opinions, social interaction has a beneficial or harmful effect on the consensus reaching, depending on the stubbornness degree and opinion distribution of DMs; and (2) Given any stubbornness degree and adjustment intensity, the proposed consensus model outperforms existing consensus methods in consensus efficiency and success rate.},

The gain matrices are used directly as design variables in the SARSA algorithm, and a time-varying incremental step is employed. The method uses a grid in the uncertain parameters to place the poles of the closed-loop system in a disk on the complex plane. In addition, a stability test based on the Lyapunov theory is performed to provide a hard stability certificate for the closed-loop system.

Recently, extension study has become a hot topic in the theoretical research of overlap functions, especially for the so-called quasi-overlap functions. In this paper, we investigate the set-based extended quasi-overlap functions, which are one kind of set-based extended aggregation functions proposed by Mesiar et al. lately. Specifically, after introducing the definition of set-based extended quasi-overlap functions, we study some of their elementary properties. Furthermore, we give two equivalent characterizations of set-based extended quasi-overlap functions by means of mappings from the set composed by all finite subsets of unit closed interval with no repetition of elements to unit closed interval and 0,1-aggregation functions recently proposed by the author, respectively. In particular, it is shown that the family of set-based extended quasi-overlap functions is closed to convex combination and that the repetition of values in the input vectors to be aggregated and adding any value between its minimum and maximum values have no effect on the output value under the aggregation of set-based extended quasi-overlap functions. The obtained results afford theoretical basis for more potential applications of quasi-overlap functions in real problems, especially when there are more than two classes or objects in fuzzy context or fuzzy sets for which we need to measure the degree of overlapping or generate overlap indices.},

The causality between features and the target variable can be traced by injecting counterfactual explanations into the prediction model and generating counterfactual instances using adjusted features to reverse the prediction results. Existing algorithms, such as Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE) and Counterfactual Explanations Guided by Prototypes (Proto), can generate multiple/single counterfactual(s) for a data point by global optimization in the range of all-out features to gain on a local decision range. However, these methods cannot clearly identify which features are the key causes. Moreover, a Random Forest Optimal Counterfactual Set Extractor (RF-OCSE) extracts counterfactual sets from a random forest and needs to manipulate all the internal nodes of the tree, restricting it to only tree ensemble models. To address the above shortcomings, we proposed a Counterfactual Explanation Generation method with the Minimal Feature Boundary (MFB), named ( CEG MFB CEGMFB ). The proposed CEG MFB CEGMFB algorithm consists of two stages: 1) mining the MFB, which can reverse the prediction results to restrain the generation range of counterfactual instances, and 2) constructing a counterfactual generative method for generating counterfactual instances within the MFB to realize the minimum reversing cost. To evaluate its performance, we compared the proposed CEG MFB CEGMFB algorithm with six baseline algorithms on 16 datasets and conducted a case study in a real scenario. The results indicate that the proposed CEG MFB CEGMFB algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms.},

However, the number of frequent subgraphs is potentially exponential while mining large graph patterns. This issue can be partly overcome using closed frequent graphs mining. Instead of mining all frequent subgraphs, it is more efficient to enumerate only the closed frequent graphs. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel closed frequent subgraph mining algorithm: CFGM. In this algorithm, a stack-based architecture is used to enumerate the frequent graph represented by the depth-first search. Moreover, this algorithm defines a strict partial order among frequent graphs. We demonstrate that, with respect to this strict partial order, only maximal elements (frequent graphs) need to be discovered. A pruning strategy is developed based on this strict partial order that dramatically reduces unnecessary frequent subgraphs to be enumerated. Computational results show our algorithm displays excellent performance, especially for some large asymmetric frequent graph patterns.},

  abstract     = {Bitcoin uses a decentralized network of miners and a distributed consensus algorithm to agree on blockchains to process transactions, and designs certain incentive strategy to ensure the system run persistently. However, recent research finds that it is vulnerable to specific game-theoretic attacks, in which a rational attack can gain a disproportionate share of reward by deviating from the honest behaviors. Among these attacks, stubborn mining is generally regarded as the most effective one. This paper propose the optimal stubborn mining strategy , trying to obtain the maximum revenue in stubborn mining. Through careful analysis, we find that the mining strategies in stubborn mining, under different conditions, can be represented as a Markovian Decision Process (MDP), and solving the MDP can result in the optimal strategy. In solving the MDP, we first transform it into a transition-reward Matrices, and then evaluate it to get the largest reward. With the method mentioned above, the attackers can get 46.9\% additional than honest miners, and this attack outweighs traditional selfish mining (a compelling and well-studied mining attack) by up to 7.53\%.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the leading-tracking control problem for heterogeneous and uncertain nonlinear autonomous vehicles is addressed. These latter communicate their status information over a wireless communication network and engage in cooperative movements in extra-urban traffic environment. The nonlinear vehicle dynamics are affected by time-varying parameter uncertainties, and the air-drag reduction caused by platooning is explicitly considered. The variation of V2V links as a result of cooperative manoeuvres is modelled by incorporating switching into the communication network topology. To this aim, we develop a novel robust distributed Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)-like control protocol which ensures that all vehicles within the platoon robustly track the behaviour of the leader, despite the presence of both unknown parameters uncertainties and network switching. The analytical stability of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated using Lyapunov theory. Sufficient stability conditions are expressed as a set of feasible Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) whose solution allows the robust control gains to be properly tuned. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated via the Mixed Traffic Simulator (MiTraS) co-simulation platform, which combines MATLAB/Simulink with SUMO microscopic traffic simulator. The exhaustive simulation analysis, involving the Monte Carlo method, is carried out considering different cooperative platooning manoeuvres, and confirms the theoretical derivation.},

  abstract     = {The probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets (PHFSs), which have received a lot of attention and have been widely used in many domains, are effective in describing hesitant evaluations. Despite significant progress, entropy and cross-entropy, as the famous uncertainty measures of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy information, have not yet been thoroughly investigated. However, these uncertainty measures are quite important and useful in the context of multi-attribute decision-making (MADM). In this contribution, we revisit the concept of uncertainty measures for probabilistic hesitant fuzzy information by comprehensively considering their fuzziness and hesitancy, and proposed some novel entropy and cross-entropy measures for them. Specifically, the hybrid entropy measures are designed as convex combinations of the fuzzy entropy factor and the hesitant entropy factor, and in the same line of thought, the hybrid cross-entropy measures are also designed as convex combinations of the fuzzy cross-entropy factor and the hesitant cross-entropy factor. It is shown that the hybrid entropy measures are simple in structure, clear in physical meaning, and strong in discriminating capability, while the hybrid cross-entropy measures can avoid the design flaws of existing cross-entropy measures and employ natural symmetry. It is further shown that the hybrid entropy and cross-entropy measures can be designed in pairs and are mutually supportive, which suggests that they are internally unified as the uncertainty measures of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy information. In the end, based on the proposed uncertainty measures, an MADM model is developed within the TOPSIS framework to evaluate a company’s strategic initiatives under probabilistic hesitant fuzzy environment. Numerical results show that these uncertainty measures can support group decision-making effectively and efficiently with probabilistic hesitant fuzzy information.},

Considering the challenges when modeling a complex process, this work presents a data-driven optimal set-point control (DDOSC) scheme for nonlinear nonaffine systems bypassing modeling steps. The outer loop of the proposed DDOSC adopts an ideal nonlinear set-point control function which is theoretically achievable to obtain a perfect tracking. Then, a dynamic linearization (DL) is used to transfer the ideal nonlinear set-point control law into a linear parametric one such that it is implementable through a parameter updating law. To address the nonlinear nonaffine system within a data-driven framework, the DL method is again used to obtain its linear data model which is further updated by a parameter-adaptive law. With a proportional feedback controller in the inner loop, the convergence of the DDOSC method is shown. In addition, the results are further extended by considering a proportional-integral-derivative feedback controller in the inner loop. The simulation results on a numerical example and a car suspension system verify the effectiveness of the proposed DDOSC in improving the performance of the local feedback controller.},

Many selection strategies in the existing literatures were emphasized on the individual characteristics of the separate particles rather than the collective features of the whole swarm. In this paper, a novel gBest selection strategy based on a new defined virtual generational distance indicator, which is calculated from a virtual Pareto front fabricated according to the geometry of a given elite archive, is proposed for selecting the most appropriate Pareto optimal solution as the gBest with respect to the comprehensive convergence and diversity contribution to improve the search effectiveness and efficiency of a MOPSO. Besides, an adaptive pBest selection strategy based on the evolutionary state in different iterations is designed for identifying the more suitable pBest from its personal archive for each particle to strengthen the exploitation or exploration ability adaptively. The experimental results show that a MOPSO with the new gBest and pBest selection strategies outperforms ten state-of-the-art competitive algorithms on DTLZ, F, WFG and ZDT series of benchmark problems. In addition, a case study on the site selection for mobile earthquake monitoring stations is also illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the real-world application.},

For object-based movement strategy, each object in the unfavorable region has one particular movement rule, so many objects can be successfully moved but the movement process is complex. Contrarily, for region-based movement strategy, all objects in the unfavorable region use the same movement rule, so the movement process is simple but few objects can be successfully moved. Therefore, to design a movement strategy with lower complexity and higher success movement rate, we propose a movement strategy based on clustering. First, we divide objects in the unfavorable region into several smaller clusters. Second, for each cluster, to define a reference object as its representative, we design four criteria: the highest frequency of global attribute value, the highest frequency of local attribute value, the object with maximum distance, the object with minimum distance. Third, a movement rule is developed for each cluster and the movement rules of all clusters form cluster-based movement strategy. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed movement strategy, we define a utility function. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

However, as the blockchain system is transparent, an adversary can analyze all the public keys or addresses and obtain some real information about users, making the pseudonym mechanism ineffective. CryptoNote V2.0 is the first blockchain system to introduce a one-time address technology to enable the true anonymity of a user. But it does not have rigorous security proof. Moreover, due to application requirements, for one thing, users need anonymity. For another, administrators need to trace the identity of anonymous users. Therefore, a traceable one-time address scheme for the interactive system of digital museum items is proposed to fulfill these concerns. It allows the recipient to receive transactions anonymously, and a supervisor can trace the identity of a user efficiently. Two security models are defined and two corresponding instances are constructed. We prove that our instances are secure in IND-PK-CPA/IND-PK-CCA mode, respectively. Analysis and experiments show that the proposed schemes are effective in tracing the long-term identity of a recipient. Finally, the challenges of user privacy protection are enhanced with the advancement of the integration of digital museum asset interactions with blockchain. We build a blockchain system for Digital Museum assets and implement our two scheme instances in it. The system can integrate museum heritage resources around the world, share data based on blockchain, provide a large number of interactions and collections, and achieve large-scale exhibitions.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is an essential task in machine learning , and learning clustering-friendly representation is crucial for clustering performance. Recently, methods that combine contrastive learning with feature decorrelation have demonstrated their efficacy in learning representation for clustering. However, the feature decorrelation is usually performed in an additional feature space, making the optimization more complex. Moreover, the dimension of this extra feature space is linked to the batch size, but this essential correlation that affects feature decorrelation has been less studied. This paper explores the connection between batch size and feature decorrelation in contrastive learning , then proposes to utilize the linear independence created by contrastive learning with small batch sizes to promote feature decorrelation indirectly. Further, this work introduces bi-vector-based contrastive learning to enable contrastive learning with small batch sizes, which is also of interest to researchers with limited resources. Besides, spectral clustering is utilized to explain the advantage of using linear independence for feature decorrelation and clarify its condition. Experiment results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method against state-of-the-art methods. As for the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our method achieves the clustering accuracy of 88.9\% and 52.1\%, which are 7.4\% and 9.6\% higher than the non-prior SOTA method.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural network (DNN) based multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has been widely studied in many domains. The approach has also been successfully applied to product sales forecasting, which is invaluable in the strategic development of enterprises. However, one key challenge is to efficiently combine all influential factors into a unified framework by considering their long short-term correlations. This is particularly challenging for real time sales predictions with many important features unknown from the perspective of future vision, because of the complex and dynamic changing environment of sales time series. Besides, DNN based methods could not effectively capture stable linear correlations between multivariate sales time series. To address these challenges, a novel Stage future-vision-based multiple Long Short-term model with prior knowledge (SLST-PKNet) is proposed. The model constructs sub-models according to the types of different influential factors, and a stage future vision mechanism is used to model dependent correlations between future influential factors and product sales by combining a two-layer convolutional neural network (TLCNN) and a two-stage LSTM (TSLSTM) into a unified framework. The combination of TLCNN and TSLSTM is the basic component for long short-term modeling, and is an effective solution for capturing dynamic patterns by fusing the outputs from different layers and stages. A dynamic co-integration mechanism (DCI) is introduced to capture strong correlations between time series, which DNN is not good at. In order to further improve the capability of the model to capture long short-term patterns from complex environment, domain prior knowledge (PK) is integrated as supervision information. Extensive experiments are conducted on two sales datasets: Galanz and Cainiao. SLST-PKNet achieves significant performance improvements over 11 state-of-the-art baselines. The proposed model is also evaluated on two new datasets: Traffic and Exchange-Rate, to further verify its generalization capability.

One module is our Spatial–Temporal Similarity Feature module (STSF) newly designed for extracting the spatial–temporal similarity directly. Another module is the spatial–temporal convolution module with an attention mechanism, which can extract spatial–temporal dependence dynamically.

In recent years, neural networks represented by Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Encoder-Decoder (ED) frameworks have been shown to be suitable for prediction of time series data. However, traditional statistical methods cannot capture nonlinear characteristics of the water quality, and deep learning models often suffer from gradient disappearance and gradient explosion problems. This work proposes a hybrid water quality prediction method called SVABEG, which combines a S avitzky-Golay (SG) filter, V ariational Mode Decomposition (VMD), an A ttention mechanism, B iLSTM, an E D structure, and a hybrid algorithm called G enetic Simulated annealing-based Particle Swarm Optimization (GSPSO). SVABEG first adopts the SG filter and VMD to remove noise and deal with nonlinear features in the original time series, respectively. Then, SVABEG combines BiLSTM, the ED structure and the attention mechanism to capture bi-directional long-term correlations, realize dimensionality reduction and extract key information, respectively. Furthermore, SVABEG adopts GSPSO to optimize its hyperparameters.

  abstract     = {Witnessing the growth of inaccurate data with uncertainty and ambiguity, the belief rule base system is attracting increasing research interest because of its usage in decision-making problems as a disjunctive paradigm particularly when there is incomplete information. In this paper, we devise a novel method that employs fuzzy association rules to optimize disjunctive belief rule base (DBRB) systems regarding incomplete information in decision-making and achieve a significant performance improvement compared to the existing ones. First, we devise a method for constructing a fuzzy representation base from history data by using the triangular membership functions to blur history information. Then, a method is proposed to construct association rules based on the fuzzy representation base, in which the association rules are found regarding the missing input information by carrying out reasoning to complete the data and then making decisions on the data filled with DBRB system. Lastly, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method against the public test data set, demonstrating that our method outperforms other baselines for decision-making with incomplete information.},

Such optimization problems were once thought to be hard to solve, but recent advances in optimization have provided efficient solvers including iterative hard thresholding (IHT) with convergence guarantees. In particular, linear (geometric) convergence was shown for strongly smooth and strongly convx loss functions. This means the current methodology and theory do not directly apply to non-smooth loss functions that appear in some popular statistical models. Here we consider non-smooth losses with the quantile check loss and the hinge loss as our examples. The two loss functions are neither strongly smooth nor strongly convex, even for fixed-dimensional problems. We establish the geometric convergence of IHT up to the statistical precision of the model. Some numerical results are presented to illustrate the convergence.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been paid much attention to solve expensive multi-objective problems in recent years. However, with the number of objectives increasing, an improper solution may be picked for expensive objective evaluation due to the accumulation error of approximated values on objective functions. Furthermore, the time to construct surrogate models for all objectives will significantly increase. Thus, in this paper, Gaussian process (GP) models are proposed for performance indicators instead of for objective functions. Furthermore, solutions are selected from either of two ways to be evaluated using the expensive objective function. When there are non-dominated solutions found so far that are approximated, they will be exactly evaluated using the objective function. Otherwise, the solution with the maximum approximation uncertainty among the current population will be evaluated using the real objective functions. The efficiency of the presented approach is validated on the DTLZ test suite with 3, 6, 10, 15, and 20 objectives, MaF benchmark problems with 3, 6, 10, 15, and 20 objectives, and a real-world optimization problem called filter design. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper is competitive compared to recently proposed peer algorithms for expensive many-objective problems.},

Such incompleteness generally disables the traditional multi-view clustering models in practical applications. This paper proposes a Kernelized Graph-based Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (KGIMC) algorithm to overcome this limitation. The key novelty of our model is that its subtasks, e.g. similarity learning, clustering analysis, and kernel completion, are optimized in a mutual reinforcement manner to achieve an overall optimal clustering result as follows: 1) Similarity learning is directed by clustering analysis to construct a graph with as many connected components just as the number of clusters. 2) The well-constructed similarity graph in the last iteration is employed to guide the process of kernel completion. 3) The updated kernels are in turn used to conduct subsequent similarity learning. We extend our model into multi-kernel settings to alleviate the difficulty of kernel selection. We provide an alternating iterative algorithm to solve KGIMC with convergence guaranteed and complexity analyzed. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular datasets, and the results demonstrate that KGIMC outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in general.},

However, developing classifiers capable of explaining how a classification result was derived, in a way that is compatible to the human perception, is still a challenge. Steps towards this direction have been made via interpretable fuzzy classifiers capable of extracting linguistically expressible rules from data. Motivated by the need for interpretable data classification, this study proposes a novel interpretable fuzzy classification framework based on Fuzzy Similarity Phrases (FSPs), aiming to provide an improved tradeoff between interpretability and classification performance. This framework incorporates the following novel components: a) a generic vocabulary-based feature extraction scheme which considers similarity features and fuzzy sets to construct FSPs; b) a rule generation methodology based on FSPs; c) an embedded feature selection methodology targeting to keep both the number of extracted rules and their length low; and an interpretable class prediction mechanism based on the interpretation of the FSPs. The experimental evaluation of the proposed framework on various publicly available datasets, in comparison with well-known and state-of-the-art classifiers, validate that it can provide a better average classification performance with fewer rules.},

Subsequently, consensus reaching and ranking selection are performed based on the proposed unit minimum cost consensus model.

  abstract     = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) has become increasingly popular in driver fatigue monitoring systems. Several decomposition methods have been attempted to analyze the EEG signals that are complex, nonlinear and non-stationary and improve the EEG decoding performance in different applications. However, it remains challenging to extract more distinguishable features from different decomposed components for driver fatigue recognition. In this work, we propose a novel decomposition-based hybrid ensemble convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to enhance the capability of decoding EEG signals. Four decomposition methods are employed to disassemble the EEG signals into components of different complexity. Instead of handcraft features, the CNNs in this framework directly learn from the decomposed components. In addition, a component-specific batch normalization layer is employed to reduce subject variability. Moreover, we employ two ensemble modes to integrate the outputs of all CNNs, comprehensively exploiting the diverse information of the decomposed components. Against the challenging cross-subject driver fatigue recognition task, the models under the framework all showed better performance than the strong baselines. Specifically, the performance of different decomposition methods and ensemble modes was further compared. The results indicated that discrete wavelet transform-based ensemble CNN achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 83.48\% among the compared methods. The proposed framework can be extended to any CNN architecture and be applied to any EEG-related tasks, opening the possibility of extracting more beneficial features from complex EEG data.},

To extend PMORL to distributed settings with privacy protection, we then present the first federated MORL algorithm Fed-PMORL with client-level differential privacy (DP). In Fed-PMORL, personalized actors are trained and maintained at local clients whereas critics are aggregated and sanitized at the central server. Extensive experimental results in benchmark MORL environments demonstrate that Fed-PMORL under DP guarantees can achieve superior performance with high efficiency. In particular, compared with the state-of-the-art methods, PMORL and Fed-PMORL can save up to 50\% 50\% training episodes for achieving the same model utility. With a sufficient number of clients (e.g., 1000 clients), Fed-PMORL with a formal DP guarantee shows utility comparable to that of the non-private algorithm.},

Nevertheless, most of them are based on the classical number-theoretic assumptions and are impossible to resist quantum attacks. Their security is only proven against chosen-keyword attacks and is considered insufficient. Fortunately, ring-LWE and ring-ISIS problems reduced from the worst-case ideal lattices are believed to be post-quantum secure and could be improved computational efficiency in constructions. In this paper, we propose a scalable PAEKS scheme based on ring-LWE and ring-ISIS by adopting the ring analog of lattice algorithms of both digital signature and searchable encryption schemes , in which signature algorithms are used to authenticate ciphertext , making our PAEKS resistant to insider keyword guessing attacks. The scheme is also proved secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks and token privacy attacks. In addition, we extend the PAEKS scheme to conjunctive keywords and multi-user settings to allow for realistic promotion. We finally implement our schemes and compare them with related counterparts, which shows that our constructions are efficient in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge tracing (KT) refers to the issue of predicting learners’ knowledge states based on their learning history and is the core technology for computer-assisted adaptive learning. The latest KT research has improved prediction performance by exploring the relationship between concepts and questions. However, these models have their parameters fixed after training. Without fully or partially re-training, they can only predict all learners’ performance at all time steps using the same set of parameters, making them challenging to adapt to learners’ personal development and individual differences. To address these problems, we take inspiration from synaptic plasticity, the primary neural mechanism conferring biological brains with lifelong learning capabilities, and propose the plastic gating network (PGN) to adapt to variation in learners’ cognition over time and across individuals. At the core of the proposed model are plastic weights, which can constantly evolve after training according to the ongoing inputs and outputs. We adopt plastic weights in calculating gates and cell input in recurrent units, thus allowing the model to develop time- and individual-specific parameters that adapt to learners’ personal development and individual differences after training. Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed PGN outperforms baseline methods in predicting the future performance of learners. Crucially, the PGN exhibits effective adaptation to learners’ personal development and individual differences.},

Consequently, the estimation result is less sensitive to the presence of outliers, as the experiment results attest. However, the algorithm performance is unstable due to the randomness of pixel sampling. To eliminate the instability and boost the detection performance, an ensemble learning method is employed. We repeat modeling background based on random pixel selection, and the detection result is an ensemble of all batches.

  abstract     = {L 1 L1 logistic regression is an efficient classification algorithm. Leveraging on the convexity of the model and the sparsity of L 1 L1 norm, techniques named safe screening rules can help accelerate solvers for high-dimensional data. Recently, Log Sum Penalty (LSP) provides better theoretical guarantees in identifying relevant variables, and sparse logistic regression with LSP has been proposed. However, due to the non-convexity of this model, the training process is time-consuming. Furthermore, the existing safe screening rules cannot be directly applied to accelerate it. To deal with this issue, in this paper, based on the iterative majorization minimization (MM) principle, we construct a novel method that can effectively save training time. To do this, we first design a feature screening strategy for the inner solver and then build another rule to propagate screened features between the iterations of MM. After that, we introduce a modified feature screening strategy to further accelerate the computational speed, which can obtain a smaller safe region thanks to reconstructing the strong global concavity bound. Moreover, our rules can be applied to other non-convex cases. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and security of our algorithm.},

Secondly, the relationship between the FL and mutation operator is founded by using ensemble learning and decision tree , and achieved a classifier named mutation operator selector. Thirdly, the relationship between the FL and algorithm parameters is founded by using a neural network , and then a classifier named parameter selector is achieved. Finally, the improved DE algorithm equip with the two selectors is tested on the CEC2017 benchmark set.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new method for designing matched digital filters with discrete valued coefficients. The fuzzy particle swarm optimization vector quantization (FPSOVQ) has been applied to obtain the optimum codebook in design of matched wavelet function. Abelian group has been used to extract the similarity present in the input voiced signal. Fuzzy particle swarm optimization (FPSO) process is used to find approximate ideal vector quantization (VQ) codebook to be carried out for compression of data. FPSOVQ scheme utilises features of fuzzy inference method (FIM) and expert particle swarm optimization (PSO). The generated codebook consists of set of highly ideal features, which are considered as the filter coefficients. These coefficients are used in the designing of the filter. All of the phonemes in the American English language were included in the 30 sentences that were chosen from the IEEE database. The sentences were originally down-sampled from 25 kHz to 8 kHz. The magnitude responses of each filter have been drawn, which indicates the characteristics of the filter. A comparison has been provided using energy compaction ratio as a parameter to judge the performance of matched designed filter with db4 filter. Experimental results show the advantage of the developed algorithm as the average value of energy compaction ratio for sampled voice signals is 2.8046 times lower for matched designed filter.},

In the case of single additive errors , bit insertion/dropping can occur in the outputs of demodulators which implies long error packets which are hard to correct. To provide highly reliable data transmission, parameters of bit errors exemplified by the length of insertion/dropping and position of bits have to be evaluated but widely used methods for detecting and evaluating bit errors do not yield such parameters. In this paper, two new methods are proposed as a solution to this problem for the estimation of bit error parameters under single additive errors in which the difference between two positions of clock elements in the reference sequence and the received pseudorandom sequence is calculated. The new method, in addition to algorithmic effectiveness and efficiency, makes it also possible to reduce the hardware complexity of devices to be implemented for detecting and estimating the bit error parameters. Specifically, when implemented on a specialized programmable signal processor the new approach yields the computational complexity as ∼200 + 27 T clock cycles.},

In this article, we introduce an analytical framework for the robustness of rank aggregation for malicious disturbances, in which we generate rankings with imperfect information and observe the response of rank aggregation methods. Along with the analytical framework, we propose an experimental data generation method and a new robustness measure . Then we investigate the robustness of five common rank aggregation methods using our proposed method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively compare the robustness of different rank aggregation methods for malicious disturbance.

However, many machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples , including advanced deep neural networks . By making imperceptible modifications to real examples, the prediction will deviate far from the correct value. A deep reinforcement learning-based black-box attacker on the image classification model is introduced in our research. Different from the existing black-box attacks, which require massive queries and trials in the pixel space, the proposed method compresses the images into latent space through variational inference, querying the optimal examples efficiently with actor-critic networks. Rather than patch-to-patch translation with generative adversarial networks in related works, the fake examples are generated by gradually superimposing the perturbations into the latent space at each step through the Markov decision process (MDP) to high stability and good astringency of the attacker. Experiments evaluated on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the proposed attacker can generate adversarial images for most samples in limited steps, greatly reducing the accuracy of the model.},

  abstract     = {The Siamese tracking framework has attracted much attention due to its scalability and efficiency in recent years. However, it is less effective in recognizing arbitrary targets with various variations, especially in complex scenarios with background distractors and illumination variations . To this end, we propose a Siamese Residual Network to formulate the characteristics of a specific given target for visual tracking, consisting of an identity branch and a residual branch. The identity branch consists of a generic offline-trained similarity-matching network, which distinguishes the target from the background at the class level. To complement the identity branch for handling complex scenarios and dramatic target appearance variations, we develop a residual branch learned from the samples of exact target states and online distractors under the guidance of the identity branch. These two branches representing arbitrary targets with both class-level and sample-level features achieve accurate target localizations under complicated scenarios. In addition, we propose an adaptive KL-based scheme for updating the residual branch effectively by avoiding overfitting to a long-retained target appearance. Extensive experimental results on OTB-2013, OTB-2015, VOT2016, VOT-2018, VOT-2019, Temple-Color-128, and LaSOT show that the proposed method performs against state-of-the-art trackers.},

  abstract     = {Optimal scale selection is studied widely at present to obtain scale rules in multi-scale decision tables. However, one limitation of this method is that it cannot directly extract scale rules from single-scale decision tables. In this study, we determine how to generate an optimal scale in two-class dominance decision tables with sequential three-way decision (S3WD). First, we use the variance of each attribute to describe its importance in a single-scale two-class dominance decision table. Then, we arrange all attributes in descending order in accordance with their importance. Second, we examine each attribute by following the aforementioned order. Thereafter, we construct different object granules on the basis of the numerical size of attribute value and different decision values and then expand them individually until their limit is reached. Third, we label and delete objects that are already in the object granules. Then, we continue to construct object granules for the remaining objects by following the preceding method until all the objects are labeled (if the information system is inconsistent, then it should be labeled with ”until it cannot be marked”). In the process above, we adopt the idea of S3WD and successively classify the objects into positive, boundary, and negative regions in accordance with the three states of objects (i.e., object classification has been confirmed, to be confirmed, and cannot be confirmed). We perform experiments on some UCI datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Therefore, multi-attribute group decision-making ( MAGDM MAGDM ) problems have become popular in recent decades, however the development of MAGDM MAGDM problems in the environment of probabilistic linguistic term sets ( PLTSs ) is not mature. To this end, the paper aims to study group consensus under PLTSs . Specifically, since some existing distance measures do not meet the basic principle of distance measures, and some ones can not measure the distance between PLTSs of different lengths, a new distance measure is defined to eliminate these two drawbacks. In the consensus reaching process, most of common orientation rules choose to change all evaluation information of experts, which is actually hard in reality. For the sake of guaranteeing the original information as much as possible with consensus reaching, the attribute discriminant value is proposed via using the idea of sequential three-way decision ( STWD ) (STWD) . Then, an STWD STWD -based group consensus method is constructed under PLTSs , namely PLTS-STWD . Meanwhile, dynamic modification parameters are developed associated with attribute discriminant values. Afterwards, the regret-rejoice function is employed to rank all alternatives. Finally, the constructed method is applied to a realistic case and compared with other consensus methods to verify its effectiveness and feasibility.},

The goal is to mine all itemsets with a utility value, in terms of importance to the user, no less than a predefined threshold value. Setting an appropriate threshold value is not trivial, requiring not only multiple trials but also the know-how in the application field. The advantage of algorithms for mining top- k high utility itemsets is they do not require such a utility threshold, but they suffer from very long runtimes and large memory requirements when large input data is considered. We propose a new genetic algorithm for mining top- k high utility itemsets, named TKHUIM-GA (Top-K High Utility Itemset Mining through Genetic Algorithms). It guides the search process by considering the utility of each item to produce initial solutions and to combine solutions accordingly, reducing the runtime and memory consumption as a result. A highly efficient data representation is utilized to reduce memory usage and runtime. A key advantage of TKHUIM-GA is that it works on positive, negative, integer and real unit utility values unlike existing approaches. Experiments on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the high performance of the proposal regarding the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) is a widely used linear unsupervised dimensionality reduction method, which maps high-dimensional data into low-dimensional subspace through linear transformation . Although various variants of LPP have been proposed to tackle different drawbacks of LPP, it is identified in this article that LPP does not possess the important topological property of translation invariance, that is, the linear transformation given by LPP is strongly related to the relative position between the data and the origin of the coordinate system. In this article, we theoretically analyze the reason why this drawback exists in LPP and propose to resolve it by introducing a kind of centralization to the model. Moreover, as topological properties are prominent information to characterize the structure of the data, this article proposes a further improvement of LPP to maintain topological connectivity of data after dimensionality reduction. Experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets show that the new model incorporating topological properties outperforms not only the original LPP model but also several other classic linear or non-linear dimensionality reduction methods.},

  abstract     = {Two novel distances between categorical time series are introduced. Both of them measure discrepancies between extracted features describing the underlying serial dependence patterns. One distance is based on well-known association measures, namely Cramer’s v and Cohen’s κ κ . The other one relies on the so-called binarization of a categorical process, which indicates the presence of each category by means of a canonical vector. Binarization is used to construct a set of innovative association measures which allow to identify different types of serial dependence. The metrics are used to perform crisp and fuzzy clustering of nominal series. The proposed approaches are able to group together series generated from similar stochastic processes , achieve accurate results with series coming from a broad range of models and are computationally efficient. Extensive simulation studies show that both hard and soft clustering algorithms outperform several alternative procedures proposed in the literature. Two applications involving biological sequences from different species highlight the usefulness of the introduced techniques.},

Compared with existing output-feedback cooperative control results using neural networks , this paper contributes to developing a universal output-feedback synchronized control methodology that uses a connectivity-preserving performance function to ensure both initial network connectivity and preselected synchronization performance with a designable convergence time. To this end, a neural-network-based adaptive observer for each follower is designed to ensure the boundedness of estimation errors of unmeasurable states. Then, local event-triggered synchronized trackers using only relative output information and the connectivity-preserving performance function are constructed to guarantee the closed-loop stability in a low-complexity sense, where no adaptive neural networks and command filters are not required in the local trackers. Finally, a purely academic example and a practical platoon-control problem of multiple uncertain vehicular systems are considered to clarify and verify the proposed connectivity-preserving performance function approach in the simulation.},

In this paper, we propose an efficient and provably secure cloud data sharing scheme ( ABEDS - RR ABEDS-RR ) using ciphertext policy attributed-based encryption. The ABEDS - RR ABEDS-RR scheme needs a semi-trusted proxy party to transform part of the ciphertext with a conversion key. Compared with most existing schemes, when changing the attributes of a user, only the private key and conversion key of the user need to be modified. In order to better adapt to occasions with limited computing capacity, such as ad hoc network , smart sensor , mobile device , the scheme can be extended to the case of outsourcing decryption.

In addition, a novel numerical strategy based on the computation of a normal vector to determine a searching target direction that guides the nondominanted solutions into more propitious regions is also introduced for the first time. IGD and HV metrics are used to evaluate the performance of KHMO algorithm against other competitive multi-objective methods such as MRBFO , FDEA-I, VMEF, BiasMOSaDE and GAMODE tested on ZDT and CEC 2009 problems. Moreover, the Wilcoxon test is carried out as a comparative statistical analysis in order to detect if a significant difference exists with respect to the rest of the algorithms. The corresponding numerical results showed that the introduced KHMO algorithm gains the best overall performance among all the compared algorithms in terms of diversity, coverage and convergence in most problems.

  abstract     = {At present, the excellent performance of support vector machine (SVM) has made it successfully applied in many fields. However, when SVM is used for two-dimensional matrix data classification, vectorization of these data easily leads to dimension curse and the loss of structural information. Moreover, SVM is sensitive to outliers, which causes the hyperplane to move towards outliers. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel classification method for data in matrix-form, named non-parallel bounded support matrix machine (NPBSMM). In NPBSMM, a constraint norm group (CNG) is constructed and applied to objective function, which can not only suppress the negative impact of outliers on the model, but also make NPBSMM has better sparsity. By constructing CNG, the operation of matrix inversion in dual problem of traditional classification methods is avoided, so NPBSMM is more suitable for solving large-scale data problems. Further, to extract structure information of matrix for modeling, multi-rank left and right projection matrices are employed to establish objective function, which makes NPBSMM has a better ability of data fitting. Experiments performed on three roller bearing fault datasets show that the proposed NPBSMM method has powerful performance and robustness as compared with other typical classification methods.},

We propose an anonymous protection mechanism that ensures secure content transmission from multiple sources to one consumer to address both issues. Furthermore, our mechanism enables each anonymously authenticated content consumer to batch verify the authenticity of different types of requested content belonging to different anonymous content producers (sources). To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, we simultaneously consider two-way authentication with consumer anonymity protection for ICN.

First, a generalized regular form of T-S fuzzy descriptor systems is defined. Then the design method of the linear switching function-based fuzzy sliding mode controller is developed and the result obtained indicates a relationship between the design parameter in the switching function and the gain matrix in the controller of T-S fuzzy systems. From this relationship, a new framework of the switching function design for T-S fuzzy descriptor systems is formulated. Moreover, the design method of the fuzzy switching function-based sliding mode controllers is proposed to exemplify the proposed framework. It is shown that the proposed fuzzy switching function-based method is less conservative than the linear switching function-based method from the viewpoint of the solvability of the sliding mode control problems.

  abstract     = {Session-based recommendation is a challenging task, which aims at making recommendation for anonymous users based on in-session data, i.e. short-term interaction data. Most session-based recommendation methods only model user’s preferences with the current session sequence, which ignore rich information from a global perspective. Meanwhile, previous works usually apply GNN to capture the transformation relationship between items, however the graph used in GNN is built through a static mode, which may introduce noise to the graph structure if user’s preferences shift. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Global Structure Enhanced Multi-channel Graph Neural Network (DGS-MGNN) to learn accurate representations of items from multiple perspectives. In DGS-MGNN, we propose a novel GNN model named Multi-channel Graph Neural Network to generate the local, global and consensus graphs dynamically and learn more informative representations of items based on the corresponding graph. Meanwhile, in order to reduce the noise information within sessions, we utilize the graph structure to assist the attention mechanism to filter noisy information within each session, so as to generate an accurate intention representation for the user. Finally, combined with a repeat and explore module, a more accurate prediction probability distribution is generated. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely used datasets, and the results demonstrate that DGS-MGNN is consistently superior to the state-of-the-art baseline models .},

In this study, a novel feature selection method was proposed to select a more relevant and compact feature subset by considering the label distribution and inter-label correlations. First, the concept of label distribution was defined to reflect the significance of each label. Second, a new algorithm for mining association rules was designed to obtain the correlation between labels by improving the existing association rules algorithm. Thus, a new information system was designed by combining the label distribution and correlation between labels. Subsequently, a novel feature selection algorithm was designed in this information system which can effectively remove irrelevant and redundant features in the feature space.

This is a problem for two reasons. Firstly, large feature sets can be computationally expensive, which reduces the playing strength of agents based on them. Secondly, redundancies and correlations between features impair the ability for humans to analyse, interpret, or understand tactics learned by the policies. We look towards decision trees for their ability to perform feature selection, and serve as interpretable models. Previous work on distilling policies into decision trees uses states as inputs, and distributions over the complete action space as outputs. In contrast, we propose and evaluate a variety of decision tree types, which take state-action pairs as inputs, and provide various different types of outputs on a per-action basis. An empirical evaluation over 43 different board games is presented, and two of those games are used as case studies where we attempt to interpret the discovered features.},

Secondly, DPC is sensitive to the cutoff parameter d c dc . For the sake of addressing these issues and improving the performance of DPC, an improved density peaks clustering algorithm based on natural neighbor with a merging strategy (IDPC-NNMS) is proposed. IDPC-NNMS identifies a natural neighbor set of each data to obtain its local density adaptively, which can effectively eliminate the impact of the cutoff parameter on final results. Then, sub-clusters are formed after selecting as many center points as possible and allocating labels to remaining non-center points. These sub-clusters are merged by a novel merging strategy until the end conditions are satisfied.

  abstract     = {Multiple-swarm approach is a quite successful evolutionary computation framework for multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) to solve multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). However, the main challenge of using this framework lies in the lack of leader selection, resulting in the optimal solutions being distributed loosely, as well as far away from the true Pareto-optimal front. To overcome this problem, a multi-swarm MOPSO with an adaptive multiple selection strategy (MOPSO-AMS) is investigated in this paper. This proposed MOPSO-AMS is able to guide each swarm with a suitable leader to improve the evolutionary performance. The novelties and advantages of MOPSO-AMS include the following three aspects. First, a hierarchical evolutionary state detection mechanism, based on the distribution and dominance information of non-dominated solutions, is designed to obtain the evolutionary state of current iteration. Then, the requirements of evolutionary process can be detected. Second, an adaptive multiple selection strategy, using the evolutionary state information and spatial features of candidate solutions, is developed to select leaders of sub-swarms in multiple evolutionary states. Then, suitable leaders can be selected to keep the balance between convergence and diversity. Third, an adaptive parameter adjustment mechanism, based on the dominance relationship of each particle, is introduced to further improve the evolutionary performance of MOPSO-AMS. Finally, numerical simulations and a practical application are used to validate the analytical results and demonstrate the significant improvement of MOPSO-AMS.},

In the proposed algorithm, two clustering based selection strategies, named local indicator selection and local crowding selection, have been devised to appropriately search the space. The local indicator selection is developed to select diverse and well-converged individuals for mating while the local crowding selection strategy is designed to maintain a set of evenly distributed individuals on the Pareto front for next generation of evolution. The proposed method is further enhanced by a clustering based crowding degree strategy, which is introduced to extract a uniformly distributed and convergent solutions as the final output. The performance of proposed algorithm has been evaluated on 31 benchmark problems and compared with related methods. The results clearly show the merits of proposed strategies and the proposed method could significantly outperform related methods to be compared.},

  abstract     = {Recently online intelligent education has caught more and more attention, especially due to the global influence of Covid-19. A major task of intelligent education is Knowledge Tracing (KT) which aims to capture students’ dynamic status based on their historical interaction records and predict their responses to new questions. However, most existing KT methods suffer from the record data sparsity problem. In reality, there are a huge number of questions in the online database and students can only interact with a very small set of these questions. The records of some questions could be extremely sparse, which may significantly degrade the performance of traditional KT methods. Although recent graph neural network (GNN) based KT methods can fuse graph-structured information and improve the representation of questions to some extent, the pairwise structure of GNN neglects the complex high-order and heterogeneous relations among questions. To resolve the above issues, we develop a novel KT model with the heterogeneous hypergraph network (HHN) and propose an attentive mechanism, including intra- and inter-graph attentions, to aggregate neighbors’ information upon HHN. To further enhance the question representation, we supplement the supervised prediction task of KT with an auxiliary self-supervised task, i.e., we additionally generate an augmented view with adaptive data augmentation to implement contrastive learning and exploit the unobserved relations among questions. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant performance improvement compared to some state-of-the-art KT methods.},

In this paper, we propose a new multi-view multi-label learning method by considering the label correlation, which is called ELSMML. Based on the high-order strategy, we construct a crafted label correlation matrix to describe the relationships among labels. We further utilize multi-view learning and dimension reduction to exploit the high-level latent semantic label information and the latent feature information, so as to build a classifier in the low dimensional space. In addition, we apply manifold regularization terms to make the data samples in the low dimensional space have the same intrinsic structure as the original data. After that, we put forward the accelerated proximal gradient method to optimize the ELSMML model and obtain thepredictive classifier. Besides, we conduct convergence analysis and computational complexity analysis for ELSMML method. In the experiments, the ELSMML method can achieve better performance on the evaluation metrics compared with other baselines.},

  abstract     = {The flight operation data sharing not only brings huge benefits to all participants, but also puts forward higher requirements for data security. Consortium blockchain provides a new approach to safely sharing flight operation data in an untrusted environment. Practical Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (PBFT) algorithm is one of the most widely used consensus algorithms in consortium blockchain, but it exists some problems, such as static structure, low consensus efficiency and large communication overhead . To solve these problems, a PBFT with grouping score mechanism and artificial bee colony-optimized consensus process, namely ABC-GSPBFT, is designed to construct the consortium blockchain for sharing flight operation data. Firstly, the artificial bee colony algorithm is used to pre-select a collection of reliable nodes to narrow the scope of consensus. Then, the grouping score mechanism is employed to dynamically update the consensus nodes to further narrow the scope of consensus and enhance the reliability of consensus nodes. Finally, the commit stage of the PBFT algorithm is reasonably simplified to improve consensus efficiency. The actual flight operation data is selected to test and verify the effectiveness of the ABC-GSPBFT algorithm. The analysis and experimental results show that the ABC-GSPBFT algorithm can greatly reduce consensus delay and communication overhead, and improve dynamic performance and consensus efficiency of the flight data sharing. It is an effective method for safely, reliably and efficiently sharing flight data.},

  abstract     = {Predicting urban flow is crucial for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), but it is not easy due to several complicated elements (such as dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, complex spatial dependence, external environment, and so on). Some studies utilize LSTM and 2D CNN networks to analyze temporal and spatial relationships independently, do not fully model spatio-temporal dependence or multiscale spatial dependence among regions. Inspired by the similarity of video analysis, we propose a new pure spatio-temporal model based on 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) to simultaneously capture spatio-temporal features from low-level to high-level layers, and design a grouped 3D multiscale residual strategy to directly and effectively extract multiscale spatial features . Based on these, we propose the S patio- T emporal 3D G rouped M ultiscale R esNet (ST-3DGMR), an end-to-end framework for region-based urban flow prediction. By adaptively integrating closeness and periodic spatio-temporal 3DCNN branches as well as other external factors, the ST-3DGMR can forecast future region-based inflow and outflow. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we use three representative traffic datasets. When compared to state-of-the-art techniques, experimental results show that the ST-3DGMR can lower RMSE by 2.6\%, 6.3\%, and 6.9\% on the BikeNYC, TaxiBJ, and TaxiCQ datasets, respectively.},

Various imbalanced classification models have been proposed.

To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid imbalanced classification model based on data density (HICD). In data-level, the density-based resampling method is presented. The data partition Algorithm is given, which divides the data space into five regions based on the data density. The corresponding subsets are generated by sampling from the divided regions to improve the recognition of different classes of instances. In algorithm-level, we construct the corresponding ensemble models for different classes of instances. In addition, the model selection Algorithm is presented. On this basis, an appropriate model is selected for each instance based on its distribution. The performance of the proposed HICD was evaluated on 18 imbalanced datasets in the real world in terms of recall, the area under the roc curve (AUC), and G-mean. The experimental results validate that our method has better performance than other competitive algorithms in imbalanced classification.},

Existing works learn respondents’ expertise to help estimate qualities of answers. However, in most of these works, the expertise is only learned from the history answers. As a result, structure correlations between question raisers and respondents are usually ignored. Besides, these works lack an efficient way to learn respondent expertise from extensive history answers. To address the limitations, we propose a novel multi-perspective respondent representation learning(MPRR) network. First, our model learns embeddings of raisers and respondents through a heterogeneous information network(HIN) constructed by the answering records in CQA websites. The structure correlations between raisers and respondents are preserved in the learned embeddings. Second, a freezed pre-trained language model is used to learn respondents’ expertise from history answer contents more quickly. Then the multi-perspective respondent representations are generated based on their expertise and the embeddings learned in the HIN. At last, the raisers, respondents, questions, and answers are all considered to compute the matching scores. We evaluate our model on three real-world CQA dataset. Experiment results show that MPRR outperforms all baseline models with three ranking metrics on all datasets.},

  abstract     = {Multi-spectral template matching (MSTM) based object detection approaches can be widely used in robotics and aerospace systems for fine-grained object discovery. However, the performance of existing nearest neighbor search based nonparametric paradigms ( e.g. , correlation coefficient and l p lp -norm) turns out to be unsatisfactory. These paradigms tend to suffer from two defects: 1) they fail to select from the raw features the discriminative ones that can help distinguish between the target and background; 2) the domain shift between the template and search spectra has not been well addressed within the feature space. In this work, we propose a data-driven MSTM method to address these two issues. First, Exemplar-SVM (E-SVM) is applied to execute feature selection and target/background categorization jointly, which is facilitated by its max-margin mechanism. To enable the learning process where the template is regarded as a single positive sample, knowledge transfer is executed to attain negative samples from other domains, e.g. , large-scale public datasets. Then, the hard negative samples are mined to help train a discriminative classifier. Concerning practical applications, we also augment the template with different image degradations and extend E-SVM from the original one-shot learning approach to its few-shot version. Second, a multi-domain adaptation approach via unsupervised multi-domain subspace alignment is proposed to tackle multi-domain shift problem. Here the multiple domains relate to template, search, and negative ones considering both offline learning and online matching. The wide-range experimental results on two multi-spectral datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The tailored dataset and code will be released publicly.},

Existing subgraph isomorphic parallelization methods suffer from redundant sharing or fine-grained parallelism. SLF, a parallel approach for subgraph isomorphism algorithm based on tree-search, is proposed in this paper. In SLF, threads are prevented from sharing tasks blindly by an “Ask for Sharing” mechanism. The “Low-depth Priority Sharing” rule filters out unnecessary sharing, which reduces the number of sharing. The context of shared tasks is represented by embedding, which reduces the time and memory usage of sharing. We prove that the parallelization overhead of SLF is smaller than that of previous method. The experimental results show that SLF achieves higher speedup and efficiency than state-of-the-art parallelization methods.},

And then, a series of operations for Z -numbers using overlap and grouping function are defined, and their properties are also investigated. Subsequently, we construct the overlap function-based Z -number weighted Bonferroni mean (OZWBM) operator to integrate the information in the Z -number environment. Furthermore, to verify the efficiency of novel aggregation techniques, a new energy investment selection issue is addressed. Besides giving the rankings of alternatives, by analyzing the calculation results, we can also derive the degree of preference from investment experts in scoring each investment object. Finally, by comparing the existing methodologies, we confirm that the new approach is effective and reasonable for the multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM).},

According to the “forward” clustering result, isolation-based anomaly detection could achieve the partition of normal domain and abnormal domain, then “reverse” clustering could directly focus on the abnormal domain to pick out those novel clusters using the newly defined novelty validation standard. Further, the defective frame of discernment (FOD) could be completed since the sum of base clusters and novel clusters is the actual target numbers.

In this work, we investigate two unexplored ideas for image captioning using the transformer: 1) an object-focused label attention module (LAM), and 2) a geometrically coherent proposal (GCP) module that focuses on the scale and position of objects to benefit the transformer model by attaining better image perception. These modules demonstrate the enforcement of objects’ relevance in the surrounding environment. Furthermore, they explore the effectiveness of learning an explicit association between vision and language constructs. LAM and GCP tolerate the variation in objects’ class and its association with labels in multi-label classification. The proposed framework, label-attention transformer with geometrically coherent objects (LATGeO), acquires proposals of geometrically coherent objects using a deep neural network (DNN) and generates captions by investigating their relationships using LAM. The module LAM associates the extracted objects classes to the available dictionary using self-attention layers. Object coherence is acquired in the GCP module using the localized ratio of the proposals’ geometrical features. In this study, experimentation results are performed on MSCOCO dataset. The evaluation of LATGeO on MSCOCO advocates that objects’ relevance in surroundings and their visual features binding with geometrically localized ratios and associated labels generate improved and meaningful captions.},

However, they suffer from a cold-start problem when historical interaction is sparse. To carry out cold-start recommendations, many methods assume auxiliary data, such as user/item information and heterogeneous network information, being available. However, considering auxiliary data are not always available in practice, we explore a novel approach, MetaGC-MC, to alleviate cold-start recommendation issues, which can provide more effective cold-start recommendations, regardless of whether auxiliary data is available. MetaGC-MC is based on two emerging techniques, namely, graph convolutional network and meta-learning . In MetaGC-MC, a mechanism of stochastic enclosing subgraph sampling is introduced to randomly sample h -hop enclosing subgraphs as the meta-learning tasks for new users or new items. According to the γ γ -decaying theory, low-hop enclosing subgraphs contain enough information to learn good high-order graph structure information. Without relying on auxiliary data, MetaGC-MC can capture various subgraph structure information under a meta-learning framework, and encode learned information as a meta-prior that makes rapid adaptions in new subgraphs. MetaGC-MC can also take advantage of auxiliary data to enhance model performance. Extensive experimental results in three real-world datasets illustrate that MetaGC-MC is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods for user and item cold-start scenarios.},

In this work, we present FedPOIRec, a privacy-preserving federated learning approach enhanced with features from user social circles to generate top- N POI recommendations. First, the FedPOIRec framework is built on the principle that local data never leave the owner’s device, while a parameter server blindly aggregates the local updates. Second, the local recommender results are personalized by allowing users to exchange their learned parameters, enabling knowledge transfer among friends. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol for integrating the preferences of the user’s friends, after the federated computation, by exploiting the properties of the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) fully homomorphic encryption scheme. To evaluate FedPOIRec, we apply our approach to five real-world datasets using two recommendation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedPOIRec achieves comparable recommendation quality to centralized approaches, while the social integration protocol incurs low computation and communication overhead on the user device.},

In this study, we design a p a r all e l t ransgenera t ional learning-assisted evolutionar y algorithm, called PRETTY, to accelerate the search process using three novel mechanisms. First, we fuse the transgenerational learning mechanism with metaheuristic algorithms to reduce unnecessary fitness evaluations. Then, a Hypervolume-Cauchy (HV-Cauchy) algorithm is proposed to balance population convergence and diversity adaptively. Finally, a parallel-computing framework is proposed to fuse the transgenerational learning mechanism and the HV-Cauchy algorithm into a multipopulation evolutionary algorithm . To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, empirical experiments are conducted on nine benchmarks and four real-world problems, including feature selection, critical node detection, flocking, and neural network training. In terms of execution time, the experimental results demonstrate that PRETTY has significant advantages over several expensive multi-objective algorithms. Furthermore, PRETTY can maintain population diversity and fast convergence while accelerating the computation. In particular, in tackling real-world problems that require expensive fitness calculations, PRETTY can reduce the execution time by more than five times while ensuring high-quality solutions.},

By designing suitable Lyapunov functional with adjustable parameters and combining with inequality techniques, two algebraic criteria are obtained to realize the GPS of the PDIMNNs. Owing to the conservatism caused by the ineluctable inequality scaling, it is worth noting that the controller gains are greater than the actual requirements.

However, traditional GANs is not effective in mining the intrinsic association between samples and data space. Also, the multiple sections and variable scaling ratios of ultrasound images lead to inconsistency among images. The current GAN-based image generation methods cannot obtain the overall anatomical semantic constraints of inconsistent images, thus illogical images are generated. Therefore, a Reference-guided Fuzzy Integral GAN (RFI-GAN) is proposed. First, RFI-GAN implicitly constrains the logicality of the generated images through feature fusion between samples and reference set. These references, a kind of prior knowledge, cover most of the anatomical structures in the dataset. Second, as the general linear fusion takes features as additive and cannot fit the inconsistency of features, we generalize the additivity of features to non-additivity through the Fuzzy Integral, which is used to fusion non-additive measures. Two Fuzzy Integral Modules are proposed to nonlinearly fusion the texture and structure features of ultrasound images under the guidance of references. Finally, we perform experiments on the thyroid ultrasound image dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of RFI-GAN in terms of generation and downstream classification tasks.},

Since pseudo labels are inevitably inaccurate, direct adoption of noisy labels can lead to inappropriate knowledge transfer. Although some previous studies have shown the benefits of using only “reliable” pseudo labels, performance improvement is still limited. In this work, we experimentally analyze how the noise in pseudo labels affects model performance within the self-distillation framework. Motivated by the finding that incorrect pseudo labels with large confidence scores have a significant impact on performance, we propose the overconfidence suppression (OCS) strategy to mitigate the effect of the overconfident pseudo labels, and thus prevent over-fitting of the student model. In addition, a simplified contrast learning method is utilized to fine-tune the feature representation by increasing the separation of the foreground and background snippets. Equipped with the proposed methods, the benefits of pseudo labels can be better exploited and allow the model to achieve state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS’14 and ActivityNet-1.2 benchmarks.},

However, the practical system is frequently disturbed by the external factors, which inevitably leads to unknown disturbances in the solution process. Therefore, addressing the TVCRP with high accuracy in non-ideal environment (unknown disturbances) is the basis of solving the nonlinear dynamic model. In this work, a noise-suppression zeroing neural dynamics (NSZND) model is investigated and developed from the control perspective to resolve the time-varying or time-invariant cube root problem with the different disturbances (bounded and unbounded disturbances) in real/complex domain. Moreover, the generalized noise-suppression zeroing neural dynamics model with various activation functions is discussed and designed for eliminating the interference of different disturbances to improve the precision and noise immunity of the NSZND model. The global/exponential convergence of the developed models with various disturbances are proved by theoretical analyses. With unbounded disturbance (linear noise), the solving accuracy of the NSZND model is about 10 1 and 10 3 times superior to the gradient neural dynamics model and the zeroing neural dynamics model. Finally, the proposed NSZND model is extended to the tensor cube root problem, and the feasibility of the proposed model is verified in this work. Beyong that, different fractals are generated by using the proposed model to solve the cube root problem in the complex domain, which provides an interesting idea for advertising design and computer graphics .},

More specifically, for LModel, we propose a new multi-directional local feature coding (MDLFC) to efficiently extract shallow features from the images, which will be input into the CNN to refine the features further. For the FIModel, we input the original image to the CNN for feature extraction and integrate it with the features extracted by LModel to enhance the feature representation. Surprisingly, compared with traditional CNN, even if FIModel incorporates Lmodel, it is still a lightweight network, which is also suitable for small sample datasets such as finger veins. The proposed system is validated on two publicly available databases and obtains superior performance over other state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {Partition-based clustering methods , such as point center-based and plane center-based clustering techniques , have drawn much attention due to their simplicity and effectiveness in general clustering tasks . However, most of these methods use an unbounded distance during clustering, which may cause their performance to be sensitive to the defined infinite measure, and almost all of them cannot automatically identify halos. To solve these problems, by adopting a locally finite capped l 2 , 1 l2,1 -norm distance in clustering, this paper proposes a novel clustering method named locally finite distance clustering with discriminative information (LFDC). The LFDC effectively solves the above problems and realizes robust clustering by solving a series of eigenvalue problems . We test the effectiveness of the LFDC on a number of different data, including artificial data, benchmark data, and image segmentation data. The experimental results show that the LFDC is more robust than the compared methods.},

We propose a novel algorithmic trading model based on recurrent reinforcement learning , optimized for making consecutive trading signals. This paper elaborates on how temporal features from complex observation are optimally extracted to maximize the expected rewards of the reinforcement learning model. Our model incorporates the hybrid learning loss to allow sequences of hidden features for reinforcement learning to contain the original state’s characteristics fully. The self-attention mechanism is also introduced to our model for learning the temporal importance of the hidden representation series, which helps the reinforcement learning model to be aware of temporal dependence for its decision-making. In this paper, we verify the effectiveness of proposed model using some major market indices and the representative stocks in each sector of S&amp;P500. The augmented structure that we propose has a significant dominance on trading performance.

  abstract     = {Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to classify objects using multi-view data. Many existing MVC methods explore the consensus agreement among views or enhance the complementary features from multiple views in order to improve the clustering quality . However, multi-view data, especially multi-view image data, contains much more complex and meaningful information, which not only describes intrinsic common properties of one object, but also implies rich unique features from different views. Both of them are important and useful for MVC. Though the widely-used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based MVC methods can address these two kinds of information, the qualities of learned representations are not well, which limits the clustering performance. To solve this problem, motivated by the ideas of feature selection and graph regularization , a novel NMF based unified representation learning framework is presented with the integration of two specifically designed graph regularization terms in order to obtain a high-quality representation for multi-view data: An unified NMF based optimization problem is formulated to learn the consensus and complementary representations simultaneously and an alternating optimization algorithm is designed to solve this non-convex optimization problem . Then, these learned representations are efficiently fused to create an integrated graph representation for the final clustering . Extensive experiments on six real image datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with other eleven competitive MVC methods.},

  abstract     = {For imbalanced binary classification , most methods classify data in the original space by balancing data or modifying classification algorithms . However, for datasets with severe overlaps and complex class boundaries, the classification performance is limited by the ability of the classifier to fit the decision boundary. A practical alternative is to map the data to a latent space with lower classification difficulty. In this paper, we propose an imbalanced binary classification method via space mapping using normalizing flows with class discrepancy constraints. The flow-based model is employed to map the original data to a latent space, ensuring the accuracy of the mapping and the authenticity of the mapped distribution. To solve the problem of overlaps and within-class imbalance, class discrepancy constraints, including global and local constraints, are proposed to modify the flow-based model. The former maps different subclusters to the same cluster of the latent space, and the latter increases the separability of different classes. Classification thus can be carried out in the latent space with simpler distribution and high separability to achieve better classification performance. Experimental results on 35 KEEL and UCI public datasets indicate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on F1-measure and G-mean.},

The attack model’s closed form solution is proposed and proven on the attack gradient, and we show that the proposed method based on the identical distribution hypothesis is equivalent to inducing significant changes for training parameters before and after an attack, establishing the equivalence between the hypotheses of identical distribution and parameter discrepancy. Numerical examples validate the attack gradient correctness and equivalence theorem , and experimental results verify the reasonableness of the identical distribution hypothesis and the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {The successful application of modern deep neural network models is deeply influenced by the choice of hyperparameters. As one of the most important hyperparameters, the Learning Rate (LR) needs to be fine-tuned. In order to train models that can perform better, finding a suitable LR schedule quickly has become a pressing problem. Current research often relies on manual use of parallel search methods such as grid search, or serial methods such as Bayesian . However, the variety and number of models and datasets result in a very large LR space, and these methods consume significant resources to find only sub-optimal static LR schedules within a given time frame. It was found that in the currently widely used Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) deep learning , where multiple nodes themselves constitute the population, it is possible to use population algorithms to optimise the searched LR schedule dynamically throughout the training process with little additional training time. To maximise the potential of both the searched LR schedule and the population optimisation of the participating multi-nodes, this paper proposes a Leader Population Learning Rate Schedule (LPLRS) for the DDP deep learning environment, which continuously explores for better learning rates in the neighbourhood of the searched LR schedule and guides the subsequent training process. LPLRS achieves higher model classification accuracy on the Cifar 10&amp;100 test datasets on the state-of-the-art Wide Residual Network with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (WRN(SAM)) model compared to the latest SGDR, CLR, and StepLR learning rate schedules.},

Affinity propagation (AP) is a representative graph-based clustering algorithm in unsupervised learning .

Besides, the clustering performance of the AP algorithm is sensitive to preference. In this paper, an improved affinity propagation based on optimization of preference (APBOP) is proposed for automatic clustering on high-dimensional data. This method is optimized to solve the difficult problem of determining the preference of affinity propagation and the poor clustering effect for non-convex data distribution. First, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding is introduced to reduce the dimensionality of the original data to solve the redundancy problem caused by excessively high dimensionality . Second, an improved hybrid equilibrium optimizer based on the crisscross strategy (HEOC) is proposed to optimize preference selection. HEOC introduces the crisscross strategy to enhance local search and convergence efficiency. The benchmark function experiments indicate that the HEOC algorithm has better accuracy and convergence rate than other swarm intelligence algorithms . Simulation experiments on high-dimensional and real-world datasets show that APBOP has better effectiveness.},

However, DBAs make the tuning decisions by mainly relying on their experiences and intuition. Due to the limitations of the DBAs, the tuning may have an uncertain performance and worse efficiency. In this paper, we observed that an estimator of the graph workload has the potential ability to guarantee the performance of tuning operations. Unfortunately, because of complex characteristics of the graph evaluation task, there exists no mature estimator for graph workload. We formulate the evaluation task of graph workload as a classification task and carefully design the feature engineering process , including graph data features , graph workload features and graph storage features. For this evaluation task, we propose an active auto-estimator (AAE) for the graph workload evaluation by combining the active learning and deep learning . We test the time efficiency and evaluation accuracy of AAE with two open source graph data, LDBC and Freebase.

Local differential privacy (LDP) is a privacy model without relying on trusted third parties. It plays a crucial role in distributed privacy-preserving clustering. Most previous methods focus on partition-based clustering (e.g., k -means), which necessitates many iterative interactions. Massive iterations cause a division of the privacy budget and increase the amount of individual noise, affecting the clustering utility. To address this issue, we turn to grid-based clustering and design the GC-LDP algorithm to balance the privacy and clustering utility with only three rounds of interactions. In GC-LDP, our core contribution is to develop a non-uniform grid division method via the coefficient of variation (CV), which can generate a grid structure approximating the global data distribution within two rounds of interactions. Besides, we designed a new perturbation mechanism to reduce the amount of individual noise injection. Further, a cell aggregation method is developed by exploring the relative density difference among grids to achieve multi-density clustering. Theoretical analysis and experiments on real-world datasets show that GC-LDP can obtain high-quality clustering results while satisfying local differential privacy .},

  abstract     = {In the multi-label classification task, an instance is simultaneously associated with multiple semantic labels. Due to the high complexity of the semantic space in practical applications, obtaining instances with full labels is difficult, leading to the weak-label problem. Existing methods focus on the low-rank and instance manifold regularization assumptions of the label matrix to recover the ground-truth label matrix but ignore the influence that the above assumptions may not hold due to the semantic noise caused by missing labels. To address the problem, this paper proposes a simple and effective method to recover the label space by reconstructing the label semantic space through joint label correlation to solve the multi-label weak-label classification task. Specifically, we leverage the label information consistency and feature-label dependency assumptions to reconstruct the semantic space and consider label correlations to enhance the information of semantic views. Moreover, l 2 , 1 l2,1 -norm is utilized to mitigate the effect of missing label space noise. Additionally, the linear model of the proposed method is expanded to a nonlinear version of the kernel method to address the problem of the inseparability of linear data. Extensive experiments on several real-world tasks show that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Various learning problems can be represented as certain canonical forms of orthogonal matrix nearness problems under the unitarily invariant norm. Since varying unitarily invariant norms favor different structured learning of input data, it is crucial to construct a unified scheme to learn encouraging distributions via any unitarily invariant norm. In this paper, we find that the orthogonal matrix nearness problem can be generalized to a common architecture of the unitarily invariant norm minimization, thus further exploit iterative and closed-form solutions. Firstly, we start with several special circumstances of orthogonal matrix nearness problems, where the unitarily invariant norm resorts to Frobenius norm . Secondly, a general scheme for orthogonal matrix nearness problems under any unitarily invariant norm is addressed and the corresponding iterative algorithm is proposed. Thirdly, feature representation problems are formulated as certain forms of orthogonal matrix nearness, indicating a joint framework for learning low-dimensional features with closed-form solutions. Finally, comprehensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against compared state-of-the-art feature representation approaches. In particular, the proposed method gains about 15\% improvements of clustering accuracy on BASEHOCK, CNAE and RCV1 data sets than benchmarks, and achieves at least 3\% improvements on other data sets.},

  abstract     = {Machine Learning’s influence increases daily, and its application prevails in different, critical, and life-changing fields. However, collecting the needed data is challenging due to the increasing concerns about clients’ privacy. In this context, federated learning addresses privacy issues by adopting an on-device model training strategy while communicating only the model parameters rather than raw data. Such an approach allows for preserving users’ information and shielding them from harm following malicious or suspicious parties’ dissemination of their private information. Nevertheless, the distributed nature of federated learning makes it vulnerable to the weight divergence problem caused by the Non-IID (Non-Independent And Identically Distributed) clients. As a result, we can observe a substantial accuracy reduction and convergence time increase. In this paper, we propose a scheme for federated learning addressing the Non-IID clients while also handling the dynamic evolution of the learning context without sacrificing the clients’ privacy. Our scheme takes advantage of the client’s weights to select a compatible subset with the minimum weight divergence to aggregate the initial global model. Our experiments show that the proposed method can boost the federated learning performance while reducing the convergence time.},

  abstract     = {The class imbalance problem , caused by skewed class distributions, is prevalent in real-world datasets. Generally, classifiers tend to bias toward the majority class, which may cause enormous misclassification costs. SMOTE is a powerful tool for this problem, which achieves a balanced class distribution by generating synthetic minority samples on the line segment between two minority samples. However, it still has some weaknesses, including 1) oversampling less-informative minority samples, 2) generating over-dense synthetic samples, and 3) generating noise. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple convex hull-based SMOTE (CHSMOTE) algorithm to overcome the three weaknesses of SMOTE simultaneously and further alleviate the class imbalance problem. Specifically, CHSMOTE selects the border minority samples as the initial minority samples for oversampling and identifies a sample synthesis area based on the convex hull by checking whether constructed convex hulls contain border majority samples. CHSMOTE can generate more samples with effective information by properly enlarging the generation range of synthetic samples. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm for alleviating the class imbalance problem.},

In particular, we first present a continuous-time temporal heterogeneous neighbour generation algorithm to capture the continuous-time interactions in the context of a specific node type. The algorithm collects temporal heterogeneous neighbours with K -hops of a node at a recent temporal distance. Moreover, it adds a decaying exponential to ensure that the fewer hops and the closer temporal distances, the more nodes are sampled. Thus, it can capture the evolutionary pattern of interactions in the recent past and collect strongly correlated heterogeneous neighbours for each node. Then the proposed relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network is used to learn the most relevant relationship to the target relationship to model the heterogeneous graph neural network for predicting target relationships. Our experimental results on three real-world temporal heterogeneous networks indicate significant advances in prediction accuracy and efficiency compared to the state-of-art approaches.},

Meanwhile,the enormous computational consumption in the consensus process of the blockchain makes it difficult to integrate with IoT closely and exert the great potential of BCoT . latterly, the ”cloud mining” mechanism has been proposed to address these issues, however,some potential problems still exist, such as data privacy and dishonest cloud mining pools, etc. In this paper, we propose a v erifiable and p rivacy- p reserving c loud m ining p ool s election scheme in BCoT ( namely , VPP-CMPS). To obtain a better solution for cloud mining pool selection, we implement an improved time-locked puzzles technique to identify dishonest mining pools and perform the authenticity for mining pool selection.Afterwards,we obtain the privacy protection of the data during the entire selection process by adopting additively homomorphic ElGamal cryptosystem . Meanwhile, considering the resource-constrained case in IoT devices, we use a semi-honest cloud server to cooperate in dealing with the selection procedure, thereby reducing the computational overhead of IoT devices.

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction is an important part of urban computing. Accurate traffic prediction assists the public in planning travel routes and relevant departments in traffic management, thus improving the efficiency of people’s travel. Existing approaches usually use graph neural networks or attention mechanisms to capture the spatial–temporal correlation of traffic data, neglecting to model the spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity in traffic data at a fine-grained level, which leads to biased prediction results. To address the above challenges, we propose a Trend Graph Attention Network (TGAN) to perform traffic prediction tasks. Specifically, we designed a trend spatial attention module, which constructs the spatial graph structure in the form of a trend-to-trend. Its main idea is to transfer information between nodes with similar attributes to solve the problem of spatial heterogeneity. For modeling the long-term temporal dependence, we introduce a trend construction module to build local and global trend blocks and perform aggregation operations between time steps and trend blocks so that each time step shares local and global fields. Lastly, we perform direct interaction between future and historical data to generate multi-step prediction results at once. Experimental results on five datasets for two types of traffic prediction tasks show that TGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline.},

However, mechanisms based on differential privacy and prediction are limited by two key issues: the lack of attention given to the spatial-temporal correlations among the input data leads to poor prediction accuracy, and unreasonable privacy budget allocations cause reduced data utility. A traffic statistics publication mechanism with differential privacy and a spatial-temporal graph attention network (DP-STGAT) is proposed to address these problems. The key components include an adjacency matrix based on equivalent distance, a multistep prediction model based on an STGAT, and a combination of pre-allocation and adaptive allocation method for privacy budget allocation. These three components are tightly integrated to improve the accuracy of forecasting and solve the problem regarding poorly allocated privacy budgets. We evaluate the proposed mechanism with two real-world datasets and compare it with four representative methods with a w-event privacy guarantee.

For personalized recommendation applications, the widely used implicit feedback is kind of incomplete data where only the interaction can be observed while the preference intensity for the interaction cannot be observed. Existing solutions degrade pairwise learning from implicit feedback by setting the preference intensity of each interaction as 1 to learn representations as model parameters. Noisy comparisons consisting of untrustful interactions (e.g. mistaken clicks) may lead to inaccurate optimization of a pairwise learning model. In this paper, we propose a new pairwise learning algorithm to learn personalized ranking from incomplete data where noisy comparisons are widely existed, called BPRAC . As prior knowledge about trustful interactions are not available, we introduce new indicators for measuring interaction trustfulness, which are to be learned together with users’ and items’ representations as model parameters in our BPRAC algorithm. We first derive the distribution of estimated item scores for trustful interactions from pairwise comparisons . The proposed BPRAC algorithm adopts the expectation-and-maximization framework: We estimate indicators using Bayesian inference in the expectation step; while learning representations for personalized ranking in the maximization step. We also analyze the convergence of our learning algorithm. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our estimation of trustful interactions and the superiority of our personalized ranking over peer algorithms.},

To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, termed: Many- Objective PSO with Cooperative Agents (MaOPSO-CA). This exploits an Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) indicator in two innovative ways: firstly, as a leader selection method to select the preferable solution in terms of convergence and diversity, and, secondly, as an archiving method to decide which non-dominated solutions are kept in a bounded archive. The proposed strategy significantly promotes selection pressure toward the Pareto front. The results indicate that the IGD-based selection circumvents the issue of a large ratio of non-dominated solutions that exist in MaOPs . Moreover, a multi-swarm is investigated and modeled as a Multi-Agent System (MAS), so that knowledge sharing among different sub-swarms is easily improved through automated negotiation. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is validated with numerous experimental studies in solving 110 benchmark testing instances with up to twenty objectives. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the application of MaOPSO-CA to a challenging, real-world water resource-management problem is shown to produce very encouraging results, demonstrating its potential as a benchmark resource for the research community.},

  abstract     = {The economic pressures and increasing competition in markets have led to the CEOs of companies being forced to make the right strategic decisions in the development of products for selling the right products to the right customers. To achieve this goal, companies need to know which criteria of their products lead to customer loyalty to that product. In the past, various methods have been introduced to obtain the importance (weight) of criteria that use the opinions of experts or customers. There is a halo effect in human decisions that leads to biases in evaluating the criteria by influencing human emotions. This study introduces a new method for weight assessment of the product loyalty criteria by considering the customer&#39;s decisions halo effect using the convolutional neural network (CNN) called the halo effect using the convolutional neural networks (HECON) method. In the HECON method to consider the halo effect of the customer decisions, a CNN model is proposed as the deep learning pipeline to obtain more accurate weights of the criteria. The HECON method to obtain the weight of the criteria and identify criteria that lead to product loyalty needs to collect the feedback of a large number of customers based on the net promoter score (NPS) scale. The innovation of the HECON method is to obtain the effect level of each product criterion on selection and loyalty to the product through the feedback of a large number of customers by considering the halo effect on the customers&#39; thinking. To date, the analyzing methods have often not been able to identify the halo effect in evaluating the reasons for customer loyalty to the product. The halo effect indicates sometimes some of the product criteria secretly affect the customers&#39; opinions that require deep neural networks to analyze them. By using the deep CNN model of the HECON method to evaluate product criteria for understanding customer behavior, companies will be able to identify customers&#39; behavior and develop their products exactly following the customer&#39;s desires. To evaluate the performance and demonstrate the applicability of the HECON method, presented two case studies. It is presented that there are challenging differences between the results of the HECON method with the other methods because the HECON method considers the halo effect on the customer decisions and demonstrates better performance.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the McGurk effect, studies on multimodal data fusion start with audio-visual speech recognition tasks. Multimodal data fusion research was not popular for a period of time because the capacity of traditional machine learning is limited. Recently, advances in deep learning techniques have provided new opportunities for multimodal data fusion . Powerful deep learning models have the capacity to process high-dimensional and complex multimodal data, and multimodal deep learning has the potential to process multimodal data at the human level. However, there is still a lack of theoretical analytical methods relating data information with model performance. In this work, we propose basic concepts and principles to gain insight into the process of multimodal data fusion from an information theory perspective. We analyze different multimodal data fusion cases, such as redundant, noisy, consistent, and contradictory data fusion. We define the model accuracy upper bound for multimodal tasks and prove that a multimodal model with an extra modal channel can perform better in theory when extra modal data provide more effective information for prediction. We explicitly inspect the latent representation space and analyze the information loss of the representation space transformation in deep learning for the first time. From a naive example to a multimodal deep learning example, we demonstrate the theoretical analysis method for evaluating a multimodal data fusion model, and the experimental results validate the definitions and principles.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, Online Social Network (OSN) is very important in maintaining relationships and disseminating information. Qzone, as one of the most popular OSNs in China, lacks detailed quantitative measurement and analysis. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a large-scale measurement on Qzone. Firstly, we develop a dedicated Qzone Crawler System (Qzone-CS) and collect over a billion user and topology data. Subsequently, we measure user behavior and network topology characteristics by analyzing their posting and interactive behaviors. The results show that: 1) the temporal distribution of user behavior follows the periodic distribution, while user posting behavior follows the segmented power-law distribution. Among all the user behaviors on Qzone, the probability of posting Shuoshuo is the highest. Meanwhile, users prefer to comment on others’ blogs than to forward them. Unlike other OSNs, Qzone is a relatively closed system, which is not conducive to the dissemination of information. 2) Qzone is a small-world and scale-free community; the friendship network has higher clustering characteristic compared with the interactive network; out-degree in the interactive network has an obvious correlation with in-degree; and unlike other OSNs, Qzone is a heterogeneous network . Our results can help researchers better understand the user behavior and network topology characteristics of Qzone.},

The topological index is an important tool in this area that associates a numerical value with a graph structure. It can be interpreted as a real-valued function that represents the physico-chemical information of a chemical compound. One of the most recently reported neighbourhood degree sum-based indices is the neighbourhood inverse sum indeg index ( NI ) (NI) . In this work, we first investigate the application potential of the NI NI index by exploring its predictive potential and isomer discrimination ability. Following that, some fascinating mathematical features of NI NI are revealed. Extremal values of NI NI are estimated for the class of all trees and unicyclic graphs. Furthermore, some crucial upper bounds on NI NI are set up in terms of well-known graph parameters, including graph order,independence number, and vertex connectivity. Associations between NI NI and existing indices are also demonstrated.},

However, most existing ensemble learning methods do not consider the difference between unseen instances, and existing methods that consider such difference fail to effectively explore label correlation, which limits their performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel method named MLDE (Multi-Label classification with Dynamic Ensemble learning). In MLDE, the most competent ensemble of base classifiers is selected and combined to predict each unseen instance. To make dynamic selection specific to multi-label problem and achieve better performance, we combine classification accuracy and ranking loss to serve as the competence measurement for the base classifiers . Specifically, classification accuracy is decomposable to multiple labels and distinguishes the ability difference of a classifier with respect to different labels, while ranking loss focuses on the overall performance of a classifier on the label set and thus fully considers the correlation between multiple labels. Extensive experiments on 24 publicly available datasets demonstrate that MLDE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

The proposed “transport-based measure” provides an objective, interval-valued comparison index that represents the range of compatibility between two soft clusterings. We study the metric and complexity properties of the proposed approach, as well as its relationship with other existing proposals. We also propose approximation and bounding algorithms that make the approach practical for large datasets.

Regarding a TKG as a static knowledge graph when ignoring the time dimension, TASTER first learns global embeddings based on this static knowledge graph to capture global information. To capture the local information in a specific timestamp, TASTER evolves local embeddings from global embeddings based on the corresponding subgraph. Besides, TASTER learns evolving entity embeddings through sparse transformation matrices , which could better adapt to TKGs with a varied number of subgraphs. We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets, and TASTER outperforms most existing models on the link prediction task of TKGs, which validates the its effectiveness.},

As opposed to traditional single-view document modeling, which treats each document independently and learns each document as a single topic representation, the views of multi-view text documents have complicated correlation relationships that include both the global and local underlying topical information. In this study, we introduce a deep generative model for multi-view document modeling known as H ierarchical V ariational A uto- E ncoder (HVAE), which combines the advantages of the probability generative model for learning interpretable latent information and the deep neural network for efficient parameter inference. Specifically, a set of hierarchical topic representations is learned for each multi-view document to capture the document-level global topical information and view-level local topical information for each view. A two-level hierarchical topic inference network is investigated as the encoder network of HVAE, which is designed using an aligned variational auto-encoder, to learn the hierarchical topic representations. Subsequently, multi-view documents are generated through a two-layered generation network, considering both the view-level local and document-level global topic representations. Experiments on three real datasets of different scales for various tasks demonstrate the satisfactory results of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The automatic segmentation of COVID-19 pneumonia from a computerized tomography (CT) scan has become a major interest for scholars in developing a powerful diagnostic framework in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Federated deep learning (FDL) is considered a promising approach for efficient and cooperative training from multi-institutional image data. However, the nonindependent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data from health care remain a remarkable challenge, limiting the applicability of FDL in the real world. The variability in features incurred by different scanning protocols, scanners, or acquisition parameters produces the learning drift phenomena during the training, which impairs both the training speed and segmentation performance of the model. This paper proposes a novel FDL approach for reliable and efficient multi-institutional COVID-19 segmentation, called MIC-Net. MIC-Net consists of three main building modules: the down-sampler, context enrichment (CE) module, and up-sampler. The down-sampler was designed to effectively learn both local and global representations from input CT scans by combining the advantages of lightweight convolutional and attention modules. The contextual enrichment (CE) module is introduced to enable the network to capture the contextual representation that can be later exploited to enrich the semantic knowledge of the up-sampler through skip connections. To further tackle the inter-site heterogeneity within the model, the approach uses an adaptive and switchable normalization (ASN) to adaptively choose the best normalization strategy according to the underlying data. A novel federated periodic selection protocol (FED-PCS) is proposed to fairly select the training participants according to their resource state, data quality, and loss of a local model. The results of an experimental evaluation of MIC-Net on three publicly available data sets show its robust performance, with an average dice score of 88.90\% and an average surface dice of 87.53\%.},

First, MPP-SMOTE removes noisy samples from minority classes. Subsequently, it divides minority samples into two types (hard-to-learn and easy-to-learn) by predicting the probability of samples belonging to the minority class. For both sample types, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy. We separately calculate the probability of each sample being selected to generate a new synthetic sample. The relative density of a sample in both the majority and minority classes is considered in the method for calculating the selection probability of hard-to-learn samples, and the relative density of a sample in only the minority class is considered in that of easy-to-learn samples. Finally, according to the types and selection probabilities, MPP-SMOTE separately selects samples and generates synthetic samples based on them by using different sample-generation schemes. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms other oversampling methods in terms of three imbalanced-learning metrics for three common classifiers. According to the results, when a support vector machine classifier is applied, the area under the curve performance of the MPP-SMOTE improves by a factor of 1.44\%.},

Specifically, when the commission fee rate is relatively high (low), the e-retailer shares information with no (both) supplier (s) and both suppliers will choose reselling (agency selling) mode; when the commission fee rate is neither too high nor too low, the e-retailer’s information sharing strategy is also related to demand uncertainty and competition intensity.

However, in complex evidence theory , which based on complex number field, negation is still an open problem. In order to deal with some problems like those in D-S theory, a new negation method for CBBA (Complex Basic Belief Assignment) should be proposed. In this paper, a new negation method called CBBA exponential negation will be presented, which can be seen as a generalization from BBA (Basic Belief Assignment) to CBBA. This proposed negation transforms a CBBA to another one with the entropy increased simultaneously. Also, some properties of this negation will be discussed such as invariance, convergence, fixed point, distribution of Pascal triangle , convergence speed, impact on negation convergence and so on. Besides, most among them will be strictly proved in this paper. Furthermore, a new entropy for CBBA and some numerical examples will be presented, and we will study the proposed negation from the view of entropy.

Our approach comprises four well-defined stages that can be applied to any structured pattern classification problem. Firstly, we pre-process the given dataset by imputing missing values and normalizing the numerical features. Secondly, we transform numerical features into symbolic ones using fuzzy clustering such that extracted fuzzy clusters are mapped to an ordered set of predefined symbols. Thirdly, we encode instances as a Prolog rule using the nominal values, the predefined symbols, the decision classes, and the confidence values. Fourthly, we compute the overall confidence of each Prolog rule using fuzzy-rough set theory to handle the uncertainty caused by transforming numerical quantities into symbols. This step comes with an additional theoretical contribution to a new similarity function to compare the previously defined Prolog rules involving confidence values. Finally, we implement a chatbot as a proxy between humans and the Prolog-based reasoning module to resolve natural language queries and generate counterfactual explanations.

Then, a finite-time adaptive fault tolerant controller is developed to resolve the heterogeneous target tracking problem in the presence of actuator faults . The tracking errors can converge within finite time. The proposed controller is fully distributed, thereby no longer requiring the system matrix of the target and actuator fault rates of the tracking agents. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed strategies and the correctness of achieved stability conditions are verified by some numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This article is intended to solve the systems of inverse fuzzy relational equations with max–min composition, which is beneficial for solving the well-known problems of fuzzy abductive/backward reasoning. Almost all the existing methods are based on numerical algorithms, and either cannot find the globally optimal solutions or consume significant computational cost to acquire the most accurate result. Due to these drawbacks, the existing methods seem not to render the retroduction applying inverse fuzzy relation popular in many real-time expert systems such as intelligent diagnosis. It is well known that the system of inverse fuzzy relational equations is not always consistent. In this case, according to the preselected weights, we employ weighted L 1 L1 norm distances to define a variety of best approximate solutions. Then we show that there exist very straightforward algebraic formulae for finding the best approximate solutions. The proposed approach not only finds the globally optimal solutions , but also has the advantage of being computationally very simple and efficient, and hence it has a lot of potentials to perform real-time abductive reasoning in many expert systems.},

In this paper, the non-smooth reaction–diffusion system with considering the encouraging effect of secondary propagation of Internet platform on rumor propagation is used to study the dynamic system of rumor propagation. Firstly, the existence of the non-negative solution is proved by using the theory of upper and lower solutions for mixed monotone system.

  abstract     = {Online social networking platforms have drastically facilitated the phenomenon of information cascades, making cascade prediction an important task for both researchers and practitioners. In cascade propagation paths, influential users can often attract more attention. Moreover, the community structure formed by users with similar interests creates information redundancy, thereby restricting the propagation process. These two features greatly affect the growth of the cascades. This paper investigates the incremental prediction of cascades during a future time period based on the evolution of cascades in early stages and proposes a neural network framework with hierarchical attention mechanisms , named Hierarchical Attention Cascade Neural Network (CasHAN). This network has a node-level attention mechanism based on user influence and a sequence-level attention mechanism based on community redundancy. User influence considers the user’s own attributes and the influence feedback provided by neighbors, while community redundancy measures information redundancy characteristics that limit cascade propagation. Through hierarchical attention mechanisms, the effective combination of these two features improves the accuracy of cascade increment prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art prediction methods.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection wrapper methods are powerful mechanisms for reducing the complexity of prediction models while preserving and even improving their precision. Meta-heuristic methods, such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithms , are commonly used as search strategies in feature selection wrapper methods since they allow minimizing the cardinality of the attribute subset and simultaneously maximizing the predictive capacity of the model. However, in high-dimensional problems, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for wrapper-type feature selection may require excessive computational time, sometimes impractical, especially when the learning algorithm has a high computational cost, such as deep learning . To address this drawback, in this paper we propose a multi-surrogate assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for feature selection, specially designed to improve generalization error . The proposed method has been compared with conventional feature selection wrapper methods that use random forest , support vector machine and long short-term memory learning algorithms to evaluate subsets of attributes. The experiments have been carried out with regression and classification problems with time series data for air quality forecasting in the south-east of Spain and for indoor temperature forecasting in a domotic house. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed multi-surrogate assisted method over conventional wrapper methods using the same run times.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) have excelled at learning to represent heterogeneous information networks (HINs). However, there are the following limitations in heterogeneous information networks representations: (1) existing models rely on pre-defined substructure sets, such as metapaths, in which the number of nodes is primarily determined based on experience; (2) except for a few simple pairwise relations, most models fail to capture multifaceted graph structures and commonly result in semantic redundancy. To tackle the aforementioned problems, in this study, we propose a He terogeneous G raphlets-guided Network E mbedding framework via E ulerian-trail-based R epresentation ( HeGEER ) for capturing complex structural characteristics automatically and efficiently. HeGEER first explores frequent heterogeneous graphlets through a random-algorithm-based method without any artificial pre-definition. Then, HeGEER conducts a Jaccard-coefficients-based sorting to reduce the semantical redundancy of derived heterogeneous graphlets, and transforms these heterogeneous graphlets into corresponding Eulerian-trails to preserve the entire relation information. The node embeddings are then generated by aggregating representations of intro- and inter- heterogeneous graphlets using a heterogeneous graph dual-attention mechanism. On various benchmark datasets, comprehensive experiments are undertaken on tasks including node classification and link prediction. The experimental results are thoroughly analyzed to illustrate HeGEER’s improved performance compared to several typical models.},

The vehicle motion features, map constraints, traffic flow density, and vehicle interactions are comprehensively considered in the generator, and a graph query mechanism is proposed to realize the reuse of the global map. In the discriminator , in addition to considering the authenticity of a generated trajectory and whether it is consistent with the historical trajectory, additional map information is introduced to establish a matching model between the generated trajectory and the current map. Experiments based on the Argoverse and nuScenes dataset are subsequently performed.

  abstract     = {Various companies have developed electric vehicle (EV)-based multiple fuel supply system modeling approaches (FSSMAs). Nonetheless, no superior approach concurrently satisfies all essential criteria, including ‘sustainability’ and ‘fuel consideration’ criteria. Furthermore, benchmarking the FSSMA alternatives to determine the most sustainable ones does not come without issues. The five main most common concerns are the use of various evaluation criteria, effecting the weights of the criteria with sublayers, criteria prioritization, trade-offs among the criteria, and data variations. Thus, this study proposes a novel FSSMA for EV benchmarking based on two methods—the Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets and fuzzy weighted zero inconsistency (PPH–FWZIC) and the measurement of alternatives and ranking according to the compromise solution (MARCOS)—which are integrated as a single method. The PPM–FWZIC method was developed to solve the criteria prioritization issue, while the MARCOS method was developed to solve the various evaluation criteria, trade-offs among the criteria, and data variation issues to benchmark the FSSMA for EV alternatives. The integrated multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) method allows the system to perform a backward scoring process (BSP) and derive a scoring decision matrix from the formulated decision matrices that are performed based on the feed-forward data presentation (FFDP) procedure to solve the multiple criteria layers that affect the proper assessment of the impact of a certain criterion and its subcriteria in the weighting purpose issues. Subsequently, the FSSMAs for EVs are benchmarked, and the most sustainable approach is selected. The results were tested via sensitivity analysis and the Spearman correlation coefficient. The present study is also compared with a benchmark study based on a benchmarking checklist.},

Numerical results illustrate the proposed method has a superiority ranging from 8.60\% to 32.58\% to conventional models on ADD performance, verifying the feasibility and effectiveness the proposed methods via granular data descriptors.

  abstract     = {Telemedicine provides remote online services for digital diagnosis and treatment via the Internet. However, there is a risk of data leakage during transmission. Therefore, data protection is an important challenge for telemedicine. Chaos is widely used in image, audio, and EEG encryption because of its unique characteristics of unpredictability, nonlinearity, and sensitivity to an initial state. However, some chaotic maps have various security issues. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a K-sine-transform-based coupled chaotic system (K-STBCCS), combining any two one-dimensional chaotic mappings to generate a new chaos mapping. To demonstrate the reliability of the system, this paper generates three new chaotic mappings using K-STBCCS and analyzes their performance. Using the chaotic mapping generated by K-STBCCS, this paper further proposes an EEG signal encryption scheme based on the confusion-diffusion principle. The purpose of confusion is to separate adjacent EEG signals, while the purpose of diffusion is to change the value of EEG signals. Among them, the diffusion operation uses positive and negative diffusion to reduce the correlation between the ciphertext and the original signals. The experimental results and security analysis show that the proposed EEG signal encryption scheme performs well and passes the rigorous cryptographic security test.},

Firstly, an innovative CS function is explored, and the local state error information of the agents can be redefined. Furthermore, we propose a novel strategy iteration method to approximate the agent’s optimal control policy. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm’s convergence analysis is presented, which is based on the Lyapunov stability and functional theorem. In the implementation of a data-based control policy, a network structure of actor-critic (AC) is designed. To improve the robustness of the control policy, the target network and experience replay (ER) are introduced in the training process.

  abstract     = {Complex systems are composed of multiple types of interactions, where each type of interaction is encoded in a layer, resulting in multi-layer networks. Detecting layer-specific modules in multi-layer networks are for revealing the functions and structure of systems. However, current algorithms are criticized for failing to quantify and balance the specificity and connectivity of communities in multi-layer networks, resulting in undesirable performance. To address these problems, we propose a joint L earning S pecific and C onserved features for C lustering in multi-layer networks (called LSCC ), where features of vertices simultaneously characterize the shared and layer-specific structure of networks. Specifically, LSCC jointly factorizes multi-layer networks by projecting all layers into a common subspace with nonnegative matrix factorization , where the structure of various layers is represented. Then, LSCC decomposes features of vertices into the conserved and specific parts, where the specificity of vertices of each layer is explicitly quantified. To balance the specificity and connectivity of modules, LSCC joint learns feature extraction and subspace clustering, which is formulated as an optimization problem . The experimental results on 8 datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the baselines on various measurements.},

  abstract     = {Community detection is one of the most important and interesting issues in social network analysis. Most of the current community detection algorithms tend to find communities in social networks with just considering the topological structures of the networks. In recent years, simultaneously considering of nodes’ attributes and topological structures of social networks in the process of community detection has attracted the attentions of many scholars, and this consideration has been recently used in some community detection methods to increase their efficiencies and to enhance their performances in finding meaningful and relevant communities. But the problem is that most of these methods tend to find non-overlapping communities, while many real-world networks include communities that often overlap to some extent. In order to solve this problem, an evolutionary algorithm called MOBBO-OCD, which is based on multi-objective biogeography-based optimization (BBO), is proposed in this paper to automatically find overlapping communities in a social network with node attributes with synchronously considering the density of connections and the similarity of nodes’ attributes in the network. In MOBBO-OCD, an extended locus-based adjacency representation called OLAR is introduced to encode and decode overlapping communities. Based on OLAR, a rank-based migration operator along with a novel two-phase mutation strategy and a new double-point crossover are used in the evolution process of MOBBO-OCD to effectively lead the population into the evolution path. In order to assess the performance of MOBBO-OCD, a new metric called alpha_SAEM is proposed in this paper, which is able to evaluate the goodness of both overlapping and non-overlapping partitions with considering the two aspects of node attributes and linkage structure. Quantitative evaluations, based on three extensive experiments on 14 real-life data sets with diverse characteristics, reveal that MOBBO-OCD achieves favorable results which are quite superior to the results of 15 relevant community detection algorithms in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In the era of big data, the data in many business scenarios are characterized by a small number of labelled samples and a large number of unlabelled samples . It is quite difficult to classify and identify such data and provide effective decision support for a business. A commonly employed processing method in this kind of data scenario is the disagreement-based semisupervised learning method, i.e., exchanging high-confidence samples among multiple models as pseudolabel samples to improve each model’s classification performance. As such pseudolabel samples inevitably contain label noise, they may interfere with the subsequent model learning and damage the robustness of the ensemble model. To solve this problem, a semisupervised classification algorithm based on noise learning theory and a disagreement cotraining framework is proposed. In this model, first, the probably approximately correct (PAC) estimation theory under label noise conditions is applied, the relationship between the label noise level and model robust estimation in the process of multiround cotraining is discussed, and a disagreement elimination algorithm framework based on multiple-model (feature argument and select (FANS) algorithm and L1 penalized logistics regression (PLR) algorithm) cotraining is constructed based on this theoretical relationship. The experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper gives not only a high-confidence sample set that meets the upper bound constraint of the label noise level but also a robust ensemble model capable of resisting sampling bias. The work performed in this paper provides a new research perspective for semisupervised learning theory based on disagreement.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing promises to improve the information processing power to levels unreachable by classical computation. Quantum walks are heading the development of quantum algorithms for searching information on graphs more efficiently than their classical counterparts. A quantum-walk-based algorithm standing out in the literature is the lackadaisical quantum walk. The lackadaisical quantum walk is an algorithm developed to search graph structures whose vertices have a self-loop of weight l l . This paper addresses several issues related to applying the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for multiple solutions on grids successfully. Firstly, we show that only one of the two stopping conditions found in the literature is suitable for simulations. In the most discrepant case shown here, a stopping condition is prematurely satisfied at the step T = 288 T=288 with a success probability Pr = 0.593276 Pr=0.593276 , while the suitable condition captures the actual amplification that occurred until T = 409 T=409 with Pr = 0.878178 Pr=0.878178 . We also demonstrate that the final success probability depends on both the space density of solutions and the relative distance between solutions. For instance, we show here that decreases in the density of solutions can even take a success probability of 0.849178 0.849178 to 0.961896 0.961896 . In contrast, increases in the relative distances can even take a success probability of 0.871665 0.871665 to 0.940301 0.940301 . Furthermore, this work generalizes the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for multiple solutions on grids of arbitrary dimensions. In addition, we propose an optimal adjustment of the self-loop weight l l for such d d -dimensional grids. It turns out other fits of l l found in the literature are particular cases. Our experiments demonstrate that successful searches for multiple solutions with higher than two dimensions are possible by achieving success probabilities such as 0.999979 0.999979 , with the value of l l proposed here, where it would be 0.637346 0.637346 , with the value of l l proposed in previous works. Finally, we observe a two-to-one relation between the steps of the lackadaisical quantum walk and Grover’s algorithm, which requires modifications in the stopping condition. That modified stopping condition can escape intermediary fluctuations that would produce premature stops at T = 6 T=6 with Pr = 0.000878 Pr=0.000878 where the system can evolve until T = 354 T=354 with Pr = 0.99999 Pr=0.99999 , as an example that we show here. In conclusion, this work deals with practical issues one should consider when applying the lackadaisical quantum walk, besides expanding the technique to a broader range of search problems.},

However, a high-dimensional short-term time series still contains rich dynamical information and is increasingly available in many fields. In this work, we exploit a spatiotemporal information (STI) scheme that transforms high-dimensional/spatial information into temporal information and develop a new method called multitask Gaussian process regression machine (MT-GPRM) to achieve accurate predictions from short-term time series. We first construct a specific multitask GPR comprising multiple linked STI mappings to transform high-dimensional/spatial information into temporal/dynamical information of any given target variable and then make multistep-ahead predictions of the target variable by solving those STI mappings. The multistep-ahead prediction results on various synthetic and real-world datasets show that MT-GPRM outperforms other existing approaches.},

In this paper, an event-triggered sampling strategy is designed for the formation control of T-S fuzzy systems, which allows the fuzzy controller and the fuzzy model not to share the same membership functions. The control strategy reduces the transmission frequency of sampling states by setting event conditions for information transmission. By means of Lyapunov stability theory , a set of formation conditions based on LMI is established. Less conservative and more efficient conditions are also obtained based on the properties of membership functions.

Following this trend, this paper develops a novel LSGDM consensus model that explores and manages the meso -scale structure among experts using free texts to express their opinions under social network settings. In the proposed approach, firstly the sentiment analysis is adopted to extract preferences over alternatives provided by experts and the preferences are further converted into distributed linguistic preference relation matrices. Then a core-periphery detection method for the social network constructed based on the newly defined distance measure for linguistic distribution assessments is proposed. After that, expert weights are derived by an optimization model that maximizes the expert reliability based on consistency and node centrality. Moreover, considering reference dependence and bounded rationality features of members among the detected network, a prospect theory-based two-stage consensus model is developed to improve group consensus systematically and gradually. Finally, a case study regarding life science investments is provided to illustrate the usefulness of our proposal. The convergence of the proposed model is proven by theoretical and simulation analysis. Comparative analysis reveals the features and advantages of our model.},

  abstract     = {It has been a long-standing goal in natural language processing (NLP) to learn a general linguistic intelligence model that can perform well on many different NLP tasks continually evolving over time while avoiding revisiting all previous data at each stage. Most existing deep neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting when dealing with sequential tasks in an incremental way, leading to dramatic performance degradation due to the missing training data of old tasks. In this paper, we propose a Lifelong language method with Adaptive Uncertainty Regularization (LAUR), which can adapt a single BERT model to work with continuously arriving text examples from different NLP tasks. Specifically, LAUR is built on the Bayesian online learning framework, and three uncertainty regularization terms are devised to collaboratively control the parameters so as to resolve the stability-plasticity dilemma in lifelong language learning. The previous posterior constrain parameters that strongly determine the output results, preventing these parameters from changing drastically, while other parameters are encouraged to be updated over time. In addition, we propose a task-specific residual adaptation module in parallel to each layer of BERT to endow LAUR with the capacity to learn better task-specific knowledge. This configuration makes LAUR less prone to losing the knowledge stored in the base BERT network when learning a new task. Experimental results show that LAUR outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning models on a variety of NLP tasks.

Recently, a novel EMO framework has been developed to solve this issue by storing all the non-dominated solutions generated during the evolution in an archive, and selecting a subset of solutions from the archive as the output. The key component of this framework is the subset selection from the archive, which typically stores a large number of candidate solutions. However, most relevant studies have focused on small candidate solution sets for environmental selection. There is no benchmark test suite for large-scale subset selection . This study aims to fill this research gap by proposing a benchmark test suite for large-scale subset selection, and providing a comparison between several representative subset selection algorithms using the proposed test suite. The proposed test suite together with the benchmarking studies provides a baseline for researchers to understand, use, compare, and develop large-scale subset selection algorithms in the EMO field.},

The study aims to help planning authorities find the most sustainable route for petroleum transportation by introducing both practical and methodological evaluation frameworks for solving this global problem. Firstly, twelve key decision-making criteria were elaborated to provide a practical framework for the authorities. Secondly, we introduced an advanced decision-making tool based on the integration of the Indifference Threshold-based Attribute Ratio Analysis (ITARA) method and the Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method under the type-2 neutrosophic number (T2NN) environment. The T2NN-ITARA method was formulated to determine the semi-objective importance of the key decision-making criteria. The T2NN-EDAS method was developed to rank alternative routes and reveal the most sustainable solution. This research offers real-world guidelines for selecting the most sustainable transportation route for petroleum derivatives using a case study of the city of Belgrade. It is recommended to direct dangerous goods vehicles towards the outskirts of the city. Finally, the introduced T2NN-ITARA-EDAS model can be used to solve other complex MCDM problems.},

Considering the few characters of outliers, a relative granular ratio factor is consequently created to measure the size of a neighborhood in which an object belongs. Since outliers always differ from the majority of objects, a granule-based majority set is defined. Then, a valid outlier factor is determined by the feature of a negative region to measure the difference between outliers and the majority set. Finally, a ratio and negative region detection factor (RNRD) is constructed by combining the above factors under a wide range of relations. In addition, the RNRD-based outlier detection (RNROD) algorithm is designed.

  abstract     = {Currently, labelling a large number of images is still a very challenging task. To tackle the problem of unlabelled data , unsupervised learning has been proposed. Among many unsupervised learning algorithms, K-means is the most popular algorithm. However, in a low-dimensional space, fuzzy c-means, which is more robust and less sensitive to initialization, has several advantages over K-means clustering. On the other hand, stacked convolutional pooling structures and manifold representation play pivotal roles in image clustering. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised multilayer fuzzy neural network for image clustering that unifies fuzzy systems, multilayer convolutional structures and manifold representation. The main contributions are as follows. First, we extend fuzzy systems to unsupervised tasks by introducing manifold representation, which expands the applications of fuzzy systems. Next, we propose the idea of using only a small number of attributes to compute firing strengths . This is implemented to prevent the firing strengths from falling to zero. Finally, randomly generated convolutional weights are used to extract features, which is a good choice for data without labels. It is demonstrated on a wide range of image datasets that the proposed approach is competitive with existing fuzzy and nonfuzzy clustering algorithms .},

UMOEAs-II, an improved version of UMOEAs, uses three differential evolution variants as multi-operator differential evolution (MODE), and CMA-ES. In this study, we further reform UMOEAs-II using an improved SHADE-cnEpSin that employs a novel adaptive strategy of scaling factor F , a crossover rate cr i , j cri,j updating mechanism which can calculate crossover rate for the i th ith individual with a particular j th jth component, an improved rank-based selective pressure based mutation strategy, and nonlinear population size reduction along with sequential quadratic programming method. The effectiveness of the improved rank-based selective pressure based mutation strategy, nonlinear population size reduction, and sequential quadratic programming are evident from the individual validations. The novel framework, enhanced the exploration and exploitation abilities, is named UMOEAs-III and is evaluated using the CEC2017 benchmark functions . The experiments are tested on 10, 30, 50, and 100 dimensions. The experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of UMOEAs-III in both low and high-dimensional tests compared to the state-of-the-art DE-based variants and hybrid algorithms.},

First, the existing neural network model is improved to obtain a new bidirectional activation (BA) neural network, to establish a many-to-one mapping relationship between the key and the chaotic initial value, to hide the original key of the cloud encryption system , and to improve the security and randomness of the key system.

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a popular stochastic algorithm for solving nonlinear optimization problems . It has been used in various industrial applications because of its few parameters and ease of implementation. Various optimal problems must be frequently formed as nonlinear constrained optimization (NCO) problems because of global resource limitations. These problem-specific nonlinear constraints can result in many infeasible regions in the search space. Current PSO-based approaches are inherently designed for unconstrained optimization problems and cannot directly handle the constraint issue; therefore, they add the constraint handling technique (CHT) to account for NCO problems. This study proposes a double-track schema inside PSO called double-track PSO (DTPSO) to address the NCO problem. When an infeasible region blocks a particle, the DTPSO creates a copy of the particle. The original and copied particles utilize different search strategies to move to feasible and infeasible regions. The results indicate that the proposed DTPSO outperforms the seven referenced PSO-based methods in all 33 NCO problems and five recent strong methods in 19 mechanical design problems belonging to the IEEE CEC 2020 competition on real-world single-objective constrained optimization problems. Furthermore, the experiment results demonstrate the quality of the solution and the effective computation of the proposed DTPSO.},

Forecasting techniques from previous research were mainly developed using single-frequency-based time series modeling , which has recently become a popular approach. Although mixed-frequency-based modeling has significant potential, research applying this approach to wind speed forecasting is almost nonexistent. To fill this research gap, we developed an innovative ensemble system based on mixed frequency modeling to perform wind speed point and interval forecasting, comprising data preprocessing , mixed frequency modeling, and ensemble forecasting modules. Unlike the methods used in most previous studies, this system exploits the tremendous potential of mixed frequency data. In addition, a multi-objective optimizer-based ensemble forecaster was devised to provide deterministic and uncertain information regarding future wind speed. Furthermore, data preprocessing based on different strategies was applied to improve the performance of multiple forecasting models . An empirical study based on two wind farms shows that the system outperforms benchmark techniques and can be employed for data monitoring and analysis in wind farms or other fields.},

  abstract     = {A common approach to constructing fuzzy rough sets (FRSs) is using t-norms. Furthermore, establishing multi-granulation fuzzy rough sets (MGFRSs) is also usually undertaken by means of t-norms. However, most of these sets cannot satisfy the property that upper approximations contain lower approximations under fuzzy binary relations , which is imperative for rough set models. The overlap function is a type of aggregate function that is widely used in multi-attribute decision-making (MADM), image processing and other fields. In this paper, two novel types of MGFRS models under n -dimensional overlap functions are established to overcome the shortcomings of existing models, which are then applied to the multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem. First, idempotent n -dimensional overlap functions are used to establish optimistic and pessimistic MGFRSs. These new models fully preserve the important properties of the traditional MGFRS model. Second, through the theoretical analysis of MGFRS based on overlap functions (OMGFRS) and in combination with the TOPSIS method, a solution mechanism for the MAGDM method is proposed. Finally, to fully illustrate this decision-making method, an effective example is developed. A comparison with available methods indicates that this approach is more suitable and has wider adaptability, and that is can be used to handle decision-making problems.},

In real life, there are many complex tasks requiring different workers, among which the quality of worker cooperation and the price satisfaction of users should not be ignored. Hence, this paper examines a satisfaction-aware task assignment (SATA) problem with the goal of maximizing overall user satisfaction, where the user satisfaction integrates the satisfaction towards price and cooperation quality. The SATA problem has been proved to be NP-hard by reducing it from the k -set packing problem . In addition, two algorithms, namely, conflict-aware greedy (CAG) algorithm and game theoretic (GT) algorithm with an optimization strategy , are proposed for solving the SATA problem. The CAG algorithm can efficiently obtain a result with provable approximate bound, while the GT algorithm is proven to be convergent which can find a Nash equilibrium .

  abstract     = {Fuzzy measure-based aggregations allow taking interactions among coalitions of the input sources into account. Their main drawback when applying them in real-world problems, such as combining classifier ensembles, is how to define the fuzzy measure that governs the aggregation and specifies the interactions. However, their usage for combining classifiers has shown its advantage. The learning of the fuzzy measure can be done either in a supervised or unsupervised manner. This paper focuses on supervised approaches. Existing supervised approaches are designed to minimize the mean squared error cost function, even for classification problems. We propose a new fuzzy measure learning algorithm for combining classifiers that can optimize any cost function. To do so, advancements from deep learning frameworks are considered such as automatic gradient computation. Therefore, a gradient-based method is presented together with three new update policies that are required to preserve the monotonicity constraints of the fuzzy measures. The usefulness of the proposal and the optimization of cross-entropy cost are shown in an extensive experimental study with 58 datasets corresponding to both binary and multi-class classification problems. In this framework, the proposed method is compared with other state-of-the-art methods for fuzzy measure learning.},

Road links involve complex features from both spatial and temporal perspectives, but existing detection methods mostly rely on the topological features of road networks because they face difficulty in capturing the spatial and temporal characteristics of road networks. To overcome this difficulty, we constructed an ensembled autoencoder framework for road anomaly detection by combining spatiotemporal graph learning and graph masking methods, and our main focus was to effectively detect the topological and attribute anomalies mapped by spatiotemporal features in a road network based on traffic flow data. To model local contexts, we performed random masking on the input graph to obtain heterogeneous masked subgraphs. On this basis, a spatiotemporal graph learning model was used to extract topological and traffic flow features from masked subgraphs. Then, we carried out feature reconstructions for each subgraph and calculated the anomaly scores for every node in the graph. Finally, an ensemble model was designed to integrate the anomaly detection results from multiple autoencoders that were trained on the subgraphs to improve feature learning. Our experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to traditional topological analysis methods, machine learning methods (DBScan, isolation forest, LOF, and one-class SVM), and recent deep learning methods (GAE and VGAE).},

Given this limitation, this study designs a general-separability-oriented detection criterion, and further proposes a novel decomposition algorithm called surrogate-assisted variable grouping (SVG). The new criterion detects the separability between a variable and some other variables by checking whether its optimum changes with the latter. Consistent with the definition of general separability, this criterion endows SVG with strong applicability and high accuracy. To reduce expensive fitness evaluations, SVG locates the optimum of a variable with the help of a surrogate model rather than the original high-dimensional model. Moreover, it converts the variable-grouping process into a search process in a binary tree by taking variable subsets as tree nodes. This facilitates the reutilization of historical separability information, thereby reducing separability detection times. Experimental results on a general benchmark suite indicate that compared with six state-of-the-art decomposition algorithms, SVG achieves higher accuracy and efficiency on both additively and nonadditively separable problems. Furthermore, it can significantly enhance the optimization performance of CC.},

High-resolution images have more detailed information and clearer content than low-resolution images. It is well known that medical images can frequently have some blurred object boundaries, and that traditional deep learning models cannot adequately describe the uncertainty of these blurred boundaries. This paper proposes a new fuzzy metric to characterize the uncertainty of pixels and designs a fuzzy hierarchical fusion attention neural network based on multiscale guided learning. Specifically, a fuzzy neural information-processing block is proposed, which converts an input image into a fuzzy domain using fuzzy membership functions. The uncertainty of the pixels is processed using the proposed fuzzy rules, and then the output of the fuzzy rule layer is fused with the result of the convolution in the neural network. Simultaneously, a multiscale guided-learning dense residual block and pyramidal hierarchical attention module are designed to extract more effective hierarchical image information. Finally, a recurrent memory module with a residual structure is used to process the output features of the hierarchical attention modules. A recursive sub-pixel reconstruction module is used at the tail of the network to reconstruct the images. Compared with existing super-resolution methods using the public COVID-CT dataset, the proposed method demonstrated superior performance in high-resolution medical image reconstruction and reduced the number of parameters and analysis time of the models.},

However, they ignore the impacts of social events or only simply embed them instead of learning the spatio-temporal representations. To address this issue, we design a novel framework named an event-aware graph attention fusion network (EGAF-Net) to effectively capture the spatiotemporal dependencies, including event impacts, in road networks based on an encoder-decoder architecture for traffic speed prediction. First, we utilize an ST-Speed attention block to model the spatial correlations among road segments and capture traffic speed changes. Second, we develop a spatial event embedding block exploiting a novel algorithm based on the node2vec approach, a new dynamic event graph constructor which produces learnable graphs utilized in graph convolution layers, and a temporal event attention block to learn the spatial and temporal representations of events. Finally, we propose a gated fusion mechanism to fuse the spatio-temporal correlations in road networks and the representations of events. Extensive experiments conducted based on the Q-Traffic, Q-Eastern-Traffic and Q-Western-Traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EGAF-Net over robust baselines.},

  abstract     = {An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of the inconsistency rate (IR) of granulated datasets on classification performance. Unsupervised (equal-width interval, EWI) and supervised (minimum description length, MDL) techniques were used to granulate 36 datasets. An algorithm was developed to divide the original granulated datasets into consistent and inconsistent subsets. Five classifiers including one simple tree-based and four ensemble-based on datasets before granulation (BG), after granulation but before removal of inconsistent granulated datasets (AGBR), and after removal of inconsistent granulated datasets (AR) were used, followed by testing and comparisons of predication accuracy (PA). The experimental results showed the following: (1) 24 out of 36 via EWI and 28 out of 36 via MDL datasets contain inconsistent datasets. (2) PA of AR is more likely higher than of BG and AGBR datasets with both EWI and MDL by all classifiers. (3) Mean PA improvement ranges from 5.74\% to 10.01\% with EWI and from 8.74\% to 13.73\% with MDL. (4) The correlation coefficient between IR and PA improvement ranges from 0.7413 to 0.7901 with EWI and 0.7870 to 0.9683 with MDL. These results demonstrate the value of uncovering the effect of IR on classification performance in the domain of machine learning.},

The recently introduced standard contradiction separation (S-CS) inference rule extends binary resolution to a multi-clause, dynamic, contradiction separation inference mechanism. The S-CS rule is used in the present work to provide a framework for fully clause reusing deductions. Accordingly, a fully reusing clause deduction algorithm (called the FRC algorithm) is built. The FRC algorithm is then incorporated as an algorithm module into the architecture of a top ATP, Vampire, creating a single integrated ATP system dubbed V_FRC. The objective of this integration is to enhance Vampire&#39;s performance while assessing the FRC algorithm&#39;s capacity for reasoning. According to experimental findings, V_FRC not only outperforms Vampire in a variety of aspects, but also solves 46 problems in the TPTP benchmark database that have a rating of 1, meaning that none of the existing ATP systems are able to resolve them.},

  abstract     = {A Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) is a causal knowledge graph connecting concepts using directional and weighted connections making it an effective approach for reasoning and decision making. However, the modelling and reasoning capabilities of a conventional FCM for real world problems in the presence of uncertain data is limited as it relies on Type 1 Fuzzy Sets (T1FSs). In this work, we extend the capability of FCMs for capturing greater uncertainties in the interrelations of the modelled concepts by introducing a new reasoning algorithm that uses Type 2 Fuzzy Sets based on z slices (zT2FSs) for the modelling of uncertain weights connecting FCM’s concepts. These Type 2 Fuzzy Sets are generated using interval valued data from surveyed participants and aggregated using the Interval Agreement Approach method. Our algorithm performs late defuzzification of the FCM’s values at the end of the reasoning process, preserving the uncertainty in values for as long as possible. The proposed algorithm is applied to the evaluation of the performance of modules of an undergraduate Mathematical programme. The results obtained show a greater correlation to domain experts’ subjective knowledge on the modules’ performance than both a corresponding FCM with weights modelled using T1FS and a statistical method currently used for evaluating the modules’ performance. Sensitivity analysis conducted demonstrates that the new algorithm effectively preserves the propagation of uncertainty captured from input data.},

  abstract     = {Many Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms (SAEAs) have been developed for expensive constrained optimization problems (ECOPs) with continuous variables. However, there exist some ECOPs that contain mixed-integer variables in real world engineering applications. The mixed-integer variables make the feasible regions of ECOPs exhibit complex disjoint characteristics, which brings two challenges for the existing methods, i.e., the classical surrogate-assisted pre-screening may easily fall into a local optimum and the population diversity tends to reduce with the influence of integer variables. For tackling these problems, a surrogate-assisted differential evolution for solving ECOPs involving mixed-integer variables (SADE-MI) is proposed. Firstly, the mutation strategy DE/best/2 is used to balance the local and global characteristics of the candidate solutions. Secondly, an adaptive pre-screening operation where the information of the population is effectively employed to construct the distance constraints is designed to avoid excessive exploitation in local regions. Finally, by selecting diversely-located individuals and limiting the number of individuals with the same integer variables, a population diversity maintenance operation is introduced to strengthen global exploration. Experimental studies on some benchmark problems and engineering optimization cases demonstrate that SADE-MI outperforms other classical algorithms for solving ECOPs with mixed-integer variables.},

  abstract     = {Multi-label learning aims to solve classification problems where instances are associated with a set of labels. In reality, it is generally easy to acquire unlabeled data but expensive or time-consuming to label them, and this situation becomes more serious in multi-label learning as an instance needs to be annotated with several labels. Hence, semi-supervised multi-label learning approaches emerge as they are able to exploit unlabeled data to help train predictive models . This work proposes a novel approach called Self-paced Multi-label Co-Training (SMCT). It leverages the well-known co-training paradigm to iteratively train two classifiers on two views of a dataset and communicate one classifier’s predictions on unlabeled data to augment the other’s training set. As pseudo labels may be false in iterative training, self-paced learning is integrated into SMCT to rectify false pseudo labels and avoid error accumulation. Concretely, the multi-label co-training model in SMCT is formulated as an optimization problem by introducing latent weight variables of unlabeled instances. It is then solved via an alternative convex optimization algorithm . Experimental evaluations are carried out based on six benchmark multi-label datasets and three metrics. The results demonstrate that SMCT is very competitive in each setting when compared with five state-of-the-art methods.},

Inappropriate settings may cause an imbalance between exploration and exploitation of the algorithm, thus resulting in two extremes: premature convergence and failure to converge. In this paper, we propose a Differential Evolution using Leader-Adjoint populations (LADE), which simultaneously integrates four mutation strategies to meet the needs of exploration and exploitation at different evolutionary stages. In LADE, the population in each generation is divided into leader population and adjoint population by using a leader-adjoint model. The leader population adopts two mutation strategies with strong exploration ability to maintain the diversity and avoid premature convergence, while the adjoint population uses the other two mutation strategies with strong exploitation ability to promote convergence and avoid stagnation. In addition, the interaction and collaboration between both populations are achieved through the sharing between their individuals, thus achieving a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The performance of LADE is evaluated on single-objective benchmark problems of the 2017 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE CEC2017). Experimental results indicate that LADE shows competitive convergence performance, and outperforms various state-of-the-art DE variants and two well-known metaheuristics .},

The development of various machine learning algorithms has benefited all disciplines of study, but choosing which algorithm is most suitable for a certain problem among a large number of algorithms is a challenge that every field must overcome. Another challenge at the practical application level is that machine learning algorithms currently trained with large amounts of data are primarily black-box and uninterpretable. This indicates that these methods pose potential risks and are difficult to rely on, thus hindering their application in sensitive fields such as finance and healthcare. The first challenge can be overcome by using meta-learning to combine data and prior knowledge to efficiently and automatically select the machine learning models. The second challenge remains to be addressed due to the lack of interpretability of traditional meta-learning techniques and deficiencies in transparency and fairness. Achieving the interpretability of meta-learning in autonomous algorithm selection for classification is crucial to balance the need for high accuracy and transparency of machine learning models in practical application scenarios. This paper proposes EFFECT , an interpretable meta-learning framework that can explain the recommendation results of meta-learning algorithm selection and provide a more complete and accurate explanation of the recommendation algorithm’s performance on specific datasets combined with business scenarios. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the validity and correctness of this framework.},

Similarly, exponential growth in the development of different data analysis approaches has been reported in the literature, amongst which the K-means algorithm remains the most popular and straightforward clustering algorithm . The broad applicability of the algorithm in many clustering application areas can be attributed to its implementation simplicity and low computational complexity . However, the K-means algorithm has many challenges that negatively affect its clustering performance. In the algorithm’s initialization process , users must specify the number of clusters in a given dataset apriori while the initial cluster centers are randomly selected. Furthermore, the algorithm&#39;s performance is susceptible to the selection of this initial cluster and for large datasets, determining the optimal number of clusters to start with becomes complex and is a very challenging task. Moreover, the random selection of the initial cluster centers sometimes results in minimal local convergence due to its greedy nature. A further limitation is that certain data object features are used in determining their similarity by using the Euclidean distance metric as a similarity measure, but this limits the algorithm’s robustness in detecting other cluster shapes and poses a great challenge in detecting overlapping clusters. Many research efforts have been conducted and reported in literature with regard to improving the K-means algorithm’s performance and robustness. The current work presents an overview and taxonomy of the K-means clustering algorithm and its variants. The history of the K-means, current trends, open issues and challenges, and recommended future research perspectives are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Accurate travel demand forecasting at the regional level benefits to urban traffic management and service operations. Irregular regions can be naturally represented by graphs, and thus, graph neural network (GNN) is rapidly becoming the mainstream method in region-level travel demand forecasting. Most existing GNN-based methods encode the association between regions into single or multiple fixed adjacency matrices. The limitation of these methods is that they ignore that the correlation between regions may vary over time. Several studies have attempted to capture such change with purely data-driven dynamic graph approaches; however, they are highly dependent on data quality. Furthermore, regions with different functional distributions exhibit diverse demand patterns, which are not fully considered in demand forecasting. To address these issues, we propose a multi-task adaptive recurrent graph attention network , in which the spatio-temporal learning component combines the prior knowledge-driven graph learning mechanism with a novel recurrent graph attention network to capture the dynamic spatiotemporal dependencies automatically. Demand forecasting for all regions is divided into different learning tasks based on region function distributions, and an uncertainty-based multi-task learning component is then developed to coordinate multiple learning tasks adaptively. Experimental results based on two real-world datasets show the superiority of the proposed method in prediction accuracy. Compared with the state-of-the-art dynamic graph methods, the proposed method further reduces prediction error by 4\%. In addition, various ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different components in the proposed method.},

In this paper, we introduce a feature fusion residual LSTM (FFRL) model to answer these two questions – how to compensate for the three limitations of LSTM and how to fuse the multi-source and multi-frequency information. FFRL consists of three modules to improve the three limitations of LSTM, namely the feature selection module, feature extraction module, and residual module. To learn features from multi-source and multi-frequency information, FFRL applies the feature selection module to emphasize important features and the feature extraction module to extract deeper features.

Although some deep learning-based methods have shown great success in XMTC, they still suffer from the following drawbacks. First, although several methods have improved the precision by clustering labels and combining several sub-models to train and predict for one dataset, they were not ideal in terms of computational efficiency. Second, most of those methods need a low dimensional bottleneck layer before the output layer to compress the feature representations to fit the GPU memory, which results in information loss of original features. In this paper, we proposed a novel two-stage X MTC framework with candidate R etrieving and deep R anking (XRR) to address those drawbacks. In the retrieving stage, we designed two retrieval strategies, including an a ligning P oint M utual I nformation (aPMI) method, and a U nified L abel- S emantic E mbedding (ULSE) method, to extract hundreds of candidates from massive labels. In the ranking stage, we presented a deep ranking model using a pre-trained transformer to distinguish the true labels from candidates.

  abstract     = {With federated learning , one of the most notable features is that it can update global model parameter without using the users’ local data. However, various security and privacy problems still exist in the process of federated learning . The problem of devising a secure and verifiable federated learning framework, so as to obtain high performance federated learning model and protect right and interests of participants has not been sufficiently studied, the malicious server may conduct dishonest data aggregation and return incorrect aggregated gradients to all the participants. What is more, the server with ulterior motives may return correct aggregated results to some participants, but return wrong results to the specific participant. To solve the above problems, we propose the SVeriFL, a successive verifiable federated learning with privacy-preserving in this work. In specific, an elaborately designed protocol based on BLS signature and multi-party security is introduced, such that the integrity of parameter uploaded by participant and correctness of aggregated results of server can be verified; the consistency of aggregation results received from server between any multiple participants can also be testified. Moreover, the CKKS approximate homomorphic encryption is used to protect data privacy of the participant. Experimental results and analyses validate the practical performance and computation efficiency of the presented SVeriFL.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a popular machine learning technique to reduce the distribution discrepancy among domains. In previous UDA methods, only convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) are used as the backbone. Therefore, these methods are subjected to inherent characteristics of single-CNNs or single-ViTs. In fact, CNNs are more biased towards local textures, while ViTs are inclined to learn the shape information of images. In this paper, we consider that the model combining the above two bias properties is closer to the human visual neural system and achieves more robust performance. A novel mutual distillation method for UDA without any assistant networks is proposed. Mutual distillation between two backbones with complementary properties (i.e. CNNs &amp; ViTs) can promote each other, leading to better domain knowledge transfer. Additionally, traditional domain-mixup approaches can only mix limited cross-domain information through linear interpolation . To encourage more cross-domain information interaction between the two backbones and bridge the domain gap, we propose a patch-mixup method, building a train of mixed intermediate domains composed of augmented patches. Meanwhile, a cross-domain semantic alignment loss is proposed to align the semantic information of these domains. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several standard UDA benchmarks, such as Office-31, Office-Home, ImageCLEF-DA and VisDA-2017.},

Whereas, the vast majority of those algorithms usually involve two independent processes, i.e., similarity matrix construction and feature selection. This incurs a poor similarity matrix that is obtained from original data, which retains constant for the following feature selection process and heavily affects the corresponding performance. Aiming to integrate these two processes into a unified framework, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised feature selection algorithm, named Graph Learning Unsupervised Feature Selection (GLUFS) to ensure the two processes proceed simultaneously. In particular, a new similarity matrix is derived from the original one, while the new matrix can adaptively maintain the manifold structure of data. Due to the fact that good individual features do not necessarily guarantee efficient combinations, the GLUFS algorithm adopts the ℓ 2 , 0 ℓ2,0 -norm sparsity constraint to achieve group feature selection. Eventually, we perform experiments on six public datasets with sufficient analysis, while the obtained results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of our GLUFS over the considered algorithms.},

Recently, a series of discrete choice models based on fuzzy subjective utility have been proposed. Specifically, utility evaluation of each alternative has been expressed by fuzzy membership grades . However, traditional fuzzy membership function has only considered supporting degree, but has not considered the degrees of opposition and indeterminacy involved in decision makers’ evaluations. In this paper, a series of novel discrete choice models based on Atanassov-type intuitionistic fuzzy set are proposed, in which membership degrees, non-membership degrees, and hesitation degrees are simultaneously taken into account to jointly express the utility evaluations. Moreover, the attitudinal character of decision makers and relative weights of attributes are also considered to further extend the proposed models. Compared with existing discrete choice models, these new models are more flexible and general, which increase the applicability of discrete choice models for decision-making under an uncertain and imprecise environment. Two real-world case studies are given to illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the new models.},

The aim of this paper is to investigate and assess the performance and behavior of a federated model during the occurrence of catastrophic forgetting events within the context of a non-stationary data scenario. To achieve this objective, the performance of a proposed federated learning approach has been evaluated in terms of the continuous flow of data in order to train a time series-based model. The results demonstrate the goodness of the solution in terms of performance, with improvements ranging from 2\% to 28\%. This indicates the benefits that the proposed approach brings to a node in terms of recovering from a catastrophic forgetting event, also taking into account the fact that the probability of catastrophic forgetting is higher at the beginning of the learning process.},

  abstract     = {Bio-inspired computing is an appropriate platform for developing artificial intelligent machines based on the behavioral and functional principles of the brain. Bio-inspired machines have been proven to play a significant role in the development of intelligent systems with spike-based operation being a key feature. However, spikes by themselves do not contain much information and may not cross the synapse and stimulate the post-synaptic neuron while bursts consisting of short trains of high-frequency spikes provide more potent information coding facilities. In this study, a pattern recognition network is proposed that consists of an input layer (adapted from a retinal model), middle layer (bio-inspired spiking neural network with bursting neurons and excitatory and inhibitory AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid) and GABA (Gamma-aminobutyric acid) synapses) and output layer (pyramidal neurons as classifying neurons). For the first time, a novel unsupervised burst-based learning algorithm inspired by spike-time-dependent-plasticity (STDP) is developed, called Burst Time Dependent Plasticity (BTDP). Compared to STDP, BTDP yields a higher performance accuracy and faster convergence rate of spiking pattern recognition networks when classifying EMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets compared to existing spiking networks. The proposed spiking network, trained by the novel unsupervised learning algorithm, is able to compete with advanced deep networks in recognizing complex patterns while being amenable to implementation on neuromorphic hardware platforms.},

Many papers show that PNNs can approximate a wide variety of functions, but comparatively, very few discuss their limitations and the scope of this paper. To this aim, we define two classes of Boolean functions – sensitive and robust –, and prove that an exponentially large set of sensitive functions are exponentially difficult to compute by multi-layer PNNs (hence incomputable by single-layer PNNs). A comparatively large set of functions in the second one, but not all, are computable by single-layer PNNs. Finally, we used polynomial threshold PNNs to compute all Boolean functions with quantum annealing and present in detail a QUBO computation on the D-Wave Advantage. These results confirm that the successes of PNNs, or lack of them, are in part determined by properties of the learned data sets and suggest that sensitive functions may not be (efficiently) computed by PNNs.},

Firstly, the secret keys are generated by Hash.

Secondly, facial information is recognized by the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG). Note that the entire algorithm only encrypts this facial image . Finally, the facial image is used as the input of the EFR-CSTP, and the ciphertext image is generated by scrambling, STP combined with the XOR diffusion method. We evaluated our algorithm in the IMDB-WIKI dataset. We also evaluate the EFR-CSTP and other algorithms on the same datasets.

This paper constitutes a substantial progress in this topic. First, monotonicities and other properties of discrete connectives are related to plane partitions, a concept deeply studied in the field of combinatorics . Second, the already known expressions on the cardinality of plane partitions are adapted to the concrete properties of discrete connectives. With this, we establish closed formulas for discrete negations and some binary discrete connectives; concretely, discrete conjunctions, disjunctions and implications. As well, we establish formulas for the cardinality of some sets of implications satisfying several additional properties known in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Access control has been widely adopted by distributed platforms, and its effectiveness is of great importance to the quality of services provided by such platforms. However, traditional access control is difficult to apply to scenarios where authorization changes frequently and to extremely large-scale datasets with limited resources. This paper proposes an access control model based on spectral clustering (SC) and risk (SC-RBAC), which is more suitable for big data medical scenarios. Based on user history access data, an improved SC algorithm is used to cluster doctor users. Then, the user classification is introduced as a parameter into the information entropy to improve the accuracy of quantifying the user’s access behavior risk. Finally, based on the accurate risk value of access behavior, we assign access rights to users through the access control function constructed in the paper. Experimental results show that in three different situations, the model proposed in this paper can distinguish the two types of doctors well, the accuracy of the model can reach more than 90\%, and it outperforms other access control models.},

However, the existing opinion dynamics ignore the relationship between opinion evolution and community structure. To address the limitation, we build a novel bounded confidence opinion dynamics model (called LPA-HK for simplicity). Based on the Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model, the label propagation algorithm (LPA) is introduced in the LPA-HK model to study the relationship between opinion evolution and community partition from the micro-perspective of the evolutionary process. Each agent has an opinion as well as a label indicating the agent’s community. The iterations of agents’ states involve two stages: label and opinion updates. The labels and opinions of agents evolve dynamically until the group reaches a stable state. We perform simulations to examine the effect of the model parameters on opinion evolution and community partitions. We show that group reaches a consensus as the confidence level increases to a critical value and the partitions of high quality are obtained when the confidence level is greater than the critical value. We apply the LPA-HK model to three kinds of real networks to solve the community detection problem. The effectiveness of the LPA-HK model is verified by comparing the results with two existing community detection results based on modularity optimization algorithms .},

  abstract     = {Topic-based communities have gradually become a considerable medium for netizens to disseminate and acquire knowledge. These communities consist of entities (actual objects, e.g., a real answer or an actual question) with different types (users, questions and answers) and are usually hidden and overlapping. Nowadays, prevalent community question answering (CQA) platforms have formed mature communities by manually marked topics and extensive accumulated user behavior. However, the ever-growing various entities and complex overlapping topic communities make it inefficient to manually label entity tags (e.g., Question labels supplement domain features; Potential user tags indicate the user&#39;s specialty.). Therefore, there is an urgent need for a mechanism that automatically finds hidden semantic communities from user social behavior and lays a foundation for community construction and intelligent recommendation of QA platforms. In this paper, we propose a H eterogeneous C ommunity D etection Approach B ased on G raph Neural Network, called HCDBG, to detect heterogeneous communities in CQA. Firstly, we define entity relationships based on user interaction behavior and employ a heterogeneous information network to uniformly represent all connections. Afterward, we exploit the heterogeneous graph neural network to fuse content and topological features of nodes for graph embedding . Finally, we convert the community detection issue in CQA into an entity clustering task in the heterogeneous information network and improve the k-means method to achieve heterogeneous community detection. Based on our knowledge of the existing literature, it is an innovative research direction that utilizes the heterogeneous graph neural network to facilitate QA community detection. Extensive experiments on authentic question-answering datasets illustrate that HCDBG outperforms baseline methods in heterogeneous community detection.},

  abstract     = {The widely applied density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm makes an intuitive cluster formation assumption that cluster centers are often surrounded by data points with lower local density and far away from other data points with higher local density. However, this assumption suffers from one limitation that it is often problematic when identifying clusters with lower density because they might be easily merged into other clusters with higher density. As a result, DPC may not be able to identify clusters with variational density. To address this issue, we propose a variational density peak clustering (VDPC) algorithm, which is designed to systematically and autonomously perform the clustering task on datasets with various types of density distributions. Specifically, we first propose a novel method to identify the representatives among all data points and construct initial clusters based on the identified representatives for further analysis of the clusters’ property. Furthermore, we divide all data points into different levels according to their local density and propose a unified clustering framework by combining the advantages of both DPC and DBSCAN. Thus, all the identified initial clusters spreading across different density levels are systematically processed to form the final clusters. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VDPC algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments using 20 datasets including eight synthetic, six real-world, and six image datasets. The experimental results show that VDPC outperforms two classical algorithms (i.e., DPC and DBSCAN) and four state-of-the-art extended DPC algorithms.},

This paper presents a solution that, as far as we know, for the first time consistently outperforms the classic multivariate DTW algorithm across dataset sizes, series lengths, data dimensions, temporal window sizes, and machines. The new solution, named TC-DTW, introduces triangle inequality and point clustering into the algorithm design on lower bound calculations for multivariate DTW. In experiments on DTW-based nearest neighbor finding, the new solution avoids as much as 98\% (60\% average) DTW distance calculations and yields as much as 25× (7.5× average) speedups.},

  abstract     = {Accurate urban traffic prediction is a critical issue in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). It is challenging since urban traffic usually indicates high dynamic spatio-temporal correlations, leading to uncertainty and complexity of traffic status. Since the transportation network is a graph structure practically, existing works have applied Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on urban traffic prediction with a pre-defined adjacency matrix based on node distance or connectivity. However, in many urban traffic scenarios, spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic data usually change over time, so using a fixed adjacency matrix cannot describe the dynamic dependencies. To track the dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic data, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Dynamic Traffic Correlation-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional network (DTC-STGCN), to forecast traffic flow and speed accurately. DTC-STGCN extracts a dynamic adjacency matrix from different traffic characters to describe dynamic spatio-temporal correlations. Moreover, an attention and dynamic adjacency matrix-based GCNs framework is proposed to capture urban traffic dynamic spatial features, while a long-short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to capture urban traffic temporal features, respectively. Finally, we feed the spatio-temporal features generated by GCN and LSTM, with real road segments into a hybrid graph convolution framework to simultaneously model the dynamic spatial and temporal dependencies for traffic predictions. The experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed DTC-STGCN model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art traffic prediction baselines on MAE and RMSE over 10\%, and achieve a stable performance for two specific tasks (long-term traffic prediction and peak time prediction). And ablation study validates the effectiveness of dynamic adjacency matrix, attention mechanism, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, matrix completion has attracted a lot of attention. Conventional matrix completions are shallow and ineffective when dealing with complex data structures . Researchers have recently tried to incorporate deep structures into matrix completion; however, considerable challenges still exist. Most matrix completion methods may fail to work effectively in the presence of limited observations. To enhance the generalization of the reconstruction, adversarial methods are proposed that attempt to fool models by providing deceptive input. The aim is to develop an adversarial training algorithm that resists attacks in a deep model, thus at the same time leading to enhancing the generalization. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an elastic adversarial training to design a high-capacity Deep Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (DNMF) model with proper discovery latent structure of the data and enhanced generalization abilities . In other words, the challenges mentioned above are addressed by perturbing the inputs in DNMF with an elastic loss which is intercalated and adapted between Frobenius and ℓ 2 , 1 ℓ2,1 norms. This model not only dispenses with adversarial DNMF generation but also is robust towards a mixture of multiple attacks to attain improved accuracy. Extensive simulations show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

We evaluate the performance of different design options from both the customers’ and the operators’ perspectives, i.e., quality of service and profitability. We study the number of chargers, their placement and the size of the fleet. We observe the impact on the system when demand is constant and then when demand increases. The results show that it is critical to scale the capacity of the charging infrastructure proportionally to the mobility demand. Conversely, the same fleet size can accommodate a 300\% increase in demand, not satisfying less than 15\% of it. Moreover, the observed demand and supply would likely not generate profits for the EV system. This is due to the high cost of electric vehicles and the need to manage the fleet for charging operations. The figure changes with at least a 5-fold increase in demand, with the current fleet size becoming profitable.},

To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel sequential three-way stock prediction model under the multilevel granular structure of hybrid data. We construct three kinds of multi-granularity methods to combine price and textual data, i.e., high-frequency data with features extracted by Sentiment Analysis ( senthigh senthigh ), high-frequency data with features extracted by BERT ( berthigh berthigh ), and low-frequency data with features extracted by BERT ( bertlow bertlow ). Subsequently, we employ sequential three-way decisions to continually predict the future trend of each test sample at adequate granularity . In addition, an autonomous attention mechanism is embedded inside the CNN and RNN to handle large embeddings and long time series dynamically. Finally, the comparative experiments are conducted on 5-year stock data to demonstrate that the proposed models outperform the non-sequential two-way predictions.},

Therefore, dimensionality reduction must be performed on the original data, which leads to the following problems: 1) the learned projection matrix does not preserve the main discriminative information of the original data; 2) the local and global structures are not preserved simultaneously; and 3) the negative effects of noise, outliers, and corruption cannot be overcome. To alleviate the aforementioned problems, a robust dimensionality reduction method based on a relaxed energy-preserving and structure-preserving embedding for multiview clustering is proposed in this study. In particular, the proposed architecture is a double-relaxed energy-preserving embedding model, which uses two projection matrices to extract the main discriminant features from the original data using two energy-preserving embedding routes, yielding clean data and a representation matrix in low-dimensional space. Subsequently, an affinity matrix that captures both local and global data structures is learned by performing locality-preserving projection and global low-rank-preserving embedding on the clean data and the representation matrix , respectively.

Thus, the compression performance should be evaluated by the full code length, i.e. the length of the encoded text plus the length of the codebook. We studied several alphabets for compressing texts – letters, n n -grams of letters, syllables, words, and phrases. If only sufficiently short texts are retained, an alphabet of letters or two-grams of letters is optimal. For the majority of Project Gutenberg texts, the best alphabet (the one that minimizes the full code length) is given by syllables or words, depending on the representation of the codebook. Letter 3 and 4-grams, having on average comparable length to syllables/words, perform noticeably worse than syllables or words. Word 2-grams also are never the best alphabet, on the account of having a very large codebook. We also show that the codebook representation is important – switching from a naive representation to a compact one significantly improves the matters for alphabets with large number of symbols, most notably the words. Thus, meaning-expressing elements of the language (syllables or words) provide the best compression alphabet.},

  abstract     = {The outranking multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method focuses on the systematic comparison of alternatives and the non-compensation among criteria to conduct decision analysis . Z-numbers are powerful tools for characterizing decision-making information and identifying information reliability. This paper aims to explore Z-number outranking theories and the corresponding MCDM method on the basis of the idea of Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) III, which is a very popular and capable outranking model. The concordance and discordance indices of Z-numbers are defined by processing their bimodal uncertainty fully. And an objective computation method is investigated to determine the values of thresholds in these indices. Further, three types of novel outranking relations, including dominance, support and opposition relations, for Z-numbers are presented by comparing these indices systematically. Then, an extended MCDM method with the distillation and flow ranking rules is proposed by detecting the outranking relations among alternatives under multiple criteria and carrying out the outranking aggregation and exploitation. To verify the applicability and effectivity of the proposed method, an illustrative example is provided, and a simulation test and a comparison discussion are conducted},

While reliable inference tools are available for classical probability samples , non-probability samples can yield strongly biased estimates since the selection mechanism is typically unknown. We propose a general method how to improve statistical inference when in addition to a probability sample data from other sources, which have to be considered non-probability samples, are available. The method uses specifically tailored regression residuals to enlarge the original data set by including observations from other sources that can be considered as stemming from the target population. Measures of accuracy of estimates are obtained by adapted bootstrap techniques.The proposed method is evaluated in simulation studies and applied to two data sets, which shows that it is able to yield improved estimates.},

The unknown nonlinearities and cost function are approximated by radial-basis-function (RBF) neural network (NN). The overall controller consists of an adaptive controller and an optimal compensation term. Firstly, the adaptive controller is designed by backstepping control method . Subsequently, the optimal compensation term is derived via policy iteration by minimizing cost function. In addition, depending on the prescribed performance control, the tracking error can be limited in the prescribed area. Therefore, the whole control scheme can effectively guarantee that the tracking error converges to a bound with prescribed performance while the cost function is minimized. The stability analysis shows that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the designed control strategy are illustrated by the simulation examples.},

Recent years have witnessed an enormous interest in the modeling, performance evaluation, and seed determination in different networked systems. Further, the competitive behavior between multiple influential groups within a network is developed to simulate the realistic marketing and propagation tasks. Powerful seeds can be detected to achieve considerable diffusion effects. Meanwhile, networks are operated in the presentence of disturbances, and the connectivity tends to be threatened by attacks and errors. Seeds with robustness against structural perturbances in competitive networks are significant for daily applications. However, little attention has been paid on evaluating the robustness of seeds towards competitive spreading scenarios, and an effective determination strategy is still lacked. In order to tackling the robust competitive influence maximization problem, a diffusion model considering competitive behaviors between spreading groups has been developed, and the spreading ability estimation technique is also given. Equipped with which, a robustness measure R CS is designed to evaluate the robustness of seeds under node-based attacks in a numerical form. The seed determination task has been modeled as a discrete optimization problem , and a Memetic algorithm containing several problem-orientated operators, termed MA-RCIM, is devised to solve the problem. Tested on several synthetic and real-world networks, MA-RCIM achieves satisfactory results for solving diffusion dilemmas, and shows superiority over existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {In pattern classification, the class imbalance problem always occurs when the number of observations in some classes is significantly different from that of other categories, which leads to the learning bias in the classifiers. One possible solution to this problem is to re-balance the training set by over-sampling the minority class. However, over-samplings always push the classification boundaries to the majority part, thus the recall increases while the precision decreases. To avoid this situation and better handle the class imbalance problem , this paper proposes a new over-sampling method, namely Subspace-based Minority Over-Sampling ( abbr. SMO). This approach considers that each category of samples is formed by common and unique characteristics, and such characteristics can be extracted by subspace. To obtain the balanced data, the common part is over-sampled for more accurately depicting the minority, and the unique part can be expanded by some generative methods . The balanced data are obtained by restoring the generated products of the subspace to the original space. The experimental results demonstrate that the SMO has the ability to model complex data distributions and outperforms both classical and newly designed over-sampling algorithms. Also, SMO can be used to generate simple images, and the generation results of MNIST can be clearly identified by both human vision and machine vision.},

Due to the limitations of single metric learning for heterogeneous data , multiple local metric learning has become an essential representative tool to describe local properties of data. Most existing multiple metric learning algorithms need to perform metric learning on a pre-obtained instance division. However, the number of clusters in the pre-obtained division affects the effectiveness of metric learning. To tackle this problem, we propose a Multiple Metric Learning via Local Metric Fusion (MML-LMF) framework, which unifies local metric learning and fusion of similar local metrics into one metric and adaptively determines the number of local metrics. As an application of the MML-LMF framework to pairwise constraints, we devise a MML-LMF algorithm by constructing a concrete optimization model and acquiring a closed-form solution to the model. The experimental results on several benchmarks, person re-identification, and face verification datasets show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to that of the existing state-of-the-art global and multiple metric learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Fraud detection is one of the most important tasks in Web platforms such as e-commerce, social media, network security, and financial systems. To prevent fraudulent actions from misleading customers or causing significant losses for businesses, various fraud detection methods have been proposed in recent years. However, research on fraud definitions, characteristics, and behaviours has been limited to which users, items, and transactions are considered fraudulent rather than why these entities have been classified as such. This inhibits effective validation of the detected frauds as well as countermeasure design. In this paper, we argue that explanations for discovered frauds may be provided in terms of prior identified frauds. A large variety of comparable frauds would assist investigators to generalise, allowing them to grasp the characteristics that are significant for fraud detection. Feature-annotated graphs are frequently used to detect the type of fraud in which fraudsters commonly interact with a large number of benign users to conceal themselves. Given a fraud subgraph, we propose a query-by-example approach for indexing and extracting the k most similar and diverse fraud subgraphs from prior frauds. To achieve an efficient and adaptive realisation of the approach in a streaming setting, we present a novel graph representation learning technique and discuss the implementation considerations. Comparing our study against baseline techniques revealed that our approach outperforms them in delivering meaningful explanations for various fraud camouflage behaviours.},

In order to determine weights for the elements in partially ordered set which can embody bi-polar preferences, some new methods such as the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) aggregation on lattice using three-set formulation have been proposed. However, when there are no posets and orders but fuzzy relations available, some new effective generalized methods should be proposed. This work differentiates two types of special fuzzy relations , called incomplete fuzzy relation and contradictive fuzzy relation. Two objective methods to derive incomplete fuzzy relation from a set of vectors and basic uncertain information (BUI) granules are introduced. Two scaling methods to transform contradictive fuzzy relation into incomplete fuzzy relation are suggested. Based on those derived fuzzy relations and given convex/concave basic unit monotonic (BUM) functions, some weights allocation methods are proposed which can well embody the bi-polar preferences of decision makers .

  abstract     = {Cross-platform sequential recommendations are a typical solution to the problem of sparse data and cold starts in the field of recommendation systems. Specifically, we utilize data from the auxiliary platform to improve the recommendation performance of the target platform. One typical scenario is the fusion of data from two interaction platforms to perform cross-platform recommendation tasks. Existing approaches assume that interaction data from the auxiliary platform can fully share cross-platforms. However, such a hypothesis is unreasonable as, in the real world, different companies may operate these platforms. Records of user interactions with items are sensitive, and the complete sharing of original data could violate business privacy policies and increase the risk of privacy leaks. This paper considers a more realistic scenario for performing cross-platform sequential recommendations. To avoid compromising users’ privacy during data sharing, we contemplate sharing only item-level relevance data and not user-level relevance data. Concretely, we transfer item embedding cross-platform to make it easier for both companies to agree on data sharing (e.g., legal policies), as the data to share is irrelevant to the user and has no explicit semantics. For extracting a valuable signal from the transfer items embedding, we propose a new model, Neural Attention Transfer Sequential Recommendation (abbreviated as NATSR), by exploiting the powerful representation capabilities of neural networks . We perform thorough experiments with two real datasets to verify their performance. The NATSR model achieves the best recommendation performance compared to the traditional cross-platform approach of directly sharing user-level relevance data. We demonstrate further that the NATSR model dramatically mitigates the problem of data sparsity with significant user privacy-preserving.},

This framework provides the mathematical tools needed to use the symbolic principal components to transform the original data in a way that is mathematically coherent with the remainder of the framework and defines the principal components as solutions to maximisation problems, similarly to what is done in conventional Principal Component Analysis. After the theoretical foundations are laid down, we explore real-world data from the telecommunications sector , in an attempt to detect Internet redirection attacks in real-time.

  abstract     = {Feature selection attempts to capture the more discriminative features and plays a significant role in multilabel learning. As an efficient mathematical tool to handle incomplete and uncertain information, fuzzy rough set theory has been widely used in feature selection. However, there are two pivotal issues to be addressed when adopting fuzzy rough sets for multilabel data analysis. One is how to effectively characterize the discriminative ability of the features to multilabel samples. Another one is how to alleviate the effect of data noise on feature selection. For these reasons, this study mainly studies the noise-tolerant fuzzy neighborhood rough set model for multilabel learning and its feature selection strategy. Firstly, a parameterized hybrid fuzzy similarity relation is introduced to granulate multilabel data, and the parameterized fuzzy decision is extended to multilabel learning. Then, a noise-resistant multilabel fuzzy neighborhood rough set model using inclusion relation is constructed for describing the discriminative ability of the features to multilabel samples. Furthermore, a noise-resistant heuristic feature selection algorithm titled NRFSFN is designed.

  abstract     = {The present work deals with the consensus issue for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) subject to nonaffine nonlinear faults and unmeasurable states. First, the Butterworth low-pass filter (BLPF) is exploited to eliminate the algebraic loop problem arising from nonaffine nonlinear faults. In light of the convex combination theory, a neural observer is established to estimate the unmeasured states, which improves the efficiency of solving the observer gain. Then, with the help of the adaptive backstepping algorithm, an observer-based neural finite-time control protocol is proposed in which a quadratic function is constructed to circumvent the singularity problem. The finite-time stability criterion and Lyapunov stability theorem are utilized to demonstrate that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded in finite time. Finally, a simulation experiment is applied to show the effectiveness of the present method.},

We develop the mean-uncertain method and the volatility-uncertain method, respectively, by assuming that the disturbance term follows the maximal and the G -normal distributions, which are the most important distributions within a sublinear expectation framework. Experiments on the simulated dataset and 10real-life datasets are conducted to compare the newly proposed approaches to several existing ones, including two resampling methods and two regression-based methods.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the sequential information, i.e., the ordering of the recorded feedback, is one of the most frequently used auxiliary information for developing recommendation algorithms . However, there are still some challenges in collaborative filtering with sequential implicit feedback. For one thing, there may be some co-occurrence and “leap-occurrence” phenomena in users’ behavior sequences. For another, a weak point of utilizing implicit feedback is that the unobserved behaviors do not always indicate “dislike”. In this paper, we focus on these two fundamental challenges in users’ preference learning, i.e., the uncertainty of the ordering of the next items and the uneven quality of the negative samples, and propose a novel solution named COFIS (short for co llaborative fi ltering with s equential implicit feedback via learning users’ preferences over item-sets). Specifically, our COFIS incorporates two learning paradigms (i.e., pairwise and pointwise) and two expression strategies (i.e., “MOO” and “MOS”, representing two different ways to treat the negative item-sets when compared with the positive item-sets). Our COFIS can be applied to existing methods such as many factorization- and deep learning-baseed models. We derive four specific algorithms of our COFIS based on Fossil (denoted as COFIS(-,-) for short) in particular, and further show the results of our COFIS-improved methods (including the factorization-based COFIS, and the deep learning-based SASRec(COFIS) and FMLP-Rec(COFIS)). Notice that we treat the seminal works and their pointwise version as special cases of our COFIS. Empirical studies on four real-world datasets show the superiority of our proposed COFIS compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we also study the impact of some key parameters in our COFIS.},

In order to prevent the attacker from discovering secret information from the communication channel, a new cryptographic scheme based on events, called event-based cryptography, is introduced. We also define the property of confidentiality of DES with respect to an encryption function and a secret language, which is associated with the fact that only the sender and the intended receiver are able to understand the transmitted secret message . A necessary and sufficient condition for confidentiality is presented, and we propose a test to verify this property. We also present a method to create an encryption function to ensure confidentiality for a CPS, if it exists, when the secret language is formed only of sequences with length bounded by a given number.},

Considering the cell relation graph is unknown in most situations, some GNN-based methods generate a pre-fixed cell relation graph using all the features (i.e., genes) from a single perspective and input it into GNN models. However, these GNN-based models can be severely hurt by the pre-fixed relation graph especially when it is not well pre-obtained due to the scRNA-seq errors. In addition, such methods learn the cell relation graph from a single perspective using all the features, which ignores the different influences of different gene subsets on cell relations. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end GNN-based scRNA-seq method called GLAE to address the above shortcomings, which is capable of learning cell relation graphs from different perspectives adaptively during the training process. We compare GLAE with several recently proposed methods and the results on six scRNA-seq datasets show that GLAE outperforms most of the methods on clustering tasks and is able to learn a meaningful cell relation graph for downstream tasks.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing provides services to store users’ data, so that they can access it anytime, anywhere at their convenience. In order to preserve data privacy, the data is encrypted before being uploaded to the cloud platform. But it is challenging to process and analyse the encrypted data as well as manage its access control. In Information Sciences 2017, Ding et al. have proposed a novel solution to address this challenge, which consists of a homomorphic re-encryption scheme (HRES) and a toolkit of several basic operations over ciphertexts . Ding’s work has good potentials for various cloud-based applications in which privacy preserving computations are required and the processed results are shared among multiple users. However, the HRES scheme relies on some relatively strong assumptions, making it less practical for real-world applications. For example, the system parameters have to be generated by a trusted third party (TTP), the two proxies who execute the decryption and re-encryption processes have to follow the protocol, and they can neither be out-of-service nor collude. In this paper, we relax these assumptions by extending the HRES scheme into a quorum controlled homomorphic re-encryption scheme (QHRES). Both the decryption and re-encryption processes are carried out by multiple proxies in a distributed fashion, and all the desirable security properties are guaranteed if there exists a quorum of honest proxies. Moreover, no TTP is required and every proxy’s behaviour can be publicly verified. Our extension inherits the homomorphic property as in HRES and it also supports the basic operations over ciphertexts . Therefore, it contributes to a more practical privacy preserving data processing system for real-world applications in the cloud.},

Design obstacles stemmed from unknown time delays and actuator saturation and unknown nonlinear functions are overcome by using appropriate multiple Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals method, the Nussbaum gain technique, and neural network approximations , respectively. The proposed control strategy guarantees that i) all the closed-loop signals for the switched system are bounded in the semi-global sense under a class of switching signals with ADT, attaining semi-global uniformly ultimately boundedness (SGUUB); and, ii) the output tracking error is driven towards, and kept within, a small neighbourhood around the origin.

Experimental results show that our model outperforms most metrics compared to prior state-of-the-art baselines across two benchmarks.

  abstract     = {Private web search (PWS) schemes allow users to find information on the internet while preserving their privacy. Among them, cryptographic PWS schemes guarantee strong privacy at the cost of performance. Their design principle is that each user takes a list of ciphertexts as inputs from its predecessor and forwards a shuffled list of the input to its successor. This idea is quite reasonable but requires O ( n ) O(n) round complexity with respect to the number of users n . Because these cryptographic PWS schemes are interaction-intensive, this long delay causes network latency and dictates the local computational cost. This linear round complexity is the main obstacle for deploying these schemes in real-world applications. In this work, our primary goal is to improve existing cryptographic PWS solutions to reduce their complexity to O ( 1 ) O(1) rounds, thus ensuring their practicality. To this end, we first introduce the notion of vertical mixing, which hides the linkability between messages and their sources without horizontally cascaded shuffling. Second, we design a method to achieve vertical mixing by adopting additive secret sharing and modifying the widely used cryptographic PWS framework, CVH, originally developed by Castellà-Roca et al. (Computer Communications 2009). This yields enhanced round efficiency while ensuring security in the semi-honest model. Furthermore, we provide a formal proof of our PWS solution using the standard simulation-based proof. In contrast, the existing works only provide heuristic proofs. Finally, we perform a set of microbenchmarks by varying the number of users and evaluate the effectiveness of our construction. Our PWS scheme runs 1.48 ∼ 3.63 × 1.48∼3.63× faster than the original CVH framework.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rough sets (FRSs) can be served as a useful technique to cope with inconsistent data by providing a pair of lower and upper fuzzy rough approximations of a fuzzy concept. Diversified FRS models have been proposed over the years. Meanwhile, t-norms and t-conorms, as two binary aggregation operators, play a critical part in the construction of fuzzy rough approximation operators. Nevertheless, one of common properties of t-norms and t-conorms is that they all fulfill associativity. Additionally, the associativity plays an important role in discussing properties of FRSs. Therefore, if the binary aggregation function does not satisfy associativity, how to define FRS models and discuss the relevant properties is a topic worthy of further investigation. Overlap functions, as a new kind of not necessary associative binary aggregation operator, have been continuously investigated by many scholars in theory and practical applications. Therefore, based on the advantages of overlap functions, and as the extension models for FRSs, we propose two new types of FRSs via overlap functions and their residual implications (or called I O IO -implications) in this paper. More specifically, we first give the definition of the 1 st 1st type of FRSs and study some essential properties. Subsequently, the definition of the 2 nd 2nd type of FRSs is presented and the relevant properties are also investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between the 1 st 1st type of FRSs and the 2 nd 2nd type of FRSs is described. That is, in a fuzzy approximation space, the 2 nd 2nd type of lower approximation is contained in the 1 st 1st type of lower approximation, while the 1 st 1st type of upper approximation is included in the 2 nd 2nd type of upper approximation when the overlap function has 1 as the identity element. At the end, a novel three-way decision (3WD) method is presented on an information table by using the new type of FRSs, and its practicality and superiority are verified via a numerical example and a series of experimental analyses.},

  abstract     = {To solve the poor performance of reinforcement learning (RL) in the multi-agent flocking cooperative control under the communication-restricted environments, we propose a multi-agent cooperative RL (MACRL) method based on the equivalent characteristics of the agents in the flocking task. A distance graph attention (GAT) mechanism is introduced into the policy network of the proposed MACRL to change the agent’s attention weights related to neighbors and reduce the influence of remote neighbors which have poor communication quality on the agent’s behavioral decision-making. Furthermore, a distance GAT-based MACRL (DGAT-MACRL) algorithm is proposed for multi-agent flocking control in the communication-restricted environment. The simulation results show that the proposed flocking algorithm has good adaptability to the communication delay and the communication distance constraint environments. The flocking control effect is significantly better than other RL-based flocking algorithms and traditional flocking algorithms. In addition, the good experimental performance has also confirmed that the proposed DGAT-MACRL is an effective solution to the problem of how to improve the adaptability of traditional RL to the flocking control system with a dynamic scale. Our algorithm provides a novel and practical algorithm offering an effective method for the cooperative task accomplished by multi-agent in non-ideal environments.},

Recent works mainly utilize conventional reward signals to train a representation that converts POMDPs to MDPs. However, rewards alone are not enough for a good representation without temporal information. In this paper, we first introduce a novel Recurrent Prediction Model to integrate temporal information into the representation that solves POMDP problems by training three additional unsupervised prediction models, named transition model, reward recovery model, and observation recovery model. This paper secondly makes a modification of the data structure of vanilla replay buffer to reduce the memory usage and thirdly proposes an off-policy correction algorithm to decrease the policy lag in POMDPs. The experiments show that our model achieves better performance in partially observable environments on both stand-alone and distributed training systems.},

  abstract     = {The integration of deep learning (DL) and fuzzy learning (FL) is considered a recently emerging and promising research direction in data embedding. The integrated fuzzy neural learning paradigm within deep learning-based recommendation helped improving the performance of both latent feature representation learning and multiple recommendation problem fine-tuning. In general, feature representation learning is considered an important component of modern deep-learning based recommendation systems (RS). However, many well-known deep learning-based recommendation techniques encounter major challenges, which are mainly related to data uncertainty and the presence of noise in the obtained user and item embeddings. Moreover, most of the deep embedding-based RSs have still relied much on the local proximity relationships. These proximity features are obtained from the direct user-item interactions in order to leverage the recommendation outputs. This limitation has led to several difficulties in effectively extracting the rich latent structural features of users and items. In addition, in previous meta -path-based embedding techniques for the HIN-based recommendation approach, the integration between multi-type path-based representation learning for recommendation often encounters challenges concerning feature uncertainty extraction. To overcome the aforementioned problems, in this paper we propose a novel fuzzy-driven HIN embedding model for recommendation, called FuzzyRec. The proposed FuzzyRec has an integrated hierarchical fused neural fuzzy and deep network-based embedding architecture. It supports effective learning of the representations of users and items, as well as reducing feature ambiguity and noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and its advantages compared with state-of-the-art baselines for recommendation systems.},

  abstract     = {Cross-modal retrieval aims to narrow the heterogeneity gap between different modalities, such as retrieving images through texts or vice versa. One of the key challenges of cross-modal retrieval is the inconsistent distribution across diverse modalities. Most existing methods tend to construct a common representation subspace to overcome the challenge. However, the supervision information is not fully explored in most single-path cross-modal learning approaches. In this paper, we present a novel Parallel Learned generative adversarial network with Multi-path Subspaces (PLMS) for cross-modal retrieval. PLMS is a parallel learned architecture that aims to capture more effective information in an end-to-end trained cross-modal retrieval model . To be specific, a dual-branch network is constructed in the modality-specific generator, thereby the overall framework learns two common subspaces to emphasize discrepant supervision information and preserve more effective transformed features. We further design two objective functions for the training of the dual branches in generators. Through joint training, the feature representations generated by dual branches in a specific modality are fused for similarity measurement between modalities. To avoid redundancy and overlap during fusion, a Multi-source Domain Balancing (MDB) mechanism is presented to explore the contribution of the two specific-task branches. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method is effective and achieves state-of-the-art results on four widely-used databases.},

However, the use of k -VCC model may cause resolution issues; thus, we use the k -relaxed-vertex connected component ( k -RVCC) model, which effectively eliminates the problem. A k -RVCC is also a connected graph , but to disconnect it, at least n - k n-k vertices must be removed, n is the vertex number of the graph. In this study, we investigate efficient practical algorithms for listing all maximal k -RVCCs from a given graph. Specifically, we first adapted the celebrate Bron-Kerbosch tree-search algorithm from listing cliques to listing k -RVCCs. We then design new branching rules to reduce the number of branches and vertex-cut-based strategies to recursively partition the input graph into smaller independent pieces. Implementation techniques that accelerate the aforementioned algorithms were also investigated. Experiments on various large real networks validated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and demonstrated the efficiency of our algorithms in mining cohesive groups.},

Under the condition of B -bounded strong connectivity, and some mild assumptions on sensing functions, the distributed estimator achieves consistent parameter estimates by selecting an appropriate stepsize. Furthermore, we also analyze the asymptotic property of the weighted estimate error sequence, including the asymptotic mean and asymptotic covariance. It is shown that the performance is consistent with that of a widely used centralized estimator and a distributed estimator over a fixed directed communication topology.

This paper addresses this issue from three aspects: modeling, proposition, and methodology. First, a succinct competitive model is built to clear the final beliefs of normal agents. Then, a cost-effective competition (CEC) problem is proposed by formulating the number of votes and the recruiting costs as two optimization objectives. Seeing the cost constraints, a theoretical cost budget is also determined. Next, a multi-objective optimization approach (MOCEC) with theoretical guarantees is developed to solve the CEC problem. In the experiments, MOCEC is compared with seven prevalent competitive methods on ten real-world social networks. We show that MOCEC can achieve the best trade-offs between maximizing the number of votes with minimizing the recruiting costs in all test environments. Especially when the number of votes reaches the maximum value, MOCEC can save up to 50\% of the recruiting costs than the best baseline.},

In this paper, we investigate the preferences-oriented online stable task assignment (POSTA) in which tasks arrive online and obey independent identical distribution (i.i.d.). First, we construct a weighted partite graph G G and formulate the POSTA problem based on G G . Then, prove it to be NP-complete. To measure the weight of edges, we design a utility estimation method. Second, we formulate the linear programming model of POSTA and obtain the solution. Next, we solve the maximum weighted matching of G G . Based on these two solutions, we design the algorithm utilizing two suggested matching (TSM) technology to obtain the combination solution, which guides the algorithm for matching. Then, we analyze the competitive ratio . Finally, we examine the performance of the proposed method through extensive experiments.

However, almost all unsupervised methods only identify outliers based on the score of individual outliers, ignoring the similarity among instances. Highly similar samples within a neighborhood region have the same behavior. Based on this, we propose an outlier detection system based on group similarity. The proposed system groups similar instances within a neighborhood region together, then evaluates the resulting groups by using the underlying measure, and finally makes a decision based on the outlierness of groups to detect outliers. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed scheme brings performance improvements for unsupervised outlier detection.},

To address the above problems, firstly, we use Gini coefficient to quantify the fairness of federated learning, which can reflect the fairness of federated learning process in each round.

Many methods have been proposed for its possible solution, including, but not limited to, exact algorithms, approximate algorithms , heuristic algorithms , and solution solvers. However, these methods cannot learn the problem’s internal structure nor generalize to similar or larger-scale problems. Recently, deep reinforcement learning has been applied to combinatorial optimization and has achieved convincing results. Nevertheless, the challenge of effective integration and training improvement still exists. In this study, we propose a novel framework (BDRL) that combines BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and deep reinforcement learning to tackle combinatorial optimization over graphs by treating general optimization problems as data points under an identified data distribution. We first improved the transformer encoder of BERT to embed the combinatorial optimization graph effectively. By employing contrastive objectives, we extend BERT-like training to reinforcement learning and acquire self-attention-consistent representations. Next, we used hierarchical reinforcement learning to pre-train our model; that is, to train and fine-tune the model through an iterative process to make it more suitable for a specific combinatorial optimization problem . The results demonstrate our proposed framework’s generalization ability , efficiency, and effectiveness in multiple tasks.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal multi-objective problems (MMOPs) arise frequently in the real world, in which multiple Pareto optimal solution (PS) sets correspond to the same objective set. Traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) show poor performance in solving MMOPs due to a lack of diversity maintenance in the decision space. Thus, recently, many multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMEAs) have been proposed. However, for most existing MMEAs, they generally have an over-convergence phenomenon, leading to the deterioration of the diversity of the decision space. To address these issues, this paper proposes a MMEAs based on independently evolving sub-problems. The sub-problem independent evolution method fits the definition of MMOPs because sub-problems form meaningful niches when they converge gradually, ensuring the convergence of the objective space, and enhancing the diversity of the decision space. In the environmental selection phase, we propose a two-stage environmental selection strategy that can guarantee both the convergence of the objective space and the distribution of the decision space. Finally, we refer to the k-nearest neighbor deletion strategy in the decision space to guarantee the distributivity of each equivalent PS. The experimental results show that our algorithm has higher competitive performance than seven other state-of-the-art MMEAs on two series of test functions.},

For small datasets, kernel methods , such as kernel support vector machines (SVMs), show good generalization performance with high-dimensional feature mapping. However, kernel SVMs have a fundamental weakness in achieving differential privacy because they construct decision functions based on a subset of the training data called support vectors. Furthermore, multi-class SVMs must decompose the training data into a binary class, which requires multiple accesses to the same training data. To address these limitations, we develop a two-phase classification algorithm based on support vector data description (SVDD). We first generate and prove a differentially private SVDD (DP-SVDD) by perturbing the sphere center in a high-dimensional feature space. Next, we partition the input space using a dynamical system and classify the partitioned regions using a noisy count.

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the use of differential evolution to improve the approximation properties of function approximation models based on fuzzy partitions . Two cases are considered: Fuzzy transform and Fuzzy projection, and the design of hybrid evolutionary fuzzy systems, is studied. Even though function approximation techniques based on fuzzy partitions have been well studied, few papers consider the problem of centroid selection of the basis functions. Thus, in most cases uniform fuzzy partitions are considered. By using an evolutionary algorithm a systematic approach on the selection of the partition, is provided. The optimisation problem involves the determination of the model parameters, which in our case are the fuzzy partition’s membership functions’ locations. The proposed method is tested on the scattered data approximation problem, in a regression sense, that is given a set of sparse data the latent function is approximated. Numerical studies on one and two-dimensional test functions demonstrate that the evolutionary algorithm based fuzzy projection displays high performance in terms of approximation error. Moreover, the proposed approach shows high approximation capabilities with a small number of basis functions. Comparison results, with uniform fuzzy partition models, neural networks and support vector machines , are provided.},

The channel fading phenomenon is considered, where the fading rates are depicted by a random variable distributed over a certain interval with known statistical properties. Different from the reported relevant results, all subsystems of the considered switched fuzzy delayed systems can be unstable. To conquer the faultiness of the existing min-switching mechanism for switched delayed systems in discrete-time domain, the improved state-dependent switching paradigm and Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) are constructed. As a result, sufficient conditions with less conservativeness are formulated. In addition, we have shown that the concerned filtering error system is asymptotically mean-square stable (AMSS) and possesses a standard ℓ 2 ℓ2 performance level.

The main theory of the bipolar complex fuzzy set is the fusion of two different theories, called bipolar fuzzy set and complex fuzzy set. The bipolar complex fuzzy set contained two different grades, called positive membership grade which is considered a positive aspect of the problem, and negative membership grade which is considered a negative aspect of the problem, both contain in a unit square of complex plane. The major analysis of this theory is to diagnose the interrelationship among any number of attributes. For this, we defined various Aczel-Alsina operational laws and proved their influential results. Further, by using the Aczel-Alsina operational laws and bipolar complex fuzzy information, we diagnosed the theory of bipolar complex fuzzy Aczel-Alsina weighted averaging (BCFAAWA), bipolar complex fuzzy Aczel-Alsina ordered weighted averaging (BCFAAOWA), and bipolar complex fuzzy Aczel-Alsina hybrid averaging (BCFAAHA) operators. To modify the influence of the explored work, we discussed various important results and some properties (Idempotency, Monotonicity, and Boundedness) of the proposed work. Additionally, we computed a multi-attribute decision-making rule under the presence of the initiated approaches and tried to justify it with the help of some examples.

This study proposes a rumor-forwarding trend prediction model that combines user awareness and multi-type rumor to address such challenges. First, considering the abstraction of user awareness under multi-type rumors, we extract features by cascading user behavior , historical activities, interactions, and activity levels and by fusing features using a two-layer fully connected network to effectively quantify the relevant features of user awareness. Second, considering the limitations of traditional text representation in semantic context understanding, we use the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) pre-training model to characterize the text in the topic, obtain text representation sequence with contextual relationships, and propose an Improved Cuckoo Search (ICS) method that optimizes the hyperparameters of the temporal convolutional network (TCN) model. Finally, an Improved Cuckoo Search-TCN-based rumor-forwarding trend prediction model is constructed based on user awareness features and text representation sequences to predict the rumor-forwarding trend. Certain rumors with a large potential impact range can be monitored at the early dissemination stage.},

Real-world occlusions lead to invisible facial regions and contaminated facial features , which undoubtedly increase the difficulty of FER in the wild. Therefore, a Patch Attention Convolutional Vision Transformer (PACVT) is proposed to tackle the occlusion FER problem. The backbone convolutional neural network is used to extract facial feature maps, which are cropped into multiple regional patches to extract local and global features. The Patch Attention Unit (PAU) is designed to perceive occluded regions by adaptively calculating the patch-level attention weights of local features for expression recognition. The facial patches are mapped into sequences of visual tokens, and the Vision Transformer (ViT) is employed to capture the interactions and correlations between these visual tokens from a global perspective. The self-attention in ViT enables the PACVT to focus on the salient patches with discriminative features and ignore the occlusion. Experiments are conducted on three widely used expression datasets and their occlusion subsets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed PACVT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on occlusion FER. Cross-dataset experiment results evidence the generalization ability of the PACVT.},

To enhance model interpretability , reinforcement learning (RL) based methods are proposed. However, RL-based solutions suffer from two major issues. The first is aimless exploration due to the limited observation information. The second is delayed and sparse rewards caused by weak supervision. To bridge the gap, we propose an interpretable model based on RL for multi-hop KGQA with weak supervision, which we refer to as A nticipation R easoning N etwork (ARN) that incorporates KG embeddings as anticipation information into RL framework to avoid aimlessly traversing in KG. ARN achieves the goal via three steps. (1) KG embedding models represent the entities and relations as low-dimensional vectors. (2) We propose a knowledge embedding based question answering (KEQA) framework to measure the plausibility of the “triple” &amp;lt; topic entity, question, answer entity &gt; &amp;gt; in embedding space. (3) A policy-guided agent is designed to perform effective path reasoning by selecting the most promising action at each step. Moreover, we utilize reward shaping strategy and actor-critic optimization to alleviate the problem of low-quality rewards. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the effectiveness of our method footnoteFor reproducibility, we publicly release the code at https://github.com/iDylanCui/ARN .},

Motivated by the superiority of the generative adversarial network (GAN) in data synthesizing, we present a differentially private generative decomposed adversarial network (DPGDAN) approach for vertically partitioned data sharing. In DPGDAN, the discriminator in the initial GAN is decomposed into several local discriminators and two relational discriminators, i.e., a real relational discriminator and a fake relational discriminator. Each party is assigned with a local discriminator while the curator holds the generator and the two relational discriminators. By combining the sanitized feedback from the local discriminators and the outputs of the relational discriminators, the curator can update the generator to approximate the distribution of the integrated dataset without compromising each party’s privacy. Moreover, to promote the shared data’s utility, we design a snapshot aggregation method by aggregating the synthetic records produced by the generators acquired during training. Furthermore, we show that DPGDAN satisfies ∊ ( ∊ , δ ) (∊,δ) - differential privacy . Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DPGDAN.},

However, COVID-19 infections continue to rise in many nations and some sporadic cases occur from time to time in China, which still poses some risks to the resumption. Hence, it is imperative to develop some reasonable techniques to assess the resumption risk. This paper aims to investigate an integrated interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) technique to adroitly assess the resumption risk based on DEMATEL (decision making trial and evaluation laboratory), BWM (best-worst method) and SPA (set pair analysis). This integrated technique is called IVIF-DBWM-SPA, where the IVIF-DBWM (combined by the IVIF-DEMATEL and IVIF-BWM) is used to determine the global criteria weights and the IVIF-SPA is employed to generate the ranking order of the alternatives. The IVIF-DEMATEL and IVIF-BWM are used to determine the weights of dimensions and the weights of criteria under each dimension, respectively. In this IVIF-BWM, two bi-objective programming models are constructed by regarding experts’ pessimistic and optimistic attitudes, respectively. Combined experts’ intrapersonal and interpersonal uncertainties simultaneously, a bi-objective programming model is proposed to derive the dynamic weights of experts. Based on the determined weights of experts and criteria, an IVIF-SPA is developed to assess the risk levels of all alternatives. The validity of the proposed technique is demonstrated with a real case of college resumption risk assessment amid COVID-19. Some sensitivity and comparison analyses are provided to show the merits of the proposed technique.},

This article first proves that effective weighting can improve the discrimination between modalities. Therefore, this paper takes into account the importance differences between multiple modalities, and assigns weights to them through the importance attention network . At the same time, considering that there is a certain complementary relationship between the modalities, this paper constructs an attention network with complementary modalities.

  abstract     = {Due to its wide coverage and strong scalability, spatial crowdsourcing (SC) has become a research hotspot in recent years. In order to assign tasks to closer workers, it is necessary for workers to provide accurate locations to the server. However, it will result in the leakage of the participants’ location privacy. Existing works provide each worker with the same level of location privacy protection, which cannot meet the different privacy requirements of various workers. In addition, most works assume that the tasks are single-location tasks, and do not consider multi-location tasks. In this paper, we propose the Multi-location Task Allocation Problem with personalized location privacy protection (MLTAP). As far as we know, we are the first to study MLTAP. We propose a Multi-location task Allocation framework with Personalized location Privacy-protecting (MAPP). In order to allocate tasks efficiently, we use the R-tree to store workers and minimum bounding rectangle to represent multi-location tasks, thus filtering the unreachable workers for tasks. To better eliminate the adverse effect of location confusion, the SC server sorts candidate workers by the ranking metrics and allocates multi-location tasks efficiently. Finally, we conduct experiments to verify that MAPP has good performance in terms of utility.},

More specifically, each pairwise comparison is performed through information granules instead of single numbers, by using an optimal allocation of information granularity . Further, we develop an optimization model that considers both consistency and consensus in one problem. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used as an optimization method to find the optimal particle of the granular decision model. Furthermore, a new convergent iterative algorithm is developed to obtain the desired decision matrix. Next, an experimental study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and essence of the proposed model.

  abstract     = {As an effective optimization tool, artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, ABC still shows unsatisfactory performance in solving complex optimization problems . Although many ABC variants have been developed, the structural features of problems have been rarely considered, which have a significant effect on algorithm performance. Therefore, a novel ABC variant, called FLABC, is proposed by designing an online fitness landscape analysis technique. In this technique, the population is considered as a sample of the fitness landscape, and the idea of dispersion metric is used to identify the landscape features. According to the identified features, the solution search equations with distinct characteristics can be adaptively used, which helps adapt the search to the fitness landscape. In addition, FLABC has another two modifications, i.e., the dynamic multiple subpopulations and modified scout bee phase. In the experiments, FLABC is verified on two well-known test suites (CEC2013 and CEC2015) and two real-world optimization problems . Seven well-established ABC variants and five non-ABC variants are included in the performance comparison, and the results verify that FLABC has very competitive performance, especially on the functions with rugged fitness landscapes.},

  abstract     = {Scenario generation is a pivotal method for providing system operators with a reasonable quantity of power scenarios that are capable of reflecting uncertainties and spatiotemporal processes to make exact and effective decisions for power systems . Aiming at improving the forecasting performance of renewable generation and capturing uncertainty as well as dependency over renewable site groups in different regions, this paper proposes a data-driven approach for parallel scenario generation. To capture the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of renewable energy sources (RESs), the proposed approach utilizes Gramian angular field (GAF) to process time sequences and constructs style-based super-resolution models that correspond with the idea of multi-model ensembles. Thereafter, a two-stage stochastic optimization strategy is adopted to accomplish scenario forecasting using point forecasts and historical error information as input. Based on two real-world datasets from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Belgian transmission operator ELIA, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by methods including statistical analysis, spatiotemporal correlations, power system scheduling, and out-of-sample evaluations. Compared with three advanced benchmarks, the proposed approach has superior forecasting performance and spatiotemporal dynamic capture capability. At a 24-h lead time, the proposed model achieves continuous ranked probability scores (CRPSs) of 4–14\% over the other models with consistent performance during the economic dispatching of actual power system operations .},

How to design a completely distributed event-triggered adaptive output feedback protocols for multi-agent systems with a derivable leader on directed graphs is an open issue. In order to overcome the difficulty of designing the controller without complete state information, we design the event-triggered output feedback protocol, and with the help of σ σ -modification techniques, ensure the boundedness of the adaptive law in proposed protocol. The conditions to ensure the realization of the leader–follower consensus and exclude Zeno behavior are given. Furthermore, the control protocol is fully distributed and uses neighbor information only when the event trigger conditions are satisfied. Finally, the availability of the proposed protocol is illustrated by simulation examples.},

However, real-world datasets often do not cover the necessary complexity space required to understand an algorithm’s domains of competence. As such, the generation of synthetic datasets to fill gaps in the complexity space has gained attention, offering a means of evaluating algorithms when data is unavailable. Existing approaches to complexity-focused data generation are limited in their ability to generate solutions that invoke similar classification behaviour to real data. The present work proposes a novel method (Sy:Boid) for complexity-based synthetic data generation, adapting and extending the Boid algorithm that was originally intended for computer graphics simulations. Sy:Boid embeds the modified Boid algorithm within an evolutionary multi-objective optimisation algorithm to generate synthetic datasets which satisfy predefined magnitudes of complexity measures . Sy:Boid is evaluated and compared to labelling-based and sampling-based approaches to data generation to understand its ability to generate a wide variety of realistic datasets. Results demonstrate Sy:Boid is capable of generating datasets across a greater portion of the complexity space than existing approaches.

In view of the above problems, we construct the body part relation reasoning network (BPRRN). It aims to explore and utilize the common-sense knowledge in human bodies to reason human activities. Firstly, ten body part boxes are generated from each human body with the help of pose estimation and part classification functions. Secondly, with the states of each body part, the relationships between different body parts are explored and utilized for constructing the body part relation reasoning module (BPRRM). Finally, the body part relation reasoning features from each frame are adopted for temporal modeling with the temporal relation reasoning module (TRRM). In this way, the context association between video frames are constructed, which further promotes the reasoning ability of BPRRN.

Some multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms have been proposed for ITLC, and most of them use deep neural networks to make decisions. However, the abundant parameters of deep structure lead to the time-consuming training process of MADRL. Recently, a broad reinforcement learning (BRL) approach has been proposed to improve the efficiency of training for an agent. Unlike MADRL algorithms that use deep architecture, BRL utilizes a broad architecture. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent broad reinforcement learning (MABRL) algorithm for ITLC. The MABRL algorithm adopts the broad network to process the joint information and updates the parameters using ridge regression. To increase the effectiveness of interaction among agents, we design a dynamic interaction mechanism (DIM) based on the attention mechanism . The DIM enables agents to aggregate information on particular intersections at appropriate moments. We conduct experiments on three different datasets. The results demonstrate that the effectiveness of MABRL outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in alleviating traffic congestion with shorter training time.},

  abstract     = {The objective and constraints of expensive constrained optimization problems (ECOPs) are often evaluated using simulations with different computational costs. However, the existing algorithms always assume that both the objective and constraints can be simultaneously obtained after one expensive simulation, i.e., the most time-consuming one among the evaluations, based on parallel computing. This will affect the optimization efficiency since it is not necessary to call all the simulations of objective and constraints for each solution. Therefore, a general framework of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (GF-SAEAs) is proposed to adaptively arrange search strategies based on actual simulation cost differences. Specifically, all constraints are classified into several constraint levels by effectively quantifying the computational cost differences of objective and constraints, and a level-by-level feasible region-driven local search strategy is designed to locate potential sub-feasible regions for each constraint level. Then three different search mechanisms are employed to explore and exploit these located regions. Additionally, an adaptive population regeneration strategy is utilized to restart the algorithm and prevent premature convergence. In summary, GF-SAEAs can maintain a good balance between feasibility and convergence. Experimental studies on benchmark problems and two real-world cases show that GF-SAEAs performs better than other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Here we introduce the inter-layer mutual confirmation mechanism into the information-disease interacting dynamics on multiplex networks. In our model, an individual increases the information transmission rate and willingness to adopt protective measures once he confirms the authenticity of news and severity of disease from neighbors’ status in multiple layers. By using the microscopic Markov chain approach, we analytically calculate the epidemic threshold and the awareness and infected density in the stationary state, which agree well with simulation results. We find that the increment of epidemic threshold when confirming the aware neighbors on communication layer is larger than that of the contact layer. On the contrary, the confirmation of neighbors’ awareness and infection from the contact layer leads to a lower final infection density and a higher awareness density than that from the communication layer. The results imply that individuals’ explicit disclosure of their infection and awareness status to neighbors, especially those with real contacts, is helpful in suppressing epidemic spreading.},

However, in many real-world optimization problems , these evaluations involve computationally expensive numerical simulations or physical experiments. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have recently gained increased attention for their performance in solving these types of problems. The main idea of SAEAs is the integration of an evolutionary algorithm with a selected surrogate model that approximates the computationally expensive function. In this paper, we propose a surrogate model based on a Lipschitz underestimation and use it to develop a differential evolution-based algorithm. The algorithm, called Lipschitz Surrogate-assisted Differential Evolution (LSADE), utilizes the Lipschitz-based surrogate model, along with a standard radial basis function surrogate model and a local search procedure. The experimental results on seven benchmark functions of dimensions 30, 50, 100, and 200 show that the proposed LSADE algorithm is competitive compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms under a limited computational budget, being especially effective for the very complicated benchmark functions in high dimensions .},

Secondly, the dominant individuals generated by LSHADE-RSP are used to establish the probability distribution model for EDA to enhance its exploitation in each generation, and a new control parameter is introduced to balance exploitation and exploration. Then, the use of greed strategy works via EDA to fully retain high-quality solutions to the next generation to improve the convergence speed. Finally, the greedy strategy is used to shrink the external archive when its size decreases due to the reduction of the population size. A comparison of IDE-EDA with cutting-edge DE-based and EDA-based variants, including AAVS-EDA, EB-LSHADE, ELSHADE-SPACMA, jSO, LSHADE-RSP, RWGEDA, HSES, and APGSK-IMODE, was implemented to verify its efficiency.

DPSS-RBFNN includes the discriminant preserving support subspace (DPSS) learning module and the subspace distribution feature extraction (SDFE) module. In the DPSS learning module, the discriminativeness of each attribute and the joint discriminant between attributes are first considered to construct multiple subspaces. The discriminativeness of the features in these subspaces is not lower than that of the original samples. The graph similarity learning is used to measure the similarity of sample distributions between subspaces with different dimensions. Then multiple DPSSs are obtained. In SDFE module, the distribution characteristics of the samples are described by combining the local responses of the feature space extracted by the sub-RBFNN in each DPSS. The experimental results show that the proposed DPSS-RBFNN with few kernels can achieve higher accuracy in the recognition task than state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Advertising using the word-of-mouth effect is quite effective in promoting products. In the last decade, there has been intensive research studying the influence maximization problem in marketing. The problem of influence maximization aims to identify a small group of people in the social network as seeds such that eventually, they will trigger the largest influence spread or product adoption in the network. In practical scenarios of online marketing, it is common that there are competitions among similar products in the network and the promotion is targeted at specific groups of users. For instance, an event organizer disseminates an event ad on a social platform hoping to attract attention of the most number of local residents. Meanwhile, there are multiple competing events being promoted on the social platform. In this paper, we formulate such problem as Targeted Influence Maximization in Competitive social networks (TIMC). To model the influence diffusion, we combine the target nodes and competitive relationships into an independent cascade model. We propose a Reverse Reachable set-based Greedy (RRG) algorithm to solve the TIMC problem and theoretically proved its approximation ratio. We also design a pruning strategy to further speed up the performance of the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments have confirmed the efficiency of the proposed RRG algorithm. We also find that the algorithm works particularly well for sparse large networks with strong competition.},

  abstract     = {The rise of reinforcement learning (RL) has guided a new paradigm: unraveling the intervention strategies to control systems with unknown dynamics. Model-free RL provides an exhaustive framework to devise therapeutic methods to alter the regulatory dynamics of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). This paper presents an RL-based technique to control GRNs modeled as probabilistic Boolean control networks (PBCNs). In particular, a double deep- Q network (DD Q N) approach is proposed to address the sampled-data control (SDC) problem of PBCNs, and optimal state feedback controllers are obtained, rendering the PBCNs stabilized at a given equilibrium point. Our approach is based on options , i.e., the temporal abstractions of control actions in the Markov decision processes (MDPs) framework. First, we define options and hierarchical options and give their properties. Then, we introduce multi-time models to compute the optimal policies leveraging the options framework. Furthermore, we present a DD Q N algorithm: i) to concurrently design the feedback controller and the sampling period; ii) wherein the controller intelligently decides the sampled period to update the control actions under the SDC scheme. The presented method is model-free and offers scalability, thereby providing an efficient way to control large-scale PBCNs. Finally, we compare our control policy with state-of-the-art control techniques and validate the presented results.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the synchronization problem of chaotic Lur’e systems by using partial sampled-data information. First, a useful lemma is established on the basis of discrete-time Lyapunov theory and interval estimate methods, which contributes to the stability of partial sampled-data control (PSC) systems. According to the features of the designed control scheme, a single-interval-dependent functional and a double-intervals-dependent functional are constructed by utilizing the corresponding interval information, respectively. Unlike the previous Lyapunov functional methods, the proposed functionals are essentially continuous and then some additional constraint conditions are removed. Then, based on several inequality methods, two sufficient criteria dependent on the controller gain, sampling period, and allowable data loss ratio (ADLR), are respectively developed to guarantee the global synchronization of Lur’e systems. Additionally, the quantitative analysis about the ADLR is discussed. Compared with the existing results, the developed interval-dependent functional techniques are beneficial to enlarging the ADLR. Finally, illustrative examples and an application to image encryption are given to demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

As a result, researchers developed methods to diagnose COVID-19. However, these methods have several limitations. Therefore, presenting new methods is essential to improve the diagnosis of COVID-19. Recently, investigation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals becoming an easy way to detect COVID-19 since the ECG process is non-invasive and easy to use. Therefore, we proposed in this paper a novel end-to-end deep learning model (ECG-COVID) based on ECG for COVID-19 detection. We employed several deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on a dataset of 1109 ECG images, which is built for screening the perception of COVID-19 and cardiac patients. After that, we selected the most efficient model as our model for evaluation. The proposed model is end-to-end where the input ECG images are fed directly to the model for the final decision without using any additional stages. The proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 98.81\%, Precision of 98.8\%, Sensitivity of 98.8\% and, F1-score of 98.81\% for COVID-19 detection. As cases of corona continue to rise and hospitalizations continue again, hospitals may find our study helpful when dealing with these patients who did not get significantly worse.},

  abstract     = {The ability to resist interference is the key to the widespread application of reinforcement learning . Although adversarial training is a promising method for robust promotion, standard adversarial training leads to unstable results or performance deterioration due to the presence of perturbation. To address the problem, a robust reinforcement learning method which integrates safety constraints that are modelled by environment termination conditions into adversarial training is proposed, where safety constraints are adopted to restrict agent’s actions and guide the training process. For better modelling the robust reinforcement learning problem, a modified constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP) that considers perturbation for robust reinforcement learning, named Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with Perturbation (CMDPP) is also introduced. The proposed safe robust reinforcement learning method based on CMDPP utilizes the penalty function to solve CMDP and generates perturbation from the gradient of state for adversarial training. Tests on the robustness of the proposed method under several attack methods and evaluation of generalization through changing environment dynamics were carried out on the OpenAI gym and Roboschool environments. The results demonstrate that our method not only has a better performance confronting the attack but also has a higher generalization capability with reference to the changing environment dynamics.},

However, timely response to emergencies and recovering from an emergency is an important problem in itself. The strategies in the current studies merely suggest that after an emergency vehicle passes, the state should iterate to the next phase. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach for recovering from an emergency situation at an intersection based on real scenarios. The proposed method is a combination of context-aware and Reinforcement Learning (RL) models that predicts better alternatives for different states rather than just iterating to the next phase. In this regard, a new algorithm, named Interrupt Algorithm, is proposed to predict proper actions for recovering the emergency situation. This algorithm uses a Q-learning-based model that learns from traffic context for an emergency situation and chooses viable action from an action set. The recovery actions are categorized as max, min, and avg , respectively. Test results show that our proposed model outperforms traffic flow over than standard single choice recovering action-based approach by approximately 80\%. Based on this, it may be more beneficial to choose different actions and therefore, proposed algorithm with the help of RL presents a more dynamic emergency recovery model.},

This makes possible to learn a robust characterization of the problem with an explainable architecture, understanding the motivation of the choice that the neural network does. This is due to the attention in the transformer that uses the representational capacity of tokens that allows one to identify, simply with respect to different architectures and methodologies, where all the interest is focused.

Intra-cluster agents are in continuous communication with their intra-cluster neighbors during the communication period, whereas only the inter-cluster leaders can communicate with other leaders at a series of discrete moments, known as the reset time. Thus this paper presents a reduced-order observer-based reset output feedback controller that solves the output synchronization problem associated with the linear heterogeneous CMAS. Specifically, a reset internal model is built to solve the output synchronization for each agent, and a reset reduced-order observer is developed to estimate the unavailable states of each agent. Then an output feedback control strategy is developed using only the output information, internal model state, and observer state. Sufficient conditions are also obtained for ensuring the output synchronization of the CMAS. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely employed to solve log anomaly detection and outperform a range of conventional methods. They have attained such striking success because they can usually explore and extract semantic information from a large volume of log data, which helps to infer complex log anomaly patterns more accurately. Despite its success in generalization accuracy, this data-driven approach can still suffer from a high vulnerability to adversarial attacks , which severely limits its practical use. To address this issue, several studies have proposed anomaly detectors to equip neural networks to improve their robustness. These anomaly detectors are built based on effective adversarial attack methods. Therefore, effective adversarial attack approaches are important for developing more efficient anomaly detectors, thereby improving neural network robustness. In this study, we propose two strong and effective black-box attackers, an attention-based and a gradient-based attacker, to defeat three target systems: MLP, AutoEncoder , and DeepLog. Our approach facilitates the generation of more effective adversarial examples with the help of the analysis of vulnerable logkeys. The proposed attention-based attacker leverages attention weights to achieve vulnerable logkeys and derive adversarial examples, which are implemented using our previously developed attention-based convolutional neural network model. The proposed gradient-based attacker calculates gradients based on potential vulnerable logkeys to seek an optimal adversarial sample. The experimental results showed that these two approaches significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art attacker model log anomaly mask (LAM). In particular, owing to its optimization, the proposed gradient-based attacker approach can significantly increase the misclassification rate on three target models, yields a 70\% successful attack rate on DeepLog and greatly exceeds the baseline by 52\%.},

One of the notable works is the development of a model for detecting noisy labels in large-scale data sets for supervised classification . This paper introduces a new method for noisy label detection that combines the support vector data description (SVDD) model with manifold regularization . The proposed method is able to detect the noisy label in the testing set. In addition, we adopt K nearest neighbors to obtain the K -nearest neighbor graph, and the k -core algorithm is used to select noise nodes by selecting the influential nodes with larger k values in the K -NN graph. Experimental results over UCI data sets show that the manifold regularized SVDD can effectively detect the noise labels data, and presents better performance over most methods in terms of the outlier detection accuracy, and the average accuracy is mostly above 50\%\% , even 100\%\% . Moreover, manifold regularized SVDD has good performance in detecting the most influential top- k nodes compared with other methods.},

Moreover, since exact approaches to solving similarity queries can be complex and time-consuming, alternative options have emerged to reduce query execution time, such as returning approximate results or resorting to distributed computing platforms. In this paper, we introduce MASK (Multilevel Approximate Similarity search with k -means), an unconventional application of the k -means algorithm as the foundation of a multilevel index structure for approximate similarity search suitable for metric spaces. We show that this method leverages inherent properties of k -means for this purpose, like representing high-density data areas with fewer prototypes. An implementation of this new indexing procedure is evaluated using a synthetic dataset and two real-world datasets in high-dimensional and high-sparsity spaces. Experimental tests show that MASK performs better than alternative algorithms for approximate similarity search.

The payoffs of different strategies are not directly given a priori in the noncooperative part but obtained by solving interval cooperative games in the cooperative part. To solve the interval cooperative game, we extend a real-valued weighted equal contribution division (WECD) approach to an interval-valued version. Subsequently, an interval acceptability degree comparison method is introduced to compare the interval payoff values. We then establish existence and necessary conditions of pure strategy Nash equilibriums and derive a condition for a Nash equilibrium to be efficient in an interval biform game.

  abstract     = {Parameter tuning is a challenging and time-consuming task, crucial to obtaining improved metaheuristic performance. There is growing interest in cross-domain search methods, which consider a range of optimisation problems rather than being specialised for a single domain. Metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics are typically used as high-level cross-domain search methods, utilising problem-specific low-level heuristics for each problem domain to modify a solution. Such methods have a number of parameters to control their behaviour, whose initial settings can influence their search behaviour significantly. Previous methods in the literature either fix these parameters based on previous experience, or set them specifically for particular problem instances. There is a lack of extensive research investigating the tuning of these parameters systematically. In this paper, F-Race is deployed as an automated cross-domain parameter tuning approach. The parameters of a steady-state memetic algorithm and the low-level heuristics used by this algorithm are tuned across nine single-objective problem domains, using different training strategies and budgets to investigate whether F-Race is capable of effectively tuning parameters for cross-domain search. The empirical results show that the proposed methods manage to find good parameter settings, outperforming many methods from the literature, with different configurations identified as the best depending upon the training approach used.},

  abstract     = {Many variants with various strategies have been proposed to improve the efficiency of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. These strategies are a precious resource waiting to be exploited. We conjecture that some new combinations of strategies selected from different PSO variants may better improve the performance of PSO . Inspired by this idea, this paper proposes a strategy learning framework to learn an optimal combination of strategies and thus derive a new PSO variant based on this combination. In this framework, a strategy pool with strategies selected from existing PSO variants is first constructed. Then, a training engine, implemented by an adaptive differential evolutionary algorithm , is employed to evaluate the performance of strategy combinations on training benchmark functions . Furthermore, a new PSO variant, named SLFPSO, is created based on the strategies learned from training results. This framework provides a novel method to design PSO variants by learning from existing algorithms through a learning mechanism. The performance and scalability of SLFPSO are compared with ten state-of-the-art PSO variants on 10/30/50/100-dimensional CEC2013/2014/2017 benchmark functions . The results verify that SLFPSO performs significantly better than the compared algorithms in most test scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is an algorithmic framework for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems , derived from an approximation to the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QAA). In solving combinatorial optimization problems with constraints in the context of QAOA, one needs to find a way to encode problem constraints into the scheme. In this paper, we propose and discuss several QAOA-based algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems with equality and/or inequality constraints . We formalize the encoding method of different types of constraints, and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme by providing examples and results for some well-known NP optimization problems. Compared to previous constraint-encoding methods, we argue our work leads to a more generalized framework for finding, in the context of QAOA, higher-quality approximate solutions to combinatorial problems with various types of constraints.},

  abstract     = {Sampling is a technique to help identify a representative data subset that captures the characteristics of the whole dataset. Most existing sampling algorithms require distribution assumptions of the multivariate data , which may not be available beforehand. This study proposes a new metric called Eigen-Entropy (EE), which is based on information entropy for the multivariate dataset. EE is a model-free metric because it is derived based on eigenvalues extracted from the correlation coefficient matrix without any assumptions on data distributions. We prove that EE measures the composition of the dataset, such as its heterogeneity or homogeneity. As a result, EE can be used to support sampling decisions, such as which samples and how many samples to consider with respect to the application of interest. To demonstrate the utility of the EE metric , two sets of use cases are considered. The first use case focuses on classification problems with an imbalanced dataset, and EE is used to guide the rendering of homogeneous samples from minority classes. Using 10 public datasets, it is demonstrated that two oversampling techniques using the proposed EE method outperform reported methods from the literature in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and G-mean. In the second experiment, building fault detection is investigated where EE is used to sample heterogeneous data to support fault detection . Historical normal datasets collected from real building systems are used to construct the baselines by EE for 14 test cases, and experimental results indicate that the EE method outperforms benchmark methods in terms of recall. We conclude that EE is a viable metric to support sampling decisions.},

  abstract     = {Recently, some researchers have explored three-way decision models in the fuzzy multi-criteria environments from the perspective of criterion fuzzy concept. The main characteristics of these models include the subjective preference of decision-maker for criteria and the evaluation value information system provided by decision-maker. However, the criterion fuzzy concept only considers the decision-maker’s membership preference to each criterion, and ignores the decision-maker’s non-membership preference to each criterion. In view of this, this paper further proposes a new criterion fuzzy concept, namely the intuitionistic fuzzy concept, to express decision-maker’s preference for each criterion. At the same time, we build an intuitionistic fuzzy concept-oriented three-way decision model to solve the ranking and classification problem in the intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria environments with decision-maker’s preference. Firstly, based on the defined intuitionistic fuzzy concept, we construct a new intuitionistic fuzzy loss function model. Meanwhile, using intuitionistic fuzzy similarity, we propose a new conditional probability calculation method to express the correlation degree between the intuitionistic fuzzy concept and alternative’s evaluation values. Secondly, we introduce three decision-making perspectives from the membership degree and non-membership degree of expected loss to obtain the final three-way classification scheme . Moreover, by combining the thresholds of the positive and negative perspectives, we obtain the comprehensive thresholds of the comprehensive perspective, which can be used to rank all alternatives. Finally, a supplier selection problem is used to verify the feasibility and superiority of the model, and six data sets are used to verify the applicability of the model.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view clustering usually yields better results than single-view clustering since it utilizes more information from multi-view data. However, in the original multi-view data, some samples may be corrupted in partial views. Under this situation, the locations of the corrupted data are often unknown. But there is limited literature regarding this problem. Moreover, most existing multi-view spectral clustering methods need a post-processed algorithm k -means after obtaining the partition matrix , which leads to deviations in the clustering results . To resolve these problems, we propose a multi-view spectral clustering method named sample-level weights learning for Multi-view Clustering on Spectral Rotation (SR-MC) in this paper. By learning the weights in the sample level, SR-MC can make full use of the helpful complementary information among different views while reducing the effects of low-quality data for each sample. Therefore, it can deal with various multi-view clustering scenarios such as data are complete or corrupted in partial views. To reduce the deviations of the clustering results , a joint framework is designed for combining the learning of the consensus Laplacian matrix , the real-valued partition matrix and the binary indicator matrix together. The objective function of SR-MC can be efficiently optimized by an alternative optimization algorithm . Compared with other ten baselines, experiments on seven datasets show the superiority of our method.},

The latest approaches utilize deep learning techniques to implicitly capture sequential dependencies but fail to consider prior knowledge. In this paper, a novel Knowledge-guided Spatial–Temporal Attention Graph Network (KSTAGE), which incorporates prior knowledge to model dynamic temporal relationships and geospatial topology structures, is proposed. The proposed KSTAGE first utilizes a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to embed the initial spectral feature . Following its development, a new Knowledge-guided Temporal Multi-head Attention Algorithm (KTMA), the core of KSTAGE, is applied to automatically generate temporal attention weights from a self-attention mechanism under the guidance of prior knowledge. Furthermore, a new strategy for aligning self-attention scores with the prior distribution is developed. Finally, a location-aware Spatial Attention Graph Network utilizing geospatial knowledge is proposed to aggregate the spatial neighborhood features for the final yield prediction. The experimental results obtained on county-level yield prediction tasks in China and the contiguous United States (CONUS) demonstrate that the proposed KSTAGE achieves obvious improvements over the baselines.},

  abstract     = {Practical optimization problems often involve a large number of variables, and solving them in a reasonable amount of time becomes a challenge. Competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) is an efficient variant of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and has been applied extensively to deal with a variety of practical large-scale optimization problems . In this article, a novel co-evolutionary method with three-phase, namely TPCSO, is developed by incorporating a novel multi-phase cooperative evolutionary technique to enhance the convergence and the search ability of CSO. In the modified CSO, the population is evenly decomposed into two sub-populations, then the update strategy of each sub-population is adjusted by the requirements of the diversity and convergence during the evolution process. In the first phase, the diversity is paid more attention in order to explore more regions. And in the second phase, the promising area in two sub-populations are exploited by introducing excellent particles of two sub-populations. The third phase focuses on the convergence by learning from the global best solution. Finally, the performance of TPCSO is evaluated and proved by large-scale benchmark functions selected from CEC’2010 and CEC’2013. The experimental and statistical results show that TPCSO can effectively solve these large-scale problems and fast obtain the optimal results with higher accuracy by comparing with several algorithms.},
