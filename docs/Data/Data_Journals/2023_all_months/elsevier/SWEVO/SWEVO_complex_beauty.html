  abstract     = {Energy-aware scheduling has attracted increasing attention mainly due to economic benefits as well as reducing the carbon footprint at companies. In this paper, an energy-aware scheduling problem in a distributed blocking flow-shop with sequence-dependent setup times is investigated to minimize both makespan and total energy consumption. A mixed-integer linear programming model is constructed and a cooperative iterated greedy algorithm based on Q-learning (CIG) is proposed. In the CIG, a top-level Q-learning is focused on enhancing the utilization ratio of machines to minimize makespan by finding a scheduling policy from four sequence-related operations. A bottom-level Q-learning is centered on improving energy efficiency to reduce total energy consumption by learning the optimal speed governing policy from four speed-related operations. According to the structure characteristics of solutions, several properties are explored to design an energy-saving strategy and acceleration strategy. The experimental results and statistical analysis prove that the CIG is superior to the state-of-the-art competitors with improvement percentages of 20.16\% over 2880 instances from the well-known benchmark set in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Several methods have already been proposed to automatically design control software for robot swarms by assembling predefined modules. Yet, so far, the modules on which these methods operate have always been defined manually in a process that is time consuming, requires domain knowledge, and must be performed by an expert. Motivated by the goal of automatizing the definition of these modules, we propose an approach in which repertoires of modules, in the form of neural networks , are automatically generated via a quality-diversity evolutionary algorithm . To illustrate the proposal, we introduce Nata , a novel approach belonging to the AutoMoDe family. Nata automatically generates probabilistic finite-state machines in which states are selected from a repertoire of neural networks , and transition conditions are selected from a set of rules based on the sensory capabilities of the robotic platform considered. Both the repertoire of neural networks and the set of transition rules are automatically generated a priori, once and for all, in a mission-agnostic way. We study Nata on three missions, both in simulation and with real robots. Nata is the first modular automatic design method that assembles modules that were themselves generated automatically.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale evolutionary multiobjective optimization , the size of the search space expands exponentially as the number of decision variables increases, which makes it more difficult to find an optimal search region and generate promising offspring. For this purpose, this paper proposes an offspring regeneration-based algorithm driven by finite element mapping, which can be divided into two stages. The first stage uses a competitive swarm optimizer to perform a pre-section of the initial population and then maps each individual into a location in a finite element region. During evolution, the population searches along these locations. The search region changes from an infinite number of points on the search space to a finite number of points, thus accelerating the convergence to the optimal region . In the second stage, a dual sampling strategy that includes convergence-based sampling and diversity-based sampling is proposed to generate more promising offspring, which balances the exploration and exploitation of the algorithm. By comparing it with five state-of-the-art large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithms . Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the compared algorithms on LSMOPs problems with up to 5000 decision variables and achieves satisfactory results on real-world problems.},

However, most multi-objective immune algorithms use clone selection strategies to accelerate convergence and focus on only the local information of clone solutions, which damages the diversity of the population and leads the algorithms to fall into local optimum easily. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective immunization algorithm based on dynamic variation distance. First, the algorithm ensures the uniform distribution of the optimal solution by the established dynamic variation distance model. Second, we divide the population into m a i n p o p mainpop and a u x p o p auxpop by quality, and design a new evolutionary strategy to achieve specific variants at different evolutionary stages under different constraints. Third, the mating selection strategy and the population selection operator are further explored to handle infeasible solutions adaptively in the late evolutionary stage. And we have conducted extensive experiments on the proposed algorithm. The results prove that our proposed algorithm outperforms 14 existing algorithms in most cases of 16 test problems, which confirms the superiority of the algorithm.},

The computer-aided design using an optimization algorithm is a promising method to improve the performance of the MIG and reduce design complexity and time consumption. However, the dependence on the initial structure makes it difficult to realize the real sense of using algorithms to design. To address this issue, this paper proposes an adaptive design method for the MIG. The design problem is equivalent to a constrained multiobjective optimization problem. A pseudo-random structure generation algorithm is developed based on the geometric constraints and the first-order MIG design trade-off equations. The fully parameterized MIG structure is randomly generated by the decision variables composed of the scale coefficients ranging from (0,1) and the other structural parameters. This transformation can increase the effectiveness of the randomly generated MIG structures and make it easier to set the value range of decision variables. The proposed adaptive design method is further verified by successfully designing the MIG for an 800 GHz gyrotron via the co-simulation of MATLAB and CST.},

  abstract     = {Solving constrained optimization problems (COPs) with evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is a popular research direction due to its potential and diverse applications. One of the key issues in solving COPs is the choice of constraint handling techniques (CHTs), as different CHTs can lead to different evolutionary directions. Combining EAs with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising and emerging approach for solving COPs. Although DRL can help solve the problem of pre-setting operators in EAs, neural networks need to obtain diverse training data within a limited number of evaluations in EAs. Based on the above considerations, this work proposes a DRL assisted co-evolutionary differential evolution, named CEDE-DRL, which can effectively use DRL to help EAs solve COPs. (1) This method incorporates co-evolution into the extraction of training data for the first time, ensuring the diversity of samples and improving the accuracy of the neural network model through information exchange between multiple populations. (2) Multiple CHTs are used for offspring selection to ensure the algorithm’s generality and flexibility. (3) DRL is used to evaluate the population state, taking into account feasibility, convergence, and diversity in the state setting and using the overall degree of improvement as a reward. The neural network selects suitable parent populations and corresponding archives for mutation. Finally, (4) to avoid premature convergence and local optima, an adaptive operator selection and individual archive elimination mechanism is added. Comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark functions CEC2010 and CEC2017 show that the proposed method performs competitively and produced robust solutions. The results of the application test set CEC2020 show that the proposed algorithm is also effective in real-world problems.},

Their imbalance can result in the algorithm failing to converge well to the Pareto front , especially when dealing with complex CMOPs. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive tradeoff evolutionary algorithm (ATEA), which can adjust the environment selection strategy based on the characteristics of problem, aiming to achieve a balance between convergence and diversity while ensuring feasibility of the population. The ATEA divides the search process into three phases: In the extended exploration phase, a global search is conducted using a guided constraint relaxation technique to enable the population to quickly traverse the infeasible region and approach the feasible region. In the tradeoff exploration phase, constraints are further detected and estimated to retain more feasible individuals and competing infeasible individuals, allowing the population to accurately identify all possible feasible regions and gradually expand towards the feasible boundary. The exploitation phase explores under-explored regions in the earlier phases with the aim of accelerating the convergence of the population and escaping from the local optima. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark test suites demonstrate that ATEA exhibits superior performance in three benchmark test suites compared with six other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Various benchmark sets have already been proposed to facilitate comparison between metaheuristics, or Evolutionary Algorithms . During the competition, typically algorithms are allowed either to run until the allowed number of function calls is exhausted (and one compares the quality of solutions found), or until a required objective function value is obtained (one compares the speed in reaching the required solution). During the last 20 years several problem sets were defined using the first approach. In this study, we test 73 optimization algorithms proposed between the 1960′s and 2022 on nine competitions based on four sets of problems (CEC 2011, CEC 2014, CEC 2017, and CEC 2020) with different dimensionalities. We intend to test the original versions of 73 algorithms “as they are”, with control parameters proposed by the authors of the particular method. The recent benchmark set, CEC 2020, includes fewer problems and allows much more function calls than the former sets. As a result, one group of algorithms perform best on older, a different one on the more recent (CEC 2020) benchmark sets. Almost all algorithms that perform best on CEC 2020 set achieve moderate-to-poor performance on older sets, including real-world problems from CEC 2011. Algorithms that perform best on older sets are more flexible than those that perform best on CEC 2020 benchmark. The choice of the benchmark may have a crucial impact on the final ranking of algorithms. The lack of tuning may affect the results that were obtained in this study, hence it is highly recommended to repeat a similar large-scale comparison with control parameters of each algorithm tuned, best by different methods, separately for each benchmark set.},

Due to the curse of dimensionality , existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithm encounter difficulties in balancing convergence and diversity on LSMOPs. In this paper, a Population Cooperation based Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PCPSO) is proposed for tackling LSMOPs. To be specific, PCPSO is a two-stage optimizer with two key components: (1) In the first stage, an inter-population collaboration component named Auxiliary Population Cooperation (APC) is used to improve the convergence speed. (2) In the second stage, an intra-subpopulation collaboration component called SubPopulation Cooperation (SPC) is applied to balance convergence and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark problems with up to 5000 decision variables and 2, 3, 5, 10 objectives demonstrate that the proposed PCPSO achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (LSMOEAs) on most test problems.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization algorithms are often applied to solve optimization problems . However, the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm has a single search method and is less capable of exploration and exploitation when solving high-dimensional and complex problems. In this paper, a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm for marine predators (HMPPSO) is proposed by combining the multi-stage search strategy of marine predators algorithm (MPA). We divide the search process of HMPPSO into three stages: the first stage uses Brownian motion for exploration; the middle stage divides the population into two parts, the first half remains responsible for exploration through Brownian motion. Besides, in the second half of the population, a random wandering strategy is proposed to randomly select five particles so that it can control the update of particles to prevent falling into the local optimal solution ; the learning strategy is improved in the later stage. The control parameters are used to adjust the strategy, while making the single case learning method and the example averaging method alternate. This strategy accelerates the convergence of the algorithm while enhancing the diversity of the algorithm in the later stage and improving the development ability of the algorithm. In addition, the population diversity is enhanced using chaotic initialization and opposition-based learning strategies. The algorithm in this paper is applied to different types of CEC2017 benchmark test functions and four multi-dimensional non-linear structural design optimization problems . Compared with other recent algorithms, the results show that the performance of HMPPSO is significantly better than other algorithms.},

The second stage implements the other algorithm in parallel with a local search strategy and a global search strategy, and allocates resources reasonably among the single algorithm and related strategies through adaptive population allocation. Finally, individuals with the worst performance are eliminated through the population reduction strategy to improve the population&#39;s quality. In order to verify the performance of the algorithm, extensive simulations were performed using four test suites of CEC2005, CEC2013, CEC2014, and CEC2017. The results show that cDE-APAR significantly improves the performance of a single algorithm. Compared with nine state-of-the-art algorithms, cDE-APAR is significantly better than the comparison algorithms according to the Wilcoxon rank sum test and has significantly improved the accuracy and stability of the solution.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the flexible job shop scheduling problem with controllable processing times (FJSP-CPT). The objective is to simultaneously minimize makespan and total energy consumption . To solve the problem, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed, and then the epsilon method is used to obtain the optimal Pareto front for small-scale instances. In order to obtain approximate Pareto fronts for medium- and large-sized problems, we propose an efficient multi-objective hybrid shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (MO HSFLA). In the proposed MO HSFLA, the encoding method, the decoding method, the initiation method of the population and the evolution processes are designed. Specifically, an energy-efficient decoding with three energy-saving strategies, namely decelerating, Turning Off/On and postponing, is designed. In addition, a multi-objective variable local search (MO-VNS) algorithm is designed and embedded in the algorithm to enhance its local exploitation capability. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed MILP model and MO HFSLA.},

  abstract     = {Coevolutionary algorithms have demonstrated high performance on many constrained multi-objective problems. However, on some problems with fraudulent constraints or small feasible regions, they may fail to converge to the Pareto front (PF) or even fail to find a feasible solution. To search for feasible solutions robustly for various problems and obtain solutions approaching the PF as possible, this paper proposes a coevolutionary algorithm assisted by two archives. To be specific, a population for minimizing constraint violation and a population for optimizing objectives without constraints coevolve to find a feasible solution first. Then, the feasible solutions are improved by the population with constrained dominance principle and an archive consisting of inversely-updated infeasible solutions. In addition to searching in the feasible regions found so far, the unconstrained population continues searching the objectives without constraints, expecting that new feasible regions can be spotted in the promising regions. To mitigate the issues that small feasible regions may be missed by the unconstrained population, a diversity archive is updated in a larger objective space than the unconstrained population to enhance exploration. In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with 11 state-of-the-art algorithms on 67 problems to demonstrate its effectiveness. The results show that the proposed method is very robust in finding feasible solutions and obtains better or competitive performance on most problems.},

  abstract     = {The increasing complexity of real-world problems raises new challenges to evolutionary computation. Distributed models have been successfully employed by many evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to deal with these challenges. In particular, distributed models provide a means to enable collaboration between multiple subpopulations, thus allowing the design of strategies to deal with premature convergence and loss of diversity, which are common problems in traditional evolutionary algorithms . Through introducing periodic migrations, many Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms (DEAs) have been proposed to improve the balance between exploration and exploitation. However, most of them focus on performing migrations at fixed or probabilistic intervals. In this work, we present a mechanism to estimate the moment of executing the migrations by assessing the loss of diversity of the subpopulations. Another relevant issue is that most studies choose to migrate the best or a random individual. We report a strategy that identifies a migrant individual capable of generating diversity that helps a given subpopulation explore non-visited regions without harming its health. The proposed approach uses an online clustering algorithm to create clouds of good-fitness individuals that have been previously migrated. The solution to be migrated must be extracted from a cloud whose population distribution is sufficiently different from the population distribution of the original subpopulation. We called this approach a Diversity-driven Migration Strategy (DDMS). The efficiency of DDMS is experimentally compared against traditional migration strategies (fixed and probabilistic) on the CEC’2014 test suite. Considering the average error values for the objective function, the proposed approach is specially better in 50D and 100D (dimensional) instances. Regarding the diversity, the proposed strategy is better in 100\% and about 96\% of the test functions in 50D and 100D scenarios, respectively. In general, we have found the DDMS mechanisms to be of considerable benefit, especially in more complex problems such as the ones based on hybrid and composition objective functions.},

  abstract     = {Decision variable analysis (DVA) methods have provided the promising direction in solving large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LMOPs). However, most existing DVA-based methods still have the problem of high evaluation consumption, which limits the performance of solving LMOPs. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new redefined DVA method with low-consumption for solving LMOPs, called R-DVA. Specifically, R-DVA detects the interrelationship among convergent decision variables by using a distance-based hierarchical clustering method, which does not need to generate lots of solutions, thus saving a large number of evaluation consumption. In addition, to improve the performance of population, an evolutionary-state-oriented evolutionary (EsoE) strategy with two search models is designed in R-DVA, which can monitor the evolutionary state of population and perform different search models according to different evolutionary states. Specifically, the intra-group optimization model is used to accelerate the convergence speed when the population is in the exploration state. Moreover, a quality-based segmentation competitive swarm optimizer is designed in the inter-group optimization model, aiming to enhance the diversity of the population when the population is in the exploitation state. In this way, a good trade-off between the convergence and diversity can be achieved via the EsoE strategy. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed R-DVA achieves the best results in comparison to five state-of-the-art competitive algorithms on most adopted benchmark LMOPs and a real-world large-scale application, i.e., feature selection.},

  abstract     = {Constrained many-objective optimization problems (CMaOPs) are frequently encountered in real-world applications, generally having constrained Pareto fronts (PFs) that are often incomplete and irregular in high-dimensional objective space. Due to the advantage of reference point-based decomposition algorithms on unconstrained many-objective optimization, they have been widely applied into dealing with CMaOPs. However, these algorithms may not be well suited for solving the constrained problems with irregular PFs, since their adopted uniformly distributed reference points may not properly fit the distribution of feasible regions. To address this issue, we propose a constrained many-objective evolutionary algorithm with reference point adaptation. To be specific, the learning vector quantization network is used to collect the feasibility information during the evolutionary search process in the supervised manner. By regarding the feasible and infeasible solutions as two classes of training samples, the network can gradually model the topological structure of the PF and adaptively generate the reference points in the feasible regions. In order to make full use of infeasible solutions to assist in the modeling of the PF, an adaptive ϵ ϵ -truncation based constraint-handling technique is proposed to introduce the elite infeasible solutions during the evolutionary process. Experimental results on several public constrained many-objective optimization test suites demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison with seven state of-the-art algorithms.},

Many existing SAEAs use a (partially) fixed setting for the surrogate type and its hyperparameters, possibly due to a shortage of solid evidence that clarifies whether the gain from online tuning outweighs its cost and effort. This study performs a systematic cost–benefit analysis to determine the most suitable approach to tune three popular surrogate types: radial basis functions (RBFs), Gaussian processes (GPs), and support vector regression (SVR). For each, a multilevel tuning scheme is designed where a higher tuning level optimizes more hyperparameters, presumably resulting in a more accurate model if the allocated time for tuning is sufficient. Our numerical results reveal that this is true only up to a specific point. After that, a higher tuning level deteriorates or at least does not improve the quality of the tuned model. The recommended tuning level for each surrogate type is then determined following an investigation of the tradeoff between the tuning cost and gain. The effect of problem dimensionality and data size on the gain from online tuning and the potential merits of using an ensemble of surrogates are explored. Our comprehensive simulations disclose the best tuning strategies for these three surrogates and their ensemble; nevertheless, the methodology can be applied to other surrogates. The findings in this study are expected to reinforce future SAEAs with superior model construction strategies, ultimately improving their efficiency.},

Our proposed algorithm not only provides a new way for handling dynamics in DMOPs, but also introduce a static multi-objective optimizer based on a multi-strategy evolutionary operator. More specifically, we propose a hybrid environmental change response mechanism to integrate several strategies for prediction and response adjustments. When the environment changes, the hybrid environmental change response strategy makes an initial response to the change, and then the response adjustment mechanism improves the quality of the response population and adjusts its optimization direction to achieve fast tracking of Pareto optimal sets and Pareto optimal fronts in the new environment. During the static optimal optimization phase, a variable neighbor-based multi-strategy evolutionary operator is used to generate new solutions, it is very helpful for both convergence and diversity preservation. MDMEA-HCR has been compared with some other advanced DMOEAs on 31 test instances. Experimental results show that MDMEA-HCR performs better than others on most instances.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) algorithms benefit from the non-convex optimization capability of evolutionary computation. However, most ENAS algorithms use a genetic algorithm (GA) with fixed parameter settings, which limits the algorithm’s search performance. Furthermore, the information generated during the evolutionary process is often ignored, while this information can be helpful for guiding the evolutionary direction of the population. This paper proposes a novel ENAS algorithm based on adaptive parameter control and gene potential contribution (AG-ENAS) to evolve neural networks efficiently. Firstly, an adaptive parameter adjustment mechanism is designed, based on population diversity and fitness. This enables better-informed adaptation of related parameters of genetic operators. Secondly, the mutation operator guided by the gene potential contribution of genes tends to produce better offspring. The gene potential contribution reflects the positive effect of the current gene on fitness. It guides the evolution by weighting the more valuable genes with the distribution index matrix. Finally, the concept of aging is introduced into the environmental selection, to offer more opportunities to the young generation and alleviate premature convergence. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on eight different datasets, and compared against 44 state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. The experimental results show that the network designed by AG-ENAS obtains higher classification accuracy than manual-designed networks such as SENet, DenseNet, and other ENAS algorithms such as Large-Evo and AE-CNN.},

To find more equivalent Pareto sets , numerous multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMEAs) based on niching have been developed. However, traditional niching methods have parameter sensitivity issues. Moreover, most existing MMEAs always perform diversity maintenance operations in the decision space and the objective space sequentially based on preferences, without considering a diversity maintenance operation that takes into account both the decision space and the objective space simultaneously. To tackle these challenges, a multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with two-stage double indicator selection strategy (MMEA-TDI) is developed. First, a dual-indicator with adaptive niche radius is developed to estimate the crowding status of the population. Then, a diversity-based mating selection is suggested to select well-distributed parents for mating. Furthermore, the environmental selection is performed in two stages. In the first stage, a parameter-free automatic niching technique based on clustering is adopted to well balance diversity and convergence in the decision space, while a double indicator selection strategy is performed for maintaining diversity in both decision and objective spaces in the second stage. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on the well-known benchmark functions , in comparison with eight state-of-the-art MMEAs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is significantly superior to the competing algorithms.},

Destruction and construction mechanisms generate a candidate individually. Seven search strategies operate on critical factories, randomly selecting possible locations where jobs or products are inserted or swapped into the rest of the sequence.

  abstract     = {The distributed heterogeneous permutation flowshop scheduling problem with lot-streaming (DHPFSPLS) is a provocative scheduling and optimization problem confronting both industry and engineering. However, no result is available in investigating the DHPFSPLS with variable number of sublots. This paper presents a many-objective mathematical model of this problem with the objectives of makespan, idle time of machines, total production cost and total flow time, considering the transfer time and sequence-independent setup time. Based on this model, a modified adaptive switching-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed, in which each solution is coded using a three-vector-based solution representation, i.e., a factory assignment vector, a lot-splitting vector and a job permutation vector. Then, a novel two-population collaborative search strategy based on a learning mechanism is designed, which can enhance exploitation abilities and make effective use of optimization knowledge from the population. Moreover, an adaptive switching strategy-based environmental selection is implemented to ensure the convergence and diversity of the solution set. Through a variety of computational tests and comparisons, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving the many-objective DHPFSPLS is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs) involve multiple equivalent Pareto sets (PSs) with identical Pareto front (PF). Popular multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMEAs) are capable of finding multiple equivalent PSs. However, most of MMEAs lead to imbalanced or local PSs are dominated and lost when tackling several MMOPs with the imbalance between convergence and diversity (MMOP-ICD) or MMOP with local Pareto solutions (MMOPL). To tackle this issue, we propose a ring-hierarchy-based evolutionary algorithm for multimodal multi-objective optimization. A ring-based niche technique is used based on the Pareto-based ranking hierarchy. Each hierarchy and its upper and lower neighbors hierarchy form a ring-hierarchy topology structure. Subsequently, a local convergence quality that considers the dominance relationship and objective values between all individuals is involved in the ring-hierarchy-based evolutionary strategy. It updates individuals and improves the population convergence quality. Moreover, a distance-based dominance selection that considers the distance between the neighbors and the dominance relationship is also developed. In this case, some individuals that approach imbalanced PS and local PS are maintained in the population instead of being dominated. Meanwhile, a dual-crowding distance is also involved in distance-based dominance selection to select diverse individuals. The proposed algorithm and several state-of-the-art MMEAs are tested on several MMOPs benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive and is capable of locating imbalanced PSs and local PSs.},

  abstract     = {The global optimization and design of interplanetary trajectories is one of the most important tasks in deep space exploration. Its search space is often characterized by multi-constraints, extreme non-linearity and sensitivity to initial conditions. To cope with these difficulties, an improved reinforcement learning-based hybrid differential evolution (DE) named RL_HDE is proposed in this paper. In RL_HDE, a novel multi-mutation strategy LSHADE based on an adaptive Q-Learning framework is proposed for global exploration. To further balance the global exploration and local exploitation of RL_HDE, a new parameter adaptive strategy based on Q-Learning is designed to control two trigger parameters. The performance of RL_HDE is verified by the well-known Global Trajectory Optimization Problems (GTOP), which are developed by Advanced Concepts Team of European Space Agency (ESA-ACT). A comparison of RL_HDE with three sets of algorithms, including ten state-of-the-art hybrid evolutionary algorithms , four interplanetary trajectory design algorithms , and seven reinforcement learning-based hybridizations. Experimental statistical results demonstrate that RL_HDE outperforms other competitors in terms of convergence efficiency and accuracy. RL_HDE has better performance for solving complex interplanetary trajectory design problems such as Cassini2 and Messenger-full.},

  abstract     = {In spite of the extensive studies that have been conducted regarding the construction of multi-objective test problems, researchers have mainly focused their interests on designing complicated search spaces, disregarding, in many cases, the design of the Pareto optimal fronts of the problems. In this regard, the work related to scalable multi-objective test problems – i.e., problems that can be formulated for an arbitrary number of objectives – has been much less studied. This paper introduces a new set of continuous and box-constrained multi-objective test problems which are scalable in both the number of objectives and in the number of decision variables. Each test problem included in the proposed test suite has a peculiar Pareto front different from those observed in the existing scalable multi-objective test suites. In addition to different Pareto fronts, the proposed test suite introduces features related to the search space that place obstacles that complicate exploring Pareto optimal solutions. Such features can be easily switched on and off by the user to analyze specific mechanisms of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). The components used in the proposed test suite can be used as a toolkit to construct new test instances not included in this set of problems. To illustrate the use and difficulties of the proposed test suite, some experiments are presented adopting three MOEAs using selection mechanisms based on Pareto optimality , decomposition, and a performance indicator (hypervolume).},

  abstract     = {Most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) provide decision makers (DMs) with an overall trade-off Pareto front . However, in practice, DMs are generally interested in a specific subset of the Pareto front that satisfies their preferences; this subset is known as the region of interest (ROI). Existing preference-based MOEAs may fail to provide satisfactory ROIs to DMs owing to inaccurate analysis of the DM’s preference information or weak diversity maintenance. This study proposes a multi-objective coevolutionary algorithm (MOCA) based on the DM’s preference direction (MOCA-PD), inspired by the mechanism of the social division of labor. To achieve the social goal of obtaining the ROI, a search center is generated by a preference model based on the DM’s preference direction. The preference model uses the search center as the criterion for the social selection of talents, with some solutions that meet the DM’s preferences selected as social leaders. To accelerate the realization of the social goal, the preference model assigns team members according to the leader’s ability; this is similar to how more capable leaders lead more team members in a society. Two teamwork operations are defined for team members to communicate (crossover and mutation) and generate offspring that are better aligned with the DM’s preferences. In addition, the diversity of social leaders is ensured by introducing an elite archive and ϵ ϵ -dominance mechanism. Experimental results on the ZDT, DTLZ, and MaF problems show that the proposed algorithm can effectively guide the population to the ROI, enabling DMs to make better and more reliable decisions.},

The concept of chaos control theory is coupled with the formulation for estimating the most probable target point in order to reduce its oscillation during convergence. The proposed formulation is solved using multi-objective differential evolution algorithm that is designed using non-dominated sorting and crowding distance. The algorithm is made adaptive for better convergence by introducing a heuristic parameter for generating mutant vectors from different variants of differential evolution.

However, one of the main drawbacks of the GP is that the fitness evaluation in the training process often requires a very high computational effort. In order to reduce the runtime of the training process, this research proposed four different surrogate models for the RCPSP. The experiment results have verified the effectiveness and the performance of the proposed surrogate models . It is shown that they achieve similar performance as the original model with the same number of evaluations and better performance with the same runtime. We have also tested the performance of one of our surrogate models with seven different population sizes to show that the selected surrogate model achieves similar performance for each population size as the original model, even when the searching space is sufficiently explored. Furthermore, we have investigated the accuracy of our proposed surrogate models and the size of the rules they designed. The result reveals that all the proposed surrogate models have high accuracy, and sometimes the rules found by them have a smaller size compared with the original model.},

  abstract     = {Swarm robotic systems (SRSs), which are widely used in many fields, such as search and rescue, usually comprise a number of robots with relatively simple mechanisms collaborating to accomplish complex tasks. A challenging task for SRSs is to design local interaction rules for self-organization of robots that can generate adaptive patterns to entrap moving targets. Biologically inspired approaches such as gene regulatory network (GRN) models provide a promising solution to this problem. However, the design of GRN models for generating entrapping patterns relies on the expertise of designers. As a result, the design of the GRN models is often a laborious and tedious trial-and-error process. In this study, we propose a modular design automation framework for GRN models that can generate entrapping patterns. The framework employs basic network motifs to construct GRN models automatically without requiring expertise. To this end, a constrained multi-objective genetic programming is utilized to simultaneously optimize the structures and parameters of the GRN models. A multi-criteria decision-making approach is adopted to choose the preferred GRN model for generating the entrapping pattern. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can obtain novel GRN models with simpler structures than those designed by human experts yet better performance in complex and dynamic environments. Proof-of-concept experiments using e-puck robots confirmed the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed GRN models.},

  abstract     = {The economic development of numerous countries is defined by maritime supply chains to a great extent. Substantial volumes of containerized cargoes delivered by ships are handled at marine container terminals. However, these terminals often face different types of disruptive events, and it is critical to provide an effective response to unexpected disruptions. This study proposes a novel optimization model for reactive berth allocation and scheduling at marine terminals that explicitly captures various recovery strategies along with the handling resources available at the terminal. Due to the computational complexity of the model, a novel Diffused Memetic Optimizer (DMO) is developed. The proposed DMO algorithm addresses the issue of limited interactions between the individuals located on the opposite sides of the diffusion grid, which is viewed as a common limitation of diffused algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed DMO deploys problem-specific tailored hybridization techniques inspired by exact optimization to facilitate the search for good-quality solutions within the diffusion grid. The computational experiments showcase the competitive DMO performance against the exact mixed-integer non-linear programming method (BARON) and some of the well-known state-of-the-art metaheuristics . Furthermore, it is discovered that slow diffusion alone by means of imposing the diffusion grid is not sufficient for the successful performance. The periodic migration between the designated areas of the diffusion grid and the application of problem-specific hybridization techniques are essential for explorative capabilities of the developed DMO algorithm. Last but not least, important managerial insights are revealed using the proposed methodology, which can assist with the berth schedule recovery.},

  abstract     = {High-quality flow measurement plays an essential role in almost all process industries, e.g., chemical engineering , energy, and sewage treatment . Although increasing the number of flow sensors can improve the observability and redundancy of flow data, it inevitably brings higher deployment and maintenance costs. Thus, the configuration of flow sensors is a multi-objective optimization problem with conflicting objectives, i.e., to achieve the highest observability , and redundancy of flow data, by minimal flow sensors. To address the above problem, the Gauss–Jordan elimination is adopted for computing the objective functions. For small-scale processes, an exact algorithm is proposed to solve the Pareto optimal set in a depth-first manner by using a multiway tree structure . For large-scale industrial processes, a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), called D&amp;A-AGE-MOEA, is proposed by incorporating a duplication-reduction environmental selection operator and a comprehensive strategy that combines multiple dichotomies with the search volume allocation into the Adaptive Geometry Estimation-based MOEA (AGE-MOEA). In addition, a population initialization strategy that initializes offspring populations with the evolution results of pioneering populations is used to facilitate the search process. Extensive confirmatory and comparative experiments have been conducted on the ZDT-5 and two practical industrial processes. Experimental results show that D&amp;A-AGE-MOEA outperforms seven state-of-the-art MOEAs.},

  abstract     = {Graph coloring is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem with a wide range of applications. In this paper, a distribution evolutionary algorithm based on a population of probability model (DEA-PPM) is developed to address it efficiently. Unlike existing estimation of distribution algorithms where a probability model is updated by generated solutions, DEA-PPM employs a distribution population based on a novel probability model, and an orthogonal exploration strategy is introduced to search the distribution space with the assistance of an refinement strategy. By sampling the distribution population, efficient search in the solution space is realized based on a tabu search process. Meanwhile, DEA-PPM introduces an iterative vertex removal strategy to improve the efficiency of k k -coloring, and an inherited initialization strategy is implemented to address the chromatic number problem well. The cooperative evolution of the distribution population and the solution population leads to a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Numerical results demonstrate that the DEA-PPM of small population size is competitive to the state-of-the-art metaheuristics .},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective optimization problems in many real-world applications are characterized by computationally or economically expensive objectives, which cannot provide sufficient function evaluations for evolutionary algorithms to converge. Thus, a variety of surrogate models have been employed to provide much more virtual evaluations. Most existing surrogate models are essentially regressors or classifiers, which may suffer from low reliability in the approximation of complex objectives. In this paper, we propose a novel surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm, which employs a surrogate model to conduct pairwise comparisons between candidate solutions, rather than directly predicting solutions’ fitness values. In comparison to regression and classification models , the proposed pairwise comparison based model can better balance between positive and negative samples, and may be directly used, reversely used, or ignored according to its reliability in model management. As demonstrated by the experimental results on abundant benchmark and real-world problems, the proposed surrogate model is more accurate than popular surrogate models, leading to performance superiority over state-of-the-art surrogate models.},

The first mechanism, named “Small diversity dimensions exploit, Large diversity dimensions explore” classifies dimensions into exploitation and exploration dimensions according to their diversity rankings and assigns them with collective and single dimensional learning strategies, respectively. The second mechanism, named “number of dimensions automatic configuring” automatically configures the number of dimensions performing exploitation and exploration in each solution according to its fitness ranking. Experiments on 29 benchmark functions confirm the effectiveness of ODF by performance comparisons with single utilization of objective and dimension space knowledge, single utilization of dimensional learning strategies and several objective, solution and dimension space knowledge-based methods from literatures.},

Two objectives are to minimize the mean makespan and the worst-case makespan across all scenarios, which reflect solution optimality and solution robustness respectively. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we propose the bi-objective robust optimization formulation under discrete scenarios for uncertain UPMSP. Second, two versions of swarm intelligent algorithms are developed by combining fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) framework and scenario-guided local search, which are performed based on two problem-specific neighborhood structures. The learning-scenario neighborhood structure is constructed by selecting single scenario using reinforcement learning . The united-scenario neighborhood structure is constructed by collecting all discrete scenarios. Third, an experiment was conducted to compare two developed algorithms with the state-of-the-art alternative algorithms. The computational results show that the developed algorithms are identically better than possible alternatives in terms of multi-objective metrics. Moreover, it is shown that the FOA algorithm with learning-scenario-neighborhood smell search is advantageous for the discussed problem.},

  abstract     = {Dispatching rules (DRs), which are simple constructive methods that incrementally build the schedule, represent the most popular method for solving dynamic scheduling problems. These DRs were usually designed for optimising a single criterion and work poorly when solving multi-objective (MO) problems. In recent years, we have seen an increase of research dealing with automated design of DRs using genetic programming (GP), which has enabled the application of several evolutionary MO optimisation methods to create DRs for MO problems. However, for each considered MO problem new DRs need to be evolved, which can be computationally expensive. Motivated by this, we propose a novel methodology to combine existing DRs evolved for optimising individual criteria into ensembles appropriate for optimising multiple criteria simultaneously. For this purpose, we adapt the existing simple ensemble construction (SEC) method to construct ensembles of DRs for optimising MO problems. The method is evaluated on several MO scheduling problems and compared with DRs evolved by NSGA-II and NSGA-III. The obtained results show that for most problems the proposed method constructed ensembles that significantly outperform DRs developed with standard MO algorithms. Furthermore, we propose the application of evolved MO rules and ensembles on problems with a smaller number of criteria and demonstrate that with such a strategy similar or better performance is achieved compared to evolving DRs for such problems directly, which demonstrates theif reusability and generalisation potential.},

This paper proposes a new dynamic constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (NDCMOEA) to address this issue. Specifically, the constraint handling strategy based on a novel penalty function integrates the constraint deviation values in the objective space and the similarity deviation values in the decision space. This method promotes selecting promising infeasible solutions closer to the POS and drives the population towards the Pareto optimal front (POF). When environmental changes occur, we employ a dynamic response strategy based on random initialization and an inverse Gaussian process model (IGPM) predictor considering the information of feasible region changes. Then, the IGPM predictor uses the sampled points generated by the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) mechanism in the preferred regions of the objective space to obtain the initial population with better convergence and diversity in the new environment. The proposed algorithm is validated on a set of test instances and a real-world fluid catalytic cracking-distillation process optimization problem.

In this paper, a novel algorithm called the Self-adaptive Fast Fireworks Algorithm (SF-FWA) is proposed to effectively conduct large-scale black-box optimization. The main idea is to utilize a set of expressive and computationally efficient search distributions to cope with different function landscapes while tuning the hyperparameters of the search distributions in an online fashion. To achieve this, the Expressive Fast Explosion (EFE) mechanism is designed to achieve effective and efficient sampling, and the Inter-Fireworks Competitive Cooperation (IFCC) mechanism is designed to adapt hyperparameter distributions. This new optimization paradigm equips the population with the ability to automatically adjust to a rich set of function landscapes with linear computational complexity in terms of problem dimensionality . Experimental studies show that SF-FWA can not only exploit the separability of the problem efficiently but can also deal with rotational transformations to the coordinate system. The numerical results on the standard large-scale optimization benchmark suite indicate that SF-FWA outperforms current state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms. The outstanding performance of SF-FWA on optimizing neural network controllers for solving reinforcement learning tasks demonstrates its great potential to be applied to a wider range of real-world problems.},

Target entrapment is one such task; its challenges include finding ways to adapt to different environments to improve entrapment performance. This paper proposes a cooperative hierarchical gene regulatory network (CH-GRN) with the aim of enhancing mutual cooperation between robots neighbours and the utilisation of obstacles to achieve more effective and efficient entrapment. A target–neighbour–obstacle (TNO) pattern generation method is proposed in the upper layer of the CH-GRN design; it integrates the information on targets, neighbours, and obstacles in order to generate more accurate patterns for surrounding the targets. A concentration-vector method is applied in the lower layer of the CH-GRN to enable the robots to adapt quickly to the pattern and thereby complete the entrapment task. At the same time, a proposed obstacle avoidance method is incorporated, which leads to more timely obstacle avoidance. Several simulation experiments are conducted to quantitatively analyse CH-GRN’s performance on the target entrapment task in a variety of environments consisting of different types of obstacles. In addition, experiments with Kilobots are conducted to further evaluate CH-GRN’s effectiveness. The results show that the proposed model can guide a robot swarm to perform target entrapment tasks in challenging environments with a variety of obstacles, such as various shapes obstacles, narrow channel obstacles, and dynamic obstacles.},

  abstract     = {The tradeoff between feasibility and optimality is critical to handling constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). Thus, many constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) with multiple stages or multiple populations have been proposed in recent years. However, these algorithms are based on preference-based search, which makes the resource allocation between feasibility and optimality inflexible. This may lead to low performance, especially for CMOPs with an irregular Pareto front (PF). To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel CMOEA with two-stage resources allocation (CMOEA-TSRA), which considers feasibility and optimality simultaneously during the whole evolutionary process (i.e., at each stage). Specifically, it divides the evolutionary process into two stages according to the convergence degree of the population. In the first stage, it adaptively allocates fewer individuals to roughly exploit the currently discovered feasible regions and more individuals to explore the potentially optimal feasible regions. In the second stage, more individuals are allocated to further exploit the currently discovered feasible regions, while fewer individuals are allocated to continue to explore the potentially optimal feasible regions. With the help of this strategy, CMOEA-TSRA balances exploitation and exploration dynamically. In addition, most of the existing works consider the tradeoff between feasibility and optimality when evaluating individuals. However, it is not always necessary to consider the tradeoff between feasibility and optimality when evaluating individuals. Therefore, we design a new fitness assignment method based on the individual distribution in the population by utilizing the correlation between constraint violation and objective functions, which makes the more explicit evaluation preferences of individuals located in different search regions. With the help of this method, the population can easily cross the large infeasible regions. The experimental results on several widely used benchmark suites and three real-world problems demonstrate that the proposed CMOEA-TSRA is superior for handling CMOPs compared with six state-of-the-art CMOEAs.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a novel and computationally efficacious Parallel Two-Step Decomposition-Based Heuristic (PTSDBH) and a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) are developed to tackle the concurrent scheduling of jobs and Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) or transporters in a hybrid job shop system. Finite multiple AGVs, AGV eligibility, job’s alternative process routes, job re-entry, and conflict-free AGV routing are considered. As far as the authors know, the importance of conflict-free routing for AGVs has not been featured in any of the past studies. Conflict-free AGV routing is an indispensable technicality, specifically where AGVs are the main mean of transportation as AGVs may collide on routes and the whole system ends up in breakdown. To avoid this issue, a conflict-free routing strategy is considered. Utilizing the parallel computing approach, PTSDBH is capable of tackling large-sized problems in remarkably shorter runtimes. To support this, PTSDBH is compared against three literarily well-known metaheuristics ; i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) along with TSDBH (i.e., the single-core variant of PTSDBH) on three different-sized sets of benchmark instances. The results reveal that PTSDBH and TSDBH produce the same objective values and outperform the metaheuristics in terms of the quality of objective value. However, the runtimes of TSDBH are considerably higher than those of PTSDBH as it only uses one core to process. Finally, employing Nemenyi’s post-hoc procedure for Friedman’s test and the convergence plot, it is supported that the objective values generated by PTSDBH and TSDBH are significantly more desirable than those generated by the metaheuristics.},

  abstract     = {Joint operations algorithm (JOA) is a metaheuristic algorithm based on joint operations strategy in military theory, which incorporates three core operations – offensive, defensive and regroup – and has excellent performance in global optimization problems . To enhance the optimization performance of the original JOA, we re-examine the positioning of the three core operations in balancing global exploration and local exploitation, and propose a hierarchical structure-based JOA variant (abbreviated as HSJOA) by adjusting their execution mechanism. In addition, we redesign the three core operations to give full play to their synergy effect . In the new offensive operations, we simplify its specific execution strategy, but introduce an adjustment parameter to retain valuable position information. In the modified defensive operations, we integrate the influence of officer and elite comrades on soldiers to design a Gaussian distribution-based conservative defensive strategy and one Cauchy distribution-based aggressive defensive strategy. In the novel regroup operations, we replace the original random division strategy with a sorting-based division scheme. To evaluate the optimization performance of HSJOA, we conduct comparison experiments using nine excellent algorithms to deal with four real-life optimization problems and thirty test functions from IEEE CEC 2014 testbed . The comparison results show that the overall optimization performance of HSJOA is significantly better than the original JOA, the outstanding variants (TAPSO and GODE) of two well-known algorithms and four recently proposed algorithms (EO, SOA , MPA and WOA), while inferior to two winners of IEEE CEC competition (L-SHADE and EBOwithCMAR), but HSJOA clearly outperforms L-SHADE and EBOwithCMAR in terms of the runtime consumption.},

  abstract     = {Quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is a powerful computation technique that introduces quantum mechanics theory into particle swarm optimization (PSO), which has been successfully applied to address complex and challenging functional optimization problems. However, QPSO still suffers from premature convergence and trapping in the local optima. In this paper, we propose a novel QPSO variant by guiding it with the length of the potential well (LPW) and assisting it with Adam (abbreviated as Adam-LGQPSO). To select the appropriate strategy according to the evolutionary states, an LPW-guided particle update strategy is proposed, by introducing a Gaussian random vector for enhancing the information sharing among particles and endowing the swarm with adaptive randomness. Meanwhile, a particle perturbation mechanism is developed to avoid getting into a search dilemma. To balance the exploration and exploitation, a diversity function is introduced and a diversity-based LPW strategy is designed, which helps the algorithm to better adapt to the complex and variable search environment. Finally, the Adam algorithm is integrated into the QPSO to assist the initialization of the population. The effectiveness of the proposed strategies is testified by a set of experiments. With the extensive experiments on the CEC 2017 test suite, we also show that Adam-LGQPSO achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-art metaheuristics.},

Despite PPFs have shown promising results when dealing with different Pareto front geometries, there are still some open research questions to improve the way we employ them. In this paper, we answer three important questions: (1) what is the effect of a crucial parameter of some PPFs?, (2) how do we set the optimal parameter value?, and (3) what is the best PPF in EMO? To solve these questions, we designed a brand-new fast algorithm to generate an approximate solution to a PPF-based subset selection problem and, then, we conducted a comprehensive parametrical study to predict the optimal parameter values using a deep neural network . To show the effectiveness of the PPF-based diversity-preserving mechanisms, we selected two application cases: the generation of reference point sets of benchmark problems (DTLZ, WFG, IDTLZ, IWFG, IMOP, and Viennet) with different Pareto front shapes, and the definition of a PPF-based archive that can be coupled to any multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to construct well-diversified Pareto front approximations . Using several diversity indicators, it is shown that the utilization of PPF-based mechanisms lead to good Pareto front approximations regardless of the Pareto front shape.},

  abstract     = {Recently, it was demonstrated that a decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with a pre-specified weight vector set cannot find a uniformly-distributed solution set over an inverted triangular Pareto front (PF). This is because the weight vectors are created by a simplex-lattice structure with a triangular shape. Much more boundary solutions are often obtained than inside solutions. Whereas non-uniformity of obtained solutions has been discussed in many studies, it has been overlooked that solutions around the corners of the inverted triangular PF are not always obtained. This means that the obtained solution set is not only non-uniform but also covers only a part of the PF. In this paper, first we explain why the corner solutions of the inverted triangular PF cannot always be found using the relation between the weight vectors and the PF. Next, we propose a simple method for generating additional weight vectors for the search of the corner solutions. Then, we perform computational experiments after combining the proposed method with several decomposition-based algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to improve the performance of the examined decomposition-based algorithms (including those with weight adaptation mechanisms) on multiobjective problems with various irregular PFs.},

  abstract     = {Adjusting the search behaviors of swarm-based algorithms during their execution is a fundamental errand for addressing real-world global optimizing challenges. Along this line, scholars are actively investigating the unvisited areas of a problem domain rationally. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a popular swarm-based optimization algorithm, is broadly applied to resolve different real-world problems because of its more robust searching capacity. However, in some situations, due to an unbalanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration, PSO gets stuck in a suboptimal solution. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a new ensemble algorithm called e-mPSOBSA with the aid of the reformed Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) and PSO. The proposed technique first integrates PSO&#39;s operational potential and then introduces BSA&#39;s exploration capability to help boost global exploration, local exploitation, and an acceptable balance during the quest process. The IEEE CEC 2014 and CEC 2017 test function suite was considered for evaluation. The outcomes were contrasted with 26 state-of-the-art algorithms, including popular PSO and BSA variants. The convergence analysis , diversity analysis, and statistical test were also executed. In addition, the projected e-mPSOBSA was employed to evaluate four unconstrained and seven constrained engineering design problems, and performances were equated with various algorithms. All these analyses endorse the better performance of the suggested e-mPSOBSA for global optimization tasks, search performance, solution accuracy, and convergence rate.},

  abstract     = {Nature is a neverending source of inspiration for technology. Quantum physics suggests applications toward quantum computing . Swarms’ self-organization leads to robotic swarm developments. Here, quantum computing is applied to swarm robotics. We model local interactions with a quantum circuit , testing it on simulators and quantum computers . To relate local with global behavior, we develop a block matrix-based model. Diagonal sub-matrices contain information on single robots; off-diagonal sub-matrices are the pairwise interaction terms. Comparing different swarms means comparing different block matrices. Choosing initial values and computation rules for off-diagonal blocks (with a particular logic gate), different behaviors can be modeled. To show the global-behavior emergence, we propose a specific pairwise-interaction logic gate , embedding the corresponding quantum circuit in an ant-foraging-inspired algorithm. To implement a first application, we choose the foraging-ant behavior for its clarity and importance in nature, running experiments with toy swarms (3 and 10 robots). We consider ants’ individual and collective back-and-forth movements between the nest and the food source, analyzing the effect of entanglement . Our research can help shed light on quantum potentialities for swarms. The implications of our findings and results concern the future development of a decision-making system, based on the advantages of swarms and quantum computing. While an ant-foraging scenario is chosen as an example of application, our study is not focused on optimization. We present a new methodology, open to non-optimal solutions.

Benefiting from the development of the hardware resources, batch Bayesian optimization (BBO) approaches, characterized by selecting a batch of solutions for expensive evaluation in each iteration, have attracted more and more attention. However, existing BBO methods, using a single or fixed combination of acquisition functions, suffer from lousy flexibility and low robustness when facing various problems. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes a BBO method with adaptive batch acquisition functions via multi-objective optimization (called BBO-ABAFMo). Specifically, multiple acquisition functions are adaptively chosen to form a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP). Its Pareto-optimal solutions provide the candidate solutions for expensive evaluation according to a minimum-diverse-exploitative (MDE) strategy.

Specifically, the better dominant individual has a higher probability of being selected. Then, a directed mutation strategy is adopted to ensure the evolution towards a better direction during the optimization. Moreover, the archive scheme is no longer adopted in MjSO to avoid the excessive use of historically dominant individuals. MjSO is evaluated using the CEC 2018 test suite in comparison with six state-of-the-art DE variants, called jSO, mL-SHADE, ELSHADE-SPACMA, EB-LSHADE, iL-SHADE, and MadDE.

As a structure-based drug design tool, it predicts the lowest energy conformation for ligands (small molecules) binding in the active region of receptors (macromolecules) based on their three-dimensional crystal structures. The satisfactory accuracy and efficiency of docking programs depend on two components: a robust sampling algorithm and a precise scoring function. The former searches for candidate conformations of ligands and receptors, and the latter evaluates and ranks these conformations. Various docking programs have been proposed, employing different sampling algorithms and scoring functions. In this study, a novel molecular docking program is proposed, which uses a multi-swarm competitive algorithm as the search method to improve the performance of the docking problems, especially with highly flexible ligands. The algorithm adopts a multi-swarm framework and feedback mechanism to realize the competition between the swarms, and incorporates a gradient descent algorithm to refine the current population.

  abstract     = {A cloud workflow scheduling problem is extremely challenging for its large scale and the elasticity and heterogeneity of cloud resources. In this paper, we model a cloud workflow scheduling as a multi-objective optimization problem in which makespan and energy consumption need to be simultaneously optimized. To address the problem, we propose a dynamic multiple population genetic algorithm (DMGA), in which the population is divided into three sub-populations (i.e., superior, ordinary, and inferior sub-populations). Accordingly, three sets of genetic operators are introduced. Concretely, the traditional genetic operators are selected by the ordinary sub-population. On the contrary, two types of the longest common subsequence (LCS) respectively based on superior individuals and inferior individuals are utilized to design two specific genetic operators, which are adopted by the superior sub-population and the inferior sub-population, respectively. For the superior sub-population, some superior gene blocks can be saved by the new proposed genetic operators, which is beneficial for speeding up the convergence. For the inferior sub-population, some inferior gene blocks can be destroyed based on the new genetic operators, which is favorable for helping the inferior individuals to jump out of local optima. Moreover, the dynamic multiple population framework enable an individual to perform diverse search behaviors in different generations aiming to satisfy distinct requirements of different fitness landscapes. We conducted experiments with 2 heuristic algorithms, 5 algorithms designed specifically for workflow scheduling, and 3 popular swarm intelligence algorithms. In the comparison of the five measures, DMGA outperformed the other algorithms on more than 50\% of the tested dataset. The results indicate that DMGA outperforms other state-of-the-art peer algorithms on different scheduling problems, especially on large scale problems. Moreover, positive effectiveness of the new proposed strategies is also verified by a set of experiments.},

  abstract     = {The massive deployment of base stations is one of the key pillars of the fifth generation (5G) of mobile communications. However, this network densification entails high energy consumption that must be addressed to enhance the sustainability of this industry. This work faces this problem from a multi-objective optimization perspective, in which both energy efficiency and quality of service criteria are taken into account. To do so, several newly problem-specific operators have been designed so as to engineer hybrid multi-objective evolutionary metaheuristics (MOEAs) that bring expert knowledge of the domain to the search of the algorithms. These hybrid approaches have been able to improve upon canonical versions of the algorithms, clearly showing the contributions of our approach. Furthermore, this paper tests the hypothesis that the hybridization using several of those problem-specific operators simultaneously can enhance the search of MOEAs that are endowed only with a single one.},

  abstract     = {The field of dynamic optimisation continuously designs and compares algorithms with adaptation abilities that deal with changing problems during their search process. However, restarting the search algorithm after a detected change is sometimes a better option than adaptation, although it is generally ignored in empirical studies. In this paper, we suggest the elusivity formulation to (i) quantify the preference for restart over adaptation for algorithms running on dynamic problems , and (ii) evaluate the advantage and behaviour of adaptation. Informally, we state that a dynamic problem is elusive to an algorithm if restart is more effective than adapting to changes. After reviewing existing formalisms for dynamic optimisation , the elusivity concept is mathematically defined and applied to two published empirical studies to evaluate its utility. Conducted experiments show that replicated works include elusive problems, where restart is better than (or equal to) adaptation, and demonstrate that some empirical research effort is being devoted to evaluating adaptive algorithms in circumstances where there is no advantage. Hence, we recommend how and when elusivity analysis can be gainfully included in empirical studies in the field of dynamic optimisation.},

  abstract     = {Reservoir operation optimization can boost the efficiency of water resources utilization, but sometimes has huge search space and time-consuming calculation. Approximate evaluation is one of the mainstream methods to assist evolutionary algorithms to efficiently solve such problems. However, most approximation techniques have to constantly correct accuracy during optimization because of the inability to precisely control approximation errors, resulting in a decrease in computational efficiency. Therefore, by fully mining operating information and deeply integrating function evaluation with mutation operator , this study proposes a novel parallel approximate evaluation-based model (PAEM) to enhance search ability and shorten calculation time as well as realizing accurate control of approximation errors, and establishes a multi-objective operation model PAEM-LSTM by combining PAEM and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) for the fast formulation of operating rule. The results indicate that: (1) under the same parallelization, compared with three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and two surrogate-based multi-objective algorithms, PAEM provides significantly better Pareto-optimal solutions at a faster speed (e.g. 32 times faster than NSGA-II) while maintaining extremely low approximation errors; (2) small population size and large mutation size are recommended in PAEM, and moreover, the larger the scale of reservoir group, the higher the computational efficiency of PAEM; and (3) compared with conventional operating rule, the operating rule of NSGAII-LSTM increases hydropower generation by 3.45\% and reduces ecological water shortage by 29.74\%, while the rule of PAEM-LSTM increases hydropower generation by 3.63\% and reduces ecological water shortage by 36.74\%.

In such cases, both the time that a trial takes to reach the target value (or not) and its final fitness value characterize its outcome. This paper describes how trial-based dominance can totally order this two-variable dataset of outcomes so that traditional non-parametric methods can determine the better of two algorithms when one is faster, but less accurate than the other, i.e. when neither algorithm dominates. After describing trial-based dominance, we outline its benefits. We subsequently review other attempts to compare stochastic optimizers, before illustrating our method with the Mann-Whitney U test . Simulations demonstrate that “U-scores” are much more effective than dominance when tasked with identifying the better of two algorithms. We validate U-scores by having them determine the winners of the CEC 2022 competition on single objective, bound-constrained numerical optimization .},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is a significant data preprocessing technology in many fields. FS generally has two primary conflicting goals: 1) reducing features number and 2) improving classification accuracy , so it can be considered as a multi-objective optimization problem. This paper studies a symmetric uncertainty (SU) based decomposition multi-objective immune algorithm for feature selection, called MOIA/D-SU. Three novel strategies are proposed in MOIA/D-SU, namely population initialization strategy (PIS), proportional clone strategy (PCS) and population update strategy (PUS). The symmetric uncertainty based PIS calculates the SU value between each feature and class label, and initializes the population based on SU value. In the PCS, a new fitness function is defined to evaluate the performance of solutions, and then the proportional cloning process of excellent solutions will be performed to form a clone population that can be used to guide the evolution of the population. PUS uses the generated new solution to update the neighbor of the weight vector that minimizes the Tchebycheff distance of this new solution, instead of updating the neighbor of the current weight vector , so the update process is more efficient. Extensive experiments are performed on 13 benchmark data sets and compared the proposed method with five state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms . The experimental results demonstrate that MOIA/D-SU can better balance these two conflicting goals, and can achieve higher classification accuracy .},

Overfitting has attracted wide attention in some classification models , however, it is not commonly studied in the field of feature construction. In this paper, a Multi-Generation feature construction method (MG) is developed to preserve the solutions produced by multiple generations of GP. A Multi-Criteria feature construction method (MC) is introduced to use a multi-criteria evaluation function to evaluate GP individuals. Combining the above two methods, a Multi-Generation Multi-Criteria feature construction method (MGMC) is proposed. Experiments on fourteen datasets show that the proposed MG and MC methods can improve the classification performance and overcome overfitting problems of traditional feature construction methods in most cases. The combined MGMC method further improves the classification performance and achieves the best results.},

  abstract     = {There are many dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) in real-world applications. The Pareto-optimal front (PF) or Pareto-optimal set (PS) of such problems will change with the optimization process, posing a great challenge to the evolutionary algorithms(EAs). The prediction-based strategy is a commonly used strategy for DMOPs. However, the prediction-based strategy can only solve predictable problems. Additionally, using the prediction-based strategy alone may increase the imbalance of population convergence and diversity. Based on the above issues the prediction-based strategy faces, we believe that the lack of population diversity causes them. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel dynamic optimization strategy , including the prediction and diversity strategy (HPPDS) for DMOPs. First, the prediction strategies combine the prediction of pivot points (representative individuals selected through a dynamic selection mechanism) and non-dominant individuals to achieve the ability to solve predictable DMOPs. Then, a specific and controllable diversity strategy is used to maintain the population’s diversity and deal with the unpredictable DMOPs. This way, our proposed optimization algorithm can cope with various environmental changes in DMOPs. To verify that our proposed strategy is competitive, HPPDS is compared with five other state-of-art strategies. The experimental results show that the HPPDS is competitive.},

There are three main differences between APSM-jSO and jSO. First, a novel adaptive selection mechanism (APSM) for selecting entries from the historical memory is designed to fully utilize the better entries in the historical memory. Subsequently, the first in-first out (FIFO) method is utilized to update the external archive for maintaining the population diversity and avoiding overuse of the external archive . Finally, a new mutation strategy adopting rank-based selective pressure (RSP) is used to enhance the exploitation of APSM-jSO. APSM-jSO is evaluated using the IEEE CEC 2018 test suite in comparison with five state-of-the-art DE-based variants (ELSHADE-SPACMA, EB-LSHADE, LSHADE-RSP, mL-SHADE, and MadDE) and five winners of the IEEE CEC competitions (AGSK, APGSK-IMODE, EBOwithCMAR, HSES, and IMODE). The results demonstrate that APSM-jSO outperforms jSO and five DE-based algorithms, is superior to four top winners of the IEEE CEC competitions (AGSK, APGSK-IMODE, HSES, and IMODE), and is not inferior to the top method of the IEEE CEC 2017 competition (EBOwithCMAR). The conclusion is that APSM-jSO effectively further enhances the overall performance of jSO, and is an excellent jSO variant.

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) has been experimentally demonstrated to be effective in solving optimization problems. However, the effectiveness of DE encounters rapid deterioration in the face of complicated optimization problems with many grotesque local basins, which are emerging increasingly frequently nowadays. To alleviate this predicament, this paper devises a simple yet effective mutation scheme named “DE/current-to-rwrand/1” to further promote the optimization ability of DE in solving complicated optimization problems. Specifically, this strategy assigns a non-linear selection probability for each individual, which is computed based on its function value ranking. As a result, all individuals can be potentially selected to direct the mutation of the population, but better individuals preserve exponentially larger selection probabilities. In this way, the resultant DE, which is named function value ranking aware differential evolution (FVRADE), is expectedly capable of balancing high diversity and fast convergence of the population well to find satisfactory solutions to optimization problems. In particular, two classical and popular mutation strategies, namely “DE/current-to-rand/1” and “DE/current-to-best/1”, are two special cases of the proposed mutation strategy. Abundant experiments have been extensively executed on the well-known CEC’2017 and the latest CEC’2021 benchmark problem sets. Experimental results have verified that FVRADE performs highly competitively with or even significantly better than several representative and state-of-the-art peer methods. In particular, it is experimentally demonstrated that FVRADE is particularly good at solving complicated optimization problems, and preserves a good scalability to deal with optimization problems. Besides, experiments have also been conducted on the popularly adopted CEC’2011 real-world optimization problem suite and the experimental results have substantiated that FVRADE is very promising to solve real-world optimization problems.},

This paper proposes an approach that predicting the population based on the adjusted reference vector (RVCP) combined with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to solve DMOPs. First, the nondominated set is predicted by a linear prediction strategy, which can relocate elite solutions to track the true Pareto set (POS) in the new environment. Second, an adaptive reference-vector-based adjustment strategy is introduced based on the number of nondominated solutions . Then the population in the new environmention is predicted in terms of the adjusted reference vectors, which can track the POS and/or the true Pareto front (POF) more accurately. Finally, a noise-based individual expansion strategy is applied, which can generate variation individuals to keep the population in good diversity. To prove the effectiveness of RVCP , it is compared with five popular dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) on twelve test instances with different dynamic characteristics. The experimental results show that RVCP has certain advantages in dealing with DMOPs.},

However, such approaches are highly sensitive to the parameters or their implementation is complex. To this end, in this work, a helper problem (objective function) is proposed to assist evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in dealing with complex optimization problems , where the multitask optimization framework is adopted to transfer knowledge between the helper and the original problems. Specifically, the helper objective is a smoother fit of the original problem, which leads EAs to concentrate on the global optima of the original problem. Then, the helper objective-assisted multifactorial differential evolutionary algorithm is proposed, termed h-MFDE. Experimental results show that h-MFDE is competitive in finding the global optimal on complex optimization problems comparing with other state-of-the-art EAs.},

  abstract     = {Over the past two decades, to overcome the limitations of certain algorithms, ensemble strategies or self-adaptive mechanisms for evolutionary computation algorithms have been proposed. Regardless of how these strategies or mechanisms were designed, their objective was to control the balance between the global and local search capabilities during the evolutionary process. Inspired by this, a novel ensemble strategy with three groups to improve the performance of the ensemble particle swarm optimizer (EPSO) is proposed. The first group uses a covariance matrix adapted retreat phase (CMAR), the second group induces the niching behavior for inertia weight particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the third group maintains the characteristics of a large subpopulation of EPSO. Furthermore, a sample pool and replacement mechanism are proposed to perturb the three groups. This strategy also recommends a group of empirical allocation rates for subpopulations based on various proportion combination tests. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated using CEC2005 benchmark functions with 10, 30, and 50-dimensional tests and compared with those of the state-of-the-art PSO variants: EPSO, a modified PSO using adaptive strategy (MPSO), PSO variant for single-objective numerical optimization (PSO-sono), terminal crossover and steering-based PSO (TCSPSO), self-adapting hybrid strategy PSO (SaHSPS), and pyramid PSO (PPSO). Experimental results demonstrate that the improved EPSO, using CMAR, niching behavior, and sample pool, performs best.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal optimization aiming at locating multiple global optima at a time has received extensive attention from researchers since it can afford multiple choices for decision-makers. To effectively locate as many optima of multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) as possible, this paper proposes a novel differential evolution framework, named proximity ranking-based multimodal differential evolution (PRMDE). Firstly, a proximity ranking-based individual selection method is proposed to randomly select parent individuals involved in the mutation operation. Specifically, instead of the classical uniform selection, this paper devises a non-linear weight function to calculate the selection probabilities of individuals according to their proximity rankings and then randomly selects parent individuals based on the roulette wheel selection strategy. In this way, each individual is likely mutated by its Euclidian neighbors. Secondly, an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy is further devised for the selection probability calculation, so that the selection probabilities of closer individuals to each target individual gradually increase as the evolution continues. Thirdly, an adaptive local search strategy is designed to carry out the Gaussian distribution based local search adaptively around individuals. In this way, better individuals have higher chances to conduct local search to subtly improve their quality. By means of the cohesive cooperation among the three main mechanisms, PRMDE is expectedly capable of simultaneously locating multiple optima of MMOPs. Theoretically, any mutation strategy can be embedded into PRMDE to deal with MMOPs. Four classical mutation strategies are adopted in this paper to instantiate PRMDE. Experiments carried out on the publicly acknowledged CEC2013 benchmark MMOP set demonstrate that PRMDE is effective to solve MMOPs and attains considerably competitive or even far better optimization performance than several representative and state-of-the-art multimodal optimization methods.},

  abstract     = {A grey predictive evolutionary algorithm , which is attracting more and more attention, regards the population series of evolutionary algorithms as an equidistant time series. The population evolution is essentially regarded as a process in which the function values have variable-speed decrease with the increase of the number of iterations (for minimization problems). Therefore, a fitness-driven evolutionary population sequence with the property of variable-speed evolution should be more appropriately modelled as a non-equidistant time series. A novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, non-equidistant grey prediction evolution algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm is identified by its reproduction operator which is developed by the following two steps. Firstly, a non-equidistant grey model (NeGM (1,1)) based on the average fitness value of each generation population to preserve the non-equidistant nature is modelled. Secondly, the interval in the fitting stage of the NeGM (1,1) is defined as an increasing time interval . The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on CEC2019 and CEC2020 benchmark functions . Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to other more complex and notable approaches, in terms of solving accuracy as well as the rate of convergence .

  abstract     = {The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been one of the most effective methods for solving various engineering optimization problems . Most existing PSO variants frequently use fixed operators, the adoption of a fixed operator learning mode may restrict the intelligence level of each particle, thus reducing the performance of PSO in solving optimization issues with complicated fitness landscapes. To address single goal real-parameter numerical optimization while overcoming the above shortcoming, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based particle swarm optimization with neighborhood differential mutation strategy (NRLPSO). In NRLPSO, a dynamic oscillation inertial weight (DOW) strategy that provides particles with dynamic adjustment ability in different situations is designed. To resolve the operator selection conundrum of exploration and exploitation, a reinforcement learning-based velocity vector generation (VRL) strategy is developed. At each iteration, particles select the velocity update model based on reinforcement learning , and VRL helps to thoroughly search the problem space. A velocity updating mechanism based on cosine similarity (VCS) is applied to control the velocity learning mode to determine more promising solutions. Furthermore, to alleviate the problem of premature convergence, a local update strategy with neighborhood differential mutation (NDM) is employed to increase the diversity of the algorithm. To verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test suites are implemented, and nine classic or state-of-the-art PSO variants are comprehensively tested. The experimental results show that NRLPSO outperforms the popular PSO variants in terms of convergence speed and accuracy. Since NRLPSO utilizes the DE mutations, it is compared with the representative LSHADE variant algorithm - LSHADE_SPACMA. Although LSHADE_SPACMA is better than NRLPSO concerning algorithm stability and convergence accuracy, we will refine our work in the future to enhance the performance in all aspects.},

  abstract     = {Reference vector adjustment approaches pose a considerable potential to strengthen the capability of decomposition-based evolutionary many-objective algorithms in handling many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) with irregular Pareto-optimal fronts (PFs). However, most existing approaches often rely on the current population’s distribution, which may not well match MaOPs’ PFs. This can easily mislead the reference vector adjustment and impair algorithms’ performance. To address the abovementioned issue, this paper designs a growing neural gas-assisted evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm, called GNG-EMO. Specifically, the proposal contains an environmental selection without reference vectors to maintain a well-diversified and converged archive over the PFs. Also, the GNG-EMO leverages a growing neural gas (GNG) network to learn Pareto-optimal fronts’ topologies using the solutions in the archive. In addition, to alleviate the issue that the nodes of the GNG network cannot reach the boundaries of Pareto-optimal fronts, we design an expansion mechanism to further diversify the nodes of the GNG network for constructing a set of better reference vectors. To evaluate the performance of the GNG-EMO, we compare it with five state-of-the-art competitors in the context of 48 test cases with irregular PFs. The numerical results demonstrate the GNG-EMO’s superior competitiveness by significantly outperforming all the five competitors on 27 test cases with respect to the indicator Hypervolume.},

However, directly predefined reference directions with uniform distribution usually cause deteriorated performance in solving multi-objective problems with irregular Pareto fronts . Thus, an adaptive adjustment method guided by the local population is implemented in this paper. At this rate, a two-stage adaptive reference point guided evolutionary algorithm with APA-based dominance relation for many-objective optimization problems (named AREA-APA) is proposed and tested for solving these multi-objective optimization problems (including constrained and unconstrained problems).

  abstract     = {Many problems that are encountered in real-life applications consist of two or three conflicting objectives and many decision variables. Multi-guide particle swarm optimization (MGPSO) is a novel meta-heuristic for multi-objective optimization based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). MGPSO has been shown to be competitive when compared with other state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms for low-dimensional (and even many-objective) problems. However, a recent study has shown that MGPSO does not scale well when the number of decision variables is increased. This paper proposes a new scalable MGPSO-based algorithm, termed cooperative coevolutionary multi-guide particle swarm optimization (CCMGPSO), that incorporates ideas from cooperative coevolution (CC). CCMGPSO uses new techniques to spend less computational budget by periodically assigning only one CC-based subswarm to each objective (as opposed to using numerous CC-based subswarms). A detailed empirical study on well-known benchmark problems comparing the CCMGPSO with various state-of-the-art large-scale multi-objective optimization algorithms is done. Results show that the proposed CCMGPSO is highly competitive for high-dimensional problems with reference to the inverted generational distance (IGD) metric.},

This paper proposes an efficient regularity augmented evolutionary algorithm (RAEA) for multiobjective optimization , which aims to adopt such latent spaces for use with offspring generations. In this algorithm, a singular value decomposition method is adopted at each iteration to extract such latent space from the population with the regularity property . The enhancements of regularity in RAEA include: (1) an acceleration of convergence by incrementally projecting the dominated solutions into the latent space built with elite solutions (i.e., the non-dominated solutions); and (2) a novel dual-space search strategy (DSS) is developed for the generation of promising offspring solutions by searching in both latent and decision space. The developed algorithm was empirically compared with five well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithms on several complicated MOP test suites. Experimental results suggest that RAEA outperforms the compared algorithms on these test instances in terms of two commonly-used indicators. Both the effectiveness of the convergence acceleration scheme and the developed dual-space searching strategy are also validated.},

It can be extended to the thresholded and weighted concordance probability which are more appropriate for some applications. The naive way of estimating this measure requires a quadratic computation time, which is prohibitive for large data sets. We propose a new algorithm that computes the weighted thresholded concordance probability in linearithmic time, which is proven and empirically confirmed. This unlocks the possibility of calculating the thresholded concordance probability in a big data world, and makes it possible to base the fitness function of a machine learning algorithm on the concordance probability. These applications are successfully illustrated by two real examples from the insurance sector. The first one focuses on feature selection based on the concordance probability using a binary particle swarm optimization. In the second application, we use a genetic algorithm to optimize a loss function based on the concordance probability. Since both of these applications require evaluating the concordance probability a very high number of times, a huge decrease in computation time is obtained using our fast algorithm. Moreover, it is shown that the neural network optimized for the concordance probability with the genetic algorithm outperforms the traditional benchmark methodology, i.e. a classical neural network optimized for the deviance. The applicability of our fast algorithm extends beyond these illustrations and unlocks various new uses of the thresholded and weighted concordance probability.},

However, since different problems may have different internal structures, achieving trade-offs between exploration and exploitation while accelerating convergence toward the PS and PF remains challenging. To address this issue, we propose an evolutionary algorithm that explicitly exploits the regularity properties of the multiobjective optimization problem in the decision space and the objective space. A feedback loop can be formed directly between two spaces, which aims to approximate the PS and the PF by approximating the PS manifold and the PF manifold, respectively. In addition, the uniform distribution of population is guaranteed by two mutually reinforcing diversity maintenance mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the limit state curve (LSC) finding problem in reliability analysis, a new category of optimization problems referred to as the regional-modal optimization problems (RMOPs) was investigated in this paper. The most distinguishing feature of RMOPs is the continuity of its solutions. Existing optimization methods are not capable of capturing this feature and thus cannot produce acceptable results for RMOPs. Therefore, based on niching PSO a normal search particle swarm optimization (NSPSO) algorithm that can provide discrete optimal solutions for a continuous optimal region with arbitrary pre-specified density was developed. NSPSO is consisting of a normal search pattern and a multi-strategy fusion. Normal searching is the core of NSPSO, in which each particle is guided by the normal vector of the region composed of its several best neighborhoods. Normal searching prevents the particles from clustering and thus provide a basis for the solution diversity. Further, a multi-strategy framework with three components was introduced to improve the performance of NSPSO. It includes a dynamic particle repulsion strategy that improve the solution diversity, a particle memory strategy to prevent local optimum, and an elite breeding strategy that was developed to increase the efficiency of the method. This framework gives NSPSO the ability to maintain the balance between exploitation and exploration and thereby to realize the uniform distribution and high coverage and diversity of the algorithm. Furthermore, the key parameters involved in NSPSO were analyzed thoroughly. The NSPSO is compared with ten state-of-the-art multi-mode optimization algorithms in terms of twenty typical test functions with different properties that were constructed in this study. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms in solving RMOPs.},

Secondly, a two-stage mutation strategy and a novel mutation strategy, namely DE/rand-to-MMEDBest/2, are designed to boost the diversity and convergence in different evolution stages of population. Thirdly, a MMED-based environmental selection that takes individuals in lesser fronts into population is used to enhance the overall performance of the population.

  abstract     = {Considering preventive maintenance scenarios (PMS) in assembly line balancing problems can significantly influence machine reliability and production continuity. However, no research considers PMS in robust mixed-model assembly line balancing and sequencing problems (RMALBSP) with interval processing times. This paper designs a robust mathematical model to solve RMALBSP considering PMS (RMALBSP_PMS) with two types of objectives: makespan and task alteration. Then, it is linearized by duality to be directly solved by Cplex. We also develop a multi-objective cooperative differential evolution algorithm (MOCDE) to solve large-scale instances. In this algorithm, we design a coevolutionary mechanism to partition the RMALBSP and optimize each part separately. The priority-based encoding and decoding methods are proposed to represent solutions in each population. Evolutionary operators for populations and the archive are designed to explore the solution space. Four neighbor search operators are developed to replace repetitive solutions. The first experimental result illustrates the model can obtain the Pareto solutions of small-scale instances, and the MOCDE is more suitable for solving large-scale instances. The remaining two experiments demonstrate that the designed coevolutionary mechanism and improvements are effective, and the MOCDE algorithm outperforms eight state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Prediction-based evolutionary algorithms have gained much attention in solving dynamic multiobjective optimization problems due to their impressive performance in tracking the changing Pareto set (PS). Current approaches focus on developing learning or estimation models to reveal the dynamic regularities from the correlations between the historical PSs. However, the underlying knowledge in the PS itself, such as the neighborhood distribution of the individuals and their local correlation in the decision space, is ignored which may affect prediction accuracy and the quality of the predicted population. Therefore, a manifold clustering-based predictor is proposed in this paper. A manifold learning method is introduced to preprocess the historical PSs to find and reserve the intrinsic neighborhood relationship of the individuals. As a result, a number of local linear manifolds are extracted from each historical PS, and the individuals in a population are divided into several clusters according to the different linear manifolds they attach to. The individuals belonging to one cluster can be regarded as linearly correlated and may have a similar moving trend. Thus, the subsequent prediction is conducted in units of the cluster and multiple prediction models are built to predict the new PS in a decomposition manner. Finally, an initial population with good diversity and distribution can be generated for the new environment. The proposed algorithm is tested on a variety of commonly-used benchmark problems and compared with eight state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, especially on the problems with nonlinear correlation between the decision variables.},

  abstract     = {In preference-based multi-objective optimization, knee solutions are termed as the implicit preferred promising solution, particularly when users have trouble in articulating any sensible preferences. However, finding knee solutions by existing posteriori knee identification methods is hard when the function evaluations are expensive, because the computational budget wastes on non-knee solutions. Although a number of knee-oriented multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to overcome this issue, they still demand massive function evaluations. Therefore, we propose a surrogate-assisted evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm via knee-oriented Pareto front estimation, which employs surrogate models to replace most of the expensive evaluations. The proposed algorithm uses a Pareto front estimation method and a cooperative knee point identification method to predict the potential knee vector. Then, based on the potential knee vector, the aggregated function with an error-tolerant assignment converts the original problem into a single-objective optimization problem for an efficient optimizer. We perform the proposed algorithm on 2-/3-objective problems and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art knee identification evolutionary algorithms on most test problems within a limited computational budget.},

A data-driven model assisted hybrid genetic algorithm (DMA-HGA) is proposed to address the considered problem effectively. The proposed DMA-HGA applies an improved genetic algorithm (GA) as the optimization method, capable of modifying infeasible solutions while generating new solutions to satisfy model constraints. In addition, a two-stage search assistance module is implemented to facilitate a more efficient search process. In the first stage, a data-driven model is developed and used as a surrogate model for rapid fitness measurements and filtering out inferior solutions. With the generation of new solutions, the data-driven model will gradually lose its accuracy, and the second stage thus begins, using a taboo list to facilitate an in-depth search. To validate the performance of the proposed DMA-HGA, experiments on twenty-five simulation instances from five scenarios and two real-world cases are conducted. Experimental results show that the proposed DMA-HGA yields a better solution and higher accuracy compared to considered benchmarking methods. Finally, management insights for the 2DSSAP are provided based on the extended discussion of parameters.},

  abstract     = {In researching multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), the decision-maker (DM) may not need the entire Pareto optimal front searched and may only be interested in the region of interest (ROI). Most existing preference-based research focuses on determining the location of the ROI and controlling its size. Those research typically ignores the preference information provided by the DM when solving problems. Since the convergence region and diversity of the population are determined according to the DM’s preference information, so we propose a preference-based MOEA that uses a normal distribution (ND) to generate a weight vector , called MOEA/D-ND. The generation of the weight vector uses the DM’s preference information to guide the solution to converge to the vicinity of the preference information. Because the randomness of the normal distribution can lead to a loss of diversity, an angle-based niche selection strategy is adopted. This strategy prevents the population from falling into a local optimum during the search process. Although the reference vector generated by MOEA/D-ND using the normal distribution will make the final solution set no longer uniformly distributed in the ROI, still, the closer region to the reference point, the more solution sets are obtained. The experimental results show that this algorithm has advantages in various benchmark problems with 2 to 15 goals.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) aims to remove the irrelevant and redundant features to improve the classification accuracy of the algorithm, which is regarded as an NP-hard problem. Recently, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has shown promise in FS problems, but most previous PSO-based FS methods use implicit representation, whose particle size is equal to the number of original features. Such particle representation not only consumes a lot of memory and computational cost but also leads to a large search space when applied to high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a novel representation scheme called explicit representation ( i.e. particles are directly represented by the corresponding selected feature subset) and redefine the particle update strategy for the new representation. Moreover, we adopt a feature grouping strategy based on feature importance and divide the original feature set into multiple groups. Finally, a size-adaptive expansion strategy is proposed, in which the swarm automatically determines the next feature group to increase the particle size. The proposed algorithm, called ESAPSO, is able to effectively reduce the particle size as well as the computational cost and the memory occupation. We validate the performance of the proposed ESAPSO with several state-of-the-art algorithms on ten benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed ESAPSO is usually achieved by better classification performance as well as feature subsets with similar or smaller sizes. This study provides valuable and novel insight into the particle representation of the PSO-based feature selection problem.},

  abstract     = {Metaheuristics are popularly used in various fields, and they have attracted much attention in the scientific and industrial communities. In recent years, the number of new metaheuristic names has been continuously growing. Generally, the inventors attribute the novelties of these new algorithms to inspirations from either biology, human behaviors, physics, or other phenomena. In addition, these new algorithms, compared against basic versions of other metaheuristics using classical benchmark problems, show competitive performances. However, many new metaheuristics are not rigorously tested on challenging benchmark suites and are not compared with state-of-the-art metaheuristic variants. Therefore, in this study, we exhaustively tabulate more than 500 metaheuristics. In particular, several representative metaheuristics are introduced from two aspects, namely, the inspirational source and the essential operators for generating solutions. To comparatively evaluate the performance of the state-of-the-art and newly proposed metaheuristics, 11 newly proposed metaheuristics (generally with high numbers of citations) and 4 state-of-the-art metaheuristics are comprehensively compared on the CEC2017 benchmark suite. For fair comparisons, a parameter tuning tool named irace is used to automatically configure the parameters of all 15 algorithms. In addition, whether these algorithms have a search bias to the origin (i.e., the center of the search space) is investigated. All the experimental results are analyzed by several nonparametric statistical methods, including the Bayesian rank-sum test, Friedman test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, critical difference plot and Bayesian signed-rank test. Moreover, the convergence, diversity, and the trade-off between exploration and exploitation of these 15 algorithms are also analyzed. The results show that the performance of the newly proposed EBCM algorithm performs similarly to the 4 compared algorithms and has the same properties and behaviors, such as convergence, diversity, exploration and exploitation trade-offs, in many aspects. However, the other 10 recent metaheuristics are less efficient and robust than the 4 state-of-the-art metaheuristics. The performance of all 15 of the algorithms is likely to deteriorate due to certain transformations, while the 4 state-of-the-art metaheuristics are less affected by transformations such as the shifting of the global optimal point away from the center of the search space. It should be noted that, except EBCM, the other 10 new algorithms are inferior to the 4 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of convergence speed and global search ability on CEC 2017 functions. Moreover, the other 10 new algorithms are rougher (i.e., present in their behavior with high oscillations) in terms of the trade-off between exploitation and exploration and population diversity compared with the 4 state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, several important issues relevant to the metaheuristic research area are discussed and some potential research directions are suggested.},

  abstract     = {It is challenging to balance convergence and diversity while fully satisfying feasibility when dealing with constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). Overemphasizing the feasibility optimization of constraint satisfaction may lead to the search falling into local optimum, and overemphasizing the objective optimization of ignoring constraints may cause a lot of computational resources to be wasted in searching for infeasible solutions. This paper proposes a dual-population algorithm called dp-ACS, aiming to seek a balance between constraint satisfaction and objective optimization . The algorithm proposes a dominance relation to speed up the algorithm’s convergence and an adaptive constraint strength strategy to consider the information of excellent infeasible solutions. Specifically, the former defines a new domination relationship to distinguish the pros and cons of nondominated solutions . The population converges faster by selecting better nondominated solutions into the matching pool. The latter is informed by infeasible solutions with good objective values by maintaining two cooperatively complementary populations (i.e., m a i n P o p mainPop and a u x P o p auxPop ). m a i n P o p mainPop uses an adaptive constraint strength function that optimizes the objective of the original problem while satisfying the current constraint strengths. Dynamic adjustment of constraint strength can improve the diversity when the population converges to the boundary of the feasible local region. a u x P o p auxPop optimizes the unconstrained objective of the original problem, which can provide m a i n P o p mainPop with favorable information outside the feasible region it explores to guide the evolution of m a i n P o p mainPop . Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm was more competitive on four constrained test suites and four real-world CMOPs, compared with seven state-of-the-art CMOEAs .},

Nevertheless, the flight range of a rotary wing drone is restricted due to limited battery endurance. To conquer this shortage, the coordination of ground vehicles (GVs) and drones to finish complex tasks has attracted much attention recently. Especially, the coordination of trucks and drones has been investigated to realize the last-mile parcel delivery. By contrast, in this study, we propose to coordinate GVs and drones to monitor urban road networks more efficiently. The GV serves as a mobile carrier for launching, recovering, and charging the drones, while the drones are used to inspect some concerned sections of the road networks . To obtain high-quality routes for the GV and drones, a novel GV-drone arc routing problem (GVD-ARP) is specifically investigated. A mathematical model is constructed to describe the GVD-ARP and solved by the Gurobi optimizer. In addition, a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines the randomized variable neighborhood descent search, which is incorporated with the simulated annealing algorithm (RVND-SA), is developed to solve the model. Extensive experiments on instances with different scales are conducted and the results show the superiority of RVND-SA comparing with four other algorithms. Moreover, experiments on patrolling the real-world road networks are conducted, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of the model and RVND-SA.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the make-to-order (MTO) production has gradually become a new manufacturing trend, and the real-time arrival of orders has brought great challenges to order acceptance, production scheduling and maintenance planning in the actual production. Therefore, in this study, we focus on the integrated optimization of real-time order acceptance and flexible job-shop rescheduling with multi-level imperfect maintenance constraints. More precisely, (1) a multi-level imperfect maintenance model with minimal repair (MR), preventive maintenance (PM), overhaul maintenance (OM) and replacement is designed for each production machine, and the optimality is derived; (2) an integrated multi-objective optimization model is developed to characterize the concerned problem; and (3) an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III with adaptive reference vector (INSGA-III/ARV) is proposed to deal with the problem. In the numerical simulation, the effect of different order sorting rules is first analyzed. Second, the effectiveness of improved operators is demonstrated by internal analysis of the proposed algorithm. Third, the superiority and competitiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing with the variants of five state-of-the-art algorithms. Fourth, the benefits of both the designed multi-level imperfect maintenance model and real-time order acceptance and scheduling (ROAS) strategy are proved by contrasting with other two traditional maintenance models and all order acceptance and scheduling (AOAS) strategy, respectively. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed to illustrate the impact of several key parameters on the integrated optimization model.},

  abstract     = {The study of electromagnetic detection satellite scheduling problem (EDSSP) has attracted attention due to the detection requirements for a large number of targets. This paper proposes a mixed-integer programming model for the EDSSP problem and a genetic algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL-GA). Numerous factors that affect electromagnetic detection are considered in the model, such as detection mode, bandwidth, and other factors. The RL-GA embeds a Q-learning method into an improved genetic algorithm , and the evolution of each individual depends on the decision of the agent. Q-learning is used to guide the population search process by choosing evolution operators. In this way, the search information can be effectively used by the reinforcement learning method. In the algorithm, we design a reward function to update the Q value. According to the problem characteristics, a new combination of &amp;lt; state, action &gt; &amp;gt; is proposed. The RL-GA also uses an elite individual retention strategy to improve search performance. After that, a task time window selection algorithm (TTWSA) is proposed to evaluate the performance of population evolution. Several experiments are used to examine the scheduling effect of the proposed algorithm. Through the experimental verification of multiple instances, it can be seen that the RL-GA can solve the EDSSP problem effectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the RL-GA performs better in several aspects.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an adaptive two-stage large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithm , in which a neural network-based accelerating optimizer is designed in the first stage to speed up the population&#39;s convergence and a layer-based competitive swarm optimizer is used in the second stage to maintain the population&#39;s diversity by spreading the solutions obtained in the first stage. To properly train the neural network in the first stage, the whole population, i.e., the training data, is evenly divided into two subsets with different qualities based on the dominant relationship between solutions. Then, the paired low-quality solutions and high-quality solutions, respectively, act as the input and the expected output when training the neural network . In this way, the potentially directional improvement information of the evolutionary population can be learned by this neural network, which is used to guide the adopted differential evolution in promising search directions. Once the population is detected to be evolutionarily stagnated in the first stage, the second stage will be activated for remedying the population&#39;s diversity. Specifically, the promising solutions gained in the first stage are assigned into four layers with different qualities by sequentially implementing reference vectors-guided sorting and shift-based density estimation. After that, the solutions in low-quality layers can learn from that in high-quality layers in the proposed competitive swarm optimizer, which allows the population to evolve further in appreciable directions while increasing its diversity. Experimental studies validate the performance of the proposed evolutionary large-scale optimizer when compared with eight state-of-the-art algorithms in solving two widely tested benchmark suites of large-scale multi-objective optimization problems with decision variables ranging from 100 to 1000 under a limited computational resource.},

In addition, two new indices, active power loss reduction index ( PLR ) and reactive power loss reduction index ( QLR ), have also been mathematically formulated. The developed indices, based on system&#39;s active and reactive power, guarantees the best quality of electrical supply to the load terminals. The Most Valuable Player (MVP) algorithm along with various Electrical Vehicle (EV) constraints, has been considered in this work to obtain the minimum values of load variance, PLR and QLR . Further, the results, as achieved through the proposed method, are compared with the other existing approaches to reveal its effectiveness and accuracy. The statistical analysis also supports the superiority of the MVP algorithm. Furthermore, parametric case studies are also done to declare the optimal results. It is shown that the proposed method with the developed indices provide the best quality of electrical supply to the load terminals. Finally, an optimisation model combining ‘load-variance’, ‘ PLR ’, and ‘ QLR ’ as a multi-objective planning problem has been presented. This developed model can obtain the non-dominated solutions to reach the final EVs planning schedule, thus achieving a more realistic and better solution than the existing approaches. The results are validated on a standard IEEE 69-bus radial distribution system.},

  abstract     = {The satellite range scheduling problem (SRSP) is a range of combinatory optimization, which plays a vital role in the regular operation and mission accomplishment of in-orbit satellites. However, with the increase in the number of satellites and the client requirements, there is some limitation in dealing with the SRSP for existing methods, especially on large-scale problems. Therefore, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, which is integrated into a heuristic scheduling method for the satellite range scheduling problem. The core idea of the algorithm is to decompose the problem into two subproblems : (1) Assignment problem, which assigns each task on different antennas. (2) Single antenna scheduling problem, which determines the execution start and end time of selected tasks on the antenna. The two subproblems are performed iteratively and modeled as a general paradigm. In the paradigm, the DRL is to determine the process of task assignment, and the heuristic scheduling method can quickly solve the single antenna scheduling problem. The objective function of the scheduling problem is to maximize the total reward. The DRL updates the gradient information based on the reward obtained by the heuristic scheduling method. To verify this idea, various scale experiments are considered to examine the performance of training scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed paradigm combining DRL with a heuristic scheduling method can effectively deal with the SRSP.},

  abstract     = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a bio-inspired metaheuristic that operates on a set of potential solutions (called particles). In PSO, each particle moves throughout the search space using the information collected by itself and its neighbors. Experimental studies have shown that the way each particle is connected (the swarm topology) impacts the performance of PSO both for single- and multi-objective problems. Several experimental analyses have shown that the number of connections among particles directly relates to the behavior of single-objective PSO. However, few studies exist about this relationship in Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimizers (MOPSOs). Furthermore, the existing studies are limited to two-objective problems or do not use specific topologies to control the number of connections among particles. This work analyzes the influence on the number of connections among particles in a MOPSO using random regular graphs as the swarm topology in many-objective problems. In order to undertake this analysis, we modified a variation of the Speed-constrained Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimizer that can handle swarm topologies to make it more sensitive to its topology. Then, we analyzed its performance using regular graphs of different degrees. Our experimental results show that, in various problems, a higher connection degree produces instability in the algorithms. Moreover, our analysis also indicates that MOPSOs have a similar behavior if they have a swarm topology with the same connection degree.},

In MOEA/D-PD, a classifier model is built to filter the offspring solutions in decision space so that only promising solutions are evaluated, and computational resources are dynamically allocated to the subproblems on the bases of their contributions.

  abstract     = {Multi-agent Credit Assignment (MCA) problem is considered as one of the critical challenges in developing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). The MCA problem addressed how to distribute global reward, which is received by the Multi-Agent System (MAS) owing to an interaction with the environment among the agents. In this paper, a two-step method is proposed to solve the MCA using the bankruptcy and Evolutionary Games (EG). The first phase turns the MCA problem into a bankruptcy game through introducing the constraint of Maximum Performance Power (MPP). In this game, the agents act as players through a mixed strategy. The game’s outcome is the each agent’s share of the global reward. An instance of credit assignment is extracted by determining each agent’s share from the global reward. Using the mixed strategy leads to generate a lot of credit assignment instances. Therefore, finding the best instance of credit assignment is challenging. To select the best one in the second step, the EG is applied. In other words, the second step turns the MCA problem into an EG; the players are considered as the instances of credit assignment extracted from the first step. The proposed method was evaluated in an operational environment which is called Multi-score Puzzle (MsP) as compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms such as COMA, VDN, SQDDPG, ranking, dynamic and history-based methods. Simulation results indicated the better performance of the proposed method in terms of group learning rate, confidence, expertness, certainty and correctness.

The selection range of each reference vector is controlled by the associated population subset, from which an elite individual is selected.

  abstract     = {Bayesian networks (BNs) are probabilistic graphical models regarded as some of the most compelling theoretical models in the field of representation and reasoning under uncertainty. The search space of the model structure grows super-exponentially as the number of variables increases, which makes BN structure learning an NP-hard problem. Evolutionary algorithm-based BN structure learning algorithms perform better than traditional methods. This paper proposes a structural information-based genetic algorithm for BN structure learning (SIGA-BN) by employing the concepts of Markov blankets (MBs) and v-structures in BNs. In SIGA-BN, an elite learning strategy based on an MB is designed, allowing elite individuals’ structural information to be learned more effectively and improving the convergence speed with high accuracy. Then, a v-structure-based adaptive preference mutation operator is introduced in SIGA-BN to reduce the redundancy of the search process by identifying changes in the v-structure. Furthermore, an adaptive mutation probability mechanism based on stagnation iterations is adopted and used to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on eight widely used benchmark networks show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other GA-based and traditional BN structure learning algorithms regarding structural accuracy, convergence speed, and computational time.},

  abstract     = {Inferring the structure and operation of a computing model, given some observations of its behavior, is in general a desirable but daunting task. In this paper we try to solve a constrained version of this problem. We consider a P system Π Π with active membranes and using cooperative rewriting, communication, and division rules and a collection of pairs of its consecutive configurations. Then, we feed this collection of configurations as input to a ( μ + λ ) (μ+λ) evolutionary algorithm that evolves a population of (initially random) P systems, each with its own rules, with the aim of obtaining an individual that approximates Π Π as well as possible. We discuss the results obtained on different benchmark problems, designed to test the ability to infer cooperative rewriting, communication, and membrane division rules. We will also provide a description of how fitness results are influenced by different setting of the hyperparameters of the evolutionary algorithm. The results show that the proposed approach is able to find correct solutions for small problems, and it is a promising research direction for the automatic synthesis of P systems.},

  abstract     = {While many Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms only use fitness to assess the performance of particles, in this work, we adopt Surprisingly Popular Algorithm (SPA) as a complementary metric in addition to fitness. Consequently, particles that are not widely known also have the opportunity to be selected as the learning exemplars. In addition, we propose a Euclidean distance-based adaptive topology to cooperate with SPA, where each particle only connects to k k number of particles with the shortest Euclidean distance during each iteration. We also introduce the adaptive topology into heterogeneous populations to better solve large-scale problems. Specifically, the exploration sub-population better preserves the diversity of the population while the exploitation sub-population achieves fast convergence. Therefore, large-scale problems can be solved in a collaborative manner to elevate the overall performance. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on various optimization problems , including three benchmark suites and two real-world optimization problems. The results demonstrate that our Euclidean distance-based adaptive topology outperforms the other widely adopted topologies and further suggest that our method performs significantly better than state-of-the-art PSO variants on small, medium, and large-scale problems.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a very simple and effective metaheuristic algorithm . Search operators with similar behavior may lead to the loss of diversity in the search space. All particles in PSO have the same and single search strategy. Therefore, PSO may suffer from premature convergence in solving complex multimodal problems. To improve the global search ability of PSO, this paper reports an elite archives-driven particle swarm optimization (EAPSO). Note that, EAPSO only needs population size and terminal condition for performing the search task, which can distinguish EAPSO over the other reported variants of PSO. In addition, EAPSO has a clear structure, which first builds three types of elite archives to save three different hierarchical particles. Then, six learning strategies for updating the positions of particles are designed by reusing these particles of the three elite archives. To verify the performance of EAPSO, EAPSO is employed to solve CEC 2013 test suite with dimensions 30–100 and three constrained engineering problems. Experimental results show that EAPSO outperforms the compared seven powerful variants of PSO on more than half of test functions and offers highly competitive optimal solutions on the considered engineering problems. That is, experimental results support the validity of the improved strategies and prove the superiority of EAPSO in solving complex multimodal problems. The source code of EAPSO can be found by the following website: https://github.com/jsuzyy/EAPSO .},

  abstract     = {Many-objective optimization is an area of interest common to researchers, professionals, and practitioners because of its real-world implications. Preference incorporation into Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) is one of the current approaches to treat Many-Objective Optimization Problems (MaOPs). Some recent studies have focused on the advantages of embedding preference models based on interval outranking into MOEAs; several models have been proposed to achieve it. Since there are many factors influencing the choice of the best outranking model, there is no clear notion of which is the best model to incorporate the preferences of the decision maker into a particular problem. This paper proposes a hyper-heuristic algorithm—named HyperACO—that searches for the best combination of several interval outranking models embedded into MOEAs to solve MaOPs. HyperACO is able not only to select the most appropriate model but also to combine the already existing models to solve a specific MaOP correctly. The results obtained on the DTLZ and WFG test suites corroborate that HyperACO can hybridize MOEAs with a combined preference model that is suitable to the problem being solved. Performance comparisons with other state-of-the-art MOEAs and tests for statistical significance validate this conclusion.},

Given the fact that there are usually constraints in real-world optimization problems, in this work, we propose a test problem construction approach for constrained multimodal multi-objective optimization. Based on the approach, a test suite, containing 14 instances with diverse features and difficulties, is created. Meanwhile, a new evolutionary framework is tailored for this kind of problem. We test the proposed framework in the experiments and compare it to state-of-the-art multimodal multi-objective optimization algorithms on the proposed test suite. The results reveal that the proposed test suite is challenging and it can motivate researchers to develop new algorithms. In addition, the superiority of our proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness in handling constrained MMOPs.},

  abstract     = {The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has created huge demands for medical masks that need to be delivered to a lot of demand points to protect citizens. The efficiency of delivery is critical to the prevention and control of the epidemic. However, the huge demands for masks and massive number of demand points scattered make the problem highly complex. Moreover, the actual demands are often obtained late, and hence the time duration for solution calculation and mask delivery is often very limited. Based on our practical experience of medical mask delivery in response to COVID-19 in China, we present a hybrid machine learning and heuristic optimization method, which uses a deep learning model to predict the demand of each region, schedules first-echelon vehicles to pre-distribute the predicted number of masks from depot(s) to regional facilities in advance, reassigns demand points among different regions to balance the deviations of predicted demands from actual demands, and finally routes second-echelon vehicles to efficiently deliver masks to the demand points in each region. For the subproblems of demand point reassignment and two-batch routing whose complexities are significantly lower, we propose variable neighborhood tabu search heuristics to efficiently solve them. Application of the proposed method in emergency mask delivery in three megacities in China during the peak of COVID-19 demonstrated its significant performance advantages over other methods without pre-distribution or reassignment. We also discuss key success factors and lessons learned to facilitate the extension of our method to a wider range of problems.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) require the algorithms to find multiple global or local optima in a single run, which is considered a difficult task. In recent years, niching techniques have received widespread attention from researchers and extensively recognized as efficient methods for MMOPs. However, most niching techniques have the disadvantage of parameters settings. Moreover, the information of historical individuals is not fully used for evolution. In this paper, a history archive assisted niching differential evolution with variable neighborhood (HANDE/VN) is proposed. The main features are as follows: (i) a variable neighborhood strategy dynamically controls the neighborhood size of individual during the evolution, which can balance exploration and exploitation to some extent; (ii) a new mutation operation based on history archive can fully exchange the information between history archive and current population to enhance the search ability and help the algorithm locate multiple global solutions more accurately; (iii) a local optima processing based on history archive deal with the individuals trapped in the local optima. To demonstrate the performance of HANDE/VN, 20 MMOPs from CEC2013 were selected as test suite. Compared with state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms, the proposed approach obtains better results in terms of peak ratio and success rate.},

Besides helping to choose a single preferred solution, they provide a better understanding of the trade-off among the objectives and also reveal key insights about interactions among variables and objectives for the Pareto-optimal solutions. Existing visualization methods do not provide a comprehensive account of both visualization and analysis of Pareto-optimal solutions. In this paper, we present an interpretable self-organizing map (iSOM) method that produces a more simplistic mapping of higher-dimensional variable spaces into two dimensions . Multiple iSOM plots, one for each objective, allows an easier visual understanding of trade-off among objectives. By identifying high trade-off Pareto-optimal solutions and marking them on the iSOM plots, we also provide decision-makers a comprehensive method to locate critical and likely preferred solutions on the Pareto-optimal front. The visualization and analysis of Pareto-optimal solutions using iSOMs are demonstrated on 11 problems involving three to five objectives. As discussed, the approach is generically applicable to higher-dimensional and constrained problems.},
