We develop an oligopolistic-competition model in which product prices are endogenously determined, via buyers’ and sellers’ strategic decisions, and we lay down and examine its mathematical structure. Taking agents’ market power into account, we restudy the Ricardian Law of Comparative Advantage in a many -commodity framework, and obtain a (new) result that is in line with what is perceived in real-world markets: when agents act strategically , they do not specialise based on comparative advantages. For a large class of utility functions, we prove the existence of equilibria at all of which trade is driven neither by absolute nor comparative advantages, but exclusively by strategic decision-making.},

Taking bike-sharing as an example, this paper develops a non-atomic game model to characterize the collective behaviors of rational consumers and investigates how to inhibit violations in the B2P market. We assume that individuals are heterogeneous in the expected punishment cost, and each individual can choose to be a compliant consumer, violating consumer, or a non-use consumer. The equilibrium results reveal that lowering the price and increasing the initial number of shared products can suppress violations, however, the firm profit is maximized when violators are reduced to a certain percentage, which diverges somewhat from social welfare. To further eliminate violations, the subsidy mechanism is introduced, which can efficiently reduce the ratio of violators while increasing both the firm profit and social welfare, even though the firm’s response to subsidy weakens its effect, and the increase in social welfare exceeds the investment in subsidies.},

A single patroller has the goal of preventing the smugglers from doing so, but must pay a cost to travel from one location to another. We model the problem as a two-player stochastic game and look to find a Nash equilibrium to gain insight into real world problems. Our framework extends the literature by assuming that the smugglers choose a continuous quantity of contraband, complicating the analysis of the game. We discuss a number of properties of Nash equilibria, including the aggregation of smugglers, the discount factors of the players, and the equivalence of our non zero-sum game to a zero-sum game. Additionally, we present algorithms to find Nash equilibria that are more computationally efficient than existing methods. We also consider certain assumptions on the parameters of the model that give interesting equilibrium strategies for the players.},

In this paper, we use the by-production model to measure dynamic economic, environmental, and social inefficiency of Dutch dairy farms. Subsequently, we investigate associations between inefficiency and socio-economic factors using a bootstrap truncated regression model. We find farms to perform more poorly in the environmental dimension than in the economic and social dimensions. The share of household labor in total labor, farm size, replacement rate of dairy cows, specialization and government support are associated with a higher environmental inefficiency. Intensity of advisory services and number of entrepreneurs are associated with a lower environmental inefficiency. Age of the oldest entrepreneur, intensity of advisory services and share of household labor in total labor are all associated with a higher economic inefficiency and farm size is associated with a lower economic inefficiency. Social inefficiency is negatively associated with financial structure, specialization, and government support. The results provide insights into potential pathways towards improving the economic, environmental, and social performance.},

  abstract     = {Diagnostic testing is a fundamental component in effective outbreak containment during every phase of a pandemic. Test samples are collected at testing facilities and subsequently analyzed at specialized laboratories. In high-income countries where health care providers are often privately owned, the assignments of samples from testing facilities to laboratories are determined by individual stakeholders. While this decentralized system effectively matches supply and demand during normal times, dispersed outbreaks, e.g., as encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic, lead to imbalanced requests for diagnostic capacity. With no coordinating entity in place to match demands at testing facilities to laboratory capacities, local backlogs build up rapidly thus increasing waiting times for test results and thus impeding subsequent containment efforts. To ease the impact of erratic regional outbreaks through improved logistics activities, we develop a rolling horizon framework which repeatedly solves a mathematical programming snapshot problem based on the current number of test samples. The procedure dynamically adapts to requirements resulting from the pandemic activity and supports rather than replaces decentralized operations in order to match testing requests with available laboratory capacities. We present problem-specific performance indicators and assess the quality of our procedure in a case study based on the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 in Germany. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of coordinating mechanisms to support the logistics related to diagnostic testing and hence to reduce waiting times for PCR test results. Significant improvements are achieved even when interventions in the decentralized assignment process only occur in response to increased pandemic activity.},

Although certified organic farmland grew from 11 to 72.3 million hectares between 1999 and 2019, it constituted only 1.5 percent of the world’s agricultural farmland in 2019. The main impediment to the conversion from conventional to organic farming is the financial difficulties that farmers experience during the transition period in terms of decrease in yield and increase in farming costs owing to transitional practices. Furthermore, uncertainty in crop price and yield may aggravate the adverse effects of transitional practices. This article presents a multi-period optimization model for the allocation of farmland among crops and agricultural practices which allows farmers to plan a transition to organic farming while incurring a bounded shortfall of income. We calibrate our model to represent a grower of corn and soybean in Iowa and, using a seemingly unrelated regression model, crops revenues are simulated and utilized in the numerical experiments. The results show that i) our optimized crop rotation pattern outperforms other policies in the agriculture industry, including monoculture and systematic crop rotation, and that ii) our gradual conversion plan mitigates the chance of profit shortfalls.},

This paper proposes a model to determine the minimum level of the undesirable outputs that cannot be avoided in producing the desirable outputs of a production unit under weak disposability. The difference between the efficiencies of the production unit and the corresponding hypothetical unit that generates the minimum level of the undesirable outputs is a measure of the effect of generating excessive amount of the undesirable outputs on efficiency. The proposed model is able to separate the effect of generating the undesirable outputs from the inefficiency of producing the desirable outputs in measuring the efficiency of a production unit. There are two forms of weak disposability, one requires all production units to have the same proportion and another allows each production unit to have its own proportion in reducing the desirable and undesirable outputs. It is shown that the individual-proportion model is able to find lower levels of the undesirable outputs that are allowed to be generated in the production process which provides more stringent standards to better protect the environment.},

  abstract     = {Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) very often sets unrealistic targets, which require from the decision-making units (DMUs) a huge amount effort, perhaps non-assumable, for their achievement. For the identification of best practices in the benchmarking, this paper proposes considering as peers not only DEA efficient DMUs but also those that are Pareto efficient, and allowing for reference sets spanning convex combinations that are not dominated by observed DMUs. It is therefore an approach that somehow relaxes the convexity in DEA, and sets targets representing best practices in the sense that they define a course of action leading to results that are not worse than those of the real plans. A bi-level linear programming (BLP) DEA model is developed which finds the closest targets from a convex combination of the DMUs in a reference set satisfying such non-dominance requirement. This approach has proven to be successful in setting targets that require an effort significantly smaller than that needed to achieve the closest targets on the strong efficient frontier of both the DEA and the free disposal hull (FDH) technologies. In the empirical illustration, we have observed reductions in the order of 40 percentage points on average in the total effort required for their achievement, thus setting more realistically implementable directions for improving performance towards best practices than those provided by conventional DEA and FDH.},

Four strategies are considered: both platforms charge, both platforms offer the content for free, one platform charges and the other offers the content for free. As the platforms are two-sided, third-party content developers (TDs) can join and provide third-party content to consumers on the platforms. We find that two driving factors, the degree of cross-side network effect (DCNE) and function matching degree of the free version (FMDFV), affect the two platforms’ Nash equilibrium strategies. Unlike the monopolistic platform, who always chooses to charge consumers for first-party content, under a duopoly competition setting either both platforms charge for first-party content, or both platforms offer free first-party content. Interestingly, we find that a prisoner&#39;s dilemma arises when DCNE and FMDFV are both small and when the Nash equilibrium strategy is for both platforms to charge for first-party content. In addition, when both platforms charge for first-party content, a win-win outcome can be achieved for the two platforms and the consumers, if DCNE is moderately large and FMDFV is small. Interestingly, we find that it is unnecessary for a platform to charge a profit-making price to consumers or a profit-making access fee to TDs.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the risk-averse mean-variance optimization in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs). The involved variance metric concerns reward variability during the whole process, and future deviations are discounted to their present values. This discounted mean-variance optimization yields a reward function dependent on a discounted mean, and this dependency renders traditional dynamic programming methods inapplicable since it suppresses a crucial property—time-consistency. To deal with this unorthodox problem, we introduce a pseudo mean to transform the untreatable MDP to a standard one with a redefined reward function in standard form and derive a discounted mean-variance performance difference formula. With the pseudo mean, we propose a unified algorithm framework with a bilevel optimization structure for the discounted mean-variance optimization. The framework unifies a variety of algorithms for several variance-related problems, including, but not limited to, risk-averse variance and mean-variance optimizations in discounted and average MDPs. Furthermore, the convergence analyses missing from the literature can be complemented with the proposed framework as well. Taking the value iteration as an example, we develop a discounted mean-variance value iteration algorithm and prove its convergence to a local optimum with the aid of a Bellman local-optimality equation. Finally, we conduct a numerical experiment on portfolio management to validate the proposed algorithm.},

We utilize the quantiles of random variables to depict the uncertainties and then adopt the formulation of the assignment problem to develop a tractable formulation for the order statistic uncertainty set. We show that the robust optimization models with the interval uncertainty set, the budget uncertainty set, and the demand uncertainty set can be obtained as special cases of the robust optimization model with the order statistic uncertainty set. Finally, using a robust portfolio construction problem as an example, we show via numerical experiments that the order statistic uncertainty set has better performance than other uncertainty sets when the sample size is small and the correlation between random variables is low.},

  abstract     = {Omni-channel retailing allows stores to be used to fulfil online orders. The allocation of online orders to stores can however be complicated, as one needs to take into account the inventory level of each store as well as potential future in-store demand. Current practice is therefore often to use myopic order allocation rules. However, such rules may cause inventory levels to become imbalanced across the retailers network, which might result in (expensive) excessive stocks for some stores while other stores face stock-outs. We therefore study the online fulfilment and replenishment decision of an omni-channel retailer with multiple stores to fulfil the online orders, considering future demand. In contrast to previous literature, we explicitly formulate it as a multi-period problem and formulate and solve it as a periodic Markov Decision Process (MDP). Each period (e.g., week) an ordering decision is made and replenishment happens after a lead time, while online orders are allocated at the end of each sub-period (e.g., day). As the problem easily becomes intractable with multiple stores, we find an approximation of the optimal policy by decomposing the MDP and applying a one-step policy improvement approach. In an extensive numerical study, we compare our policy with two well-known heuristics from the literature and practice. The results indicate that our approach outperforms the heuristics on both profit and service levels. Further analysis shows that our method is better at allocating the online orders to the stores, resulting in more balanced and less fluctuating inventory levels across the retailers network.},

We find that there are two driving forces that shape the industry leader&#39;s procurement cooperation decisions: (1) The supplier&#39;s pricing power can be constrained under procurement cooperation, resulting in profit foci coordination between the industry leader and the CM, while (2) the industry leader&#39;s brand advantage can be either a positive or a negative driving force in its preference of procurement cooperation. We identify an interesting zone with respect to the industry leader&#39;s brand advantage in which the industry leader, the CM, and the supplier are better off without procurement cooperation. We further show the robustness of our main results by considering the impact of partial spillover in category image promotion and varying investment coefficients.},

  abstract     = {In the platform economy, many brands have already supplied products to platforms (e.g., Amazon.com and JD.com) who operate “self-run (SR)” stores. They face the challenges of whether or not operating flagship stores on the platforms and how to determine the optimal logistics choice (provided by the platforms or 3PL providers). To address these challenges, we explore the optimal channel and logistics selection strategies for brands operating on platforms through building theoretical models. This paper considers three levels of the logistics service difference between platform logistics and 3PL. It guides brands to make operational strategies of being suppliers or co-optors and choosing different logistics services. Our results imply that the brand&#39;s optimal choice of operational strategy between being “a pure supplier” or “a co-optor with the optimal logistics service selection” is affected by the logistics service level difference between platform logistics and 3PL, platform&#39;s annual service fee, and logistics fees charged by the platform and 3PL provider. Besides, we have identified the condition which could achieve a triple-win situation for the brand, the platform and consumers when the brand determines the optimal channel strategy or logistics mode strategy, respectively. We extend the models to consider consumer return behavior, spillover effect and endogenous platform logistics fee, and find that when considering consumer return behavior and spillover effect, the main results are robust. However, when considering the endogenous platform logistics fee, the brand is extremely reluctant to become a co-optor to adopt platform logistics for its flagship store.},

  abstract     = {Prepositioning of relief supplies has been widely addressed to cover the demands of humanitarian emergencies. However, cost inefficiency, item type limitation, and damage risk make solely relying on prepositioning unrealistic. We develop two-stage stochastic models that incorporate prepositioning, physical capacity reservation, and production capacity reservation for reactive procurement. As an alternative to the traditional physical capacity reservation, the production capacity reservation is inspired by the practice of the automotive industry, garment industry, etc. for manufacturing personal protective equipment during the pandemic. Our models minimize the supply-side monetary costs and the demand-side social impacts, i.e., deprivation costs. The discretized deprivation cost function is introduced to handle the nonlinear deprivation cost function. The hierarchical nature of our stochastic models motivates us to utilize the logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD). Our Benders master problem contains one set of nonbinary integer variables for prepositioning inventory and another set of continuous variables for estimating the second-stage costs, which differs from the existing LBBD works that typically contain binary and continuous variables in the master problem. Hence, a new type of logic-based Benders optimality cut, namely logic-based subgradient cut, is first introduced. To compute the cutting coefficients efficiently, heuristics that can lead to almost optimal solutions is developed. We also develop warm-start cutting planes, namely wait-and-see cuts and expected-value cuts, to help with better upper bounds and lower bounds. Extensive numerical results followed by a case study validate the efficiency of the solution method, the value of incorporating stochasticity, and the superiority of the capacity reservation.},

  abstract     = {Reducing the carbon footprint of global supply chains is a challenge for many companies. Governmental emission regulations are increasingly stringent, and consumers are increasingly environmentally conscious. Companies should therefore integrate carbon emissions in their supply chain decision making. In this paper, we study the inbound supply mode and inventory management decision making for a company that sells an assortment of products. Stochastic demand for each product arrives periodically and unmet demand is backlogged. Each product has two distinct supply modes that differ in terms of their carbon emissions, speed, and costs. The company needs to decide when to ship how much using which supply mode such that total holding, backlog, and procurement costs are minimized while the emissions associated with different supply modes across the assortment remains below a target level. We assume that shipment decisions for each product are governed by a dual-index policy for which we optimize the parameters. We formulate this decision problem as a mixed integer linear program that we solve through Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. We benchmark our decision model against two state-of-the-art approaches in a large test-bed based on real-life carbon emissions data. Relative to our decision model, the first benchmark lacks the flexibility to dynamically ship products with two supply modes while the second benchmark makes supply mode decisions for each product individually. Our computational experiment shows that our decision model can outperform the first and second benchmark by up to 15 and 40 percent, respectively, for moderate carbon emission reduction targets.},

Moreover, it leads to an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal policy parameters.

It is NP-hard and if setup operations consume capacity the feasibility problem itself is NP-complete. Several construction heuristics have been proposed in the research literature, but none of them achieves a sufficient solution quality and generality at the same time - meaning that they can be applied to different variations of the problem easily. We propose a general two-step construction heuristic (2-SCH) which sorts the customer orders in the first step and iteratively adds them to a preliminary production plan in the second step. Hence, various problem classes can be solved easily and fast. Computational experiments on the CLSP without setup times show that the 2-SCH outperforms the well-known Dixon–Silver (Dixon &amp; Silver, 1981) and the ABC heuristics Maes and Van Wassenhove (1986) and provides better results than the genetic programming approach proposed recently by Hein et al. (2018). We also apply it to the CLSP with setup times where it outperforms the construction heuristic proposed by Trigeiro (1989). Finally, we show the flexibility of the 2-SCH by applying it to the CLSP with backorders and the multi-level CLSP as well as the single-level CLSP in an online environment.},

  abstract     = {In an make-to-order (MTO) supply chain, as consumers are increasingly sensitive to the delivery time and delivery reliability, quoting a short delivery time while delivering on-time is the major challenge for the retailer. To avoid tardy delivery, the retailer usually requires the manufacturer provide reliable delivery service by hedging against its production uncertainty, which is termed as production lead-time hedging (PLTH). To examine the effect of PLTH strategy on delivery time decision and profits for both retailer and manufacturer, we develop two game models. To our best knowledge, this paper is among the first that study delivery time quotation while considering delivery reliability and production uncertainty control. Furthermore, as multi-sourcing becomes more and more popular, we extend the basic single sourcing model to the multi-sourcing model. The main methodological contribution is the development of a traceable game theoretical model that links operational hedging decisions and order allocation implication, whilst considering delivery unreliability. Our findings show that adopting the PLTH strategy, which enables the retailer to quote a short delivery time in most cases, is the dominant strategy for the retailer. Especially, the multi-sourcing outperforms the single sourcing. The single sourcing Nash game also benefits the manufacturer. However, in the single sourcing Stackelberg game, the manufacturer will join the PLTH strategy only when the consumer&#39;s delivery time sensitivity is not sufficiently large. Interesting, when the consumer&#39;s delivery time sensitivity becomes sufficiently large or the consumer&#39;s on-time delivery sensitivity becomes sufficiently small, the retailer will scarify the on-time delivery reliability.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to explore the impacts of manufacturers’ downstream distribution channels on upstream sourcing strategy and of the business relationship between manufacturers resulting from upstream sourcing transactions on downstream distribution strategy, through investigating the interplay of co-opetition and decentralization. We consider a framework with two manufacturers producing substitutable products. In the upstream component market, one manufacturer needs to source a key component from either a third-party supplier or its competing manufacturer. In the downstream consumer market, each manufacturer sells the end product through either an integrated or a decentralized distribution channel. The two channels engage in a price competition. For a given downstream distribution strategy, we find that even at a higher component price, the manufacturer who purchases the component may have incentive to source from its competitor that has an integrated channel, while having no incentive to choose a decentralized competitor. A key driver behind this contrast is that co-opetition can be substituted by a decentralized channel used by the competitor, which enables the manufacturer who purchases the component to mitigate price competition more efficiently. For a given upstream sourcing strategy, in contrast to the literature which shows that manufacturers generally prefer downstream decentralization at high competition intensity, we find that integration is always preferred by manufacturers who engage in supplier–buyer cooperation. A key underlying driver is that co-opetition helps the manufacturer who sells the component mitigate price competition more efficiently than decentralization. We also extend our analysis by investigating manufacturers’ decisions on both sourcing and distribution strategies.},

In this context, we focus on the bi-objective problem of scheduling a set of jobs on identical parallel machines to simultaneously minimize the maximum completion time and the total energy consumption over a time horizon partitioned into a set of discrete slots. The energy costs are determined by a time-of-use pricing scheme, which plays a crucial role in regulating energy demand and flattening its peaks. First, we uncover a symmetry-breaking property that characterizes the structure of the solution space of the problem. As a consequence, we provide a novel, compact mixed-integer linear programming formulation at the core of an efficient exact solution algorithm. A thorough experimental campaign shows that the use of the novel mathematical programming formulation enables the solution of larger-scale instances and entails a reduction in the computational times as compared to the formulation already available in the literature. Furthermore, we propose a new heuristic that improves the state-of-the-art in terms of required computational effort and quality of solutions. Such a heuristic outperforms the existing heuristics for the problem and is also capable of speeding up the exact solution algorithm when used for its initialization. Finally, we introduce a novel dynamic programming algorithm that is able to compute the optimal timing of the jobs scheduled on each machine to further improve the performance of the new heuristic.},

It will lead to expending extensive computational effort when evaluating the objective function. Rapid evaluation methods based on Taillard&#39;s acceleration can reduce the time complexity of function evaluation. However, existing rapid evaluation methods cannot be applied directly to the distributed flowshop group scheduling problem (DFGSP), especially to minimize the total tardiness time objective. Thus, we first proposed two theorems and their proofs based on the critical machine. Then, two rapid evaluation methods based on these theorems are proposed to accelerate the evaluation of the objective. Considering the multiple coupled sub-problems in the DFGSP, we proposed a cooperative iterated greedy algorithm (CIG) combining two rapid evaluation methods, in which inter-group and intra-group neighborhood search strategies are proposed to enhance the search depth and breadth. Comprehensive statistical experiments show that computational effort is extensively decreased in the calculation of total tardiness time, and the CIG algorithm significantly outperforms the eight compared algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Given the continuing e-commerce boom, the design of efficient and effective home delivery services is increasingly relevant. From a logistics perspective, attended home delivery, which requires the customer to be present when the purchased goods are delivered, is particularly challenging. To facilitate the delivery, the service provider and the customer typically agree on a specific time window for service. In designing the service offering, service providers face complex trade-offs between customer preferences and profitable service execution. In this paper, we map these trade-offs to different planning levels and demand management levers, and structure and synthesize corresponding literature according to different demand management decisions. Finally, we highlight research gaps and future research directions and discuss the linkage of the different planning levels.},

  abstract     = {It is common to use minimax rules to make planning decisions when there is great uncertainty about what may happen in the future. Using minimax rules avoids the need to determine probabilities for each future scenario, which is an attractive feature in many public sector settings. However there are potential problems in the application of a minimax approach. In this paper our aim is to give guidance for planners considering a minimax approach, including minimax regret which is one popular version of this. We give an analysis of the behaviour of minimax rules in the case with a finite set of possible future scenarios. Minimax rules will have sensitivity to the choice of a small number of scenarios. When regret-based rules are used there are also problems arising since the independence of irrelevant alternatives property fails, which can lead to opportunities to game the process. We analyse these phenomena considering cases where the decision variables are chosen from a convex set in R n Rn , as well as cases with a finite set of decision choices. We show that the drawbacks of minimax regret hold even when restrictions are placed on the problem setup, and we show how working with a structured set of scenarios can ameliorate the difficulty of having a final decision depend on the characteristics of just a handful of extreme scenarios.},

The conjecture asserts that a particular patrolling strategy called the E E -patrolling strategy is optimal for all tree networks. The conjecture was previously known to be true in a limited class of special cases. The E E -patrolling strategy has the advantage of being straightforward to calculate and implement. We prove the conjecture by presenting ε ε -optimal strategies for the Attacker which provide upper bounds for the value of the game that come arbitrarily close to the lower bound provided by the E E -patrolling strategy.

Starting from the deterministic model where perfect information is assumed, different formulations to address the uncertainties are constructed: classical robust optimisation, risk-minimisation stochastic programming, and adjustable robust optimisation. Experiments conducted using data from West Java, Indonesia allow us to discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each method.

  abstract     = {We study a small farmer’s optimal market choice in the presence of multiple markets in an emerging economy. A small farmer sells her product through either of the three markets available: government-regulated market, corporate-owned market (a private market having high-quality requirements), and fixed-price market (a government procurement center). Using a dynamic game of incomplete information, we examine the impact of technology choice, quality effort, and yield quantity on the farmer’s market choice. We discuss the implications of the full information and asymmetric information case analysis with the help of real-life examples. We find out that the farmer does not put her optimal quality effort due to misalignment of stakeholder payoffs. We analytically prove that market inefficiency exists due to this misalignment; we subsequently propose that contract farming can eliminate this problem. We demonstrate that the corporate-owned and government-regulated markets have individual incentives to keep their markets segregated by maintaining different threshold quality requirements. We conduct a logistic regression analysis to explain the impact of various parameters on the small farmer’s market choice. It shows the impact of change in critical parameters on the small farmer’s optimal market choice. Our analysis allows policymakers to understand the behavior of small farmers as strategic players. Our study emphasizes the importance of the threshold quality requirement of markets and prices offered in these markets on a small farmer’s market choice rather than traditional factors such as transportation cost and minimum support price. We conduct field interviews of small farmers to augment our findings.},

Building on, but different from the existing maintenance optimization literature, we present the first fully data-driven approach, where the condition threshold triggering maintenance is based purely on past condition data and failures. Numerical results for a gamma deterioration process show that the maintenance threshold resulting from our data-driven approach converges to the optimal threshold. The threshold is set higher during the initial runs-to-failure, and this helps to explore the deterioration process. An encouraging result is that the convergence is especially fast during the first few runs-to-failure so that the expected cost rate quickly converges to the minimum cost rate.},

  abstract     = {Rapid growth in the world of e-commerce is forcing traditional retailers to rethink their operational efficiency and revenue/cost streams. Retailers are facing increasing pressure to better utilize in-store inventory and reduce end-of-season markdowns. Transshipments between stores can re-balance inventory levels while preventing shortages and backorders. However, the joint inventory and transshipment problem is difficult to optimize in an extensive network, and many retailers lack the capital and managerial bandwidth required to create a system capable of transshipments between any two stores in a network of hundreds. We consider two multi-location newsvendor problems with reactive and proactive transshipments, respectively. We propose clustering stores into transshipment groups while considering both demand correlation and physical distance between locations. Since minimizing demand correlation does not follow the triangle inequality, we introduce two modified clustering algorithms that outperform existing algorithms for distance- and correlation-based clustering. For a given set of clusters, we mathematically model these two problems considering total system profit. In addition, we quantify the performance of distance-based and correlation-based clustering under several inventory ordering and transshipment policies to show the robustness of our results. To verify our methods, we test the proposed methodology using grocery sales data from IRi over three years in Houston and Dallas, TX and liquor licensee purchase information over three years from the Iowa state government. We present correlation, transshipment, and profitability analysis. We show that when demand correlation is present and stable over time, clustering based on demand correlation can maintain high transshipments and profits while decreasing solution complexity.},

Applications have been built within computer science and artificial intelligence related to e.g., decision making, image processing, machine learning for both classification, and regression. Tools for measure identification have been built. In short, as non-additive measures are more general than additive ones (i.e., than probabilities), they have better modeling capabilities allowing to model situations and problems that cannot be modeled by the latter. See e.g., the application of non-additive measures and the Choquet integral to model both Ellsberg paradox and Allais paradox. Because of that, there is an increasing need to analyze non-additive measures. The optimal transport problem is a useful tool for probabilities. It is used to define the Wasserstein distance, and also to solve problems as data matching. In this work with tackle the problem of defining the optimal transport problem for non-additive measures. We consider that it is necessary to provide appropriate definitions with a flavour similar to the one for probabilities, but for non-additive measures. The solutions should generalize the classical ones. We provide definitions based on the Möbius transform, but also based on the ( max , + ) (max,+) -transform that we consider that has some advantages. We will discuss in this paper the problems that arise to define the transport problem for non-additive measures, and provide ways to solve them. We include the definitions of the optimal transport problem, and prove some properties. We also conclude providing a definition of the Wasserstein distance for non-additive measures.},

Only for the average mechanism in the standard independent private values model with independent and uniform priors, we know that there is a continuum of equilibria. However, a non-uniform prior distribution already leads to a system of non-linear differential equations for which closed-form bidding strategies cannot be derived. Recent advances in equilibrium learning provide a numerical approach to equilibrium analysis, which can push the boundaries of existing results and allow for the analysis of environments that have been considered intractable so far. We study Neural Pseudogradient Ascent (NPGA) and Simultaneous Online Dual Averaging (SODA), two new equilibrium learning algorithms for Bayesian auction games with continuous type and action spaces. Although the environment is simple to describe, the continuum of equilibria makes it challenging for equilibrium learning algorithms. Empirically, NPGA finds the payoff-maximizing linear equilibrium, while SODA also finds non-differentiable step-function equilibria. Interestingly, the algorithms also find equilibrium with non-uniform priors and risk-averse traders for which we do not know an analytical solution. We show that the game is not globally monotone, but we can prove local convergence for a model with uniform priors and linear bid functions.},

In this context, we investigated the effect of a fuzzification procedure on the variable measurement validity and statistical results of an AHP model. Based on market data regarding factors influencing the production and marketing stages of the Taiwanese litchi export chain, we verified whether the estimated variables exhibit unbiased validity after applying a fuzzification procedure using the balanced scorecard framework and MCDM. We also measured the effectiveness of two defuzzification methods—centre of gravity (COG) and extent analysis method (EAM)—and compared their estimation performances. Further, we successfully established fresh fruit supply chain indicators and assigned weights to them corresponding to their importance. The results revealed that global priority values determined using COG were similar to those estimated using the fuzzification-free AHP, which is critical for simple hierarchical structures. The EAM accurately identified the crucial indicators and variables affecting the complex supply system of fresh fruit, highlighting the benefits of fuzzy AHP data application corresponding to extensive hierarchies. The proposed method is expected to aid decision makers in improving the quality of their decision-making by evaluating the effect of data fuzzification with respect to information scale and applying appropriate defuzzification methods to reduce option screening.},

This is accomplished by not imposing any restrictions on how the inputs and outputs can be weighted together. Unfortunately, this flexibility also has drawbacks. The underlying best practice production structure is typically very complex, which can make it difficult to understand efficiency evaluations. This flexibility may also motivate DMUs to pick specialized input‒output combinations simply to appear more efficient, particularly in applications where they are rewarded based on their DEA performance. In this paper, we therefore propose an approach that retains the fundamental principles of DEA while reducing flexibility in the evaluations. Our approach entails performing ex post k -centroid clustering of DMUs according to their input‒output mix patterns. The resulting mixed-integer programming problem seeks to put the centroids (as prototypes of their generated clusters) in their best possible light. This clustering enables us to work with a less complex underlying technology, which simplifies the evaluations and enhances their interpretability. Furthermore, it limits the possibility of DMUs inflating their performance by selecting extreme input‒output combinations. We demonstrate our approach with a simple numerical example and a complex data set involving Brazilian electricity distribution companies, providing clear and realistic illustrations of its application.},

However, choosing the right direction is challenging in empirical research. Additionally, efficiency measurement becomes problematic when input and output data are uncertain. To address these issues, we present an equivalent DDF model in multiplier form and use the robust optimization approach to construct a technology in order to develop a generalized robust-DDF measure of efficiency. Among the three commonly used predefined directions (input-oriented, output-oriented, and proportional) considered in this study, we define the robust direction as the one with the minimum price that decision-maker must pay to be immune to data uncertainty. To demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed robust direction measure, we apply it a real-life data on life insurance companies in India over eight years (2011–12–2018–19). Our results show that the proportional direction exhibits the lowest price of robustness and is therefore the most appropriate for measuring potential efficiency improvement. Additionally, the increasing efficiency trend in the life insurance industry confirms the evidence of increased work intensity due to competition resulting from insurance reforms, supporting the competition and X-efficiency hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {We propose a family of probabilistic ordinal regression methods for multiple criteria sorting. They employ an additive value function model to aggregate the performances on multiple criteria and the threshold-based procedure to derive the class assignments of alternatives. The Decision Makers (DMs) can provide certain and uncertain assignment examples concerning a subset of reference alternatives, expressing the confidence levels using linguistic descriptions. On the one hand, we introduce Bayesian Ordinal Regression to derive a posterior distribution over a set of all potential sorting models by defining a likelihood for the provided preference information and specifying a prior of the preference model. This distribution emphasizes the potential differences in the models’ abilities to reconstruct the DM’s classification examples and thus is robust to the DM’s potential cognitive biases in her judgments. We also develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to summarize the posterior distribution of the preference model. On the other hand, we adapt Subjective Stochastic Ordinal Regression to sorting problems. It builds a probability distribution over the space of all value functions and class thresholds compatible with the DM’s certain holistic judgments. The ambiguity in representing incomplete and potentially uncertain preference information by the assumed sorting model is quantified using class acceptability indices. We investigate the performance and robustness of the introduced approaches through an extensive experimental study involving real-world datasets. We also compare them against novel methods based on mathematical programming that handle potential inconsistencies in uncertain preferences in the traditional way by minimizing the misclassification error or the number of misclassified reference alternatives.},

Also, the performance-related capital inflow or outflow feature is introduced, and the wealth process is modeled by a stochastic delay differential equation. Under the time-inconsistent mean-variance criterion, we derive the explicit optimal reinsurance-investment strategy and value function under the expected value premium principle as well as the variance premium principle by solving the extended Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) delay system.

In addition, an age-based post-warranty maintenance strategy is developed for the non-renewing replacement warranted product, which provides a lower cost rate than the existing ones. Based on the indicator function method and renewal process theory, we derive the product’s life cycle cost rate.

For this purpose, a stochastic model of sales propagation among consumers is developed. This model utilizes a compartmentalized schema denoted as a Markov Chain where the local network effects impact transition rates. A key aspect of the proposed model is its multilayer structure, where products’ information streams through different layers. The equilibrium conditions and the optimal pricing strategies in a competitive market are examined. The pricing problem is investigated in two settings of homogeneous and heterogeneous (i.e., differential). It is shown that the existence and coexistence of individual products in the equilibrium point depends on an epidemic parameter, called reproduction number, that quantifies the speed by which a product’s sales spread over the network. Moreover, it is found that the correlation between the network’s layers impacts the equilibrium point. Specifically, a negative correlation between the network’s layers allows a wider coexistence region than a positive correlation. Additionally, it is found that a negative correlation between the network’s layers provides more flexibility to firms for their pricing practices and yields a higher profit. Finally, different pricing strategies are characterized with respect to model parameters and the centrality measures of different networks. It is observed that while centrality measures and optimal prices are highly correlated, node centralities alone are not enough to determine optimal prices.},

Existing approaches for maintenance policy development consider degradation to be either fully or partially observable. For the more general case of partial observability, it is usually assumed that the relationship between the underlying degradation process and the observed condition is time-invariant. In this paper, we address this major shortcoming by modeling observed CM signals through an underlying failure process wherein the linkage is time-dependent piecewise linear with jumps, and then utilizing a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to determine the optimal maintenance strategy. We investigate the structure of the policy and show that, under certain conditions, a control-limit policy exists, i.e., a belief threshold exists beyond which the optimal action is to preventively maintain the unit. Finally, we present a case study based on battery resistance data and demonstrate that our modeling procedure offers a maintenance policy that is superior to those from other competing models.},

  abstract     = {In the post-pandemic era, global supply chains are increasingly experiencing disruptions. To mitigate the effects of production disruptions, many multinational firms (MNFs) are centralising their supply chains by removing production subsidiaries back to the domestic countries (i.e. backshoring), at the expense of tax arbitrage benefits. This study conducts an analytical game-theoretical model to examine competing MNFs’ incentives to backshore, considering the trade-off between tax arbitrage and production reliability improvement. The MNFs’ equilibrium backshoring decisions, corresponding production quantities, and transferring prices are derived. We find that lower geographic tax differences and higher foreign country (or lower domestic country) disruption rates will jointly incentivise the MNFs to backshore; however, this does not guarantee higher expected profits for the two competing MNFs. The setting of symmetric MNFs could also result in the asymmetric equilibrium of backshoring strategy when the disruption risks in the same country are more correlated, which is induced by the competition mitigation incentives. Additionally, we find that backshoring always benefits customer surplus but may be detrimental to social welfare. Moreover, we endogenize the tax rate and investigate the government&#39;s tax regulation design problem. A main finding is that inducing MNFs’ backshoring by setting low tax rates would be unwise for the government under some conditions. To check the robustness of the main model, several extensions are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {When an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) sources key components from one contract manufacturer (CM), the CM may produce its own-brand product to compete against the OEM. Therefore, these two firms have a co-opetitive relationship. We develop a co-opetitive newsvendor model in which two newsvendors (OEM and CM) compete against each other in the format of product substitution. Moreover, the CM also serves as the only supplier to the OEM. We find that whether the CM’s final product is substitutable for the OEM’s product is the prerequisite condition that allows the CM to utilize its monopoly power in the key component market and earn extra profits. This result implies that being the only key component supplier of another newsvendor cannot automatically bring extra profits to the CM, except that the CM’s final product has a reasonable competitive advantage against the OEM’s final product. Furthermore, relative to the output of the purely competitive supply chain, the co-opetitive supply chain can achieve higher joint profits if the CM can fully compete against the OEM, i.e., the CM’s product can be treated as a perfect substitute for the OEM’s product. We also find that in the traditional selling to the newsvendor setting, when effective demand increases, the retailer (OEM) could be less profitable. Furthermore, we extend the discussion to the cases of horizontal decentralization and Nash bargaining. A parallel Cournot competition case is also discussed.},

This paper analyzes quality and pricing strategies for competing firms facing the risk of a severe quality-related recall making the product hazardous and leading to its removal from the market. We develop a two-stage Nash game where the probability of recall depends on the firms’ chosen quality investments, and either firm can experience a recall. We consider a utility-based model where consumers’ sensitivity to price and quality can change following the recall. Our results indicate that the competitor should lower its price after a recall if consumers’ price sensitivity changes enough and may increase or keep its price the same otherwise. Surprisingly, considering the risk of a recall does not always lead firms to enhance their product quality. If the change in consumer quality sensitivity is low enough, firms adopt an inferior product quality level than when they overlook the product recall risk, even if consumer quality sensitivity increases and/or consumer price sensitivity decreases after the recall. These results can help companies plan their pricing and quality decisions in competitive industries with potential product quality failures leading to recalls.},

  abstract     = {Companies use different criteria such as lead time, cost and quality to evaluate suppliers; often using multiple suppliers with the aim of reducing stockout risk. But in many industries there may be significant differences between the quality levels of different suppliers. Thus quality-sensitive companies may prefer an item from a primary supplier, but be forced to accept substitute products of lesser quality in case of a stock-out. Motivated by an example in the aviation industry, we introduce a Dual Sourcing problem With Stock-out dependent substitution (DSWS) which includes quality differences. Due to nonconvexity of the multi-period model, analytical characterization of the optimal policy appears intractable. To overcome this problem, we prove a relation between the optimal cost of DSWS and costs of three other problems - dual sourcing without substitution and single sourcing problems with and without backlogging. This leads us to propose the use of the dual index policy (and a variant) as heuristics for DSWS, and to develop an algorithm for parameter optimization of our heuristics. Extensive numerical experiments show that the dual index policy outperforms all other candidate solutions from the literature by at least 8\%. Our experiments show that the utilization of the back-up supplier leads to substantial cost savings and service rate increase, especially in case of high differences between holding cost rates of different quality items.},

In addition to the choice of the metaheuristic and the neighborhood structure, the success of most of the influential local search approaches relies on the ability to quickly and efficiently rule out infeasible moves and evaluate the quality of the feasible neighbors. Hence, the proposed framework focuses on the feasibility and quality evaluation of a general move when solving the job-shop and flexible job-shop scheduling problems for any regular objective function. The proposed framework is valid for any scheduling problem where the defined neighborhood structure is appropriate, and each solution to the problem can be modeled with a directed acyclic graph with non-negative weights on nodes and arcs. The feasibility conditions and quality estimation procedures proposed in the literature rely heavily on information on the existence of a path between two nodes. Thus, based on an original parameterized algorithm that asserts the existence of a path between two nodes, novel generic procedures to evaluate the feasibility of a move and estimate the value of any regular objective function of a neighbor solution are proposed. We show that many well-known literature results are special cases of our results, which can be applied to a wide range of shop scheduling problems.},

This interesting property ensures that the cutting plane method is exact for (EMSDP), even in the absence of concavity. As such, the cutting plane method, which is primarily designed for concave maximisation problems, converges to the optimal solution of (EMDSP). The method was evaluated on several standard benchmark test sets, where it was shown to outperform other exact solution methods for (EMSDP), and is capable of solving two-coordinate problems of up to eighty-five thousand variables.},

We then focus on two prevalent optimality concepts that are shown to be equivalent. Our main focus lies on the investigation of a bijective linear transformation that transforms ordinal optimization problems to associated standard multi-objective optimization problems with binary cost coefficients. Since this transformation preserves all properties of the underlying problem, problem-specific solution methods remain applicable. A prominent example is dynamic programming and Bellman’s principle of optimality, that can be applied, e.g., to ordinal shortest path and ordinal knapsack problems. We investigate the interrelation between scalarization techniques and methods based on the hypervolume indicator when applied to the ordinal and the transformed problem, respectively. Furthermore, we extend our results to multi-objective optimization problems that combine ordinal and real-valued objective functions.},

  abstract     = {Bilevel optimization is a very active field of applied mathematics. The main reason is that bilevel optimization problems can serve as a powerful tool for modeling hierarchical decision making processes. This ability, however, also makes the resulting problems challenging to solve—both in theory and practice. Fortunately, there have been significant algorithmic advances in the field of bilevel optimization so that we can solve much larger and also more complicated problems today compared to what was possible to solve two decades ago. This results in more and more challenging bilevel problems that researchers try to solve today. This survey gives a detailed overview of one of these more challenging classes of bilevel problems: bilevel optimization under uncertainty. We review the classic ways of addressing uncertainties in bilevel optimization using stochastic or robust techniques. Moreover, we highlight that the sources of uncertainty in bilevel optimization are much richer than for usual, i.e., single-level, problems since not only the problem’s data can be uncertain but also the (observation of the) decisions of the two players can be subject to uncertainty. We thus also review the field of bilevel optimization under limited observability, the area of problems considering only near-optimal decisions, and discuss intermediate solution concepts between the optimistic and pessimistic cases. Finally, we also review the rich literature on applications studied using uncertain bilevel problems such as in energy, for interdiction games and security applications, in management sciences, and networks.},

  abstract     = {To model the Exposure At Default (EAD) of revolving credit facilities, such as credit cards, most of the research thus far has employed point estimation approaches, focusing on the central tendency of the outcomes. However, such approaches may have difficulties coping with the high variance of EAD data and its non-normal empirical distribution, whilst information on extreme quantiles, rather than the mean, can have greater implications in practice. Also, many of the input variables used in EAD models are strongly correlated, which further complicates model building. This paper, therefore, proposes vine copula-based quantile regression, an interval estimation approach, to model the entire distribution of EAD and predict its conditional mean and quantiles. This methodology addresses several drawbacks of classical quantile regression, including quantile crossing and multicollinearity, and it allows the multi-dimensional dependencies between all variables in any EAD dataset to be modelled by a suitable series of (either parametric or non-parametric) pair-copulas. Using a large dataset of credit card accounts, our empirical analysis shows that the proposed non-parametric model provides better point and interval estimates for EAD, and more accurately reflects its actual distribution, compared to a selection of other models.},

  abstract     = {Counterfeiting is an ever growing problem worldwide which is exacerbated by the ease of access through e-commerce and online shopping. This calls for innovative technologies, such as blockchain, to identify, track, and prevent fake products from reaching consumers, especially for vital sectors such as the drug industry, which is the main motivation for this work. We investigate the strategic implications of using blockchain technology to deter counterfeiters. We particularly focus on the case of deceptive counterfeits that infiltrate legitimate distribution channels. Deceptive counterfeits lack the quality of genuine products and may pose immense health and safety risks to consumers who are unable to distinguish them from genuine products at the time of purchase. In contrast to prior literature that assumes that blockchain eliminates deceptive counterfeiting, we present a model that realistically considers blockchain as a technology that increases the capability of detecting counterfeits. This capability nonetheless comes at an increasing cost that may financially discourage genuine manufacturers from adopting the technology. The presented model shows that blockchain is not always financially beneficial and demonstrates that manufacturers can strategically balance between product quality and investment in blockchain to combat counterfeiting. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that, with the availability of blockchain, genuine manufacturers may be less interested to differentiate products based on quality, but rather rely on blockchain to block counterfeits.},

  abstract     = {International environmental agreements can lead to the design of environmental policy targets for individual countries. One of the most timely examples are targets aiming at increasing the share of renewable energy production in the overall energy mix. To reach these targets, corresponding governments must stimulate the private sector to undertake sufficient investments in time. This paper studies the effect of a subsidy on the probability of reaching a policy target and on the resulting welfare. The subsidy in the form of a fixed price support accelerates investment and increases the investment size. As such it helps to reach a policy target in time, but also has its own effects on the total surplus, the latter being the sum of producer and consumer surplus. The paper defines a new measure, “the expected Total Surplus corresponding to the Policy Target”   abbreviated by TSPT, which takes all these effects into account, including the penalty that is incurred upon not reaching the policy target. Based on the TSPT we determine the optimal subsidy size. We find that a policy target increases the optimal subsidy size. An international policy target can cause a tradeoff in the sense that a large investment is required to achieve the target, while at the same time such a large investment is bad in terms of total surplus. We also find that targets designed with earlier deadlines and intermediate levels of target sizes are more effective in motivating governments to reach the target with a high likelihood. A larger penalty can induce more subsidy support from the government, but always harms total surplus.},

In brief, OLPS is the task of sequentially updating the investment portfolio with the continuous update of assets’ prices. In this paper, we study the OLPS problem with transaction costs. First, we study the exact computation of the transaction cost and derive related constant upper and lower bounds, which allow us to take the transaction costs into account when deriving an optimal portfolio in each investment period. Second, considering that assets’ market states switch from time to time and their prices exhibit different behaviors in different market states, we propose the state-dependent exponential moving average method (SEMA), which can accurately predict assets’ returns based on historical return data and assets’ market states. Third, we construct the net profit maximization model (NPM) and the net profit maximization model with a risk parity constraint (NPMRP). Finally, we combine these three parts to build the state-dependent online portfolio selection algorithm (SOPS) for solving the OLPS problem with transaction cost. Our empirical results reveal that the proposed SOPS algorithm can outperform many state-of-the-art OLPS algorithms.},

This research capitalizes on Twitter list membership data to provide a new metric indicating the similarity of users’ list membership profiles. This metric is used as a proxy for perceptions of brand–celebrity (mis)fit (i.e., the degree of congruency or similarity between the celebrity and the brand) in celebrity endorsement situations, where a celebrity&#39;s fame or social status is used to promote a brand. To validate the accuracy of the method, we compare the list similarity metric with directly elicited survey data for a test set of 62 celebrities and 64 brands, ranging across eight industry sectors. This research contributes to the extant literature of studies extracting brand-related associative information (i.e., information held in consumers’ memory that contains the meaning of a brand) from large volumes of consumer online data.

  abstract     = {Reducing wind energy costs is a crucial goal to promote renewable energy and reduce dependencies on fossil fuels, both to fight climate change and to increase energy independence. Two main optimization problems arise during the design of offshore wind farms: the Wind Farm Layout Optimization (WFLO) problem and the Wind Farm Cable Routing (WFCR) problem. The goal of WFLO is to find the optimal turbine locations within a given area to maximize revenues from energy production minus construction costs. The goal of WFCR is to minimize the costs of subsea cables that transfer the electricity produced by turbines. Traditionally, the two NP-hard problems have been studied separately and are solved sequentially, despite being strongly related. The output of WFLO defines the input to WFCR, and their goals are opposing: while larger distances between turbines have a positive effect on WFLO due to reduced wake losses, they negatively impact the cable costs in WFCR. Hence, we study the combined optimization problem, unifying the two problems. We propose a novel heuristic that uses a combined local search to modify solutions of WFLO and WFCR simultaneously. While the combined approach is more computationally demanding than the sequential approach, the proposed method solves industry-scale problems and improves up to 12 million Euro the Net Present Value (NPV) of wind parks, particularly when the energy density is low. Furthermore, the combined approach reduces the up-front investment costs by up to 10\%, significantly reducing investment risks, and enabling a faster expansion of wind energy.},

  abstract     = {The overall quality of last-mile delivery in terms of operational costs and customer satisfaction is primarily affected by traditional logistics planning and the consideration and integration of driver knowledge and behavior. However, this integration has yet to be exploited. This phenomenon is mirrored in two largely separated research bodies on logistics planning and driver behavior. Bridging this gap by using and integrating historical data from actually driven tours into last-mile delivery planning is promising for research and practice. Still, it also leads to complex and large-scale routing problems, which require the development of an overall methodology that goes beyond classical optimization approaches as the needed approach requires a multi-stakeholder perspective, calls for a hybrid-analytical approach by incorporating tour prediction and prescription, and requires both data science and optimization methods. Accounting for these challenges, we suggest a hybrid decision support framework for the traveling salesman problem with time windows that combines machine learning techniques and conventional optimization methods and considers the deviation between suggested and predicted tours. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework in a case study that draws on real-world logistics data. Relying on a sensitivity analysis, we investigate and illustrate the trade-off between the level of deviation between predicted and suggested tours and tour costs. Our case study draws general managerial implications and recommendations that guide decision makers in building their decision support systems for last-mile delivery routing by instantiating our generic framework.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated lives and economies around the world. Initially a primary response was locking down parts of the economy to reduce social interactions and, hence, the virus’ spread. After vaccines have been developed and produced in sufficient quantity, they can largely replace broad lock downs. This paper explores how lockdown policies should be varied during the year or so gap between when a vaccine is approved and when all who wish have been vaccinated. Are vaccines and lockdowns substitutes during that crucial time, in the sense that lockdowns should be reduced as vaccination rates rise? Or might they be complementary with the prospect of imminent vaccination increasing the value of stricter lockdowns, since hospitalization and death averted then may be permanently prevented, not just delayed? We investigate this question with a simple dynamic optimization model that captures both epidemiological and economic considerations. In this model, increasing the rate of vaccine deployment may increase or reduce the optimal total lockdown intensity and duration, depending on the values of other model parameters. That vaccines and lockdowns can act as either substitutes or complements even in a relatively simple model casts doubt on whether in more complicated models or the real world one should expect them to always be just one or the other. Within our model, for parameter values reflecting conditions in developed countries, the typical finding is to ease lockdown intensity gradually after substantial shares of the population have been vaccinated, but other strategies can be optimal for other parameter values. Reserving vaccines for those who have not yet been infected barely outperforms simpler strategies that ignore prior infection status. For certain parameter combinations, there are instances in which two quite different policies can perform equally well, and sometimes very small increases in vaccine capacity can tip the optimal solution to one that involves much longer and more intense lockdowns.},

  abstract     = {Blood shortages are one of the main challenges in blood supply chains. To supply required blood, blood center managers face conflicting collection objectives involving costs and patients’ lives. Moreover, some challenging decisions must be made, such as routing, blood collection, location of blood stations, transshipment policy and holding inventory. In this study, a bi-objective mixed integer mathematical model is developed to address all the above-mentioned issues in the network. The model focuses on precisely determining the location of collection stations (permanent and temporary), transshipment and inventory of the blood center, routes and the quantity of collected blood to optimize the two objectives of decreasing total blood shortages and costs. Next, a subtour cut generation (SCG) method is introduced to enhance the solution approach of the problem. It leads to solving large instances more efficiently. The problem is critical and complex since missing even a non-dominated solution may lead to both negative financial impact and noncompensable outcomes. To extract all non-dominated solutions, an exact criterion space search method, called the triangle splitting method (TSM), is adopted. Several experiments are investigated for some instances from the literature. In addition, a real case study is considered. Results indicate that designing the network using the proposed mathematical model can significantly reduce total blood costs and shortages. Consequently, by utilizing the proposed methodology, blood center decision makers will have the opportunity to choose the most preferred point among extracted non-dominated solutions. Furthermore, the performance of the adopted TSM was compared with an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and lexmin epsilon constraint (LEPS). The results confirm that the adopted TSM algorithm performs much better than the improved NSGA-II and LEPS, considering bi-objective performance measures.},

  abstract     = {The steepest descent method proposed by Fliege and Svaiter has motivated the research on descent methods for multiobjective optimization, which has received increasing attention in recent years. However, empirical results show that the Armijo line search often results in a very small stepsize along the steepest descent direction, which decelerates the convergence seriously. This paper points out the issue is mainly due to imbalances among objective functions. To address this issue, we propose a Barzilai-Borwein descent method for multiobjective optimization (BBDMO), which dynamically tunes gradient magnitudes using Barzilai-Borwein’s rule in direction-finding subproblem. We emphasize that the BBDMO produces a sequence of new descent directions compared to Barzilai-Borwein’s method proposed by Morovati et al. With monotone and nonmonotone line search techniques, we prove that accumulation points generated by BBDMO are Pareto critical points, respectively. Furthermore, theoretical results indicate that the Armijo line search can achieve a better stepsize in BBDMO. Finally, comparative results of numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the efficiency of BBDMO and verify the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The consensus-reaching process (CRP) is essential for forming a solution in large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM). We designed a parallel method with a strategy-proof mechanism to support CRP in the LSGDM. First, considering the previous clustering methods’ poor performance in non-convex datasets, a density-based clustering method (DBCM) is proposed. Because the parameters of DBCM influence the performance of clustering, they are optimized based on the CRP. Second, after clustering, the analytical target cascading (ATC) method is proposed to support CRP. For ATC, we set the moderator as the first layer and subgroups as the second layer. Each subgroup connects only to the moderator and realizes the consensus separately. The final consensus is realized when the difference among the subgroups’ alternatives is lower than a threshold value. The ATC method supports the high-efficiency, independent, and distributed CRP in LSGDM, which is feasible in new situations prompted by COVID-19, like telecommuting, shared manufacturing, cloud-based medical treatment, and distributed designing. To enhance the efficiency of CRP, we propose a preference learning method based on big data. Third, a strategy-proof mechanism is proposed to prevent manipulation in LSGDM, which indicates that the expert’s profit is higher than that of the expert with manipulation, regardless of the manipulating possibility of experts. The mechanism avoids the loss caused by experts’ manipulation in the CRP. Finally, we design an enhanced gray wolf algorithm to solve the optimization problem. The advantages of the proposed method are verified by the slewing bearing design in the industrial internet.},

We show that it is possible to solve this complex variant with an exact branch-and-price approach and some derived heuristics. On one side, this problem could be modeled as a set partitioning type problem with low to moderate density (the number of ones per column, i.e., clients to visit, is not large). Such problems have some nice polyhedral properties to consider for favoring integrality. In the other side, some complex handling rules apply due to the problem’s context. A natural way is to address them in the column generation subproblem as an elementary shortest path problem with resource constraints, which constitutes the major bottleneck. To succeed in this challenge, we need to design some sophisticated techniques i) for branching to profit from the polyhedral properties and ii) for solving the column generation subproblem. Direct use of on-the-shelf algorithms does not work, unfortunately. Numerical results on a real network (four depots, five types of petroleum products, four main groups of clients, heterogeneous fleet of highly compartmented tank trucks) prove the effectiveness and high potential of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Firms that deal with weather-sensitive products are often exposed to weather risk. How a weather rebate contract can be implemented to improve the performance of a supplier-retailer supply chain is investigated. The supplier offers a weather rebate to the retailer to compensate for the loss of sales due to weather risk. Depending on certain weather conditions, the retailer receives the rebate if it orders beyond a predefined ordering quantity. Depending on its risk attitude, the supplier uses weather derivatives to minimize the downside risk. The performance of weather rebate contracts is analyzed for three cases: risk-neutral supplier and risk-averse retailer, risk-averse supplier and risk-neutral retailer, and risk-averse supplier and risk-averse retailer. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is used as the risk measure. The supply chain coordination under weather risk is investigated, and the specific conditions of a weather rebate contract leading to a Pareto-improving solution for both parties are obtained. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the weather rebate contract incorporating the risk attitude of the firms using a cooling degree days (CDD)/heating degree days (HDD)-based rebate structure. A comparative analysis between the weather rebate and wholesale price contracts is carried out based on the actual temperature and demand data. The results show that the weather rebate contract outperforms the regular wholesale price contract in all three cases. The study also demonstrates how to use weather derivatives to improve the performance of a supply chain dealing with weather-sensitive products.},

Using Cournot competition, we study the outsourcing decision between the OEM and the CM, both competing in the same market. We provide the optimal solutions and outsourcing strategies from which all three players may choose under various power dynamics. We identify Win-Win conditions in which both the OEM and the CM benefit, and Win-Win-Win conditions that all players benefit from outsourcing. If CM&#39;s product is a partial substitute to OEM&#39;s product, we find that the OEM always prefers consignment, and the CM prefers turnkey when the CM determines the outsourcing cost. However, when the OEM determines the outsourcing cost, counter-intuitive results may occur: the OEM prefers turnkey, and the CM prefers consignment are presented. Also, when the OEM determines the outsourcing cost, the CM&#39;s profit is capped at a level that the OEM is willing to share. But when the CM determines the outsourcing cost, the OEM can counteract to CM&#39;s outsourcing cost. While the supplier is always worse off in turnkey, the total profit of the supply chain is always worse off in turnkey when the outsourcing cost is determined by the CM (but not by the OEM). Numerical analysis and lemmas provide managerial insights on how a certain sourcing strategy is chosen by the OEM or the CM due to dynamics between optimal outsourcing cost, component price, and quantity decisions.},

  abstract     = {The factory logistics increases in importance as more processes and types of components are needed to produce a product. Due to the limited industrial space and stressful competitive environment, manufacturers increasingly outsource logistics-related activities to Third-Party Logistics (3PLs) and Supply hubs. However, the challenges, including unsynchronised decisions with other partners, non-value-added warehousing operations, and excessive space occupation, still burden manufacturers. This research proposes a cross-docking-based factory logistics unitisation process (CD-FLUP) that integrates the cross-docking technique into the assembly line feeding process and uses mobile shelves for component holding and delivery. We formulate the CD-FLUP with an integer program to minimise the total number of shelf units put into storage and the number of deliveries to assembly lines. Based on time decomposition, we propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach to solve the model efficiently. The time-varying value function approximation (VFA) developed in the proposed ADP approach reduces the approximation parameters and speeds up convergence significantly. The numerical experiment shows that the proposed ADP can generate high-quality solutions far more efficiently than a commercial solver.},

Specifically, we examine (i) the individual effect of discrete, non-overlapping time window constraints; (ii) the individual effect of vehicle capacity constraints; and (iii) the joint impact of both constraint types on local route efficiency gains due to the integration of pickup and delivery operations. Extending the existent literature on continuum approximation of route distances, we propose closed-form adjustment factors which accurately capture these non-trivial route efficiency effects. To derive the adjustment factors, we conduct extensive numerical experiments and apply a novel hybrid data analysis approach which combines exploratory data analysis with symbolic regression. Our analysis suggests that these real-world constraints affect the optimal stop sequence and diminish or even eliminate the expected efficiency gains from integrating first- and last-mile operations. The proposed adjustment factors are particularly relevant for the optimal strategic design and operational planning of modern, industrial-scale distribution networks in light of growing and increasingly fragmented e-commerce volumes and a high cost pressure on the logistics industry. They help researchers and practitioners to efficiently quantify the expected benefits from integrating pickup and delivery operations, and to assess under which circumstances such an integration is (not) desirable.},

  abstract     = {The maximal covering location problem (MCLP) and the partial set covering location problem (PSCLP) are two fundamental problems in facility location and have widespread applications in practice. The MCLP determines a subset of facilities to open to maximize the demand of covered customers subject to a budget constraint on the cost of open facilities; and the PSCLP aims to minimize the cost of open facilities while requiring a certain amount of customer demand to be covered. Both problems can be modeled as mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations. Due to the intrinsic NP NP -hardness nature, however, it is a great challenge to solve them to optimality by MIP solvers, especially for large-scale cases. In this paper, we present five customized presolving methods to enhance the capability of employing MIP solvers in solving the two problems. The five presolving methods are designed to reduce the sizes of the problem formulation and the search tree of the branch-and-cut procedure. For planar problems with an extremely huge number of customers under realistic types of facility coverage, we show that the number of customers in the reduced problems can be bounded above by a quadratic polynomial of the number of facilities. By extensive numerical experiments, the five presolving methods are demonstrated to be effective in accelerating the solution process of solving the MCLP and PSCLP. Moreover, they enable to solve problems with billions of customers, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than those that can be tackled by previous approaches.},

We address the Collapsed k k -Core Problem, which seeks to find a subset of b b users, namely the most critical users of the network, the removal of which results in the smallest possible k k -core. For the first time, both the problem of finding the k k -core of a network and the Collapsed k k -Core Problem are formulated using mathematical programming. On the one hand, we model the Collapsed k k -Core Problem as a natural deletion-round-indexed Integer Linear formulation. On the other hand, we provide two bilevel programs for the problem, which differ in the way in which the k k -core identification problem is formulated at the lower level. The first bilevel formulation is reformulated as a single-level sparse model, exploiting a Benders-like decomposition approach. To derive the second bilevel model, we provide a linear formulation for finding the k k -core and use it to state the lower-level problem. We then dualize the lower level and obtain a compact Mixed-Integer Nonlinear single-level problem reformulation. We additionally derive a combinatorial lower bound on the value of the optimal solution and describe some pre-processing procedures, and valid inequalities for the three formulations. The performance of the proposed formulations is compared on a set of benchmarking instances with the existing state-of-the-art solver for mixed-integer bilevel problems proposed in (Fischetti, Ljubić, Monaci, and Sinnl, 2017).},

This prompted researchers to also investigate the structure of problem instances that are hard for existing solvers. In the current paper we are interested in investigating which features make 0-1 knapsack problem instances hard to solve to optimality for the state-of-the-art 0-1 knapsack solver. We propose a set of 14 features based on previous work by the authors in which so-called inclusionwise maximal solutions (IMSs) play a central role. Calculating these features is computationally expensive and requires one to solve hard combinatorial problems. Based on new structural results about IMSs, we formulate polynomial and pseudopolynomial time algorithms for calculating these features. These algorithms were executed for two large datasets on a supercomputer in approximately 540 CPU-hours. We show that the proposed features contain important information related to the empirical hardness of a problem instance that was missing in earlier features from the literature by training machine learning models that can accurately predict the empirical hardness of a wide variety of 0-1 knapsack problem instances. Moreover, we show that these features can be cheaply approximated at the cost of less accurate hardness predictions. Using the instance space analysis methodology, we show that hard 0-1 knapsack problem instances are clustered together around a relatively dense region of the instance space and several features behave differently in the easy and hard parts of the instance space.},

  abstract     = {Conventional regression methods often fail when encountering noise. The application of a bounded loss function is an effective means to enhance regressor robustness. However, most bounded loss functions exist in Ramp-style forms, losing some inherent properties of the original function due to hard truncation. Besides, there is currently no unified framework on how to design bounded loss functions. In response to the above two issues, this paper proposes a general framework that can smoothly and adaptively bound any non-negative function. It can not only degenerate to the original function, but also inherit its elegant properties, including symmetry, differentiability and smoothness. Under this framework, a robust regressor called bounded least squares support vector regression (BLSSVR) is proposed to mitigate the effects of noise and outliers by limiting the maximum loss. With appropriate parameters, the bounded least squares loss grows faster than its unbounded form in the initial stage, which facilitates BLSSVR to assign larger weights to non-outlier points. Meanwhile, the Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) algorithm is employed to optimize BLSSVR. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets profoundly demonstrate the superiority of BLSSVR over benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {With dramatic improvements in optimization software, the solution of large-scale problems that seemed intractable decades ago are now a routine task. This puts even more real-world applications into the reach of optimizers. At the same time, solving optimization problems often turns out to be one of the smaller difficulties when putting solutions into practice. One major barrier is that the optimization software can be perceived as a black box, which may produce solutions of high quality, but can create completely different solutions when circumstances change leading to low acceptance of optimized solutions. Such issues of interpretability and explainability have seen significant attention in other areas, such as machine learning, but less so in optimization. In this paper we propose an optimization framework that inherently comes with an easily interpretable optimization rule, that explains under which circumstances certain solutions are chosen. Focusing on univariate decision trees to represent interpretable optimization rules, we propose integer programming formulations as well as a heuristic method that ensure applicability of our approach even for large-scale problems. By presenting several extensions to the univariate decision tree approach, we showcase the generality of the proposed framework. Computational experiments using random and real-world data of a road network indicate that the costs of inherent interpretability can be very small.},

We assume that the fund wealth is greater than the actuarial liability and then the manager builds a pension fund surplus. In order to contemplate sudden changes in the financial market, the surplus can be invested in a portfolio with a bond and several risky assets where the uncertainty comes from Brownian motions and Poisson processes. The aim of the participants is to maximize a utility of the extra benefits. The game is analyzed in three scenarios. In the first, the aim of the firm is to maximize a utility of the fund surplus, in the second, to minimize the probability that the fund surplus reaches a low level, and in the third, to minimize the expected time of reaching a benchmark surplus. An infinite horizon is considered, and the game is solved by means of the dynamic programming approach. The influence of the jumps of the financial market on the Nash equilibrium strategies and the fund surplus is studied by means of a numerical illustration.},

  abstract     = {Population-based cancer screening programmes invite high-risk population groups to screenings in order to increase the probability of an early diagnosis. In this paper, we study the organisation of preventive breast cancer screening, accounting for both scheduling of patients and planning of resources. Mammography screening comprises a two-stage healthcare process, encompassing a patient scan in a mammography unit and a scan examination by a central coordination center. Objectives are to minimise patient flow times and maximise resource efficiency and number of patients treated. Performance of population-based screening programmes is hampered due to large rates of patient no-shows, which is partially remedied by giving patients the option to cancel or reschedule their appointment. We model the scheduling problem as a three-stage stochastic optimisation problem and propose a diving heuristic relying on Sample Average Approximation and nested Benders decomposition to find high-quality integer solutions. Computational experimentation is performed on real-life instances to benchmark the proposed method to alternative methodologies. Results demonstrate that the proposed heuristic yields a stable performance for instances of different sizes. However, integrating the three decision stages increases significantly the complexity, such that larger-sized instances are preferably solved via two separate solution stages to improve resource efficiency. In addition, insights are provided in the value of stochastic optimisation and strategies to cancel or reschedule appointments mitigating the impact of no-show uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and new viral variations with higher transmission and mortality rates have highlighted the urgency to accelerate vaccination to mitigate the morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, this paper formulates a new multi-vaccine, multi-depot location-inventory-routing problem for vaccine distribution. The proposed model addresses a wide variety of vaccination concerns: prioritizing age groups, fair distribution, multi-dose injection, dynamic demand, etc. To solve large-size instances of the model, we employ a Benders decomposition algorithm with a number of acceleration techniques. To monitor the dynamic demand of vaccines, we propose a new adjusted susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) epidemiological model, where infected individuals are tested and quarantined. The solution to the optimal control problem dynamically allocates the vaccine demand to reach the endemic equilibrium point. Finally, to illustrate the applicability and performance of the proposed model and solution approach, the paper reports extensive numerical experiments on a real case study of the vaccination campaign in France. The computational results show that the proposed Benders decomposition algorithm is 12 times faster, and its solutions are, on average, 16\% better in terms of quality than the Gurobi solver under a limited CPU time. In terms of vaccination strategies, our results suggest that delaying the recommended time interval between doses of injection by a factor of 1.5 reduces the unmet demand up to 50\%. Furthermore, we observed that the mortality is a convex function of fairness and an appropriate level of fairness should be adapted through the vaccination.},

  abstract     = {This study develops a stochastic-robust optimization model for inter-regional power system planning. The model is formulated as Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC) with two levels of decision makers. In the bottom-level, various individual regions separately make generator investment, operating, and trading plans for the minimization of their own costs in a perfectly competitive market. In the top-level, a central system operator makes the investment plan of cross-border transmission lines for the minimization of total system cost, anticipating how generators in various regions respond to those investments. Two different levels of data uncertainties are considered in the problem, namely scenario and local uncertainties. The uncertainties are handled by combining the advantages of stochastic programming and robust optimization methods. The proposed model is applied for power system planning in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) between 2020 and 2040. The modelling results show that the integration of a cross-border power grid results in a substantial shift in the generation portfolio, and can potentially reduce total costs by up to 6.0\%. The cost savings primarily result from the increased utilization of renewable energy resources, facilitated by cross-border electricity transmission. We assessed the performance of our proposed approach in handling data uncertainties by comparing it with existing practices. The comparison results demonstrate that our stochastic-robust approach not only enhances the capacity expansion plan’s robustness to meet power demand and CO 2 2 emissions targets, but also significantly reduces investment and operational costs.},

  abstract     = {Given the uncertainty of orders and the dynamically changing workload of charging stations, how to dispatch and charge electric vehicle (EV) fleets becomes a significant challenge facing e-hailing platforms. The common practice is to dispatch EVs to serve orders by heuristic matching methods but enable EV drivers to independently make charging decisions based on their experiences, which may compromise the platform’s performance. This study proposes a Markov decision process to jointly optimize the charging and order-dispatching schemes for an e-hailing EV fleet, which provides pick-up services for passengers only from a designated transportation hub (i.e., no pick-up from different locations). The objective is to maximize the total revenue of the fleet throughout a finite horizon. The complete state transition equations of the EV fleet are formulated to track the state-of-charge of their batteries. To learn the charging and order-dispatching policy in a dynamic stochastic environment, an online approximation algorithm is developed, which integrates the model-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework with a novel SARSA( Δ Δ )-sample average approximation (SAA) architecture. Compared with the model-free RL algorithm and approximation dynamic programming (ADP), our algorithm explores high-quality decisions by an SAA model with empirical state transitions and exploits the best decisions so far by an SARSA( Δ Δ ) sample-trajectory updating. Computational results based on a real case show that, compared with the existing heuristic method and the ADP in the literature, the proposed approach increases the daily revenue by an average of 31.76\% and 14.22\%, respectively.},

This is the first attempt to measure efficiency in terms of firms’ contribution to employment opportunities for women, a social and developmental issue gaining much public attention. The empirical application uses data on 1109 Peruvian coffee farms over the period 2017–2019. Sample farms operate in two natural regions of Peru – namely Sierra, and Selva – where farming systems differ because of variations in resource endowments and socioeconomic conditions. Results indicate the presence of interregional heterogeneity in production technologies of sample farms. Sierra coffee farms outperformed coffee farms located in the Selva region in all three dimensions of sustainability efficiency, suggesting that it is the latter that are in greater need of efficiency improvement interventions. Results further show that both Sierra and Selva coffee farms performed worst with respect to environmental efficiency, implying a greater scope for reducing nitrous oxide emissions with existing production technology and resources.},

The core of our approach is Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in estimating whether a node belongs to the optimal solution. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach, and the results suggest that using our approach can effectively solve the DST problems with at least 95.04\% accuracy. Compared to solving DST problems using traditional methods, our approach significantly improves the solvability of DST problems with acceptable execution time. We further explore how our approach can be applied to different scenarios, such as large-scale graphs. Moreover, we show that our approach can be smoothly applied to solve several variants of the Steiner Tree problem, including Steiner Forest problems. In summary, the proposed approach shows promising results and can be implemented in practice. Research limitations and future directions are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Applications of data envelopment analysis often incorporate inputs and outputs stated as proportions or percentages, which are typically used to represent socio-economic and quality characteristics of the production process. As is well known, the use of such ratio measures is inconsistent with the assumption of convexity required by the conventional variable and constant returns-to-scale (VRS and CRS) technologies, and with the additional assumption of scalability in the case of CRS. Several existing approaches to modelling technologies with ratio data assume that either we know the exact volume numerators and denominators of all ratio measures or, alternatively, that we do not have such information. The former approaches are not always realistic and the latter are equivalent to benchmarking each decision making unit against a significantly reduced subset of observed units, which has a negative impact on the discriminating power of the model. In this paper, we develop new technologies under the assumptions of VRS and CRS that bridge the gap between the two known approaches. They are applicable in a general scenario in which we can specify some lower and upper bounds for the numerators or denominators of the ratio measures, which should be unproblematic in most practical settings. We demonstrate the usefulness and advantages of the developed approach by an application in the context of school education.},

We present a novel fixpoint-based dynamic programming approach to compute risk-sensitive feedback policies with Pareto-optimal combinations of mean and semivariance. We illustrate the effectiveness and the applicability of our concepts compared to state-of-the-art heuristics. For various numerical examples the results show that our approach clearly outperforms all other heuristics and obtains a performance guarantee with less then 0.2\% optimality gap.

The problem is to locate new facilities to maximize the worst-case captured user demand. We show that, interestingly, our robust model preserves the monotonicity and submodularity from its deterministic counterpart, implying that a simple greedy heuristic can guarantee a ( 1 − 1 / e ) (1−1/e) approximation solution. We further show the concavity of the objective function under the classical multinomial logit (MNL) model, suggesting that an outer-approximation algorithm can be used to solve the robust model under MNL to optimality. We conduct experiments comparing our robust method to other deterministic and sampling approaches, using instances from different discrete choice models.

  abstract     = {This paper considers optimal design of queueing networks in which each node consists of a single-server FIFO queue and an infinite-server queue, which is referred to as incubation queue. Upon service completion at a FIFO queue, a job splits (forks) into two parts: the first part is routed to the next node on its route, and the second part is placed in the incubation queue. Routing of the jobs of multiple types is governed by a central decision maker that decides on the routes for each job type and aims to minimize the mean turnaround time of the jobs, i.e., the time spent in the system until service completion at the FIFO queue in the last node, and at all incubation queues on the job’s route, which may be viewed as a join operation. We provide explicit results for the turnaround time when all service and inter-arrival time distributions are exponential and invoke the Queueing Network Analyzer when these distributions are general. We then develop a Simulated Annealing approach to find the optimal routing configuration. We apply our approach to determine the optimal routing configuration in a chemistry analyzer line.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 outbreak put healthcare systems across the globe under immense pressure to meet the unprecedented demand for critical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE). The traditional cost-effective supply chain paradigm failed to respond to the increased demand, putting healthcare workers (HCW) at a much higher infection risk relative to the general population. Recognizing PPE shortages and high infection risk for HCWs, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends allocations based on ethical principles. In this paper, we model the infection risk for HCWs as a function of usage and use it as the basis for distribution planning that balances government procurement decisions, hospitals’ PPE usage policies, and WHO ethical allocation guidelines. We propose an infection risk model that integrates PPE allocation decisions with disease progression estimates to quantify infection risk among HCWs. The proposed risk function is used to derive closed-form allocation decisions under WHO ethical guidelines in both deterministic and stochastic settings. The modelling is then extended to dynamic distribution planning. Although nonlinear, we reformulate the resulting model to make it solvable using off-the-shelf software. The risk function successfully accounts for virus prevalence in space and in time and leads to allocations that are sensitive to the differences between regions. Comparative analysis shows that the allocation policies lead to significantly different levels of infection risk, especially under high virus prevalence. The best-outcome allocation policy that aims to minimize the total infected cases outperforms other policies under this objective and that of minimizing the maximum number of infections per period.},

Searching for efficient solution algorithms for UE has been a recurring study subject in transportation research and has attracted much attention in past decades. Existing solution algorithms can be classified into three categories: link-based, path-based, and origin-based. This paper introduces an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm that is different from these categories. Based on the origin-based formulation of UE problem, an equivalent problem is proposed which eliminates the flow conservation conditions through the augmented Lagrangian function. In order to make use of the ADMM, the network links should be grouped into different blocks, where the links in the same block are disconnected. This link grouping problem falls into the category of edge-coloring problem in graph theory, and it follows the Vizing theorem. A novel approach is developed for the link grouping problem. For links in the same block, we have a separable subproblem, which is solved in parallel by the gradient projection algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed algorithm, which shows its computation efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Airlines face many different planning processes until the day of operation. The assignment of aircraft to flights is of central importance and is determined by the optimization of the two planning problems Fleet Assignment and Tail Assignment. The competitiveness of the derived flight sequences strongly depends on the Turnaround Handling, which coordinates the processes on the ground between two flights. All of these planning problems have in common that they often need to be reoptimized on the day of execution due to unplanned events. In many cases, this is still done manually with the expertise of airline operators in the airline operations center. In order to automate this process and to find the best possible reoptimization solution, the medium-term aircraft assignments and the short-term plannable turnaround processes should be optimized in a combined manner. For this purpose we provide a new mixed integer program, which considers Fleet Assignment, Tail Assignment and Turnaround Handling. Due to the size of the model, it cannot be solved efficiently as a complete model using available solvers. Hence, we develop a new decomposition algorithm that alternately solves the combined assignment problems and the turnaround model, and projects the turnaround costs into the aircraft assignment’s objective function. In a computational study with realistic airline data, it is shown that for many problem instances this method yields feasible and optimal solutions much faster than comparable benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we consider the assortment planning problem of a manufacturing firm with multiple plants. Making a plant capable of producing a product is costly, therefore the firm cannot manufacture every product in every plant. In case a customer’s order in a particular region is not available in the closest plant, another plant can ship the product using transshipment, but at an extra transportation cost. If a demanded product is not produced in any plant, substitution from first choice to a second choice is also considered, which can be either satisfied by the closest plant, or by transshipment. The problem is to jointly determine assortments in all plants such that total profit after assortment and transshipment costs is maximized. The resulting problem is complex as transshipments and substitutions are intertwined to affect assortment decisions. We show that the optimal assortments are nested, i.e., the assortment of a plant with a smaller market share is a subset of the assortment of a plant with a larger share. The common assortment of all locations is shown to be in the popular set (i.e., no leapfrogging in product popularities), and a sufficient condition on substitution rate is derived for each individual assortment to be in the popular set. We conduct an extensive numerical study to understand the effects of allowing transshipments on resulting assortments. Moreover, we introduce approximate assortment planning algorithms that benefit from the derived structural properties, which are shown to generate near-optimal assortments in a broad range of instances tested.},

In our scheduling model, a given set of jobs with different release dates are scheduled onto a machine that can process multiple jobs simultaneously in a batch. However, the number of jobs in a batch is limited. Each job can be rejected subject to a job-dependent penalty cost, but the total penalty cost of the jobs rejected is required to be no greater than a given bound. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the makespan of accepted jobs and the total rejection penalty of rejected jobs. We provide some important structural properties and develop fast approximation algorithms. We also present an efficient polynomial time approximation scheme (EPTAS) with near-linear-time complexity. Our results significantly improve both the time complexities and performance bounds of several existing algorithms and approximation schemes.},

The problem is first formalized as a mixed integer program. Because it is already difficult to solve, the simpler problem with a fixed sequence of operations is then extensively studied. Some properties are derived for the specific problem with a fixed sequence. These properties show that the complexity of the problem depends on the structure of the energy pricing scheme. They are also used to propose two heuristic approaches. Relying on these heuristics, we further develop an iterative tabu search for the general problem. Extensive computational experiments are carried out to evaluate the solution methods and the potential gains on the total energy cost, depending on the flexibility associated to the maximum allowed makespan and on the time-of-use structures.},

The canonical problem contains a set of customers, each associated with an area (neighborhood) that is generally circular. In the GCETSP, each customer is associated with a set of disks with different radii. Having multiple disks around the customer allows us to model several real-world applications, in which a higher benefit is gained by more closely approaching each target. A prize is assigned to each disk and is collected if the disk is traversed. The goal is to determine the route that visits each customer and the depot and maximizes the difference between the total collected prize and the route length. The total collected prize is given by the sum of the customer prices’ associated with the innermost disk traversed by the route. We propose a heuristic algorithm and an evolutionary approach, specifically, a genetic algorithm (GA), to solve this problem. We evaluate the GA’s performance on instances generated from benchmark CETSP and TSP instances. We then compare GA solutions with CETSP solutions and solutions obtained through an alternative approach based on pre-selecting intersection points with customers’ disks. The results show that the GA can identify high-quality solutions with a short computing time.},

  abstract     = {Container Terminals (CTs) are continuously presented with highly interrelated, complex, and uncertain planning tasks. The ever-increasing intensity of operations at CTs in recent years has also resulted in increasing environmental concerns, and they are experiencing an unprecedented pressure to lower their emissions. Operational Research (OR), as a key player in the optimisation of the complex decision problems that arise from the quay and land side operations at CTs, has been therefore presented with new challenges and opportunities to incorporate environmental considerations into decision making and better utilise the ‘big data’ that is continuously generated from the never-stopping operations at CTs. The state-of-the-art literature on OR&#39;s incorporation of environmental considerations and its interplay with Big Data Analytics (BDA) is, however, still very much underdeveloped, fragmented, and divergent, and a guiding framework is completely missing. This paper presents a review of the most relevant developments in the field and sheds light on promising research opportunities for the better exploitation of the synergistic effect of the two disciplines in addressing CT operational problems, while incorporating uncertainty and environmental concerns efficiently. The paper finds that while OR has thus far contributed to improving the environmental performance of CTs (rather implicitly), this can be much further stepped up with more explicit incorporation of environmental considerations and better exploitation of BDA predictive modelling capabilities. New interdisciplinary research at the intersection of conventional CT optimisation problems, energy management and sizing, and net-zero technology and energy vectors adoption is also presented as a prominent line of future research.},

Convex expectile regression (CER) is a closely related nonparametric approach, which has the following expectile property: the relative share of negative deviations is equal to the weight of negative deviations. The first contribution of this paper is to extend these quantile and expectile properties to the general set of shape constrained nonparametric functions. The second contribution is to relax the global concavity assumptions of the CQR and CER estimators, developing the isotonic nonparametric quantile and expectile estimators.

  abstract     = {Reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions is often not free, and estimating the marginal abatement cost of CO 2 emissions (MCAC) provides valuable information for policy analysis and decision-making. Past studies often assume that producers would take a uniform abatement option that overlooks the heterogeneity of abatement options and the possibility of taking energy-related abatement options (e.g., merely cutting down fossil fuel consumption). This study contributes to the literature by investigating how different abatement options can be incorporated into estimating the MCAC. It first provides an expository derivation of the MCAC by opening the “black box” of the production process, which reveals that the MCAC can be negative if switching to fuels with lower carbon content generates positive marginal profit. We then develop a new approach for estimating the MCAC, where six alternative abatement options are considered. A case study on China&#39;s thermal power industry is presented, which reveals that the least-cost abatement option varies across different provinces and periods.

  abstract     = {The future of work is likely to include private platform-enabled marketplaces which remain a new, fertile ground for research. This paper focuses on hybrid workflows which utilize the expertise of in-house (IH) and on-demand (OD) workers to perform complex knowledge intensive tasks under service constraints. Our primary contributions are in identifying and modeling an innovative application of OR in the new economy, proving its complexity and proposing a high-quality heuristic. We formulate a scenario-based mathematical programming model of a private talent marketplace for Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS). This model considers uncertainty in task, worker, and OD marketplace characteristics. Problem complexity is illustrated. We develop a simplified queuing theory-based model of PKIBS to characterize the structure of the OD marketplace. Propositions from the queueing model inform IH workforce size, IH and OD workforce composition, and OD pricing decisions. A Tabu-based One Period Look Ahead heuristic based on propositions from the simplified queuing theory-based model is proposed. Heuristic performance is evaluated using a problem upper bound and MIP solution for small problems, and experiments based on a cyber security use case. Results illustrate the mix of OD and IH workforce and sophisticated hybrid workflows for different market conditions.},

  abstract     = {Survival models with time-varying covariates (TVCs) are widely used in the literature on credit risk prediction. However, when these covariates are endogenous, the inclusion procedure has been limited to practices such as lagging these variables or treating them as exogenous. That leads to possible biased estimators (depending on the strength of the exogeneity assumption) and a lack of prediction framework that consolidates the joint evolution of the survival process and the endogenous TVCs. The use of joint models is a suitable approach for handling endogeneity, however, it comes at a high computational cost. We propose a joint model for bivariate endogenous TVCs and discrete survival data using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). We illustrate the implementation via simulations and build a model for full-prepayment consumer loans. We also propose a methodology for individual survival prediction using the Laplace method that leads to more accurate approximations than comparable approaches. We evidence the superiority of joint models over the traditional survival approach for an out-of-sample and out-of-time analysis.},

However, since a 3PSP is another stakeholder, whether the two parties will cooperate to complete the bike-rebalancing procedure needs further discussion. This study uses evolutionary game theory to study the strategic choices of bike-sharing companies’ rebalancing strategies (i.e., self-operation, joint venture, and outsourcing) and 3PSPs’ cooperation strategies (i.e., cooperation, no cooperation, and cooperation with deviation). Using DIDI Bike data, one of the largest dockless bike-sharing companies in China, to simulate a model and conduct sensitivity analyses, we show that (1) outsourcing and cooperation with deviation are long-term optimal strategies when 3PSPs have a small variable cost advantage and a high penalty and rebalancing effort; (2) not outsourcing (i.e., joint venture or self-cooperation) and not cooperating are long-term optimal strategies when the variable cost advantage, penalty, and the rebalancing effort is small for 3PSPs; and (3) outsourcing and cooperation are long-term optimal strategies when variable cost advantage, penalty, and rebalancing effort is high for 3PSPs. The results show that choosing third parties with a large variable cost advantage would help bike-sharing companies reach a rebalancing level. However, a penalty mechanism may be not effective in deterring 3PSPs from deviations in service quality.},

  abstract     = {Recently, more realistic customer choice rules based on the Multinomial Logit have been proposed for the follower competitive facility location problem, together with efficient exact solution methods based on cut generation approaches. We address this problem in the case in which a new chain, the entrant, decides to locate some stores in a market where there are already incumbent chains offering substitute products, which differ from the entrant&#39;s product in secondary features. The entrant&#39;s stores are very similar to each other, and this is also the case for the incumbent chains. In this case, for a given customer, purchases made at the stores of one of the chains are correlated, given the similitude between these stores. The Multinomial Logit rule does not capture this correlation. We propose using a Nested Logit rule which does capture this correlation and, in addition, represents a sequential decision process by the customer, who first chooses the chain and then the store. We prove the concavity of the objective function in the problem and find exact solutions using Branch and Cut over a generalized linear reformulation of the problem and four different types of cuts: submodular and an improvement of these, outer-approximation, and a set of new cuts. Our results show locations that fit better the intuition and practice. Furthermore, our computational times improve in many cases upon the known results for similar problems.},

With the platform’s logistics, some manufacturers adopt the platform’s logistics while others do not. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model consisting of a platform, a manufacturer, and consumers to investigate the interplay between the logistics strategy and the platform’s channel choice. In the first stage, the platform decides whether to build its self-supporting logistics and its optimal logistics level. In the second stage, the platform chooses among the marketplace channel, the reselling channel and the hybrid channel. In the third stage, the manufacturer chooses whether to adopt the platform’s logistics if its store exists in the market (under the marketplace or hybrid channel). In the fourth and fifth stages, the manufacturer and the platform make pricing strategies. The results indicate the interplay between the two types of strategies. First, when the platform logistics level is much higher than the third-party logistics, the platform’s optimal channel choice is to operate the hybrid channel. Second, the platform’s channel choice affects the manufacturer’s logistics provider. When the platform logistics level is slightly higher than the third-party logistics level, the manufacturer chooses to adopt the platform’s logistics under the marketplace channel and not adopt it under the hybrid channel. We also find that the platform chooses to build its self-supporting logistics when the third-party logistics level is in the low or medium ranges.},

  abstract     = {Many multi-agent systems have a single coordinator providing incentives to a large number of agents. Two challenges faced by the coordinator are a finite budget from which to allocate incentives, and an initial lack of knowledge about the utility function of the agents. Here, we present a behavioral analytics approach for solving the coordinator’s problem when the agents make decisions by maximizing utility functions that depend on prior system states, inputs, and other parameters that are initially unknown. Our behavioral analytics framework involves three steps: first, we develop a model that describes the decision-making process of an agent; second, we use data to estimate the model parameters for each agent and predict their future decisions; and third, we use these predictions to optimize a set of incentives that will be provided to each agent. The framework and approaches we propose in this paper can then adapt incentives as new information is collected. Furthermore, we prove that the incentives computed by this approach are asymptotically optimal with respect to a loss function that describes the coordinator’s objective. We optimize incentives with a decomposition scheme, where each sub-problem solves the coordinator’s problem for a single agent, and the master problem is a pure integer program. We conclude with a simulation study to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach for designing a personalized weight loss program. The results show that our approach maintains efficacy of the program while reducing its costs by up to 60\%, while adaptive heuristics provide substantially less savings.},

The propensity of a consumer to return an end-of-use or an end-of-life item, however, also depends on his/her sensitivity to environmental sustainability. In this paper, we study the impact of simultaneously determining the optimal density of a network of collection centers as well as the most appropriate level of investment in the public&#39;s environmental awareness. We adopt a Nerlove-Arrow-type advertising model to capture the potential influence of public awareness campaigns in increasing the consumers’ environmental sensitivity over time. The potential negative impact of the travel distance to the nearest collection site is also incorporated. Thus, we present a dynamic modeling framework for the joint design of the network infrastructure and the public campaign intensity. A case study is presented based on the operations of the Canadian E-Waste Stewardship Program in the Greater Vancouver region. We find that investments into environmental awareness can enable the take-back scheme to improve its collection rates significantly. Our findings through the case study also reveal that running an advance campaign prior to the launch of the collection network can be an effective strategy in most cases. In addition, we present an extended model, which highlights that increasing the investment in environmental awareness can be utilized as a lever to offset the impact of increased hauling costs.},

In data envelopment analysis the shadow prices can be calculated using the dual variables, or weights, from the solved linear programming program. However, the weights, and therefore the shadow prices, for corner points are not necessarily unique and most linear program solvers simply return one of the possible optimal values. To overcome this uncertainty we build on a model suggested by Cooper et al. (2007) which for corner points selects a set of weights that is most supported by other points on the frontier. In the context of incorporating undesirable outputs, we adjust their idea for the weak disposability model and suggest an alternative approach to break ties in case two sets of weights are supported by the same number of points. We illustrate the models using a constructed example dataset and also apply it on a sample of UK dairy farms.},

More specifically, we consider a dynamic set optimization problem, where a decision-maker offers a subset (assortment) of products to a consumer and observes the response in every round. Consumers purchase products to maximize their utility. We assume that a set of attributes describe the products, and the mean utility of a product is linear in the values of these attributes. We model consumer choice behavior using the widely used Multinomial Logit (MNL) model and consider the decision makers problem of dynamically learning the model parameters while optimizing cumulative revenue over the selling horizon T . Though this problem has recently attracted considerable attention, many existing methods often involve solving an intractable non-convex optimization problem. Their theoretical performance guarantees depend on a problem-dependent parameter which could be prohibitively large. In particular, current algorithms for this problem have regret bounded by O ( κ d T ) , where κ is a problem-dependent constant that may have an exponential dependency on the number of attributes, d . In this paper, we propose an optimistic algorithm and show that the regret is bounded by O ( d T + κ ) , significantly improving the performance over existing methods. Further, we propose a convex relaxation of the optimization step, which allows for tractable decision-making while retaining the favorable regret guarantee. We also demonstrate that our algorithm has robust performance for varying κ values through numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Providing spare parts and maintenance services to customers has become an important revenue stream for equipment manufacturers. This paper studies a Production-Inventory-Maintenance (PIM) system where a manufacturer serves an installed base of machines. Each machine contains the same critical component, whose degradation behaviour is described by a Markov process and captured via condition monitoring. When the state of a component reaches a prespecified replacement threshold, the machine is considered to have failed and incurs downtime penalties until being repaired. There are a few repair servers and queueing dynamics follows the Machine Interference Problem (MIP). Component deterioration and server congestion provide advance demand information, which helps plan the production of spare parts in a make-to-stock routine. The unsatisfied requests for spare parts are fulfilled by emergency replenishments with lost-sales penalties. We formulate the production-control problem as a continuous-time Markov decision process, characterize the structure of the optimal policy, and develop an effective heuristic policy. Through numerical experiments, we reveal a number of notable differences between managing PIM systems and operating MIP systems alone: (1) Although identifying more degradation states has no value to MIP systems, PIM systems benefit substantially from such a refined state identification. (2) While MIP systems prefer more repair servers and higher repair operation efficiency, greater repair capacity may worsen the performance of PIM systems. (3) When the product of repair service rate and server number is fixed, a single server is always preferred in MIP systems. However, PIM systems could perform better with multiple less-efficient servers.},

Current literature for this innovative concept bases upon the use of a single truck to pick up multiple robots from robot depots and release them for delivery. This limits the practical use for industry applications in bigger cities. The demand for home deliveries is steadily increasing, and with that, the requirements for potential delivery by robots. The truck-and-robot concept therefore needs to be refined to meet these requirements by a fleet of delivery trucks. We generalize the truck-and-robot delivery with robot depots for the simultaneous routing of multiple trucks. This means that a fleet of trucks is available, and customer orders and robot deliveries must be assigned to delivery tours. We formulate this problem as multi-vehicle truck-and-robot routing problem . This extension includes routing multiple trucks and the corresponding clustering decisions while choosing the optimal drop-off points for robots and their delivery. We develop a tailored heuristic solution approach based on a novel neighborhood search, the Set Improvement Neighborhood Search (SINS). We show that transportation costs can be reduced by up to 24\% using our integrated multi-vehicle routing and robot scheduling approach compared to a sequential cluster-first-route-second approach. Complementary experiments show a 62\% savings potential compared to conventional truck delivery. We derive structural insights into the novel delivery system by analyzing the impact of changing customer distributions, delivery time windows, and truck or robot availability.},

The advantages of the two models are combined within a three-phase method that we propose to solve the problem to global optimality.

Our work differs from existing articles that investigate the remanufacturing strategy in the presence of quality decisions, by actively including the innovative features in the remanufactured products, as opposed to passively carrying over product quality to the remanufactured products. We consider three remanufacturing strategies: (i) not remanufacturing, (ii) remanufacturing without adding innovative features, and (iii) remanufacturing adding innovative features (upgrading). To analyze the problem, we create a single-period model where the OEM determines the level of innovation and the quantity of new products, in both competitive settings, and either the OEM or IR determines the remanufacturing quantity depending on the competitive setting. We investigate how the firms’ environmental impact and the consumer surplus are affected by the competition and the remanufacturing strategy.},

  abstract     = {Managing blood product inventories can be challenging due to stochastic supply and demand, varying shelf lives of the products, and the need to account for multiple objectives such as the minimisation of costs, product shortage and expiry. This complex setting makes it difficult to include all relevant aspects, while ensuring that the computation time required to optimise the blood product supply chain remains reasonable. Consequently, existing models typically fail to solve realistic-sized problems and thus have not found much use in supporting decisions faced by blood service practitioners. This research develops a methodological framework for modelling platelet inventories, resulting in robust managerial recommendations. Specifically, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming model to define optimal order-up-to levels that minimise costs, shortage and expiry in a decentralised decision-making setting. We exploit the problem structure to decompose it and make the model computationally tractable. To ensure that the model is practically relevant, we develop it with practitioners from the Finnish Red Cross Blood Service. We use the model to estimate the costs of extending the shelf life of platelets from five to seven days through two methods and assess the impacts of this extension on optimal inventory decisions. These results can be used to optimise the Finnish platelet supply chain and inform future cost-effectiveness analyses regarding shelf life extension.},

The operational decision of interest is the transportation mode choice from the waypoint to the destination market, dependent on available information, including time and temperature history via RFID and sensors. We use analytical modeling to derive optimal transportation policies and generate generalizable, managerial insights. We then apply the analytical model in a numerical case study investigating the transportation of vine-ripened tomatoes from the Netherlands to the United States. Our analytical and numerical studies result in a number of interesting findings. First, the quality of sensor measurements may or may not impact the optimal policy and the decision maker can be guided accordingly. Second, better information may enable more profitable transport decisions, but doing so can have a negative impact on product quality at the destination. Third, we show that more stringent quality requirements by retailers may drive salvaging produce at the waypoint and thereby negatively impact service levels, despite penalties. Fourth, we identify the factors that drive the value of information under multiple information scenarios and establish both the direction and magnitude of their effects. Finally, both the analytical and numerical findings indicate that the information value is robust under measurement error. Thus, even if measurements are not perfect, RFID and sensor technology enabled information can be used to dynamically adjust forwarding decisions for perishable products, which can yield significant improvements to operational performance.},

To reduce food waste, we develop a two-period dynamic pricing and inventory decision model for perishable products with partial lost sales. Faced with random demand, the firm has two opportunities to make inventory decisions during the selling season. The first inventory decision (for Period 1) is made at the beginning of the selling season and used to detect the market information, and the second decision (for Period 2) is to update the inventory level by reordering or returning based on the fully-realized market demand information. The firm may carry the unsold units left from Period 1 to Period 2, and there may be two types of stocks for the same products, but with different perceived levels of quality (old v.s. fresh) in Period 2. Both price competition and product substitutability exist between the fresh and old units. Using a dynamic programming approach, we derive the optimal solutions for the order quantities and retail prices of products under various quality conditions. We find that the reorder quantity at the middle of the season decreases with the quantity and the quality of old units. The pricing of fresh units does not depend on the quality or quantity of old units, while the pricing of old units increases with their quality and decreases with respect to the quantity.},

  abstract     = {The flowshop group scheduling problem (FGSP) has become a hot research problem owing to its practical applications in modern industry in recent years. The FGSP can be regarded as a combination of two coupled sub-problems. One is the group scheduling sub-problem with sequence-dependent setup times. The other is the job scheduling sub-problem within each group. A mixed integer linear programming model is built for the FGSP with the makespan criterion. Based on the problem-specific knowledge, i.e., the sequence-dependent group setup times are greater than the processing time of jobs, and the number of machines is small, the group scheduling sub-problem is approximated into an asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). Then, a matheuristic algorithm (MA) is proposed by integrating a branch-and-cut algorithm and an iterated greedy (IG) algorithm, where the branch-and-cut algorithm is used to generate the optimal Hamiltonian circuit for sub-group sequences of a group sequence obtained by the IG. On 405 test instances, the proposed MA performs significantly better than several state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature.},

  abstract     = {To meet the expectations of demanding customers, there is a trend toward warehouse automation, especially in large e-commerce distribution centers. In this context, this paper considers robotized sorting systems, where autonomous mobile robots are applied to automatically sort products after picking. The robots load individual pieces of stock keeping units (SKUs) at a loading station, drive to the collection points temporarily associated with customer orders, and autonomously release them, e.g., by tilting a tray mounted on top of each robot. In these systems, a huge number of products approach the loading station with an interarrival time of very few seconds. Hence, we have a very challenging real-time environment for the following decisions: First, since pieces of the same SKU are interchangeable among orders with a demand for this specific SKU, we must assign pieces to suitable orders. Furthermore, each order must be temporarily assigned to a collection point. Finally, we must assign robots to transport jobs. These interdependent decisions become even more involved, since we (typically) do not possess complete knowledge on the arrival sequence but have merely a restricted lookahead of the next approaching products. We show that even in such a fierce environment sophisticated optimization, based on a novel two-step multiple-scenario approach applied under real-time conditions, can be a serviceable tool to significantly improve the sortation throughput. With our approach a limited-lookahead system is shown to almost reach the performance of a (hypothetical) system with complete knowledge on the approaching products.},

We propose new formulations for PVDP and PEDP. They rely on structural properties of perfect dominating sets and are computationally compared with their counterparts from the literature. For the new PEDP formulation, in particular, running times for standard state-of-the-art mixed integer programming codes are shown to frequently lead to speed-ups of orders of magnitude, over their corresponding performances for the remaining PEDP formulations.},

Such unitary variant induces a combinatorial optimization problem for which we introduce a nontrivial special case that is polynomially solvable when the capacity of each vehicle is at most 2 but it is NP-Hard otherwise. We also study the polytope associated with the solutions to this problem. We introduce new families of valid inequalities and give necessary and sufficient conditions under which they are facet-defining.

Accordingly, it is a challenging task to reduce the size of an uncertainty set without changing the resulting objective value too much. On the other hand, robust optimization problems with many scenarios tend to be hard to solve, in particular for two-stage problems. Hence, a reduced uncertainty set may be central to find solutions in reasonable time. We propose scenario reduction methods that give guarantees on the performance of the resulting robust solution. Scenario reduction problems for one- and two-stage robust optimization are framed as optimization problems that only depend on the uncertainty set and not on the underlying decision making problem. Experimental results indicate that objective values for the reduced uncertainty sets are closely correlated to original objective values, resulting in better solutions than when using general-purpose clustering methods such as K-means.},

  abstract     = {The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) has always been considered as one of the most complex and industry essential scheduling problems. Optimizing the makespan of a given schedule generally involves using dedicated algorithms, local search strategies, or metaheuristics. These approaches, however, heavily rely on classical computational power, which is bounded by the physical limits of microcontrollers and power issues. Inspired by the promising results achieved for Quantum Annealing (QA) based approaches to solve JSSP instances, we propose a new approach that uses gate-model quantum architecture as an alternative to QA. We find that we can make use of the time-indexed JSSP instance representation to build a cost Hamiltonian, which can be embedded into Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to find an optimal solution to a basic JSSP instance. We demonstrate the use of QAOA to solve the JSSP, and we evaluate its efficiency and accuracy for this problem from experimental results, as there is an increased urgency to demonstrate the applicability of quantum optimization algorithms. We also find that optimal variational parameters form patterns that can facilitate computation in bigger quantum circuits. Additionally, we compare the obtained noiseless simulation results of gate-model quantum circuits demonstrating the relationship between two evaluation criteria - makespan and energy. Finally, we analyze and present the overall performance of our approach with the increasing deadline and simulated depth of QAOA circuits.},

By distinguishing between various material distributions and stability types, this expands into a small family of related questions. While many upper and lower bounds on the necessary numbers of faces and vertices have been established, none of these questions has been so far resolved. Adapting an algorithm presented in Bozóki et al. (2022), here we offer the first complete answer to a question from this family: by using the toolbox of semidefinite optimization to efficiently generate the hundreds of thousands of infeasibility certificates, we provide the first-ever proof for the existence of a monostatic polyhedron with point masses, having minimal number ( V=11 ) of vertices (Theorem 3) and a minimal number ( F=8 ) of faces. We also show that V=11 is the smallest number of vertices that a mono-unstable polyhedron can have in all dimensions greater than 1 (Corollary 6).},

  abstract     = {Currently, the simplex method and the interior point method are indisputably the most popular algorithms for solving linear programs, LP s. Unlike general conic programs, LP s with a finite optimal value do not require strict feasibility in order to establish strong duality. Hence strict feasibility is seldom a concern, even though strict feasibility is equivalent to stability and a compact dual optimal set. This lack of concern is also true for other types of degeneracy of basic feasible solutions in LP . In this paper we discuss that the specific degeneracy that arises from lack of strict feasibility necessarily causes difficulties in both simplex and interior point methods. In particular, we show that the lack of strict feasibility implies that every basic feasible solution, BFS , is degenerate; thus conversely, the existence of a nondegenerate BFS implies that strict feasibility (regularity) holds. We prove the results using facial reduction and simple linear algebra. In particular, the facially reduced system reveals the implicit non-surjectivity of the linear map of the equality constraint system. As a consequence, we emphasize that facial reduction involves two steps where, the first guarantees strict feasibility, and the second recovers full row rank of the constraint matrix. This illustrates the implicit singularity of problems where strict feasibility fails, and also helps in obtaining new efficient techniques for preproccessing. We include an efficient preprocessing method that can be performed as an extension of phase-I of the two-phase simplex method. We show that this can be used to avoid the loss of precision for many well known problem sets in the literature, e.g., the NETLIB problem set.},

  abstract     = {We consider a generalised comprehensive Look-ahead Security-constrained Optimal Power Flow (LASCOPF) formulation under the N − 1 N−1 contingency criterion over multiple dispatch intervals. We observe that the number of decision variables varies quadratically with the number of intervals. To improve scalability, we propose a reduced LASCOPF formulation for which the number of decision variables varies only linearly. We extend these formulations to the N − k N−k contingency criterion. For reduced LASCOPF we observe that the number of decision variables varies with the number of k k -permutations of contingencies. To improve scalability, we propose a formulation that is further reduced to vary only with the number of k k -combinations. Also, we show that our formulations can be extended simply to model recovery from the corresponding outages. Furthermore, we present LASCOPF under the N − 1 N−1 contingency criterion using DC and AC power flow under generator contingencies. We prove that, barring borderline cases, solving the reduced formulation is equivalent to solving the comprehensive formulation. We extend these results to the N − k N−k contingency criterion. Finally, we present numerical results on the IEEE 14 bus, IEEE 30 bus and IEEE 300 bus test cases, and the 1354 bus part of the European power system using AC power flow to demonstrate the computational advantage of the reduced formulations under the N − 1 N−1 and N − 2 N−2 contingency criteria.},

  abstract     = {Robust optimization and stochastic optimization are the two main paradigms for dealing with the uncertainty inherent in almost all real-world optimization problems. The core principle of robust optimization is the introduction of parameterized families of constraints. Sometimes, these complicated semi-infinite constraints can be reduced to finitely many convex constraints, so that the resulting optimization problem can be solved using standard procedures. Hence flexibility of robust optimization is limited by certain convexity requirements on various objects. However, a recent strain of literature has sought to expand applicability of robust optimization by lifting variables to a properly chosen matrix space. Doing so allows to handle situations where convexity requirements are not met immediately, but rather intermediately. In the domain of (possibly nonconvex) quadratic optimization, the principles of copositive optimization act as a bridge leading to recovery of the desired convex structures. Copositive optimization has established itself as a powerful paradigm for tackling a wide range of quadratically constrained quadratic optimization problems, reformulating them into linear convex-conic optimization problems involving only linear constraints and objective, plus constraints forcing membership to some matrix cones, which can be thought of as generalizations of the positive-semidefinite matrix cone. These reformulations enable application of powerful optimization techniques, most notably convex duality, to problems which, in their original form, are highly nonconvex. In this text we want to offer readers an introduction and tutorial on these principles of copositive optimization, and to provide a review and outlook of the literature that applies these to optimization problems involving uncertainty.},

By estimating a regression discontinuity design with a four-component stochastic frontier panel data model, we estimate the causal impact of a policy intervention on the outcome variable, whenever the treatment status depends on an exogenous threshold. We distinguish between (i) the direct effect of the intervention, (ii) the efficiency-enhancing effect, or (iii) their combination. Moreover, we distinguish between persistent (time-invariant) and transient (time-varying) inefficiency components while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, which is important for policy implications. We showcase the practical usefulness of the proposed approach by estimating the effect of providing additional resources on schools that exceed an exogenously set share of disadvantaged students in secondary schools in Flanders, Belgium. We also demonstrate the trade-off between balance of the covariates in the treated and control group and statistical power. Thus, despite insignificant effects in a balanced but smaller sample close to the discontinuity, the results become significant in the unbalanced sample with more statistical power. In both samples, we observe that the policy had an effect on the outcome mostly through the efficiency-enhancing channel. To this extent, we show that the model specification including both direct and indirect effects outperforms the other two specifications and it offers a more exhaustive perspective from a policy view point.},

  abstract     = {Trade-in promotions are increasingly recognized as an effective strategy in retail operations to boost sales. Retail firms can restrict their trade-in programs to current consumers through an exclusive trade-in program or accept trade-ins from competitors’ consumers through a nonexclusive trade-in program. Moreover, consumers may build brand loyalty towards the products they have used and thus affect their future trade-in choices. However, the effects of brand loyalty on trade-in strategies in a competitive market remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, this study analytically examines the impact of brand loyalty on exclusive and nonexclusive trade-in programs by developing a stylized duopoly model. The results show that as a defensive strategy, an exclusive trade-in program effectively retains consumers when brand loyalty is sufficiently weak. Conversely, as an offensive strategy, a nonexclusive trade-in program is more likely to attract competitors’ consumers. An exclusive trade-in program is always the dominant strategy for both firms compared with the no trade-in benchmark. However, a nonexclusive trade-in program is better for both firms when brand loyalty is sufficiently strong. Moreover, an exclusive trade-in program benefits firms with a high proportion of trade-in-sensitive consumers. In contrast, firms with a high proportion of the overall consumer base benefit from a nonexclusive trade-in program. The results not only support trade-in practices but also provide important practical implications related to trade-in competition for policymakers.},

  abstract     = {Flight delays are major sources of disruptions in airline operations. To mitigate them, day-ahead aircraft routing aims to create flight sequences that can absorb delays and minimize their propagation. However, flight delays are unknown ahead of operations; moreover, predicting delays is complicated by the fact that historical data encompass both primary delays (arising from exogenous sources) and propagated delays (arising from cascading effects in an airline’s network). This paper thus develops predictive and prescriptive analytics models to forecast primary delays and to optimize day-ahead aircraft routing toward delay mitigation. We develop a quantile regression model to reconstruct primary delays from historical data, and an ensemble machine learning model to predict them based on flight-level features, environmental features, and traffic features—estimated via a queuing model of airport operations. Then, we formulate deterministic and stochastic optimization models to support day-ahead aircraft routing. Using real-world data from Vueling Airlines , we evaluate the models out of sample against real-world counterfactuals. Results show that our predictive model achieves a mean absolute error of 7–8 minutes and that our prescriptive models can reduce delay costs by 3–5\%. This paper shows the benefits of predictive and prescriptive analytics to enhance the robustness of airline operations by (i) creating shorter aircraft rotations, and (ii) strategically allocating schedule slack to avoid the propagation of long delays in later phases of the day. This research led to the deployment of the models in collaboration with the Vueling data science unit.},

  abstract     = {Due to the computational complexity, the staff scheduling problem is generally decomposed into two subproblems, i.e. staff rostering and task assignment problems. Very often, this could result in suboptimal solutions. Thus, we study an integrated staff rostering and task assignment (ISRTA) problem in this paper. Previous studies formulate this problem as task- and roster-based ISRTA models, which can only solve small-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel shift-based ISRTA model, which exhibits less symmetry and greatly reduces the number of variables and constraints. We extend the shift-based ISRTA model to six real-world requirements, i.e., shift flexibility, qualification, travel time, contractual rules, task connection preference, and fairness, which ensure the applicability of the result schedule. To efficiently solve the shift-based ISRTA model, we propose a clique-based aggregated model that enhances the performance of the basic shift model. Further, two heuristics, i.e., rolling horizon algorithm and iterative shift selection algorithm, are proposed to speed up the solution process. Based on randomly generated 24 benchmark instances and 16 real-world instances from a major airline, computational results show that the shift-based ISRTA model outperforms the task- and roster-based ISRTA models. For small- and mid-scale problems, the shift-based ISRTA model can be solved optimally or near-optimally directly using a commercial solver, and the rolling horizon algorithm and iterative shift selection algorithm can solve large-scale problems and obtain high-quality solutions.},

A set of trucks available at an inland container terminal must fulfil shippers’ requests of transporting containers within time windows and, to do so, can perform multiple daily trips. A request may entail picking up or delivering containers either at the shippers’ premises, the inland terminal or the seaport. Demand for empty containers can be satisfied by either using the available limited stock at the inland terminal, by street-turning or, ultimately, by retrieving them at a local depot for empties resulting in extra mileage. Hence, the minimization of routing costs also entails synchronizing trucks’ trips that retrieve and add empty containers to the inland terminal stock to avoid unnecessary visits to the empty depot. After modelling the problem mathematically, we develop an exact column-and-row generation approach embedded in a branch-and-price framework. To accelerate the solving process of the pricing problem, we propose effective strategies by combining a set of tailored pricing algorithms. These strategies perform well on a set of adapted Solomon’s instances up to 100 nodes and against a standard branch-and-cut solver. Finally, experiments on real-world instances, inspired by a case study of an inland terminal at the Port of Rotterdam region, provide insights into current planning practices.},

  abstract     = {At some point during transport, intermodal containers will be stored at a terminal, where they are typically stacked on top of each other. Stacking yields a higher utilization of the area but may lead to unproductive reshuffle moves when containers below another need to be retrieved. Preventing reshuffles has a financial benefit, as it not only avoids the costs of executing the reshuffle but also decreases the time needed to retrieve a container. Typically, researchers consider only the retrieval of containers and assume the retrieval order is fully known. In addition, existing studies do not consider the stacking restrictions imposed by a reach stacker, which is commonly used in smaller inland terminals. This research aims to design decision support for determining real-life applicable container stack allocations so that the expected number of reshuffles is minimized. We propose a model that includes both arrivals and departures of containers as well as a certain level of uncertainty in the order thereof. The problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process and solved using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP). Through numerical experiments on real-life problem instances, we conclude that the ADP approach drastically outperforms a benchmark heuristic from the literature.

One solution to overcome this problem is to compute an enclosure, a special kind of coverage, of the nondominated set. For that computation one often makes use of so-called local upper bounds. In this paper we present a generalization of this concept. For the first time, this allows to apply a warm start strategy to the computation of an enclosure. We also show how this generalized concept allows to remove empty areas of an enclosure by deleting certain parts of the lower and upper bound sets which has not been possible in the past. We demonstrate how to apply our ideas to the box approximation algorithm, a general framework to compute an enclosure, as recently used in the solver called BAMOP. We show how that framework can be simplified and improved significantly, especially concerning its practical numerical use. In fact, we show for selected numerical instances that our new approach is up to eight times faster than the original one. Hence, our new framework is not only of theoretical but also of practical use, for instance for continuous convex or mixed-integer quadratic optimization problems.},

In this paper, we focus on improving the higher moments of mean-variance-efficient portfolios by designing the target so that its first two moments match those of the chosen efficient portfolio but has more desirable higher moments. We show theoretically that the optimal portfolio is in general different from the mean-variance portfolio, but remains mean-variance efficient when asset returns are Gaussian. Otherwise, it can move away from the efficient frontier to better match the higher moments of the target distribution. An extensive empirical analysis using three characteristic-sorted datasets and a dataset of 100 individual stocks indicates that the proposed framework delivers a satisfying compromise between mean-variance efficiency and improved higher moments.},

The influences of the relevant parameters on the prices, demands and profits of the supply chain and its members, and on the consumer surplus, are analyzed. The theoretical results are verified through numerical analyses and corresponding managerial insights and suggestions are provided. The results show that the RSP does not necessarily benefit from its integration. When the online retail platform dominates the market, the integration can improve the RSP profit only when the consumer acceptance of the reusable products is low. The RSP integration always benefits the RSP when the power of the online secondhand platform is at least equal to that of the online retail platform, and always harms the online retail platform, the supply chain and the consumers. The RSP coordination mechanism is discussed in an extension. The extensions also show that only under strict conditions, can the online retail platform enter the secondhand market and integrate with the RSP.},

  abstract     = {A novel approach based on a specialized interior-point method (IPM) is presented for solving large-scale stochastic multistage continuous optimization problems, which represent the uncertainty in strategic multistage and operational two-stage scenario trees. This new solution approach considers a split-variable formulation of the strategic and operational structures. The specialized IPM solves the normal equations by combining Cholesky factorizations with preconditioned conjugate gradients, doing so for, respectively, the constraints of the stochastic formulation and those that equate the split-variables. We show that, for multistage stochastic problems, the preconditioner (i) is a block-diagonal matrix composed of as many shifted tridiagonal matrices as the number of nested strategic-operational two-stage trees, thus allowing the efficient solution of systems of equations; (ii) its complexity in a multistage stochastic problem is equivalent to that of a very large-scale two-stage problem. A broad computational experience is reported for large multistage stochastic supply network design (SND) and revenue management (RM) problems. Some of the most difficult instances of SND had 5 stages, 839 million linear variables, 13 million quadratic variables, 21 million constraints, and 3750 scenario tree nodes; while those of RM had 8 stages, 278 million linear variables, 100 million constraints, and 100,000 scenario tree nodes. For those problems, the proposed approach obtained the solution in 1.1 days using 174 gigabytes of memory for SND, and in 1.7 days using 83 gigabytes for RM; while CPLEX v20.1 required more than 53 days and 531 gigabytes for SND, and more than 19 days and 410 gigabytes for RM.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of finding near-optimal Markovian randomized (MR) policies for finite-state-action, infinite-horizon, constrained risk-sensitive Markov decision processes (CRSMDPs). Constraints are in the form of standard expected discounted cost functions as well as expected risk-sensitive discounted cost functions over finite and infinite horizons. We first show that the aforementioned CRSMDP optimization problem possesses a solution if it is feasible (that is, if there exists a policy which satisfies all the constraints). Secondly, we provide two methods for finding an approximate solution in the form of an ultimately stationary (US) MR policy. The latter is achieved through two approximating finite-horizon CRSMDPs constructed from the original CRSMDP by time-truncating the original objective and constraint cost functions, and suitably perturbing the constraint upper bounds. The first approximation gives a US policy which is ϵ ϵ -optimal and feasible for the original problem, while the second approximation gives a near-optimal US policy whose violation of the original constraints is bounded above by a specified tolerance value ϵ ϵ . A key step in the proofs is an appropriate choice of a metric that makes the set of infinite-horizon MR policies and the feasible regions of the three CRSMDPs compact, and the objective and constraint functions continuous. We also discuss two applications and use an infinite-horizon risk-sensitive inventory control problem as an example to illustrate how existing solution techniques may be used to solve the two approximate finite-horizon problems mentioned above.},

There are often very limited process observations. Thus, there exist both simulation and model uncertainties in the system performance estimates. In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, model uncertainty often dominates. The proposed framework can produce a confidence interval that accounts for simulation and model uncertainties by using a metamodel-assisted bootstrapping approach. Furthermore, a variance decomposition is utilized to estimate the relative contributions from each source of model uncertainty, as well as simulation uncertainty. This information can be used to improve the system mean performance estimation. Asymptotic analysis provides theoretical support for our approach, while the empirical study demonstrates that it has good finite-sample performance.},

When a manufacturer encroaches on the retail market by introducing a direct channel, both the manufacturer and its existing retailer need to set retail prices for their own channels. In setting the retail prices, either the manufacturer or the retailer may be the first mover, or the two may set prices simultaneously. We show that retail pricing leadership significantly affects the encroachment decision if the manufacturer has a selling cost disadvantage in the direct channel. If the manufacturer can lead by setting its direct channel selling price first, it is more likely to encroach, and will do so as long as the degree of consumer acceptance of the direct channel is larger than 1/2. Otherwise, the manufacturer is equally likely to encroach if the retailer sets the retail price first or if they set the prices simultaneously, and the encroachment decision depends on the degree of consumer acceptance of the direct channel and the direct selling cost. Interestingly, when the manufacturer sets its direct selling price before or simultaneously with the retailer, it launches the direct channel to create a threat to the retailer, while when the retailer has first-mover advantage, the manufacturer may directly sell to consumers.},

  abstract     = {Sourcing affordable replacement parts is a major issue in the secondary market. Independent remanufacturers (IRs) typically use two sources. They harvest collected products for useable spare parts and procure new spare parts. The first option is complicated by having products with specific parts showing high relative failure rates, e.g., a washing machine that, when collected for remanufacturing, almost always contains a defective PCB board. Thus harvesting for such PCB boards is a challenging option and arguably more complicated when the part failure rate asymmetry (PFRA) increases. The second option is potentially expensive when the failed parts are proprietary, i.e., sold by a monopolist manufacturer at a high price. In this paper, we examine both of those challenges. Using a stylized model and starting with a setting without proprietary parts, we observe that a high PFRA does not necessarily lower IR profitability but might increase both collection and remanufacturing. We extend our results to examine the impact of PFRA on remanufacturing decisions for products containing proprietary parts, and our results are structurally identical. Interestingly, an increase in the proprietary content of a product can benefit the IR in specific settings. Yet, proprietary parts always lead to less remanufacturing, while the collection may increase. For policymakers invested in promoting remanufacturing, our results show important trade-offs on the interplay between part proprietariness and the PFRA.},

Touting the right customers, such as those located nearby customers who already placed orders, allows for more efficient routes over time. However, it also increases the frequency of visits at such touted customers as they are serviced before they would normally require, which leads to smaller demand volumes per visit. To tackle this trade-off, we propose several strategies to decide which customers to tout and when, using the characteristics of the customers as well as the current plan at the time of touting. Specifically, using the demand and the location information, we approach the ones which are close to the current tour, relatively far from the depot and not likely to easily be covered in the near future. This information is then used as a part of different touting strategies, which are further embedded in a rolling-time horizon vehicle routing algorithm to address the multi-period nature of the problem. These different strategies are empirically compared in a simulation based on a real-world waste collection problem. We demonstrate that touting indeed allows to significantly reduce the travel distance in a dynamic vehicle routing problem.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, reducing emissions has been important for mitigating global warming and the effects of traffic congestion. As a variant of the green vehicle routing problem (GVRP), the time-dependent GVRP with time windows (TDGVRPTW) accounts for both time-dependent travel times and time window constraints and integrates the minimization of carbon emissions. Therefore, the TDGVRPTW is of great practical interest. In this paper, we design an effective adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm for solving the TDGVRPTW. The proposed algorithm uses a time discretization search (TDS) method to determine the departure time from each customer node, together with efficient feasibility checking procedures. The ALNS algorithm has been extensively tested on benchmark instances derived from the literature. The results show that, for small-size instances for which optimal solutions are known, the proposed algorithm can solve several instances to optimality and that high-quality solutions can be obtained for the instances that are not solved to optimality. For large-size instances involving up to 1000 customers, ALNS is particularly effective in computing solutions using a very limited amount of computing time.},

The timeliness of medical services provided to patients is crucial to emergency departments as it directly impacts the mortality and morbidity of urgent patients.

Thus, hospital administrators may need to investigate solutions to improve the efficiency of the emergency department. In this work, we study the dynamic problem of scheduling patients to doctors, aiming at minimizing the total weighted tardiness. We propose a simple reoptimization heuristic based on multiple queues of patients in accordance with their urgency levels, and then combine it with an effective variable neighborhood search. We also propose a scenario-based planning approach that uses sampled scenarios to anticipate future events and the variable neighborhood search to schedule patients. The methods are adapted to handle a problem variant where information on arrival time and urgency level of some patients can be received in advance by the emergency department. With a comprehensive computational study on two sets of realistic instances from Hong Kong SAR of China and Italy, we validate the performance of the proposed methods, evaluating the benefits of having more doctors and receiving early information.},

  abstract     = {Moldable tasks allow schedulers to determine the number of processors assigned to each task, thus enabling efficient use of large-scale parallel processing systems. We consider the problem of scheduling independent moldable tasks on processors and propose a new perspective of the existing speedup models: as the number p of processors assigned to a task increases, the speedup is linear if p is small and becomes sublinear after p exceeds a threshold. Based on this, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm to minimize the makespan. As a by-product, we also propose an approximation algorithm to maximize the sum of values of tasks completed by a deadline; this scheduling objective is considered for moldable tasks for the first time while similar works have been done for other types of parallel tasks.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates the use of time-dependent decisions in the context of hub-location routing. Instead of setting up the entire system at once, a planning horizon partitioned into several periods is considered during which the system is to be phased-in. In addition to installing the hubs, decisions are also to be made concerning the hub-level network, namely, the hub edges to use. The origin-destination flows are assumed to be time-dependent as well as the costs underlying the problem which include, set up costs for hubs and hub edges and variable operational costs at the hubs. A mathematical model is developed for the problem that can be solved up to proven optimality with a general-purpose solver for small instances of the problem. For larger instances, a four-phase matheuristic that combines principles of relax-and-fix, variable neighborhood descent and local branching schemes is proposed. In addition, two variants of the matheuristic have been developed. The above model and methodology are tested using data generated by extending existing hub location instances to our problem. The obtained results are detailed and analyzed in depth. The major conclusion is that by capturing time in the decision-making process, one may find solutions that better hedge against parameter changes throughout time. Furthermore, the overall procedure presented in this work is quite general in the sense that it can be easily adapted to other multi-period decision making problems and different objective functions.},

  abstract     = {Maintaining a positive balance between cash outflow and inflow is very important for contractors to smoothly implement projects. Based on this fact, with the objective of minimising the maximal cash flow gap, this paper investigates a dedicated resource-constrained multiproject scheduling problem with stochastic activity duration where renewable resources are dedicated to individual projects in advance, and the schedule of each project is then arranged independently. First, we construct an optimisation model for the problem and propose properties for it. Second, for the NP-hardness of the problem, we design a tabu search algorithm consisting of two modules and develop the measures according to the proposed properties to improve the searching efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, we conduct a computational experiment on a randomly generated dataset to evaluate the performance of the developed algorithm and analyse the effects of key parameters on the objective function value. The conclusions are as follows. The developed tabu search algorithm with the improvement measures is the most promising algorithm for solving the studied problem, and the contribution of the improvement measures may vary as the project parameters change. The maximal cash flow gap increases along with the resource factor, required robustness of project schedule, and discount rate per period of cash flows, and decreases with the increase in the project deadline, resource strength, number of milestone activities, advance payment proportion, or progress payment proportion. The interactions among the resource strength, resource factor, and project deadline may also generate an effect on the maximal cash flow gap.},

  abstract     = {In classical deterministic scheduling models, it is common to assume that each of the parameters has only a single predefined value. However, in many applications this is not the case, and there is a certain level of uncertainty in the values of the parameters. The multi-scenario approach is one of the most common approaches to model uncertainty. In this approach, each scenario defines a different possible realization of the parameters and the scheduler has to decide upon the exact schedule prior to knowing the exact scenario realization. Different scenarios may arise for a large number of reasons, such as: ( i ) the assignment of different workers to the processing operations, where the identity of the worker is beyond the scheduler’s control; ( ii ) unpredictable changes in weather conditions; or ( iii ) a possible strike at the port, which may affect job release dates. The purpose of this paper is to offer a unified framework for scheduling in a multi-scenario environment by presenting an up-to-date survey of results in this field. We also included some new results, presented here for the first time, and suggest many challenges for future research.},

  abstract     = {Precision medicine that enables personalized treatment decision support has become an increasingly important research topic in chronic disease care. The main challenges in designing a treatment algorithm include modeling individual disease progression dynamics and designing adaptive treatment selection strategy. This study aims to develop an adaptive treatment selection framework tailored to an individual patient’s disease progression pattern and treatment response. We propose a Partially Observable Collaborative Model (POCM) to capture the individual variations in a heterogeneous population and optimize treatment outcomes in three stages. The POCM first infers the disease progression models by subgroup patterns using population data in stage one and then fine-tunes the models for individual patients with a small number of treatment trials in stage two. In stage three, we show how the treatment policies based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) can be tailored to individual patients by utilizing the disease models learned from the POCM. Using a simulated population of chronic depression patients, we show that the POCM can more accurately estimate the personal disease progression than the traditional method of solving a hidden Markov model. We also compare the POMDP treatment policies with other heuristic policies and demonstrate that the POCM-based policies give the highest net monetary benefits in majority of parameter settings. To conclude, the POCM method is a promising approach to model the chronic disease progression process and recommend a personalized treatment plan for individual patients in a heterogeneous population.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to predict optimal solutions for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) via machine learning (ML). To find high-quality solutions efficiently, existing work uses a ML prediction of the optimal solution to guide heuristic search, where the ML model is trained offline under the supervision of solved problem instances with known optimal solutions. To predict the optimal solution with sufficient accuracy, it is critical to provide a ML model with adequate features that can effectively characterize decision variables. However, acquiring such features is challenging due to the high complexity of COPs. This paper proposes a framework that can better characterize decision variables by harnessing feedback from a heuristic search over several iterative steps, enabling an offline-trained ML model to predict the optimal solution in an adaptive manner. We refer to this approach as adaptive solution prediction (ASP). Specifically, we employ a set of statistical measures as features, which can extract useful information from feasible solutions found by a heuristic search and inform the ML model as to which value a decision variable is likely to take in high-quality solutions. Our experiments on three NP-hard COPs show that ASP substantially improves the prediction quality of an offline-trained ML model and achieves competitive results compared to several heuristic methods in terms of solution quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ASP can be used as a heuristic-pricing method for column generation, to boost an exact branch-and-price algorithm for solving the graph coloring problem.},

  abstract     = {The DebtRank approach is a popular metric used to estimate systemic risk in network models. It assumes that the loss distribution of a distressed debtor among its creditors follows a pro-rata fashion, proportional to the loan granted to the debtor. However, the banking literature documents that the loss distribution can be heterogeneous across different creditors. In this study, we extend the DebtRank framework assuming a heterogeneous pattern of the loss distribution, inspired by the default pecking order . Grounded on the empirical literature, we assume distressed debtors employ some criterion (equity, equity-to-assets ratio, out-degree, or loan extended) to rank the creditors they are willing to default on first. Applying this framework to an extensive Brazilian data set, we find that the systemic risk is sensitive to the heuristic adopted for the default pecking order, with the pro-rata pattern serving as a lower bound. We can interpret this result in light of the dual role of financial networks, which can serve as a conduit for both risk-sharing and shock propagation. DPO may affect the balance between these two effects. We find empirical evidence corroborating this hypothesis by assessing the role of interconnectedness (as measured by the network density) in driving systemic risk. When losses are mostly transmitted to the more fragile creditors, the density positively affects systemic risk. In this instance, the financial network serves primarily as a channel for shock propagation rather than risk-sharing.},

To enable reliability analysis without failure data, a new generalised reliability method is proposed for complex systems, based on the survival signature and using stochastic processes to model degradation. The combination of the survival signature and stochastic processes enables the proposed method to be applied to complex systems with different structures and stochastically degrading components. First, system reliability is analysed based on the survival signature and a generalised stochastic process. Then, component reliability analysis based on the generalised stochastic process is introduced using Wiener and Gamma processes. Finally, the approach presented in this paper is illustrated using two numerical examples, and the estimation results are compared with those calculated using failure time distribution functions.},

This is generally not taken into account when estimating cost efficiency. In the operations research literature, for example, the standard approach to estimating cost efficiency is based on the assumption that managers choose inputs to minimise the cost of producing realised (i.e., observed) outputs. However, when outputs are unknown at the time input decisions are made, most managers will instead choose inputs to minimise the cost of producing output targets (e.g., minimum service levels, predicted maximum demands). In this paper, we explain how data envelopment analysis (DEA) estimators can be used to estimate cost, technical and allocative efficiency in these situations. The methodology is applied to Australian data on hospital and health service providers. We obtain estimates of efficiency that are quite different from estimates obtained using a standard approach that ignores uncertainty.

The firm&#39;s behavior in reaction to the subsidies is analyzed through a two-stage Stackelberg game. The obtained results reveal that the subsidy level does not affect the relationships between the environmental qualities of the manufactured products under different marketing strategies when the green market is not strong.

  abstract     = {The uptake of electric aircraft appears faster today than predicted. Given the prominent electric aircraft technologies, short- and medium-haul routes are the ones that will benefit first, with the promise to revolutionize regional aviation at short notice. This paper proposes an optimization model to support the strategic design of charging networks for electric aircraft as a key enabling factor to prepare for and take full advantage of aviation electrification. The model, named Electric Aircraft Charging Network for Regional Routes , defines a network of airports and flight paths to optimally trade-off the number of charging bases (and associated investment costs) with connectivity and population coverage targets typical of regional routes serving remote regions. Due to computational challenges in large problem instances, we propose a Kernel Search heuristic and illustrate how it can deliver high quality solutions for large cases in a shorter computational time than the branch-and-cut algorithms. A real-world application to Sweden then demonstrates the practical insights of the proposed approach. We find that leveraging the many currently under-utilized regional airports has connectivity and investment benefits (on average +12.1\% in number of origins covered, +5.8\% in population coverage, and − 7.3 −7.3\% reduction of travel times). Furthermore, increasing the maximum aircraft range on a single charge implies significantly fewer charging bases and more feasible travel options, thus favoring network resilience and granting higher flexibility for later planning stages.},

  abstract     = {This paper is the first to develop a Monte Carlo simulation model of a snooker frame, using post-match video analysis of over 30,000 shots to inform the probability that a top professional will pot a ball on each shot depending on the number of balls remaining on the table and the status of their current visit to the table. We demonstrate that this accurately reflects the progression of a frame at this level, advocating new approaches in viewing a frame as a succession of scoring visits and in using dynamic measures to evaluate player performance. The simulation model also produces a realistic expectation of the probability that the frame will be won from any given position. The model is then used to analyse the effectiveness of the break-off shot and the influence that this has on the outcome of the frame. We also use simulated outcomes to evaluate the choice between taking on a risky pot or playing safe and the merits of alternative approaches to escaping from a snooker.},

  abstract     = {For educational purposes, medical residents often have to pass through many departments, which place different requirements on them. They are informed about the upcoming departments by an annual training schedule which keeps the individual departments’ service level as constant as possible. Due to poor planning and uncertain events, deviations in the schedule can occur. These deviations affect the service level in the departments, as well as the training progress and satisfaction of the residents. This article analyzes the impact of priorities on residents’ annual planning based on department assignments to combat uncertainty that might result in departmental changes. We present a novel two-stage formulation that combines residents’ tactical planning with duty and daily scheduling’s operational level. We determine an analytical bound for the problem that is superior to the LP bound. Additionally, we approximate a bound based on the solution approach using the objective value of the deterministic solution of an instance and the absences in each scenario. In a computational study, we analyze the performance of various bounds, our solution approach, and the effects of additional priorities in residents’ annual planning. We show that additional priorities can significantly reduce the number of unexpected department assignments. Finally, we derive a practical number of priorities from the results.},

  abstract     = {After a severe disaster strikes, a large number of casualties in need of urgent treatment, known as a mass casualty incident (MCI) event, arise from multiple disaster areas in a very short period of time and overwhelm available resources of the local healthcare system. This paper focuses on the effective design of casualty collection point (CCP) locations and the efficient allocation of limited emergency medical service (EMS) resources to transport casualties quickly to appropriate hospitals and increase the survival rate of casualties. A hybrid simulation–optimization approach to optimize the CCP location and EMS resource allocation problem over mixed binary and integer feasible domains for the minimization of expected complete delivery time of all casualties from disaster region to hospitals is presented in this work due to the stochastic and dynamic nature of the MCI logistics environment. A high-resolution stochastic discrete event simulation model considering time-varying stochastic casualty arrivals, random triage service times, and stochastic travel times caused by road network vulnerability is first constructed to describe a more detailed modeling of comprehensive MCI humanitarian logistics from the disaster regions to the hospitals. Then, a novel two-stage sequential algorithm, namely a combination of optimal computing budget allocation-based rapid-screening algorithm and adaptive particle global and hyperbox local search (ORSA-APGHLS), is developed to speed up convergence to near-optimal solutions compared to three common existing algorithms (Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search and Stochastic Nelder-Mead Algorithm) under a limited simulation budget. We collaborate with the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) in Taiwan to conduct computational experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed two-stage ORSA-APGHLS algorithm according to a potential earthquake scenario occurring in Tainan City, Taiwan. Through sensitivity analysis, the influence of different levels of scarce emergency medical resources and degrees of road damage on the expected complete delivery time of all casualties and the location-allocation decisions are investigated.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we focus on death-linked contingent claims (GMDBs) paying a random financial return at a random time of death in the general case where financial returns follow a regime switching model with two-sided phase-type jumps. We approximate the distribution of the remaining lifetime by either a series of Erlang distributions or a Laguerre series expansion, whose capability to fit the tail of the observed mortality data turns out to be much better than the commonly used series of exponential distributions. More precisely, we develop a Laurent series expansion of the discounted Laplace transform of the subordinated process at an Erlang distributed time, which leads to explicit formulae for European-type GMDB as well as related risk measures such as the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and the Conditional-Tail-Expectation (CTE). We further concentrate upon path-dependent GMDBs with lookback features like dynamic fund protection or dynamic withdrawal benefits, by relying on a Sylvester equation approach. The advantage of our approaches is that our results are of semi-closed form, avoiding numerical Fourier inversion or Monte-Carlo simulation, leading to fast evaluation. This is necessary in risk-management, in particularly for nested simulation in the framework of Solvency II. Several numerical experiments are included. Our results have implications beyond life-insurance and GMDBs, namely in all situations where randomization or Erlangization replaces known quantities, like, for example, model parameters, by random variables. In Finance, it is for example well-known that a random maturity time leads to much more convenient valuation formulas that well approximate its non-random counterpart.},

  abstract     = {Adaptation to climate change is impacted by a range of interrelated processes operating from local to global levels. There are often significant disconnects between different people&#39;s perceptions of responsibilities, capabilities and motivations, and divergent understandings of how the system works across actors, sectors and levels of governance. This results in misalignments of policies and practices, plus ineffective flows of resources and knowledge across the network of climate adaptation actors. As these disconnects are rooted in deep misunderstandings of the grounded realities of different actors, an experiential process of mutual discovery is required to build shared understanding and mutual respect. While it is common in the literature for people to talk about multi-level governance, most existing planning processes involve the production of separate plans at each individual level, based on the often-mistaken assumption that they will aggregate into an effective multi-level approach. This paper presents a new, multi-level integrated planning and implementation (MIPI) process, bringing together diverse actors from community, district, regional and national levels in the same workshop. The MIPI process creates a safe space that allows participants to interact directly in conducting systemic, cross-level analyses, as well as the multi-level integration of policies, plans and programs. The paper describes how the MIPI process was designed and facilitated in Ghana to address climate change, agricultural development and food security. This methodology has potential for much broader applicability to complex, multi-level planning and implementation processes.},

  abstract     = {In multi-criterion optimization, decision-makers (DMs) are not often interested in the complete Pareto-optimal front. Instead, they have preferences favoring specific parts of the front. Multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) literature provides a plethora of approaches for introducing DM’s preference information in an interactive manner to solve multi-criterion optimization problems. Interactions with DMs can be aided with a user-friendly visualization method or by using special data analysis procedures. An earlier study has indicated the use of self-organizing maps (SOM) as a tool for analyzing Pareto-optimal solutions. In this paper, we demonstrate how a specific MCDM method – NIMBUS – can be executed with the interpretable SOM (iSOM) approach iteratively to arrive at one or more preferred solutions. A visual illustration of the entire high-dimensional search space into multiple reduced two-dimensional spaces allows DMs to have a better understanding of the interactions of the objectives and constraints independently, and execute the NIMBUS decision-making procedure with a more wholistic approach. The paper demonstrates the proposed method on a number of multi- and many-objective numerical and engineering problems. The approach is now ready to be integrated with other popular MCDM methods.},

We also apply a matrix completion technique to lower-level SDO problems to make their problem sizes much smaller. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our cutting-plane algorithm is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art MISDO solver SCIP-SDP.

This paper addresses this issue by presenting a method for exact analysis of the inventory level distributions in a centralized One-Warehouse-Multiple-Retailer (OWMR) inventory system with quantity restricted deliveries from the warehouse. The system is characterized by continuous review (R,nQ) policies, complete backordering, and compound Poisson demand. The class of quantity restricted delivery policies we consider is motivated by a common desire in practice to ship full load carriers. It generalizes the assumption of unrestricted partial deliveries often used in the literature, and allows the warehouse to only ship retailer specific delivery batch quantities to the different retailers. The delivery batches typically represent package or pallet sizes, containers, or full truckloads. An attractive feature of our approach is that it does not add to the computational effort of analyzing the special case of unrestricted partial deliveries available in the existing literature. A numerical study shows that accounting for quantitative delivery restrictions used in transportation and handling operations when optimizing the reorder points in multi-echelon systems can be very important. Failure to do so can lead to high backorder costs and inadequate customer service.},

In the system, a truck and a drone work in tandem to serve customers within pre-specified delivery time windows. Since the uncertainty in the ground traffic network can not only fail a service promise but also expose the drone to danger, we focus on mitigating such risks when designing the routing plan. In particular, we investigate the robust drone-truck delivery problem (RDTDP) that seeks a robust joint route for the truck-and-drone tandem to maximize the profit. We develop an exact branch-and-price (B&amp;P) solution approach that can solve RDTDP instances, both randomly generated and collected from real-life data, with up to 40 service requests. In a numerical study, we demonstrate that the solution obtained with our proposed B&amp;P approach is significantly more robust than the one obtained without considering any uncertainty. In particular, while maintaining a comparable mean value in the solution quality measures, the robust solution features a variance up to 58\% smaller and a feasibility ratio (i.e., on-time performance) up to 90\% higher than the deterministic solution. These insights suggest that the robust route can be carried out much more frequently in practical usage.},

Shortages in the system are fully backlogged but transshipments between retailers are not allowed. The fixed-interval order-up-to policy has been studied in the literature under virtual allocation that reserves a unit of warehouse stock immediately after a unit of demand occurs. We consider an inventory control system that is different in two aspects. First, the warehouse implements myopic optimal allocation that allocates stock to retailers only at points of delivery to minimize system cost. Second, the warehouse adopts a non-stationary base stock policy to order stock for retailers according to their replenishment schedules. We develop methods to exactly evaluate and fully optimize this inventory control system. In a numerical study, we demonstrate that myopic optimal allocation reduces system cost by an average of 5.89\% with a range from 1.45\% to 10.13\% as compared to virtual allocation. In addition, we develop an iterative procedure to alleviate the problem of dimensionality for myopic optimal warehouse stock allocation and a close-to-optimal heuristic solution that can significantly reduce computation.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the Electric Autonomous Dial-A-Ride Problem (E-ADARP), which consists in designing a set of minimum-cost routes that accommodates all customer requests for a fleet of Electric Autonomous Vehicles (EAVs). Problem-specific features of the E-ADARP include: (i) the employment of EAVs and a partial recharging policy; (ii) the weighted-sum objective function that minimizes the total travel time and the total excess user ride time. In this work, we propose a Deterministic Annealing (DA) algorithm and provide the first heuristic results for the static E-ADARP. Partial recharging (i) is handled by an exact route evaluation scheme of linear time complexity. To tackle (ii), we propose a new method that allows effective computations of minimum excess user ride time by introducing a fragment-based representation of paths. These two methods compose an exact and efficient optimization of excess user ride time for a generated E-ADARP route. To validate the performance of the DA algorithm, we compare our algorithm results to the best-reported Branch-and-Cut (B&amp;C) algorithm results on existing instances. Our algorithm provides 25 new best solutions and 45 equal solutions on 84 existing instances. To test the algorithm performance on larger-sized instances, we establish new instances with up to 8 vehicles and 96 requests, and we provide 19 new solutions for these instances. Our final investigation extends the state-of-the-art model and explores the effect of allowing multiple visits to recharging stations. This relaxation can efficiently improve the solution’s feasibility and quality.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain technology has been widely used in many industries. One current application is in remanufacturing. In this paper we consider the combination of remanufacturing and blockchain, and model a supply chain composed of a manufacturer, a third-party firm, and an online platform. Among them, the manufacturer faces the cap-and-trade regulation and adopts blockchain to record the information on the used products and then remanufactures products. The platform has the power to expand the potential market size and can operate in the marketplace or reselling mode. The third-party firm collects used products for the manufacturer. We conduct a Stackelberg game analysis and obtain the following major findings: First, the optimal production quantities and optimal collection rates with and without blockchain in the marketplace and reselling modes increase with the allocated cap and platform-enabled power. Second, in the reselling or marketplace mode, the manufacturer should not adopt blockchain if the emissions intensity is low; otherwise, it should adopt blockchain. Third, selecting the reselling (marketplace) mode is more profitable for the manufacturer if the platform-enabled power is low (high). Fourth, for quantity coordination, the reselling mode under the wholesale price contract can always coordinate the manufacturer and platform, and the manufacturer, online platform, and third-party firm. However, the marketplace mode with a commission rate can only coordinate the manufacturer, online platform, and third-party firm. For social welfare coordination, the manufacturer, online platform, and third-party firm can achieve coordination in the marketplace or reselling mode. Finally, extending the work to consider the cross-channel effect, we find that the major findings for both quantity coordination and social welfare coordination in the reselling and marketplace modes still hold.},

  abstract     = {When an aircraft is approaching an airport, it gets a short time interval called a slot by Air Traffic Control that it can use to land. If the landing of the aircraft is delayed for some reason, it loses its slot and Airline Operation Controllers have to assign it a new one. However, landing slots are a scarce resource of the airports and, in order to avoid that an aircraft waits too long, Airline Operation Controllers have to regularly modify the assignment of slots to the aircraft. Due to the system implemented to exchange slots, controllers can modify the slot-assignment using only two kinds of operations: either assign a slot that was free to aircraft A A , or give the slot of another aircraft B B to A A and assign a free slot to B B . The problem can then be modelled as follows. Let k ≥ 1 k≥1 be an odd integer, let G G be a graph and M M be a matching in G G , i.e., a set of pairwise disjoint edges. A k k -maximum matching is a largest possible matching that can be obtained from M M by using only augmenting paths of length at most k k . This problem has already been studied in the context of wireless networks, mainly because it provides a simple approximation for the maximum matching problem. This paper provides a polynomial-time algorithm when k ≤ 3 k≤3 . We then prove that the problem is NP-hard in planar bipartite graphs with maximum degree at most 3 for any odd integer k ≥ 5 k≥5 .},

  abstract     = {Uncertain job types can arise as a result of predictive or diagnostic inaccuracy in healthcare or repair service systems and unknown preferences in matching service systems. In this paper, we study systems with multiple types of jobs, in which type information is imperfect and will be updated dynamically. Each job has a prior probability of belonging to a certain type which may be predicted by data, models, or experts. A job can only be processed by the right machine, and a job assigned to the wrong machine must be rescheduled. More information is learned from the mismatch, and job type probabilities are updated. The question is how to dynamically schedule all jobs so that they can be processed in a timely fashion. We use a novel coupling and inductive method to conduct optimality analysis. We obtain the near-optimal policy regarding completion time, named the less-uncertainty-first policy, when there are two types of jobs; the insights it yields are used to develop heuristic algorithms for more general cases. We also consider other objectives, including the number of mismatches and the total amount of time jobs spend in the system. In our numerical study, we examine the performance of the proposed heuristics when there are more than two types of jobs under two learning schemes: dedicated learning and exclusive learning. In the extension, we also analyze an online version of the problem in which jobs arrive sequentially to the system and must be assigned immediately and irrevocably without any knowledge of future jobs. We analyze the competitive ratios of different scheduling policies and find similar insights. It is essential that managers dynamically schedule services by leveraging predictive information and knowledge learned from mismatches. Our proposed less-uncertainty-first policy, which accounts for system dynamics to avoid mismatches and resource idling, can be used to improve system efficiency in various contexts.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel matheuristic algorithm for the Set Orienteering Problem (SOP). The set orienteering problem generalizes the Orienteering Problem (OP) by considering customers to be divided into mutually exclusive clusters. The profit associated with each cluster is collected by visiting at least one of the customers belonging to this cluster. The problem calls for the determination of the closed route that maximizes the collected profit without violating a given maximum route duration. We propose a matheuristic algorithm based on local search. The proposed algorithm is equipped with mathematical programming components for dealing with various subproblems, as well as an adaptive memory structure for producing high-quality starting solutions. Promising and diverse solutions are collected and multiple solution reconstruction mechanisms are presented. Extensive computational experiments are conducted for parameter tuning, and for evaluating the contribution of the mathematical programming components and the adaptive memory mechanism. The proposed solution approach is compared against previously published SOP algorithms. It produces the best solutions for 98.20\% of the instances of the classic SOP benchmark data set. For 102 of the total 612 instances a new best solution is obtained. In addition, a new large data set of 304 instances is introduced with instances of up to 3162 customers and 634 clusters to evaluate the scalability of the proposed algorithm, and the effectiveness of the various adaptive memory schemes. The proposed algorithm manages to outperform or match the best-known solution for 281 out of 304 instances when compared with a state-of-the-art open source SOP algorithm.},

The algorithm uses an effective feasible local search to find high-quality local optimal solutions and employs a strategic oscillation search with a responsive filtering strategy to seek still better solutions by searching along the boundary of feasible and infeasible regions. The algorithm additionally relies on a frequency-based perturbation to escape deep local optimal traps. Extensive evaluations on two sets of 6340 benchmark instances show that the algorithm is able to discover 39 new lower bounds and match all the remaining best-known results. Additional experiments are performed on 21 real-world instances of a daily photograph scheduling problem. The critical components of the algorithm are experimentally assessed.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we discuss an exact algorithm for solving mixed integer concave minimization problems. A piecewise inner-approximation of the concave function is achieved using an auxiliary linear program that leads to a bilevel program, which provides a lower bound to the original problem. The bilevel program is reduced to a single level formulation with the help of Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. Incorporating the KKT conditions lead to complementary slackness conditions that are linearized using BigM, for which we identify a tight value for general problems. Multiple bilevel programs, when solved over iterations, guarantee convergence to the exact optimum of the original problem. Though the algorithm is general and can be applied to any optimization problem with concave function(s), in this paper, we solve two common classes of operations and supply chain problems; namely, the concave knapsack problem, and the concave production-transportation problem. The computational experiments indicate that our proposed approach outperforms the customized methods that have been used in the literature to solve the two classes of problems by an order of magnitude in most of the test cases.},

The Resource-Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem (RCMPSP) consists of assigning start times to jobs corresponding to two or more projects that must be executed simultaneously while respecting the precedence between jobs and limited resources. The existing rise in the study of the RCMPSP resulted in numerous works on the topic while proposing different problem features. This research analyzes different variants of the problem based on aspects related to jobs, projects, relationships, resources, and time management. Moreover, based on the problem variants considered in the collected works, a taxonomy allowing (i) the identification and positioning of each RCMPSP variant and (ii) the analysis of the current state-of-the-art of the problem is proposed. In addition, the solution methods proposed to solve RCMPSPs are classified and analyzed, together with the benchmarks used to validate such approaches.

The bilateral nature of matches imposes constraints on the range of competitive balance measures, as teams cannot win matches in which they do not play. Application of normalized competitive balance indices requires knowing the maximum value the index can attain, representing the most unequal distribution of points among teams. However, evaluation of the points distribution consistent with maximum imbalance is non-trivial when the total points allocated are not known in advance, as when bonus points are awarded. We theoretically derive the corresponding perfectly unbalanced distribution of points, characterized as a ‘Double Cascade distribution’, and provide an Excel tool to obtain it for different parameter values. We apply our results to examine variation in within-season competitive balance in the Six Nations Championship in rugby. The degree of competitive balance, as measured by a normalized concentration index, has improved since the award of bonus points in 2017, primarily because the index&#39;s maximum value increases with bonus points. However, with limited available data on the bonus-points regime, it is not possible to establish or reject a causal link, due to induced behavioural changes by teams, between the raw concentration index and bonus points. A relatively high level of imbalance still exists compared to other sports leagues, which will be an important consideration in evaluating future developments of the competition.},

  abstract     = {Game theory provides a valuable conceptual framework for developing strategic insight into complex, multi-actor situations and is well-suited for addressing real-world problems. Participatory game theory involves model construction and analysis with stakeholders guided by a facilitator with the aim of examining strategic interactions within real-world problems. Previous work in this field focused often on the analytical insights from game theory models whereas guidance on the design and implementation process of participatory game theory interventions remains under researched. This paper addresses this gap by providing a framework to assist in the design of game theory-based interventions. Here, stakeholders’ decision-support needs are designed according to specific learning levels, as defined by Bloom&#39;s taxonomy and triple-loop learning, that the intervention will target. The framework further specifies the design choices for each learning level by comparing the design choices from two case studies of game theory-based interventions in Dutch railway and Bangladesh drinking water contexts. The former involved stakeholders using a game concept identification tool while the latter used game theory-based role-playing games with community and local government stakeholders. This paper describes the value of this framework for structured learning through game theory-based interventions. It includes the facilitator&#39;s role and design choices for each learning level related to the knowledge capabilities and activity focus to achieve that learning outcome. Future work will incorporate design inputs from additional learning theories, behavioural game theory and will explore the framework&#39;s potential for evaluating game theory-based interventions.},

Containers being retrieved have due times, indicating when they will be required by other subsystems. The problem can be seen as a pickup routing problem and also as a one-machine scheduling problem. As a starting point, integer linear models were developed for both approaches. Then, to obtain good solutions for large instances, several heuristic algorithms, coupled with a local search, were proposed. An extensive computational study, based on a newly generated benchmark, shows the limits of the exact methods and the quality of the solutions obtained by the heuristics.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an economic dispatch problem for power grids involving renewable generation and storage units is studied. A multi-stage robust optimization algorithm for computing base dispatches and re-dispatches is proposed. Unlike the other approaches in the literature, the proposed method finds an exact solution to the multi-stage robust optimization problem considered when there are no storage devices or storage devices are ideal (i.e. charging/discharging inefficiencies are neglectable). In the presence of non-ideal storage devices, the algorithm can produce upper-bounding approximations. The devised approximation scheme has two distinguishing features. Firstly, the base dispatches and, especially, multi-stage re-dispatch policies computed are guaranteed to be free of simultaneous charges/discharges. Secondly, it produces lower bounds allowing one to assess the quality of solutions. Optimality and convergence properties of the proposed method are proven and it is compared with other alternatives in the literature through numerical experiments. Results show that significant economic benefits can be achieved compared to the other approaches and solutions could be obtained within acceptable time limits for large-scale problems.},

  abstract     = {Critical infrastructures (CIs), such as energy systems, transportation networks and telecommunications networks, are the backbone of any advanced society, and ensuring their resilience is a fundamental task. CIs are often interconnected to, and interdependent on, each other through complex coupling interfaces. Failures can propagate among different CIs through these coupling interfaces, causing multi-sectoral disruption. The design of the coupling interface can strongly impact the cascading effect between different CIs. In this paper, we propose a data-driven distributionally robust approach for the optimal coupling of interdependent CIs. Our model obtains an optimal coupling interface that maximizes the expected combined performance of interdependent CIs under random failure scenarios with ambiguous probability distributions. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach using an ambiguity set built upon a synthetic data set of historical contingency scenarios. Interdependent power and gas networks (IPGNs) are used as an illustrative case study. We show that our proposed approach leads to better coupling interfaces with higher expected performance under disruptive scenarios.},

In this paper, we evaluate the impact of a balance budget rule enforcement, exploring its effect on the local government cost efficiency and, in particular, considering the complex trade-off between efficiency and equity. Specifically, our identification strategy considers the exogenous introduction of a new budget balance rule that requires local governments to respect both an annual and a longer-term equilibrium criterion. The difference-in-differences analysis builds on a rich panel dataset covering all the public functions. We find that, on average, the budget rule enforcement exerted a positive effect on local government efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In previous research, buyback and revenue sharing contracts are regarded as equivalent in terms of the final profit and coordination ability. However, if the opportunity cost of working capital (OCWC) is considered, the parameters, coordination nature, and relative performance of the two contracts may vary with their payment structure. Considering the OCWC, we investigate the above phenomenon in two scenarios. The first is based on the decisions made with the objective of maximising accounting profit (not including OCWC). We reveal, for the first time, the relative financing effect between these two contracts, and show that these decisions may lead to managers’ misjudgement. Firms that recognise the impact of opportunity cost will exhibit different preferences between the two originally equivalent contracts. In the second scenario, we examine and compare the two contracts with the decisions based on economic profit (including OCWC) maximisation. We show that a buyback contract may degenerate into a wholesale price contract, while a revenue sharing contract may degenerate into a full credit contract. Moreover, revenue sharing contracts are Pareto dominated by buyback contracts when the supplier’s opportunity cost is higher than that of the retailer, and vice versa. Unexpectedly, the two contracts may achieve super coordination of the supply chain in terms of economic profits. These findings clarify how managers should use supply chain contracts when the opportunity cost of capital cannot be ignored.},

The duration of surgeries in many cases cannot be known until the surgery has actually been completed. Furthermore, disruptions such as equipment failure or the arrival of a non-elective surgery can occur simultaneously. Thus, the assignment of surgeries needs to be updated, as and when disruptions occur, to minimize their effects. In this paper, we present a stochastic dynamic programming approach to the surgery allocation problem with multiple operating rooms under uncertainty. Given an elective list for the day, the dynamic optimization model minimizes the number of surgeries not carried out by the end of the shift and the total waiting times of patients during the day weighted according to their urgency level. Due to the curse of dimensionality, we apply an approximate dynamic programming algorithm to solve the stochastic dynamic surgery management model. Computational experiments are designed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and its applicability to practical settings. The results show that the approximate dynamic programming algorithm provides a good approximation to the optimum policy and leads to some managerial insights.},

  abstract     = {The spread of epidemics is a common societal problem across the world. Can operational research be used to predict such outbreaks? While equation-based approaches are used to model the trajectory of epidemics, can a network-based approach also be used? This paper presents an innovative application of epidemic modelling through the design of both approaches and compares between the two. The network-based approach proposed in this paper allows implementing heterogeneity at the level of individuals and incorporates flexibility in the variety of situations the model can be applied to. In contrast to the equation-based approach, the network-based approach can address the role of individual differences, network properties, and patterns of social contacts responsible for the spread of epidemics but are much more complex to implement. In this paper, we simulated the spread of infection at the beginning of Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) using both approaches. The results are showcased using empirical data for eight countries. Sophisticated measures, including partial curve mapping, are used to compare the simulated results with the actual number of infections. We find that the plots generated by the network-based approach match the empirical data better than the equation-based approach. While both approaches can be used to predict the spread of infections, we conclusively show that the proposed network-based approach is better suited with its ability to model the spread of epidemics at the level of an individual. Hence, this can be a model of choice for epidemiologists who are interested to model the spread of an epidemic.},

In addition, it has posed unprecedented challenges to public health and policy/decision-makers who have been responsible for designing and implementing measures to mitigate its strong negative impact. The Portuguese health authorities have used decision analysis techniques to assess the impact of the pandemic and implemented measures for counties, regions, or across the entire country. These decision tools have been subject to some criticism and many stakeholders requested novel approaches. In particular, those which considered the dynamic changes in the pandemic’s behaviour due to new virus variants and vaccines. A multidisciplinary team formed by researchers from the COVID-19 Committee of Instituto Superior Técnico at the University of Lisbon (CCIST analyst team) and physicians from the Crisis Office of the Portuguese Medical Association (GCOM expert team) collaborated to create a new tool to help politicians and decision-makers to fight the pandemic. This paper presents the main steps that led to the building of a pandemic impact assessment composite indicator applied to the specific case of COVID-19 in Portugal. A multiple criteria approach based on an additive multi-attribute value theory aggregation model was used to build the pandemic assessment composite indicator. The parameters of the additive model were devised based on an interactive socio-technical and co-constructive process between the CCIST and GCOM team members. The deck of cards method was the adopted technical tool to assist in the assessment the value functions as well as in the assessment of the criteria weights. The final tool was presented at a press conference and had a powerful impact on the Portuguese media and on the main health decision-making stakeholders in the country. In this paper, a completed mathematical and graphical description of this tool is presented.},

In such scenarios, there is high managerial interest to know the maximum investment at risk at any time during project execution. This can be answered using the alphorn of uncertainty which maps the maximum and minimum possible project costs during project execution when activity durations and, correspondingly, cash flows are random. We prove the NP-hardness of calculating the alphorn of uncertainty and provide a mixed integer linear program for calculating it. The mixed integer linear program is shown to be able to calculate the alphorn for projects with up to 145 activities efficiently. We also show that using railway scheduling as opposed to roadrunner scheduling can significantly reduce the maximum possible investment at risk without significantly delaying the project.},

We analyze our general market-clearing proposal using conic duality theory to derive efficient spatially-differentiated prices for the multiple commodities, comprised of energy and flexibility services. Under the assumption of perfect competition, we prove the equivalence of the centrally-solved market-clearing optimization problem to a competitive spatial price equilibrium involving a set of rational and self-interested participants and a price setter. Finally, under common assumptions, we prove that moving towards conic markets does not incur the loss of desirable economic properties of markets, namely market efficiency, cost recovery, and revenue adequacy. Our numerical studies focus on the specific use case of uncertainty-aware market design and demonstrate that the proposed conic market brings advantages over existing alternatives within the linear programming market framework.},

  abstract     = {Manufacturers often declare recycled content claims that are specific (e.g., to each production period) or average (e.g., across many production periods). Such claims are manifested through the choice of certification and generate demand for the manufacturer’s recycled content product. However, since the amount of usable recycled input available from local sources is often limited and uncertain, and external (non-local) sources are expensive, a manufacturer needs to balance the demand-side benefits of a recycled content claim with the associated sourcing and inventory costs. In this paper, we develop a multi-period model over a planning horizon, where a manufacturer makes a product’s source mix decision (recycled input vs. virgin content) and recycled input carryover decision each period in the presence of a stochastic supply and external sourcing cost. We solve for the manufacturer’s optimal recycled content claim decision over a planning horizon and calculate the manufacturer’s profit, recycled input, and virgin raw material usage at the optimal claim. Our key contributions are as follows. We show that (i) a shorter (longer) planning horizon may sometimes increase (decrease) the recycled content claim, (ii) demand stimulation for recycled products may sometimes decrease the optimal recycled content claim, and (iii) supply stabilization (i.e., lowering variability in the municipal stream) may decrease the recycled content claim. We provide numerical results for parameters driven by European data from the fiberglass insulation industry and use our analysis to quantify the impact of several European policies relevant to the glasswool insulation industry on a manufacturer’s incentive to incorporate recycled content.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the role of return policies on trade credit offered by suppliers to retailers. Traditional trade credit agreements, wherein a supplier extends a short-term loan to a retailer, can lead to over-ordering by the retailer even though she is financially constrained (FC), and this can affect supply chain efficiency. With ever-increasing product-handling costs, such over-ordering can have a severe impact on the supply chain profit. Motivated by our work with an industry partner, we design a game-theoretic model to evaluate optimal stocking decisions and wholesale prices in an FC supply chain, analyze the traditional trade credit model, and establish the reasons for over-ordering by the retailer when trade credit is deployed. We then examine how product returns, prevalent in the industry, can be used to control over-ordering. We design three different mechanisms incorporating returns in a trade credit model: quantity-limit-based returns, partial refund based returns, and marginal refund based returns. We find that returns-based policies improve profits for all members of the supply chain by driving inventory reduction and reducing over-ordering when trade credit is used. We also perform numerical analysis to quantify the impact of key parameters on the optimal decision variables. Our paper contributes by suggesting easy-to-implement mechanisms for improving trade credit deployment in supply chains and provides useful insights to decision makers to incorporate returns in trade credit policies.},

In the typical ADP implementation, the value function is approximated by means of a single model trained over a suitable sampling of the state space. In this paper we investigate the ensemble learning paradigm in the ADP context, which consists in exploiting the outputs of many models trained for the value function approximation. To this purpose, we introduce an optimization scheme for the aggregation of the ensemble outputs, related to the supremum norm error on which the ADP accuracy depends. Furthermore, we show that the ensemble of value function approximations can be used to identify a-priori good state points used to train the approximating models, exploiting an ambiguity-like term tailored to the proposed ensemble optimization scheme. The advantages of ensembles in ADP are showcased both through error analysis and a simulation campaign involving various test problems. Our results show how ensembles obtained through the proposed output weights optimization scheme yield more accurate and robust value function approximations with respect to single elements. At the same time, we show how the ensembles can successfully be employed to select good state samples to be employed as training set for the value function approximations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a partially time-windowed dynamic routing approach with forecast orders to tackle the dynamic pricing problem of attended home delivery, one of the challenging problems in last-mile logistics. The purpose of forecast orders is to find a cost-effective route map for delivery with forecast orders to guide the delivery system to accept real orders in potentially better time slots for servicing. Initially, we build and optimise virtual routes using forecast orders without time windows. Upon the arrival of real orders, we replace the forecast orders with incoming real orders to help the delivery system estimate the opportunity cost of making the delivery in each time slot. Dynamic pricing is then used to influence the customer’s choices of servicing slots, and based on what the customer selects, the real order replaces the forecast order, and the route map is re-optimised. This strategy leads to better scheduling for the overall route map and more slot availability for incoming customers. Through computational study, we demonstrate the benefit of our approach compared to static pricing and previous dynamic pricing policies, with or without forecast orders. In particular, by employing forecast orders without time windows, we witness a decrease in delivery costs and an increase in the number of accepted orders, leading to higher profits.},

  abstract     = {Product return rates are much higher for online retailers than brick-and-mortar retailers. In this paper, we develop a model for optimizing the retailer’s price, quantity, and terms of the product return policy in the presence of consumer opportunistic behavior (wardrobing). We consider a seasonal product and formulate and solve a newsvendor (e-tailer) model where an in-season price markdown may be used before any remaining inventory is salvaged at the end of the season. We compare a return policy in which refunds for returned products are in cash to one where refunds are in store credit or gift cards (SC/GC). Products sold at the clearance (salvage) price cannot be returned or exchanged. We find that with both cash and SC/GC refunds, consumer product match uncertainty, measured by the probability of the product matching consumers’ expectations, benefits consumers who keep the product more than consumers who return it. Moreover, under realistic conditions, using SC/GC refund increases the profits of the e-tailer and benefits consumers who keep the product by lowering the price. We also find that even when consumers redeem all SC/GC, using SC/GC refunds can still be beneficial to the retailer because SC/GC refunds deter proportionally more wardrobers from buying than consumers from buying. As a result, costly returns are reduced and the e-tailer benefits.},

Many classical stability concepts used in the GMCR are based on a conservative attitude of DMs. Here we propose to incorporate a degree of optimism to allow for more types of attitudes under uncertainty. More specifically, inspired by the notions of L h h stability and Maximin h h stability, we present the Optimism Pessimism stability for conflicts involving any finite number of DMs considering that a DM anticipates his/her own benefits looking an arbitrary number of rounds ahead, called horizon and denoted by h h , and uses his/her degree of optimism to evaluate his/her anticipated payoff according to the worst and best scenarios that can be achieved. We investigate how the degree of optimism and the conflict horizon influence the stability of states. We also analyse how the optimism pessimism stability is related to other stabilities commonly used in GMCR.

Customer demand is stochastic, and customers individually decide with given probabilities from which newsvendor they want to order or whether they do not want to order at all. These probabilities can vary depending on which newsvendor is out of stock. The problem described arises when marketplace operators offer the same or substitutable products as third-party vendors and therefore directly compete with third-party vendors on their platform. Our research is motivated by practical cases such as the Amazon marketplace, where Amazon is the marketplace operator that sets the sales commission and, simultaneously, directly competes with third-party vendors. Both the marketplace operator and a competing third-party vendor should ideally account for the other party&#39;s behavior when deciding their order quantity. We calculate the noncooperative Nash equilibrium and the optimal cooperative order quantities (centralized solution). Additionally, we emphasize analyzing the effect of the sales commission on the optimal order quantities and the gross profits of the two parties.},

A 3PL service provider usually caters to different classes of shipments that require different levels of service, e.g. two-day delivery, next-day delivery etc. We, therefore, study the problem under stochastic demand from two classes of shipments, with one class receiving priority over the other in service at the hubs to maintain the different service levels required by them. To this end, we present two models for designing a capacitated hub network with a service level constraint, defined using the distribution of time spent at hubs, for each shipment class. The models seek to design the hub network at the minimum total cost, which includes the total fixed cost of equipping open hubs with sufficient processing capacity and the variable transportation costs. The network of hubs, given their locations, is thus modeled as spatially distributed priority queues. The resulting model is challenging to solve, for which we propose a cutting plane-based exact solution method.},

A relief strategy that delivers (pushes) goods to the affected population depending on the predicted demand is critical, especially during the early post-disaster period when accurate demand information is lacking. Several inventory-distribution strategies based on multi-echelon humanitarian logistics networks have been previously investigated to facilitate a quick response to demand information. However, natural disasters have raised doubts about the performance of these networks. This paper presents the disaster conditions under which conventional multi-echelon networks are conducive to push-mode strategies that deliver relief goods depending on the predicted demand. Specifically, an approximate solution to the optimal inventory-distribution strategy is analytically derived from a dynamic stochastic optimization problem using deterministic approximation and decomposition. Several numerical validations ensure the optimality and practical applicability of the strategy. The approximate strategy identifies disaster conditions that do not contribute to push-mode strategies in conventional multi-echelon networks and proposes an alternative network structure.},

Motivated by a string of events that have globally impacted supply chains, our objective is to study the resiliency of long chains when there is a positive probability of plant disruptions. To achieve this, we first investigate the connection between long and open chains. Then, we propose a simple greedy algorithm for characterizing the performance of an open chain for a given scenario of plant disruptions and product demands. When such information is uncertain, we develop a pair of Markov chains for computing the load of the open chain’s dedicated and flexible arcs, respectively, which in turn enables us to have an elaborate look at the long chain’s expected performance. We further argue that the long chain is indeed a viable alternative of the full flexibility system that provides a significant improvement over the dedicated design when the demand distribution is symmetric or right-skewed and that all three designs are similarly competitive otherwise. Finally, we report a case study on a flexible configuration of cellular base stations in the People’s Republic of China.},

Under different business contracts, the equilibria and impacts of piracy on the supply chain differ considerably. Surprisingly, we find that although the presence of piracy always negatively affects chain members’ profits under the agency selling contract, it can positively affect such profits in certain situations under the reselling contract. In addition, we show isolated Pareto improvement regions under the reselling and agency selling contracts. We also find that if there is a large gap between the high and low protection levels, then the platform prefers the high level over the low level, regardless of the business contract.

In the case of two farmers, due to the different transportation costs, the company first orders from farmer 1 and then from farmer 2. The order quantities are constrained by the farmers’ actual outputs. We analyze the company&#39;s demand information-sharing strategies and obtain interesting results: (1) the company prefers to share positive demand information and withhold negative demand information with all farmers if the production cost is low. Surprisingly, when the production cost is high, the company only shares demand information with farmer 2. (2) When information is withheld from farmer 1, farmer 2 is more responsive to information. This is caused by farmer 1’s advantage of being the preferred supplier. Additionally, farmer 1 always obtains its maximum profit, but farmer 2 does not always achieve optimal profits under the company&#39;s optimal strategies. (3) We find that maximizing social welfare is not the most beneficial strategy for each farmer.

This study focuses on the platform entry strategy in a supply chain, where a manufacturer that could voluntarily disclose quality information sells its product via a retailer. Two common distribution contracts (reselling and agency selling) between the manufacturer and the online platform are considered. We find that downstream entry induces the manufacturer to reveal more quality information to the consumer than in the monopoly setting and that the agency contract results in a higher (lower) transparency level of the supply chain than the reselling contract when the commission fee is small (large). Moreover, contrary to the conventional wisdom that downstream entry likely harms incumbent retailers, we show that entry is not necessarily a problem that harms existing traditional retailers due to the increased quality transparency caused by entry. It is generally believed that a higher commission fee may encourage the platform to adopt the agency contract. In contrast, we demonstrate that the platform does not always benefit from a higher commission fee when an agency selling contract is adopted; the platform still chooses a reselling contract to enter the market in a context with asymmetric quality information, despite the higher commission fee. That is, the manufacturer’s quality disclosure can create a new win-win outcome for the platform and manufacturer in the choice of distribution contract.},

In the existing literature of traditional e-commerce, it is assumed that a manufacturer sells through the retailer&#39;s reselling or agency selling format. As live-streaming services developed, firms leverage the influence of Internet celebrities and discount strategies in the live-streaming channel to attract new consumers who are never aware of the firms’ offerings. However, it is unclear that how the unique characteristics of live-streaming commerce affect the choice of selling formats and the optimal price discount strategy. We develop a game-theoretical model with two price schemes (i.e., committed price scheme and dynamic price scheme) where the decision-maker only decides on the live channel introduction in the first period. We first provide the thresholds at which decision-makers decide to adopt live-streaming selling. Second, we offer the optimal price discount rate and equilibrium outcomes for each selling format. The optimal price discount rate mainly depends on the uninformed consumers’ (UCs) valuation and informed consumers’ (ICs) proportion. Third, we solve the optimal selection of selling format for the retailer. The introduction of a live-streaming channel reduces the threshold that the retailer selects the agency selling format. Fourth, we compare the results of the committed price scheme and the dynamic price scheme. Findings show that decision-makers are more likely to offer a live channel promotion and raise the price of the traditional online channel under the dynamic price scheme. However, under the dynamic regular scheme, decision-makers tend to provide a deeper discount rate in the live channel, leading to a lower retail price in the live channel. Finally, we extend our model by considering a negotiated commission fee between the decision-maker and the third-party live streamer under different selling formats. Our study provides useful insights to managers to make the live-streaming channel adoption decision and make price discount decisions in supply chains with manufacturers selling through online retail.},

  abstract     = {Community detection is a fundamental network-analysis primitive with a variety of applications in diverse domains. Although the modularity introduced by Newman and Girvan (2004) has widely been used as a quality function for community detection, it has some drawbacks. The modularity density introduced by Li et al. (2008) is known to be an effective alternative to the modularity, which mitigates one of the drawbacks called the resolution limit. A large body of work has been devoted to designing exact and heuristic methods for modularity density maximization, without any computational complexity analysis. In this study, we investigate modularity density maximization from both algorithmic and computational complexity aspects. Specifically, we first accelerate column generation for the modularity density maximization problem. To this end, we point out that the auxiliary problem appearing in column generation can be viewed as a dense subgraph discovery problem. Then we employ a well-known strategy for dense subgraph discovery, called the greedy peeling, for approximately solving the auxiliary problem. Moreover, we reformulate the auxiliary problem to a sequence of 0–1 linear programming problems, enabling us to compute its optimal value more efficiently and to get more diverse columns. Computational experiments using a variety of real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Finally, we show the NP-hardness of a slight variant of the modularity density maximization problem, where the output partition has to have two or more clusters, as well as showing the NP-hardness of the auxiliary problem in column generation.},

An SPS can quickly respond to market demands with changing varieties and fluctuated volumes. Resource conflicts are used to indicate the requirements for a same worker by more than one seru . This paper studies the on-line seru scheduling problem with resource conflicts in limited work space, which decides serus’ built-up sequence over time and aims at minimizing the makespan. To keep a balance between quick responsiveness and production efficiency in an SPS, a proactive waiting strategy is proposed and a nested algorithm is structured with an external framework and an internal sequencing policy. The external framework handles resource conflicts among serus and divides serus into groups in which resource conflicts do not exist. The internal sequencing policy acts on each group and decides the built-up sequence for serus . The nested algorithm is proved to be 2 ρ ρ -competitive with two seru families. Performance of the nested algorithm can be enhanced by improving the internal sequencing policy without changing the external framework, which is conformed by computational experiments. With more seru families, experimental results show that the nested-LPT algorithm can adapt to frequent arrivals of orders, complicated resource conflicts, and fluctuating market demands.},

  abstract     = {The Precedence Constrained Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (PCGTSP) is an extension of two well-known combinatorial optimization problems — the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) and the Precedence Constrained Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (PCATSP), whose path version is known as the Sequential Ordering Problem (SOP). Similarly to the classic GTSP, the goal of the PCGTSP, for a given input digraph and partition of its node set into clusters, is to find a minimum cost cyclic route (tour) visiting each cluster in a single node. In addition, as in the PCATSP, feasible tours are restricted to visit the clusters with respect to the given partial order. Unlike the GTSP and SOP, to the best of our knowledge, the PCGTSP still remain to be weakly studied both in terms of polyhedral theory and algorithms. In this paper, for the first time for the PCGTSP, we propose several families of valid inequalities, establish dimension of the PCGTS polytope and prove sufficient conditions ensuring that the extended Balas’ π π - and σ σ -inequalities become facet-inducing. Relying on these theoretical results and evolving the state-of-the-art algorithmic approaches for the PCATSP and SOP, we introduce a family of MILP-models (formulations) and several variants of the branch-and-cut algorithm for the PCGTSP. We prove their high performance in a competitive numerical evaluation against the public benchmark library PCGTSPLIB, a known adaptation of the classic SOPLIB to the problem in question.},

  abstract     = {Many problem-specific heuristic frameworks have been developed to solve combinatorial optimization problems, but these frameworks do not generalize well to other problem domains. Metaheuristic frameworks aim to be more generalizable compared to traditional heuristics, however their performances suffer from poor selection of low-level heuristics (operators) during the search process. An example of heuristic selection in a metaheuristic framework is the adaptive layer of the popular framework of Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS). Here, we propose a selection hyperheuristic framework that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) as an alternative to the adaptive layer of ALNS. Unlike the adaptive layer which only considers heuristics’ past performance for future selection, a Deep RL agent is able to take into account additional information from the search process, e.g., the difference in objective value between iterations, to make better decisions. This is due to the representation power of Deep Learning methods and the decision making capability of the Deep RL agent which can learn to adapt to different problems and instance characteristics. In this paper, by integrating the Deep RL agent into the ALNS framework, we introduce Deep Reinforcement Learning Hyperheuristic (DRLH), a general framework for solving a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems and show that our framework is better at selecting low-level heuristics at each step of the search process compared to ALNS and a Uniform Random Selection (URS). Our experiments also show that while ALNS can not properly handle a large pool of heuristics, DRLH is not negatively affected by increasing the number of heuristics.},

We model business expansion as an enlargement of the opportunity set for business policies. However, expansion is irreversible and has an opportunity cost attached. We use the expected optimization of utility to formulate this as a novel stochastic control problem combined with an optimal stopping time, and we derive an explicit solution for exponential utility. We apply the framework to an investment and a reinsurance scenario. In the investment problem, the cost and incentives to increase the trading exposure are analyzed, while the optimal timing for an insurer to launch its reinsurance business is investigated in the reinsurance problem. Our model predicts that the additional income gained through business expansion is the key incentive for a decision to expand. Interestingly, companies may have this incentive but are likely to wait for a period of time before expanding, although situations of zero opportunity cost or specific restrictive conditions on the model parameters are exceptions to waiting. The business policy remains on the boundary of the opportunity set before expansion during the waiting period. The length of the waiting period is related to the opportunity cost, return, and risk of the expanded business.},

At the same time, this allows platforms to gather detailed information on transactions and tailor their strategies when introducing their own products that compete with independent sellers. Concerns have been raised that such an information advantage of platforms can hurt sellers. To investigate the impact of information usage by platforms, we analyze a dynamic game-theoretic model where competing sellers trade via a platform that has access to information at various levels of granularity. We show that the usage of more detailed and individualized information by the platform can actually benefit sellers. This occurs as sellers compete less intensely, anticipating that the platform would take advantage of more individualized information to target the more successful sellers. The competition relaxing effect is particularly strong when sellers are close substitutes and face little demand uncertainty within their product category. In such cases, both the platform and sellers could benefit from more individualized information usage, but consumers may be hurt.},

While this may ensure sufficient resources for lucrative passenger transportation, the separation also leaves consolidation potentials untapped. In this paper, we propose combining both services in an anticipatory way that ensures high passenger service rates while simultaneously transporting a large number of goods. To this end, we introduce a dynamic priority policy that uses a time-dependent percentage of vehicles mainly to serve passengers. To find effective time-dependent parametrizations given a limited number of runtime-expensive simulations, we apply Bayesian optimization. We show that our anticipatory policy increases revenue and service rates significantly, whereas a myopic combination of service may actually lead to inferior performance compared to using two separate fleets.},

A line is balanced if the maximum total execution time of any station is minimal. Commonly, the task execution order is constrained by precedences, and task execution times are independent of the station performing the task. Here, we consider a recent variation, called the “(Calzedonia) Workload Allocation Problem” (WAP), where the precedences form a chain, and the execution time of a task depends on the worker executing it. This problem was recently proposed by Battarra et al. (2020) and it is a special case of the Assembly Line Worker Assignment and Balancing Problem Miralles et al. (2007) where precedence relations are arbitrary. In this paper we consider the computational complexity of the problem and prove its NP-hardness. To solve the problem, we provide different lower bounds and exact and heuristic procedures. The performance of the proposed methods is tested on previously proposed instances and on new, larger instances with the same characteristics. The results show that the proposed methods can solve instances with up to about 4000 tasks and 29 workers, doubling the size of the instances that previously could be solved to optimality.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of sharing economy, the manufacturer has begun to establish direct sharing channels in addition to their existing distribution channels via independent retailers. Motivated by this business practice, this paper aims to answer the following questions: whether and when should a manufacturer establish a direct sharing channel? To this end, we first analyze a supply chain where a manufacturer distributes her product only through a retailer (the M-S Model), where we obtain the optimal retail price. Next, we consider the scenario where the manufacturer sets up a direct sharing channel in addition to the retail channel (the MR-S Model), where we obtain the optimal rental price and retail price. We then study the manufacturer&#39;s channel structure choice between the M-S and the MR-S models. Our main findings include the followings. First, the manufacturer may not always benefit from establishing a new sharing channel. The manufacturer will benefit only if the operating cost of sharing channel is low. However, when the operating cost of sharing channel is below a threshold, adding the sharing channel will decrease the profit at the retail channel, resulting in channel conflict. Second, only if the operating cost of sharing channel falls into a certain interval, the manufacturer&#39;s sharing channel will decrease the retailer&#39;s profit but increase the total supply chain profit. To avoid channel conflict, the two firms can adopt an appropriate sales reward contract so that both can benefit from the sharing channel. Lastly, when both the operating cost of sharing channel and the simultaneous rental rate of consumers are low, the manufacturer even needs to produce less if she establishes a new sharing channel.},

In the new structure, the number of each team&#39;s games per season increased by more than 25 percent, which increased the aggregate attendance. In our empirical analyses, we investigated attendance per game by using data from the three seasons before and after the change. Comparing the attendance of the same teams that played before and after the change, our fixed effects estimation reveals a significant decrease of close to nine percent in attendance per game after the change compared to the Top 16 stage. We also found no significant difference in attendance after the change compared to the regular season before the change. Finally, we found that the main decrease in attendance after the change appears in the first half of the season, when the games are likely to be perceived as less decisive than in the second half of the season.},

  abstract     = {The solution of multistage stochastic linear problems (MSLPs) represents a challenge for many applications. Long-term hydrothermal dispatch planning (LHDP) materializes this challenge in a real-world problem that affects electricity markets, economies, and natural resources worldwide. No closed-form solutions are available for MSLP and the definition of non-anticipative policies with high-quality out-of-sample performance is crucial. Linear decision rules (LDRs) provide an interesting simulation-based framework for finding high-quality policies for MSLP through two-stage stochastic models. In practical applications, however, the number of parameters to be estimated when using an LDR may be close to or higher than the number of scenarios of the sample average approximation problem, thereby generating an in-sample overfit and poor performances in out-of-sample simulations. In this paper, we propose a novel regularized LDR to solve MSLP based on the AdaLASSO (adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). The goal is to use the parsimony principle, as largely studied in high-dimensional linear regression models, to obtain better out-of-sample performance for a LDR applied to MSLP. Computational experiments show that overfitting is a non-negligible threat when using the classical non-regularized LDR to solve the LHDP, one of the most studied MSLP with relevant applications in industry. Our analysis highlights the following benefits of the proposed framework in comparison to the non-regularized benchmark: 1) significant reductions in the number of non-zero coefficients (model parsimony), 2) substantial cost reductions in out-of-sample evaluations, and 3) improved spot-price profiles.},

  abstract     = {Sugarcane and its by-products make a relevant contribution to the world economy. In particular, the sugar-energy industry is affected by the timing of sugarcane cultivation and harvesting from which sucrose and bio-energy are produced. We address this issue by proposing a mixed-integer non-linear programming model to schedule planting and harvesting operations for different varieties of sugarcane. The decisions to be made include the choice of sugarcane varieties to be grown on a given set of plots, the periods for their cultivation, the subsequent harvesting periods, and the type of harvesting equipment. These decisions are subject to various constraints related to matching cultivation periods with harvesting periods according to the maturity cycles of the selected sugarcane varieties, the availability of harvesting machinery, the demand for sucrose and fiber, and further technical requirements. The tactical cultivation and harvesting plans to be determined account for three conflicting objectives, namely maximization of the total sucrose and fiber production, minimization of the total time devoted to harvesting, and minimization of the total cost of transporting the harvesting equipment. We develop a tailored exact method based on the augmented Chebyshev scalarization technique extended with a mechanism for identifying an initial feasible integer solution that greatly helps reduce the computational effort for obtaining Pareto-optimal solutions. Our computational study with instances that reflect the current cultivation and harvesting practices in Brazil demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. In addition, a comparative analysis reveals the trade-offs achieved by alternative planting and harvesting schedules, thereby facilitating the decision-making process.},

  abstract     = {Human trafficking, the commercial exploitation of individuals, is a gross violation of human rights; harming societies, economies, health and development. The related disciplines of Operations Research (OR) and Analytics are uniquely positioned to support trafficking prevention and intervention efforts by efficiently evaluating a plethora of decision alternatives and providing quantitative, actionable insights. As operations and analytical efforts in the counter-trafficking field emerge, it is imperative to grasp subtle, yet distinctive, nuances associated with human trafficking. This paper is intended to inform those practitioners working in the Operations and Analytics fields by highlighting key features of human trafficking activity. We grouped ten themes around two broad categories: (1) representation of human trafficking and (2) consideration of survivors and communities. These insights are derived from our collective experience in working in this area and substantiated by domain expertise. Based on these areas, we then suggest avenues for future work.},

  abstract     = {The tuna fishing sector has faced important regulatory restrictions for years, mainly based on the number of fish aggregating devices (FADs) allowed per vessel, which has threatened the survival of many tuna firms. Various academics have studied this issue, proposing various solutions based on the reassignment and sharing of FADs. However, previous research has focused primarily on the use of FADs and their implications, rather than actually helping to optimize the tuna fleet’s fishing activity, and possibly for this reason, none of these proposals has impacted current fishing practices. In light of this situation, our research proposes a more equitable approach: we have modeled the tuna vessel problem as a cooperative game, reallocating FADs among vessels, studying the Shapley value, and comparing the results achieved with previous proposals. Although our approach is fairly standard in the literature, it is a novel solution to a deep-rooted problem in this sector that also leads to a significant reduction in CO 2 CO2 emissions associated with fuel consumption. In fact, the application of our theoretical results to real data shows that there is not only a significant scope for improvement for firms and their vessels –both gain more revenue– but also a beneficial contribution to the environment in terms of reduced fuel consumption.},

  abstract     = {Workload control (WLC) relies on order release (input control) and capacity adjustments (output control) to regulate manufacturing throughput times. Research concerning integrated input-output control is very scarce. A novel approach is proposed: a closed-loop integrated model, where automatic feedback control is added and where order release and capacity decisions are a continuous function of the shop floor current state. In existing models, capacity increments are triggered by a threshold utilisation and have a fixed value, defined by means of experiments. In the proposed approach, these values are dynamically and flexibly defined (by the controller), addressing a gap regarding input-output parameterisation. The model was applied to a shop with unidirectional flow and three control rules were tested in scenarios of unbalanced work in process (WIP) and demand fluctuations. The results showed that the simultaneous input-output control is effective, leading the system to restore WIP balance, reach stability and absorb demand fluctuations, especially when global information is provided to the controller. The results of continuous closed-loop model simulation were integrated into a discrete-event simulation (DES) model, to compare the proposed capacity policies with the policies presented in the literature. The comparison showed that the proposed policies are cost-effective for a reasonable throughput time reduction. Moreover, the closed-loop model provided good parameters for a step-increment capacity policy that minimizes throughput times. Closed-loop control models are responsive and prescriptive, in contrast to DES models used in WLC research, which are descriptive. With this approach, WLC research can benefit from the strengths of both methods.},

  abstract     = {This article concerns a variant of moving target travelling salesman problem where the number and locations of targets vary with time and realizations of random trajectories. Managerial objectives are to maximize the number of visits to different targets and to minimize the total travel distance. Employing a linear value function for finding supported Pareto-efficient solutions, we develop a two-stage stochastic programming model. We propose an iterative randomized dynamic programming ( R D P RDP ) algorithm which converges to a global optimum with probability one. Each iteration in R D P RDP involves a randomized backward and forward recursion stage as well as options for improving any given schedule: swaps of targets and optimization of timing for visits. An integer linear programming (ILP) model is developed and solved by a standard ILP solver to evaluate the performance of R D P RDP on instances of real data for scheduling an environmental surveillance boat to visit ships navigating in the Baltic Sea. Due to a huge number of binary variables, the ILP model in practice becomes intractable. For small to medium size data sets, the Pareto-efficiency of solutions found by R D P RDP and ILP solver are equal within a reasonable tolerance; however, R D P RDP is significantly faster and able to deal with large-scale problems in practice.},

  abstract     = {We suggest a novel choice of non-separable basis functions for an approximate linear programming approach to the well-known network revenue management problem. Considering non-separability is particularly important when interdependencies between resources are large. Such a situation can be illustrated for example by a bus line, where different origin-destination pairs have many overlapping segments. Traditional separable approximation approaches tend to ignore the resulting interactions. We suggest to group resources into non-separable subnetworks. For each chosen subnetwork, basis functions either span the whole function space or consist of linear functions. Given this more general choice of basis functions, we extend existing reductions of approximate linear programs. If there is only one subnetwork, for which the basis functions span the whole function space, we prove the equivalence to a compact linear program of polynomial size. For the general case, we suggest an approximate reduction. Numerical examples illustrate our novel upper bounds for the maximum expected revenue and the corresponding competitive policies. In particular, we find that the added benefit of non-separability heavily depends on the network structure and the capacity. Our work helps to better understand the impact of assuming separability in network revenue management. The polynomial sized reductions make it possible to estimate the added average revenue resulting from incorporating interactions between resources. The theory we develop demonstrates how the interpretation of dual variables as state-action probabilities can be applied to reduce exponentially large approximate linear programs via variable aggregation.},

Furthermore, we show that the mobile rate always benefits the incumbent, but does not necessarily hurts the entrant. In particular, an increase in the mobile rate ekes greater market share for the entrant, albeit less profitability. We extend the current model to the case of substitutability on both sides, different initial utilities, and the incumbent not capturing all mobile providers, to draw managerial insights.},

The analysis focuses on the widely used ‘weight and rate’ method of multicriteria decision-making, but the findings also provide perspectives on scale dependence in numerous settings. We introduce a simulation method to generate ‘weight and rate’ decisions uniformly and use simulation to characterize the sensitivity of the obtained rankings to monotonic transformations. We define a weight-rate function and cumulative weight-rate function to characterize decision alternatives and draw on the results of stochastic dominance to address the sensitivity of the rankings to the choice of the constructed scale analytically for certain classes of decisions. We define absolute, first-order, and second-order weight-rate dominance conditions. We also define a special case where the domain of the weight-rate function of one alternative is contained within the domain of another. We show that this special case is especially sensitive to the constructed scale. We also show via simulations that increasing the number of attributes or the number of alternatives increases sensitivity to the constructed ratings scale. The numerical and theoretical results show the ranking of decision alternatives is sensitive to the constructed scale, except in limited cases such as absolute and first-order weight-rate dominance. The results provide insights for practitioners and government officials into this widely used method of decision-making and cautions them to the sensitivity of their results to the rating and weighting scales that are used.},

We show that the distribution of the arrival rate at arrival instants is the size-biased counterpart of the original distribution. In particular, the ASTA (arrivals see time averages) property does not hold but rather a rate-biased version of it which we define and coin by the term RASTA (Rate-biased ASTA). We show that the RASTA phenomenon plays a crucial role in the analysis of strategic behavior of customers who evaluate the consequences of the actions they take upon arrival. By studying such a system with a single server and strategic customers who decide whether to join or balk without observing the queue, we exemplify the importance of RASTA in deriving the equilibrium behavior.},

We also propose a general framework to stabilize our algorithm, and show its finite convergence and exact behavior. We report an extensive computational study on large-scale instances of stochastic optimization literature that shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared to nine alternative algorithms from the literature.

We examine the behaviour of the influence function of the estimator in a stochastic frontier context, and derive some sufficient conditions for robust maximum likelihood estimation in terms of the properties of the marginal distributions of the error components and, in cases where they are dependent, the copula density. We find that the canonical distributional assumptions do not satisfy these conditions. The Student’s t noise distribution is found to have some particularly attractive properties which means it can be paired with a broad class of inefficiency distributions while still satisfying our conditions under independence.

We find that the cross-channel effect and blockchain have significant impacts on the optimal decisions and coordination results. In the marketplace mode, the optimal production quantity increases (decreases) with the commission rate if the cross-channel effect is high (low). The optimal delivery time increases (decreases) with the cross-channel effect and the cap in the marketplace (reselling) mode. The reselling mode can coordinate the manufacturer and platform regardless of whether delivery time or strategic inventory is considered, while the marketplace mode can coordinate the two firms only when delivery time is considered.

We propose an analytical framework to identify when a manufacturer facing strategic consumers should offer trade-in (and refurbishment) programs. For that purpose, we analyze and compare the results of three models: no program, trade-in program only, and trade-in and refurbishment programs. This study establishes that the manufacturer can always increase his profit by improving the quality of new products and reducing the quality depreciation rate. Yet when the manufacturer does not (resp., does) offer a refurbishment program, his profit must (resp., need not) decrease with any increase in the production cost of new products. Finally, the manufacturer prefers to offer (a) trade-in programs only when the production cost of new products is low, (b) both trade-in and refurbishment programs when that cost is moderate, and (c) neither program when the cost to produce new products is high.

We examine and compare scenarios of a centralized supply chain, a traditional supply chain without ugly veg, an ugly veg supply chain with a single retailer offering both regular produce and ugly veg, and a two-retailer supply chain where an auxiliary retailer sells the ugly veg. We characterize the equilibrium decisions in these systems and also provide analytical results and insights on the effectiveness of different supply chain designs based on a comprehensive numerical study. We demonstrate the conditions under which the supply chain can reduce overall food loss. For sufficiently high cost of effort, selling ugly veg through the single retailer reduces food loss. Nonetheless, the grower is generally better off offering the ugly veg to an auxiliary retailer. We show that the ratio of food loss per cultivated land always decreases in the two-retailer supply chain, while the total food loss might increase for sufficiently high cost of effort.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of remanufacturing planning in the presence of statistical estimation errors. Determining the optimal remanufacturing timing, first and foremost, requires modeling of the state transitions of a system. The estimation of these probabilities, however, often suffers from data inadequacy and is far from accurate, resulting in serious degradation in performance. To mitigate the impacts of the uncertainty in transition probabilities, we develop a novel data-driven modeling framework for remanufacturing planning in which decision makers can remain robust with respect to statistical estimation errors. We model the remanufacturing planning problem as a robust Markov decision process, and construct ambiguity sets that contain the true transition probabilities with high confidence. We further establish structural properties of optimal robust policies and provide insights for remanufacturing planning. A computational study on the NASA turbofan engine shows that our data-driven robust decision framework consistently yields better out-of-sample reward and higher reliability of the performance guarantee, compared to the nominal model that uses the maximum likelihood estimates of the transition probabilities without considering parameter uncertainty.},

A dynamic programming based method is designed to solve the PPs efficiently. To further accelerate the solution processes of the PPs and of the RMP, some tailored strategies are also embedded within the algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the contributions of the dynamic programming and of the acceleration strategies.

The interest for the CPP comes from the fact that it represents well many practical problems from areas like data mining, engineering, bio-informatics, etc. To address this NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, the novel fixed set search (FSS) metaheuristic is applied. This is performed, firstly, by developing a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) using a new type of neighborhood in the local search. The GRASP is further extended to the FSS by adding a learning mechanism. The FSS application to the CPP provides a new approach for generating fixed sets for problems with solution symmetries. This approach opens the application of the FSS to new families of combinatorial optimization problems. The conducted computational experiments show that the FSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art metaheuristics for the CPP. The proposed approach obtains a large number of new best solutions for commonly used CPP test instances.},

Unlike other appointment scheduling problems in healthcare systems, patients are scheduled for a series of dialysis treatment appointments instead of a single appointment. In this study, we formulate this multiple-appointment system as a set-partitioning problem that allows partial schedules to be feasible. We employ a Branch and Price (BP) algorithm to solve the problem, however, the pricing sub-problem proves to be exceedingly challenging for state-of-the-art dynamic programming algorithms. Therefore, we propose a novel decomposition of the sub-problem and design an efficient embedded Column Generation (CG) algorithm to find the optimal solution. We further design a greedy heuristic that enhances the computational efficiency of the BP algorithm. Our proposed BP algorithms efficiently solve challenging instances that are simulated based on the data from a collaborating hemodialysis center. Specifically, the Enhanced CG-embedded BP algorithm accelerates the CPU time on average by 78\% compared to the Base BP algorithm (32\% and 59\% compared to the Enhanced and the CG-embedded BP algorithms, respectively). We also compare the optimal results with the current scheduling policy at the center. Our proposed Enhanced CG-embedded BP algorithm improves the percentage of leftover appointments by 98\% on average and the hours of deviations per patient by 46\% on average, compared to the current policy.},

The objective is to find the optimal decisions on due date assignment, job sequencing, and level of induced learning to minimize a cost function consisting of the total weighted number of tardy jobs, due date penalty, and investment cost. We find a novel property of the optimal solution that although the due date penalty may be larger, the number of on-time jobs will not decrease with the increasing induced learning effect, which is a breakthrough to solve the problem. Exploiting the property, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that generates an approximation solution with a gap less than L ϵ Lϵ compared with the optimal result, where ϵ ϵ can tend to be infinitesimal, and L L is a constant.},

While, thus far, methods have focused mostly on optimizing a single selected objective, it is increasingly important to address several objectives simultaneously in order to move from extreme to balanced solutions that consider diverse operational requirements. Following this, we classify and characterize the literature dealing with multi-objective hybrid flow shop scheduling problems (HFSP). We identify those features in metaheuristics that require particular attention during the process of finding Pareto solutions for HFSP (especially coding and decoding schemes, Pareto archives, and Pareto dominance concepts). To promote the evaluation of the suitability of algorithms for solving multi-criteria HFSP, we provide an overview of the test instances used in the literature and propose a systematization of performance criteria for the evaluation of Pareto fronts in order to create clear and consistent conceptual and semantic understanding. Based on this, recommendations are derived that can also be helpful for various multi-objective optimization problems and other application contexts for assessing solution quality as accurately and comparably as possible. Finally, current challenges and possible future research directions are highlighted.},

  abstract     = {After a promising ramp up, free-floating car sharing is about to establish itself as a mainstream mobility option in many urban areas. This form of short-term car rental allows users to begin trips wherever they are offered an available car and end them at their most convenient position. Current implementations are not based on optimization; each user decides locally whether to place a short-term reservation among available cars. This paper evaluates the potential gains for a car sharing provider if, instead, a sophisticated optimization algorithm is applied to match demand and supply centrally. For this purpose, we formulate the car-request assignment problem, provide a heuristic solution approach, and show how to apply it in different booking processes. Specifically, we compare the status quo with different optimization-based matching approaches, where either the booking with all its details is instantaneously confirmed to the customer or only a service promise is accredited, but the final specification of the car is postponed. Furthermore, we differentiate whether incoming customer requests are collected for a short batching interval and then jointly optimized, or if each customer receives immediate feedback. In an computational study, based on generated and real-world data, these five different booking policies are benchmarked in a dynamic environment where new requests appear over time. The computational tests also evaluate the impact of no-shows, late car returns, and the application of relocators. The results reveal that, once customers are willing to accept an altered booking process, an optimization-based matching mechanism promises considerable improvement of services.},

  abstract     = {Recently, an increasing number of companies have encountered random production disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we investigate a two-stage supply chain in which a retailer can order products from a low-price (“cheap”) unreliable supplier (who may be subject to an uncertain production disruption and partially deliver the order) and an “expensive” reliable supplier at Stage 1 and a more “expensive” backup supplier at Stage 2. If the disruption happens, only the products that were produced before the disruption time can be obtained from the unreliable supplier. It is found that in the case with imperfect demand information updating, the unreliable supplier is always used while the reliable supplier can be abandoned. The time-dependent supply property of the unreliable supplier reduces the retailer&#39;s willingness of adopting the dual sourcing strategy at Stage 1, compared with the scenario with all-or-nothing supply. Different from the case with imperfect demand information updating, either the reliable or unreliable supplier can be abandoned in the case with perfect demand information updating. We derive the optimal ordering decisions and the conditions where single sourcing or dual sourcing is adopted at Stage 1. We conduct numerical experiments motivated by the sourcing problem of 3M Company in the US during the COVID-19 and observe that the unreliable supplier is more preferable when the demand uncertainty before or after the emergency order is higher. Interestingly, the retailer tends to order more from the unreliable supplier when the production disruption probability is larger in some cases.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic patients can receive multiple/different treatments. However, there is no universal solution for all patients, i.e., one prescription can treat some patients, but it may not be effective for others. Therefore, if we can stratify those patients into several sub-classes, the patients in each sub-class can receive the optimal treatment. There are two main challenges: (1) counterfactual inference when a patient can only take one treatment at a time, i.e., a long time is required to collect an adequate amount of patient data for analysis; (2) the confounding effects of covariates on the treatment. To address these challenges, we propose a method entitled constrained optimization for stratified treatment rules (COSTAR). The proposition is to view the realized treatment outcome as observable but the unrealized as missing values. Thus, the problem becomes finding the optimal treatment with missing outcomes and covariate balance constraints. Through the method COSTAR, the experiment results with real-world data suggest that our results perform better than the related methods in reducing the hospital readmission rate within 30 days. Our solution also guarantees the robustness of the estimation of the mean treatment response in each sub-class.},

We develop a robust model to establish the prevalence of such inefficiencies and demonstrate the mechanisms that exacerbate or mitigate them. The model illustrates how the spatial distribution of the population and the severity of disamenity costs can generate outcomes that make the entire locality worse off. Based on these properties, we provide a feasible remedy. Analysis of U.S. census data illustrates the magnitude of potential inefficiencies that arise with simple majority-rule decisions. Such losses can be mitigated using our model, which easily captures the aggregate disamenity cost and can consequently recommend the required voting supermajority to ensure efficiency.},

We investigate the manufacturer’s product-line selling strategies: either the manufacturer sells low-quality products and rents high-quality products (i.e., the L H LH product line), or the manufacturer sells high-quality products and rents low-quality products (i.e., the H L HL product line). We also examine whether to offer the add-on for rental products. The results show that the manufacturer will always offer the add-on. When the add-on value and the degree of quality differentiation are low, the manufacturer will offer the add-on and choose the H L HL product line; otherwise, the manufacturer will offer the add-on and choose the L H LH product line. Furthermore, reducing the add-on cost will not always increase the manufacturer’s profit. However, as the add-on cost decreases, the manufacturer will be more likely to offer the add-on and choose the H L HL product line.

The switch to customer-centric strategies also implies that firms are collecting an enormous amount of customer-related data. The purpose of this paper is to propose a DEA-based methodology to determine the contribution of customer segments to firm value. We show the practical usefulness of our methodology through an application to Activity Based Costing (ABC) data collected from a large European telecom provider, which offers fixed telephone, mobile telephone, digital television and internet subscriptions. Our analysis reveals that the average cost reduction potential across all customer segments amounts to 1.26\% 1.26\% of the total controllable costs, which represents approximately EUR 5 million when expressed in monetary terms. We also document substantial variation in the cost reduction potential across customer segments.},

  abstract     = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a well-known data-driven mathematical modeling approach that aims at evaluating the relative efficiency of a set of comparable decision making units (DMUs) with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. The number of inputs and outputs (performance factors) plays a vital role for successful applications of DEA. There is a statistical and empirical rule in DEA that if the number of performance factors is high in comparison with the number of DMUs, then a large percentage of the units will be determined as efficient, which is questionable and unacceptable in the performance evaluation context. However, in some real-world applications, the number of performance factors is relatively larger than the number of DMUs. To cope with this issue, selecting models have been developed to select a subset of performance factors that lead to acceptable results. In this paper, we extend a pair of optimistic and pessimistic approaches, involving two alternative individual and summative selecting models, based on the slacks-based model. We mathematically validate the proposed models with some theorems and lemmas and illustrate the applicability of our models using 18 active auto part companies in the largest stock exchange in Iran.},

  abstract     = {The data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is extensively used to estimate efficiency, but no study has determined the DEA model that delivers the most precise estimates. To address this issue, we advance the Monte Carlo simulation-based data generation process proposed by Kohl and Brunner (2020). The developed process generates an artificial dataset using the Translog production function (instead of the commonly used Cobb Douglas) to construct well-behaved scenarios under variable returns to scale (VRS). Using different VRS DEA models, we compute DEA efficiency scores with artificially generated decision-making units (DMUs). We employ five performance indicators followed by a benchmark value and ranking as well as statistical hypothesis tests to evaluate the quality of the efficiency estimates. The procedure allows us to determine which parameters negatively or positively influence the quality of the DEA estimates. It also enables us to identify which DEA model performs the most efficiently over a wide range of scenarios. In contrast to the widely applied BCC (Banker-Charnes-Cooper) model, we find that the Assurance Region (AR) and Slacks-Based Measurement (SBM) DEA models perform better. Thus, we endorse the use of AR and SBM models for DEA applications under the VRS regime.},

  abstract     = {Public decisions are typically related to large investments leaving long legacies. We should therefore strive for wide societal agreement regarding such decisions, which meet the diversity of preferences between stakeholders and over time. But if, how and why do stakeholder preferences change over time? In decision analysis, these questions received little attention. We explored them using three real-world public decision processes, based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). We used repeatedly elicited ranking of objectives over time. These were obtained during three to five moderated workshops we organised several months apart (total N = 200 questionnaires, and 100 stakeholders). We analysed individual and aggregated (group) preferences, their changes and potential drivers including demographic and experience variables. We also analysed the effect of preference evolution on the performance of decision-alternatives with MCDA over time. We found that stakeholder preferences often changed over time, both on an individual and group level. These changes did not systematically diminish over time, but some convergence of preferences was observed for stakeholders who repeatedly participated in workshops. High-ranking objectives were relatively stable and similar between stakeholders. While preference changes could not be explained by demographics and personal experiences, repeated interaction with the decision problem might play a role. Neither the observed disagreement between stakeholders, nor the preference changes over time affected the best and worst performing alternatives in our decision problems. Thus, despite changing stakeholder preferences over time, public decision-makers can contrive robust solutions to complex public decision problems in the present.},

The objective is first to offer a better modeling of delivery problems in congested cities. In particular, we remove the assumption that a vehicle can/must park in front of each customer. Second, we evaluate potential savings in traveled distances and parking times. We introduce the Park-and-Loop Routing Problem with Parking Selection (PLRP-PS) in which a parking space or loading zone has to be found for the driver and his vehicle before he walks to deliver to one or several customers. In this paper, we focus on cases where parking locations should be selected among a large set of parking areas. To solve this problem, we develop a variant of the large neighborhood search metaheuristic called Small and Large Neighborhood Search (SLNS). We focus on designing and comparing simple and efficient techniques to select parking spots for vehicles before goods are delivered by walking trips. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on small instances of the PLRP-PS and in the park-and-loop routing problem, with eleven new best solutions found on an existing benchmark. Some realistic instances are generated based on open data from the city of Nantes, France. In these instances, we find that combining walking and driving to deliver to the center of a city can save 19\% of working time on average compared to the classical vehicle routing approach.},

In addition to the degradation condition of the system, maintenance schedules should take into account the availability of spare parts. By incorporating spare part order information, planners can make more precise arrangements for both maintenance and spare parts replenishment, leading to a reduction in operating cost. This paper investigates the joint optimization of condition-based maintenance and spare provisioning for a K -out-of- N system considering failures during inspection intervals. The degradation states of the system are revealed at periodic inspection epochs where planners have the opportunity to replace components and order spare parts. The resulting sequential decision problem is formulated as a Markov decision process that integrates the comprehensive information of the components and spare parts orders into decision making. We propose an optimal joint policy by using the value iteration algorithm and compare it with two separated policies that consider part of the information. Sensitivity experiments are conducted to analyze the impact of the parameters on the effect of the proposed policy with the comprehensive information. The results show that the comprehensive information is more important to the ordering decisions than the replacing decisions.},

  abstract     = {Besides carrying the operational inventory, retailers may invest in the strategic inventory for obtaining the discount of future wholesale price, although this behavior can induce the holding cost. In this paper, we adopt a game theoretical method to check the role of strategic inventory under the retailer-to-retailer competition. The impact of strategic inventory on a two-tier supply chain model is investigated under the retailer competition. A supplier sells products to customers through two competing retailers who may choose to carry the strategic inventory in a two-period setting. The results indicate that the retailer-to-retailer competition may affect the decisions of supply chain parties about the strategic inventory and pricing as follows. First, the competition weakens the incentives of retailers in holding the strategic inventory. Second, the lower inventory holding expense would still stimulate retailers to hold the strategic inventory for more profits. Third, facing two competing and asymmetric retailers, the prisoner&#39;s dilemma and chicken game equilibrium may occur between the two retailers when the inventory holding cost is intermediate under the uniform wholesale price strategy. However, under the differentiated wholesale price strategy, the prisoner&#39;s dilemma and chicken game equilibrium can be eliminated. For similar operational styles including store styles and locations, retailers can break through the dilemma by simultaneously holding the strategic inventory, and can obtain more profits from carrying strategic inventory under differentiated wholesale price strategy. Therefore, the differentiated wholesale price strategy can promote the two retailers to cooperate with each other and can benefit all parties.},

Without artificial intelligence (AI), the optimal production quantities in both the marketplace and reselling modes increase (decrease) with the platform power under low (high) network effects.

We examine a production-inventory system that can operate in Working, Idle, and Off energy modes with mode-dependent energy costs. There can be a warm-up delay to switch between one mode to another. With random inter-arrival, production and warm-up times, we formulate the problem of determining in which mode the production resource should operate at a given time depending on the state of the system as a stochastic control problem under the long-run average profit criterion considering the sales revenue together with energy, inventory holding and backlog costs. The optimal solution of the problem for the exponential inter-arrival, production and warm-up times is determined by solving the Markov Decision Process with a linear programming approach. The structure of the optimal policy for the exponential case uses two thresholds to switch between the Working and Idle or Working and Off modes. We use the two-threshold policy as an approximate policy to control a system with correlated inter-event times with general distributions. This system is modelled as a Quasi Birth and Death Process and analyzed by using a matrix-geometric method. Our numerical experiments show that the joint production and energy control policy performs better compared to the pure production and energy control policies depending on the system parameters. In summary, we propose a joint energy and production control policy that improves energy efficiency by controlling the energy modes depending on the state of the system.},

Compared with the existing models, the new formulation simultaneously considers alternative operation selection and sequencing and operational method assignment under two optimization criteria. The new formulation does not need to plot the common AND/OR-network that often depicts partial possible processing routes. Distinctively, the important operational precedence constraint is beforehand transformed into the possible successor set of each operation and the possible immediate successor set. Three methods are creatively proposed to prohibit from generating a cycle in sequencing. The complicated criteria involving the machine, tool and setup changeover identification are linearly expressed. The experimental results indicate that the proposed 0-1 linear programming models are able to quickly obtain the optimal solution of the small-scale problems and stably find a satisfactory solution of the large-scale problems within acceptable time. Compared with the existing mathematical programming models for process planning, the proposed linear models have lower complexity and better performance in solving benchmark instances. In two groups of comparative experiments, the number of constraints of the proposed linear models dramatically reduces by 99.6\% and 70\%, respectively. Moreover, all benchmark instances are exactly solved by the Cplex solver using the proposed linear models within one hour.},

However, in the VRPTW-FL each customer is served in one of a set of potential service locations, each of which has a certain capacity. From a practical point of view, the VRPTW-FL is highly relevant due to its numerous applications, e.g. parcel delivery, routing with limited parking space, and hospital-wide scheduling of physical therapists. Theoretically, the VRPTW-FL is challenging to solve due to the limited location capacities. When serving a customer, location availability must be ensured at every time. To solve this problem, we present a mathematical model and a tailored hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search. Our heuristic makes use of an innovative backtracking approach during the construction phase to alter unsatisfactory decisions at an early stage. In the meta-heuristic phase, we employ novel neighborhoods and dynamic updates of the objective violation weights. For our computational analysis, we use hospital data to evaluate the utility of flexible delivery locations and various cost functions.

  abstract     = {This study investigates the issue of optimal preventive replacement scheduling for a repairable system, considering its failure/repair history and its environment or degradation, as characterised by covariates. The proposed approach is developed within a recurrent event modelling framework, in which the failure behaviour of the system is defined by its failure intensity, and perfect preventive replacements and imperfect corrective repairs are integrated following a virtual age assumption. The observed heterogeneity between systems is integrated through covariates by following a proportional hazard assumption. These covariates are assumed to be either fixed and represent, for example, the manufacturer origin, or to be dynamic and represent the monitored degradation process. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, a dynamic condition-based preventive replacement policy is developed. The maintenance decision rule integrates the available information on both the corrective repair history and covariate behaviour to determine the optimal preventive replacement time. This policy extends the state-of-the-art model of Gilardoni et al. (2016), which considers only the corrective repair history without integrating covariates. Second, the results of this study demonstrate how different levels of knowledge and information regarding the covariates can be integrated into the maintenance decision and lead to different optimal replacement times that are associated with different cost performances of the preventive replacement policy.

  abstract     = {Container terminal quay crane scheduling may enter a new era with the recently patented quay crane design. These next-generation cranes can induce noticeable improvements to the service time and quay side’s capacity. Specifically, they can access containers from both sides of the vessel and can perform up to four container operations at a time. Port managers may find it useful to operate these cranes in conjunction with traditional cranes, whether in the transition phase or in following a strategic resource allocation. For that, in this work, we model the simultaneous scheduling of next-generation and traditional cranes. We introduce a mixed integer program and two solution methodologies to solve the problem. The first is a column generation approach, designed based on the main problem formulation. It shows improvement over solving the formulation in commercial solver but requires considerable computational time. For that, we introduce a re-visualized vessel structure that results in a reduction of possible feasible arrangements for column generation purposes. Thus, the second approach uses a (modified) column generation algorithm to solve a re-visualized vessel structure, where the new structure’s workload is enumerated using a fast set-partitioning formulation. Through a computational study, we show that the proposed approach can solve real cases in a reasonable time. Finally, a case study sheds light on how the positioning of cranes affects the service time and motivates a modelling extension.},

  abstract     = {The combined increase of energy demand and environmental pollution on a global scale is forcing a rethinking, in sustainable terms, of energy supply policies and production models. To flatten demand peaks in power plants, energy suppliers adopted pricing policies that stimulate a change in the consumption practices of customers. One example of such policies is the Time-of-Use (TOU)-based tariffs, which encourage electricity usage at off-peak hours using low prices while penalizing peak hours with higher prices. To avoid a sharp rise in energy supply costs, the manufacturing industry must carefully reschedule the production processes, by shifting them toward less expensive periods. TOU-based tariffs impose specific constraints on the completion of the jobs involved in the production processes as well as a partitioning of the time horizon of the production into a set of time slots, whose associated cost becomes part of the optimization objective. In this article, we review the flourishing literature on job scheduling under TOU-based energy tariffs. Our purpose is to provide researchers and practitioners with a framework that may guide them toward the most important theoretical results on the topic as well as the most prominent practical applications in sustainable manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {A variety of strategies have been proposed for overcoming local optimality in metaheuristic search. This paper examines characteristics of moves that can be exploited to make good decisions about steps that lead away from a local optimum and then lead toward a new local optimum. We introduce strategies to identify and take advantage of useful features of solution history with an adaptive memory metaheuristic, to provide rules for selecting moves that offer promise for discovering improved local optima. Our approach uses a new type of adaptive memory based on a construction called exponential extrapolation. The memory operates by means of threshold inequalities that ensure selected moves will not lead to a specified number of most recently encountered local optima. Associated thresholds are embodied in choice rule strategies that further exploit the exponential extrapolation concept and open a variety of research possibilities for exploration. The considerations treated in this study are illustrated in an implementation to solve the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. We show that the AA algorithm obtains an average objective gap of 0.0315\% to the best known values for the 21 largest Palubeckis instances. This solution quality is considered to be quite attractive because less than 20 s on average are taken by AA, which is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude less than the time required by most algorithms reporting the best known results.},

  abstract     = {In network analysis, node centrality is used to quantify the importance of a node to the structure of the network. One of the most natural and widely used centrality measures is degree centrality, defined as the number of nodes adjacent to a given node. A simple generalization of this concept that arises in many real-life applications is to consider the centrality of node groups, including subgraphs with specific connectivity properties. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the most central walk in a network, where the centrality of the walk is given by the size of its immediate neighborhood. We begin with the problem of finding the most central shortest path and show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time. We then focus on finding other types of most central walks, such as general walks, trails, paths, and induced paths of some pre-defined length. We demonstrate that in contrast to the most central shortest path problem, these problems are N P NP -hard. We propose two types of linear MIP formulations to solve these problems exactly that rely on two interpretations of a walk: a sequence of visited nodes and a sequence of traversed edges. In addition, we develop two heuristic algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness by comparing them with the exact solutions obtained using MIPs; we also exploit heuristic solutions to warm-start the MIP solver. Finally, we test our solution approaches using synthetic and real-life networks in an extensive computational study, which allows us to provide some interesting insights and observations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem with Conflicts (VSBPPC). In VSBPPC, a set of items each with a certain size has to be packed into bins of various types. Bin types differ in terms of their capacity and cost, and certain pairs of items cannot be packed into the same bin due to conflicts. The goal is to pack the items into the bins such that the total cost of the used bins is minimized. VSBPPC generalizes both the Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem (VSBPP) and Bin Packing Problem with Conflicts (BPPC). We propose new lower bounds and develop a large neighborhood search algorithm for the problem. In the proposed solution approach, we destroy the solution by unpacking some of the bins and then repair the solution by a greedy method considering the unit cost of packing each item followed by a local search procedure. In the local search phase, we improve the repaired solution by (i) transferring items from its current bin to another bin, and (ii) swapping the items between bins. We evaluate the performance of the proposed solution approach not only against a lower bound but also against the benchmark algorithms from the literature. The proposed solution approach outperforms the benchmark algorithms with at least a margin of 4.39\% on average. Moreover, the solutions obtained by the proposed approach have an average optimality gap of 2.77\% with respect to the lower bound.},

Essentially, the neural network guides the algorithm by estimating the best splitting of the problem into subproblems. The paper also describes a new method for generating the training data set, which speeds up the training dataset generation and reduces the average optimality gap of solutions. The experimental results show that our machine learning-driven approach can efficiently generalize information from the training phase to significantly larger instances. Even though the instances used in the training phase have from 75 to 100 jobs, the average optimality gap on instances with up to 800 jobs is 0.26\%, which is almost five times less than the gap of the state-of-the-art heuristic.},

This problem was motivated by a scheduling application in healthcare. We present several compact formulations for the CTSP, which have been adapted from models known from the Time-dependent TSP (TDTSP) literature, and propose a new model, which is an aggregated version of a model adapted from the TDTSP. A preliminary computational experiment allowed us to identify the three most competitive models. These models were then evaluated in more detail, first through a set of instances with 2, 3 or 5 routes and characteristics that derive from an healthcare application; and second through a set of tests with 5 routes and seven different and more general consistency configurations. The computational results show that for consistency configurations in which the consistent nodes appear in all, or most, of the routes, the new aggregated model can outperform the best model adapted from the literature. For the cases where the consistent nodes appear in fewer routes or less frequently, the original time-dependent model is more efficient.},

  abstract     = {The electric fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem with time windows and recharging stations (E-FSMFTW) is an extension of the well-known electric vehicle routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW). The fleet consists of heterogeneous electric vehicles that differ in their fixed cost, transport capacity and battery size. In this paper, we introduce the electric fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem with a partial linear recharging strategy (E-FSMFTW-PR). To solve this problem, we formulate a path-based mixed-integer linear model without replicating any recharging stations. Then, we propose a tailored hybrid heuristic that combines a large neighborhood search algorithm with a set partitioning component. Our methods are tested on the public E-FSMFTW benchmark instances. The results show that our model can be used in a commercial solver to solve 88 out of 108 small-scale E-FSMFTW-PR instances. Allowing partial linear recharging can significantly reduce the logistical cost of large-scale E-FSMFTW instances compared to the best-known solutions with full recharging strategy. We also use the heuristic algorithm to solve a newly designed instance set from a real-world dataset, and investigate the benefit of the partial linear recharging strategy. Finally, our heuristic is benchmarked against state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark instances of related problems. Our algorithm finds 38 new best solutions on large-scale E-FSMFTW-FR instances, finds 11 new best solutions on large-scale EVRPTW-PR instances, and obtains a high-quality local optimal solution on a real-world dataset.},

Inspired by previous studies on complex systems and observations from the authors’ field research, in this paper, the dynamic characteristics of a deterministic service system that adopts an RCA policy in response to customers’ demand, i.e., a demand-based capacity-allocation strategy, are investigated. Particularly, a manager’s level of responsiveness to adjust capacity, consumers’ reneging behavior, social interactions among consumers, and the size of the loyal-customer base are examined. Some theoretical guidance is derived, and the dynamics of the queue length and customer base in the long-run equilibrium through bifurcation plots, Lyapunov exponents, and return maps are characterized. The results show that the very action of improving a system may instead make it more unstable and more difficult to manage. Therefore, it is not always advisable to adopt dynamic, operational policies such as RCA unless there is supporting evidence.},

However, we obtain that, when extending the analysis for capacity choice, the firm with the lowest cost always enters first in the triopoly market. The designed algorithm, which employs the bisection method at several steps to solve this model, is of value of its own as it can be more generally applied to investment problems in markets with several firms and multiple investment opportunities.},

  abstract     = {To cope with market competition and focus on core competence, many Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) choose to outsource their product manufacturing and/or component procurement functions to Contract Manufactures (CMs). In this paper, we aim to investigate the strategic interplay between manufacturing outsourcing and procurement outsourcing in a three-tier supply chain consisting of one component supplier, one common CM, and two competing OEMs. Each OEM has four outsourcing strategies: no outsourcing, “manufacturing-only” outsourcing, “procurement-only” outsourcing, and “manufacturing + procurement” outsourcing. We build a two-stage game model, where two OEMs simultaneously choose their outsourcing strategies in the first stage; in the second stage, the CM and two OEMs make wholesale prices and quantity decisions based on the outsourcing structure formed in the first stage. We find that OEMs’ equilibrium outsourcing strategies depend on the discount rate of component price and the fixed investment cost of manufacturing. Our analysis also reveals the strategic relationship between manufacturing outsourcing and procurement outsourcing: OEMs would not outsource procurement until the product manufacturing is outsourced. Moreover, there may exist Prisoners’ Dilemma , where both OEMs earn higher profits when they choose “manufacturing + procurement” outsourcing, but neither OEM is willing to outsource procurement. Interestingly, we show that OEMs’ and CM’s profits may decrease with the discount rate and market potential, but increase in the fixed investment cost.},

The first model deals with a single-period energy mix where the electricity production configuration at a future date (e.g., 2050), based on the available generation sources, is optimally obtained. An optimization model, based on a non-linear goal programming method, is designed to ensure a mixed balance between national and regional goals. The desired energy mix configuration, which is the solution obtained by solving the first model, is then fed into the second model as the main data input. In the second model, a multiple-period generation expansion plan is designed which optimizes the energy transition over the time horizon from the present until the future planning date (2050). The model considers uncertain parameters, including the regional energy demand, fuel cost, and national peak load. A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed where the sample average approximation approach is used as a method of solution. The practical use of the proposed models has been assessed through application to the electricity generation system in China.},

Earlier research assumes that when a socially responsible product is offered, consumers’ perception of its conventional (i.e., non-socially responsible) attributes remain unchanged. However, anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests that in addition to societal benefits, offering a socially responsible product can have spillover effects on consumers’ perceptions of the product&#39;s conventional characteristics and subsequently, its product image. We propose and analyze an economic equilibrium duopoly model where firms compete on price and products differentiated by their socially responsible attributes and conventional product image. Our model provides new insights into product-positioning and how failing to consider the interaction between socially responsible product offerings and spillover effects on product image can lead to suboptimal product-positioning decisions. Specifically, offering a socially responsible product can have a halo spillover effect on product image, but result in a profit loss for the firm. Furthermore, a high incremental cost of providing the socially responsible product and a large hardcore market segment can lead to a quasi-monopoly market structure where the firms earn their highest profits, if one provides the standard and the other the socially responsible product.},

This collaboration is performed by constructing a large mathematical programming model that is available to all parties. The parties then use the solution of this model in their own capacity control systems. In this setting, however, the major concern for the parties is the privacy of their input data, along with their individual optimal solutions. We first reformulate a general linear programming model that can be used for a wide range of network revenue management problems. Then we address the data privacy concern of the reformulated model and propose an approach based on solving an equivalent data-private model constructed with input masking via random transformations. Our main result shows that, after solving the data-private model, each party can safely access only its own optimal capacity allocation decisions. We also discuss the security of the transformed problem in the considered multi-party setting. Simulation experiments are conducted to support our results and evaluate the computational efficiency of the proposed data-private model. Our work provides an analytical approach and insights on how to manage shared resources in a network problem while ensuring data privacy. Constructing and solving a collaborative network problem requires information exchange between parties that may not be possible in practice.

  abstract     = {Often traditional mail carrier models assume that one carrier is assigned to each truck. This carrier drives the truck according to a delivery route, gets out of the truck at a stop, and services customers using a walking loop. We introduce the Paired Mail Carrier Problem (PMCP), which allows for two mail carriers per truck. If at least one carrier is in the truck, the truck may move forward. Given two mail carriers per truck, the objective is to minimize the time from the start to the end of the route while ensuring that each service stop is fully serviced and obeys all feasibility constraints. We develop a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation and two fast heuristics for the PMCP. The MIP formulation obtains optimal solutions for smaller instances within reasonable running times. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in addition to being very efficient (running time is on the order of milliseconds, even for large instances), our heuristics are near-optimal (within 5\% of optimality) on instances up to 80 stops. More importantly, we evaluate the impact of the paired mail carrier (PMC) setting on both a one-truck situation and a fleet (multiple trucks) situation, relative to the single mail carrier (SMC) setting. Overall, the PMC setting not only can accomplish over 50\% extra work within the same shift hours but also can lead to 22\% cost savings. Finally, we discuss an extension where we can have three or more mail carriers per truck.},

  abstract     = {In the presence of multiple lines, customers can often occupy the lines simultaneously with the help of someone else, so as to reduce their wait times. To understand the impact of such line-sitting behavior on the service system with multiple lines, we establish a queueing game-theoretic model to capture the interactions among customers, line-sitting firm and service provider. In particular, we consider a congested-prone service system with two dedicated queues, where arriving customers can join the two queues simultaneously by hiring a line-sitter to wait in one of the line on behalf of them, enabling them to receive service in any one of the queues. Our main results are as follows. First, contrary to our conventional wisdom that line-sitting firm could be more profitable when the system is more congested, we find instead that a queue with an intermediate demand volume can be most susceptible to line-sitting, whereas queues with either a very small or a very large demand volume may not be financially attractive to line-sitters. Second, our result discloses that the provision of line-sitting service in multiple lines can efficiently increase the system throughput. In the short run, both revenue of service provider and the customer surplus can be improved with the provision of line-sitting, which leads to a win-win situation. However, in the long run, line-sitting will stimulate a higher service fee charged by the service provider, reversing its short-run beneficial effect on customers, which results in a lower customer surplus. To restore the efficiency of line-sitting, we propose a centralized regulation policy from the perspective of social planner to maximize the social welfare without detriment to the customer population.},

In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic optimization framework to inform recruitment decision making for a period of highly uncertain demand in a setting where all patients must be served. The first stage identifies the number of permanent positions to advertise, and the second stage determines the number of temporary workers to recruit. Our framework accounts for the uncertainty in the permanent recruitment process, stochasticity of the service delivery, and asymmetry in demand information at the times of permanent and temporary recruitment. Under a general setting of the problem, we characterize the optimal first- and second-stage decisions analytically, propose fast numerical methods for finding their values, and prove some of their monotonicity properties. A case study based on data from a geriatric ward illustrates the application of our framework, and numerical experiments provide further managerial insights.},

By writing Dynamic Programming equations for the dual, we can employ an SDDP type method, called Dual SDDP, which solves these Dynamic Programming equations. allows us to compute a sequence of nonincreasing deterministic upper bounds for the optimal value of the problem. Since the Relatively Complete Recourse (RCR) condition may fail to hold for the dual (even for simple problems), we design two variants of Dual SDDP, namely Dual SDDP with penalizations and Dual SDDP with feasibility cuts, that converge to the optimal value of the dual (and therefore primal when there is no duality gap) problem under mild assumptions. We also show that optimal dual solutions can be obtained using dual information from Primal SDDP (applied to the original primal MSLP) subproblems. As a byproduct of the developed methodology we study sensitivity of the optimal value of the problem as a function of the involved parameters. For the sensitivity analysis we provide formulas for the derivatives of the value function with respect to the parameters and illustrate their application on an inventory problem. Since these formulas involve optimal dual solutions, we need an algorithm that computes such solutions to use them, i.e., we need to solve the dual problem. Finally, as a proof of concept of the tools developed, we present the results of numerical experiments computing the sensitivity of the optimal value of an inventory problem as a function of parameters of the demand process and compare Primal and Dual SDDP on the inventory and a hydro-thermal planning problems.},

The fast growth is not without its challenge. In 2016, due to low concentrations of memberships and far distance from the depot, certain minority neighborhoods were excluded from receiving Amazon’s SDD service, raising concerns about fairness. In this paper, we study the problem of offering fair SDD service to customers. The service area is partitioned into different regions. Over the course of a day, customers request for SDD service, and the timing of requests and delivery locations are not known in advance. The dispatcher dynamically assigns vehicles to make deliveries to accepted customers before their delivery deadline. In addition to overall service rate ( utility ), we maximize the minimal regional service rate across all regions ( fairness ). We model the problem as a multi-objective Markov decision process and develop a deep Q -learning solution approach. We introduce a novel transformation of learning from rates to actual services, which creates a stable and efficient learning process. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in alleviating unfairness both spatially and temporally in different customer geographies. We show this effectiveness is valid with different depot locations, providing businesses with an opportunity to achieve better fairness from any location. We also show that the proposed approach performs efficiently when serving heterogeneously wealthy districts in the city.},

It focuses on developing an optimal stacking strategy to allocate the arriving containers in a preassigned yard bay, with the aim of reducing extra rehandles during later retrieval. Some studies employ dynamic programming models to tackle the problem, which can offer exact solutions. Following this line of research, we propose an alternative dynamic programming model by redefining the bay representation and adjusting the formulations accordingly. The results show that the new model strikes a good balance between stacking quality and computational time. Considering that the dynamic programming model encounters difficulty in solving large-scale instances, we design two neural network algorithms that adopt a self-attention mechanism to enhance the fitting ability of the network. The neural network algorithms learn the decision patterns from the optimal results for small-scale instances obtained by dynamic programming and then are applied to solve large-scale instances. In addition, we propose a data-driven rollout algorithm by integrating the branching strategy and the aforementioned neural network algorithms to prevent the myopic drawback of using solely the neural network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that integrates the optimization method and machine learning techniques to tackle the container stacking problem. Finally, extensive computational experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models and algorithms.},

Using a game-theoretic framework, we examine how an authentic luxury brand, observing the strategic behavior of its competing copycats, should make its optimal entry decision to a third-party online marketplace. Our findings reveal that the authentic luxury brand does not sell on the online marketplace when either the quality or the physical resemblance of the copycat to the authentic luxury brand is high. This contributes to the related literature by offering an explanation for the increasing quality of copycats amid the e-commerce boom —improving the quality of the copycat can deter the authentic luxury brand from selling on the online marketplace. Furthermore, by comparing our equilibrium outcome with the benchmark case where the authentic luxury brand does not consider selling on the online marketplace at all, we show that the authentic luxury brand’s potential entry to the online marketplace is sufficient to induce the copycat to improve its quality and lower its price, thereby improving the aggregate consumer surplus. In addition, the online marketplace can always be better off allowing the entry of the copycat if there is no external enforcement against copycats. We show that our key results are valid in various extensions and they offer multiple managerial implications.},

  abstract     = {Deep-lane shuttle-based storage systems with forklifts are widely used in bulk storage and finished-goods warehouses that require dense storage paired with high operational efficiency. In such a system, automated shuttles take care of the movements of loads within the storage lanes, and forklifts take care of the horizontal and vertical movements of loads. Since shuttles are expensive, the number of shuttles in the system is typically smaller than the number of storage lanes, so shuttle transfers are required with the help of the forklift. This paper focuses on optimizing the schedule: Given a set of retrieval requests and shuttles, how can the shuttle transfer sequence and the retrieval request sequence be arranged to minimize the makespan? A mathematical model is formulated. Since the problem is NP-hard, an efficient two-stage heuristic is proposed to compute near-optimal solutions. This study’s numerical results show that the two-stage heuristic can provide high-quality solutions in reasonable time. Compared to straightforward heuristics used in practice and in the literature, the makespan can be reduced considerably. The proposed two-stage heuristic can also be used to decide the optimal shuttle fleet size.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the vehicle routing problem with time windows and stochastic demands (VRPTWSD). The problem is modeled as a two-stage stochastic program with recourse, in which routes are designed in the first stage and executed in the second. A failure occurs if the load of the vehicle is insufficient to meet the observed demand of a customer, implying recourse actions to recover feasibility. We consider the classical recourse policy where reactive trips to the depot are made in case of failures and a fixed rule-based recourse policy where, in addition, preventive trips are allowed. These recourse actions delay the vehicle and may cause further failures if the arrival times on the remaining customers of the planned route do not satisfy their time windows. An additional recourse action is used to service the customers whose time windows would be violated in the planned routes. We propose an Integer L-shaped algorithm considering the mentioned recourse actions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tailored exact approach for the VRPTWSD. Computational experiments using 112 benchmark instances evaluate the performance of this algorithm as well as the quality of the stochastic problem solutions. The results indicate significant savings in the solutions when using the fixed rule-based policy and round-trip recourse actions instead of the classical policy. Additionally, the algorithm performed better with the fixed rule-based policy, solving to optimality all instances with up to 34 customers, and taking less time on instances that were solved to optimality with both policies.},

  abstract     = {We develop an inventory control policy for perishable products considering both random demand and random lead time. We consider a B2C retail environment where excess demand is lost. The policy dynamically determines the optimal replenishment quantity under a service level constraint in every period, allowing for order-crossing, a widely disregarded characteristic in the literature. Regarding perishability, we compare the two most extreme issuing policies, first-expired-first-out (FEFO) and last-expired-first-out (LEFO), and evaluate our policy to existing inventory policies for perishables that typically ignore lead time uncertainty. We obtain several interesting findings. First, we show that ignoring lead time uncertainty and planning based on the expected lead time significantly undershoots the target service level. Even planning with the maximum lead time, under LEFO, the achieved service level would still fall considerably below the target, which the lost-sales structure can explain. On the other hand, under FEFO, the achieved service level would overshoot the target service level, which leads to unnecessary waste. Second, a more reliable lead time can significantly reduce waste, especially under LEFO. Third, our model allows us to distinguish between past, present, and future lead time uncertainty and thus to consider partial lead time information. We show the value of lead time information on outstanding orders. Fourth, we evaluate the impact of a fast but unreliable delivery option and a slow but reliable delivery option on the retailer’s average waste and ordering process. We find that the optimal choice depends on the demand characteristics.},

  abstract     = {The practical importance of coherent forecasts in hierarchical forecasting has inspired many studies on forecast reconciliation. Under this approach, base forecasts are produced for every series in the hierarchy and are subsequently adjusted to be coherent in a second reconciliation step. Reconciliation methods have been shown to improve forecast accuracy but will generally adjust the base forecast of every series. However, in an operational context, it is sometimes necessary or beneficial to keep forecasts of some variables unchanged after forecast reconciliation. In this paper, we formulate a reconciliation methodology that keeps forecasts of a pre-specified subset of variables unchanged or “immutable”. In contrast to existing approaches, these immutable forecasts need not all come from the same level of a hierarchy, and our method can also be applied to grouped hierarchies. We prove that our approach preserves unbiasedness in base forecasts. Our method can also account for correlations between base forecasting errors and ensure the non-negativity of forecasts. We also perform empirical experiments, including an application to a large-scale online retailer’s sales, to assess our proposed methodology’s impacts.},

  abstract     = {We consider a manufacturer that has a capacity constraint and allocates capacity according to the lexicographic mechanism, which involves assigning different priority levels to different retailers. The manufacturer sells products to two competing retailers: a high-priority one and a low-priority one. The manufacturer&#39;s capacity information is either public or private, which makes our paper the first to examine the impact of capacity information on the capacity allocation problem of a manufacturer. We investigate two contract types: wholesale-price and wholesale-price-and-quantity. Our results show that when capacity information is public, the manufacturer will always prefer a wholesale-price contract. Moreover, it can benefit from a lower capacity limit (capacity scarcity) due to the retailer&#39;s capacity-withholding behavior. Interestingly, the high-priority retailer may prefer that the manufacturer use a wholesale-price-and-quantity contract to limit how many items the retailer can order. When capacity information is private, the retailer can order more than the capacity of a low-type manufacturer to reveal the manufacturer&#39;s capacity level under the wholesale-price contract. At the same time, under a wholesale-price contract, the manufacturer may not want to supply all the order quantities to the retailers to avoid disclosing its capacity level. We find that pooling equilibrium can survive the Intuitive Criterion, and the manufacturer cannot benefit from capacity scarcity and withholding no longer occurs. Lastly, contrary to the case where capacity information is public, the manufacturer may prefer the wholesale-price-and-quantity contract when capacity information is private. Therefore, it is possible to achieve a win-win situation between supply chain partners with the right contract type, which is not possible when capacity information is public.},

  abstract     = {This research investigates cost-efficient manufacturer technology licensing strategies for three cost-differential manufacturers that produce partially substitutable products. Among a technology innovator, a mid-cost manufacturer, and a high-cost manufacturer; four strategies are considered including: competition; licensing of the technology by the innovator to either the mid- or high-cost manufacturer exclusively; and licensing of the technology to both the mid- and high-cost manufacturers. Following the modeling framework of an oligopolistic competition, we derive the equilibrium solutions for the alternative licensing strategies and explore the optimal strategy by evaluating the profits of the licensor, licensee(s) and unlicensed manufacturer in the different licensing models. We find that each of the four licensing strategies has the potential to deliver the best economic performance, but the optimal strategy in a given situation depends on the unit production cost differences among the three manufacturers. The underlying principle that determines it is the trade-off between the economic gain and loss from technology licensing, which is influenced by differences in production costs, market competition intensity, and the power relationship between licensor and licensee(s). Licensing coopetition between an innovator and a licensee could force an unlicensed manufacturer to exit the market, highlighting the interactive effect of coopetition in a triad. We also find that licensing cost-reducing technology among competitors will always improve social welfare compared with competition. Although the improvement in social welfare is mainly driven by increased economic performance of the manufacturers, it is not necessarily at the expense of customers with decreased consumer surplus.},

The stochastic arrival of corrective maintenance tasks and changes in both fleet and resource availability require schedules to be continuously adjusted.

This paper is the first study to address disruption management for the hangar maintenance task scheduling problem, proposing a practical and efficient modeling framework. The framework comprises a mixed integer linear programming model for airline maintenance task rescheduling in a disruptive environment, in which task scheduling is constrained by the availability of resources. The model’s capabilities include creating and adjusting maintenance schedules continuously and dynamically reacting to new information when this becomes available. The modeling framework was tested in a case study provided by a large airline, and its performance was compared to the current practice of the airline. The results show that the proposed approach produces more efficient and stable results. A 3\% ground time decrease was achieved, while the number of schedule changes in the last days before operations was decreased by more than half.},

MASS first generates satisfactory initial solutions which are feasible w.r.t. the shift duration and the vehicle capacity using a novel procedure in which (1) a giant tour is split into vehicle routes, (2) intermediate processing facilities are introduced and (3) waste pick-ups can be split further if profitable. Second, MASS improves these solutions through local search. New test instances are created, which are used to evaluate the performance of MASS’s components. We show that MASS provides high-quality feasible solutions by comparing MASS with an exact approach on a small example. Furthermore, MASS is tested on existing instances for the multiple-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP), (multi-depot) vehicle routing problem with intermediate facilities ((MD)VRPIF) and the multi-depot vehicle routing problem with inter-depot routes (MDVRPI). MASS shows competitive results for the MDVRP, the VRPIF and the MDVRPI. For the MDVRPIF, MASS obtains better results than those currently found in the literature. To assess its practical value, MASS is used to solve a real-life waste collection problem in the Brussels Capital Region in which alternative scenarios for municipal bio-waste collection and treatment are compared.},

  abstract     = {The joint optimization of facility location and service charge arises in many industrial and business contexts. This paper investigates a facility location and mill pricing problem (FLMPr), where a company aims to maximize its profit by locating service facilities and setting appropriate service charges to customers. For each facility, the number of pricing levels are finite, and the company will select exactly one level for each facility if it is open. We visualize the problem from a fully decentralized perspective, i.e., each customer acts as an independent decision-maker. Under mill pricing, customers visiting the same facility encounter the same service charge. The problem is formulated as a bilevel program, in which the company makes location and pricing decisions at the upper level, and customers decide whether to seek the service from a facility at the lower level. To solve FLMPr, we leverage three types of closest assignment constraints to reformulate the problem as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs), which can be directly solved by modern solvers. However, this approach suffers from a time-consuming solver compiling process and cannot handle large-scale instances effectively. This observation motivates us to design a branch-and-cut algorithm by exploring the bilevel structure and deriving a feasibility cut to efficiently eliminate bilevel infeasible solutions. Our extensive experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm can solve large-scale FLMPr satisfactorily and outperforms the MILP approach by a large margin. Finally, we conduct sensitivity analysis and draw interesting observations.},

At each generation, it sequentially executes an inherit-repair recombination operator to generate a promising offspring solution, a fast betweenness centrality-based late-acceptance search to find high-quality local optima, and a simple population updating strategy to maintain a healthy population. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic benchmarks show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, it can steadily find the known optimal solutions for all 22 real-world instances with known optima in only one minute, and new upper bounds on the remaining 22 large real-world instances. For 54 synthetic instances, it finds new upper bounds on 36 instances, and matches the previous best-known upper bounds on 15 other instances in ten minutes.

The goal is to identify a feasible induced pseudo-star, which is defined as a collection of nodes forming a star network with a certain probability, such that it maximizes the sum of the individual probabilities of unique assignments between the star and its open neighborhood. The feasibility is measured as the product of the existence probabilities of edges between the center node and leaf nodes and the product of one minus the existence probabilities of edges among the leaf nodes. First, the problem is shown to be NP NP -complete. We then propose a non-linear binary optimization model subsequently linearized via McCormick inequalities. We test both classical and modern Benders Decomposition algorithms together with both two- and three-phase decomposition frameworks. Logic-based-Benders cuts are examined as alternative feasibility cuts when needed. The performance of our implementations is tested on small-world (SW) graphs and a real-world protein-protein interaction network. The SW networks resemble large-scale protein-protein interaction networks for which the deterministic star degree centrality has been shown to be an efficient centrality metric to detect essential proteins. Our computational results indicate that Benders implementations outperforms solving the model directly via a commercial solver in terms of both the solution time and the solution quality in every test instance. More importantly, we show that this new centrality metric plays an important role in the identification of essential proteins in real-world networks.},

  abstract     = {The area of maritime transportation optimization has recently begun to achieve increasing success at solving large scale models, and industry is steadily adopting operations research-based models and algorithms. However, the parameters of models in the maritime domain, like many others, are beset with uncertainty. The travel times of ships, the handling times at port, the amounts of demand available at ports, fuel prices and more are all unknown and highly variable inputs to optimization methods. Recently, the maritime literature has started to address sources of uncertainty to provide higher quality decision making. We review this nascent area of the literature and provide a unifying view of different types of uncertainty across the main areas of maritime transport and varying problem types.},

We consider a market where the strategic trader can dynamically acquire costly information about an asset’s payoff via private signals instead of endowing him with its full information. The noise trading, which provides necessary liquidity for the market, has the feature of long-range dependence. The risk-neutral market maker then sets the equilibrium price for the asset based on information gleaned from the market total order flow. We characterize the equilibria for both opaque and transparent markets depending on whether or not the trader’s order flow is disclosed. In particular, closed-form solutions are obtained for two special cases and associated financial interpretations are provided. We find that: (1) the endogenous information acquisition and information-based trading help improve the price informativeness over time, while the information efficiency could be decreasing; (2) long-memory stochastic liquidity leads to an excessive price volatility; and (3) in a transparent market, the trader should adopt a mixed strategy by adding an additional noise term to the trading strategy to prevent rapid information leakage.},

  abstract     = {A generalized game is a situation in which interaction between agents occurs not only through their objective function but also through their strategy sets; the strategy set of each agent depends upon the decision of the other agents and is called the individual constraint. As opposed to generalized games with exogenous shared constraint literature pioneered by Rosen (1965), we take the individual constraints as the basic premises and derive the shared constraint generated from the individual ones, a set K K . For a profile of strategies to be a Nash equilibrium of the game with individual constraints, it must lie in K K . But if, given what the others do, each agent agrees to restrict her choice in K K , something that we call an endogenous shared constraint, this mutual restraint may generate new Nash equilibria. We show that the set of Nash equilibria in endogenous shared constraint contains the set of Nash equilibria in individual constraints. In particular, when there is no Nash equilibrium in individual constraints, there may still exist a Nash equilibrium in endogenous shared constraint. We also prove a few results for a specific class of generalized games that we call non-classical games. Finally, we give two economic applications of our results to collective action problems: carbon emission and public good problems.},

The ASA process is carried out by coordinators, who prioritise airline requests through the consideration of policy rules that aim to serve airlines and the travelling public, improve airport capacity utilisation, connectivity, and competition. Even though the ASA involves both airlines and coordinators, existing studies model the ASA without considering the interactions between airlines’ preferences and the rules and priorities that are considered by the coordinators. This paper introduces an ASA problem variant in which the assignment of airport slots is modelled by considering the interrelation between airlines’ preferences and coordinators’ prioritisation, expressed through time-dependent valuation functions. Through the development of a Mixed Integer Programming Model (MIP) and a preference-based algorithm that integrate the developed valuation functions, we propose request-to-slot assignments that are Pareto optimal per se , ergo guaranteeing that airlines and coordinators have no incentive to reject or alter the proposed schedules. Computational results demonstrate the ability of the proposed MIP and algorithm in supporting coordinators on decisions relating to which requests will be displaced or rejected so as to achieve improved capacity utilisation.},

  abstract     = {Quantity and price risks determine key uncertainties market participants face in electricity markets with increased volatility, for instance due to high shares of renewables. In the time from day-ahead until real-time, there lies a large variation in best available information, such as between forecasts and realizations of uncertain parameters like renewable feed-in and electricity prices. This uncertainty reflects on both the market outcomes and the quantity of renewable generation, making the determination of sound trading strategies across different market segments a complex task. The scope of the paper is to optimize day-ahead and intraday trading decisions jointly for a portfolio with controllable and intermittent renewable generation under consideration of risk. We include a reserve market, a day-ahead market and an intraday market in stochastic modeling and develop a multi-stage stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Program. We assess the profitability as well as the risk exposure, quantified by the conditional value at risk metric, of trading strategies following different risk preferences. We conclude that a risk-neutral trader mainly relies on the opportunity of higher expected profits in intraday trading, whereas risk can be hedged effectively by trading on the day-ahead. Finally, we show that reserve market participation implies various rationales, including the relation of expected reserve prices among each other, the relation of expected reserve prices to spot market prices, as well as the relation of the spot market prices among each other.},

Herein, three-index and modified group-based formulations are described and an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is proposed as a solution. The ALNS algorithm relies on both adapted and novel removal and insertion operators and a feature-based local search procedure. The mathematical formulations and the ALNS algorithm are evaluated on instances generated according to the actual production process. The results validate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

  abstract     = {Natural or human-inflicted disasters may cause large-scale disruptions in the services of infrastructure networks including power, water, and telecommunication. Restoring the services of these infrastructures is vital in the aftermath of the disaster, so that search-and-rescue activities, relief transportation, and restoration efforts can be efficiently facilitated. On the other hand, operations of these infrastructures may depend on receiving services from one another, resulting in an interdependent network structure. Consequently, addressing the decisions of network reinforcement before the disaster and the repairs in its aftermath needs to take into account this interdependent structure, as well as the uncertainties arising from the timing, location, and magnitude of the disaster. This paper introduces the Stochastic Interdependent Infrastructure Reinforcement and Repair Problem, which considers the pre-disaster reinforcement of interdependent network components and post-disaster repair scheduling in an integrated manner. In making these decisions, the uncertainty on which network components will be disrupted is incorporated into the problem definition. The problem is modeled using scenario-based two-stage stochastic programming. A heuristic based on a genetic algorithm and partial optimization is proposed to solve realistically-sized instances of the problem. Computational experiments not only show that the heuristic is able to find near-optimal solutions within reasonable times, but also illustrate the ability of the approach to help derive managerial insights.},

While teaching quality can be measured via student performance and teacher evaluation programs, the connection between research output and its antecedents is much harder to check, test, and understand. To inform research governance and policy-making at universities, we clarify the relationship between grant money and research performance. We examine the interdependence structure between third-party expenses, publications, citations, and academic age. To describe the relationship between these factors, we analyze individual-level data from a sample of professorships and a Scopus database from 2001 to 2015. Using estimates from a panel vector autoregressive model with exogenous variables, impulse response functions, and forecast error variance decomposition, we show that decision-making based on university-level data is inappropriate and does not reflect the behavior of individual faculties. Our results quantify the difference between the quality and quantity of research output, a better understanding of which is important to design incentive schemes and promotion programs. The paper also proposes a visualization of the cooperation between faculties and research interdisciplinarity via the co-authorship structure among publications.

  abstract     = {The multi-drop container loading problem (MDCLP) requires loading a truck so that boxes can be unloaded at each drop-off point without rearranging other boxes to deliver later. However, modeling such unloading constraints as hard constraints, as done in the literature, limits the flexibility to optimize the packing and utilize the vehicle capacity. We instead propose a more general approach that considers soft unloading constraints. Specifically, we penalize unnecessary relocations of boxes using penalty functions that depend on the volume and weight of the boxes to move as well as the type of move. Our goal is to maximize the value of the loaded cargo including penalties due to violations of the unloading constraints. We provide a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the MDCLP with soft unloading constraints, which can solve to optimality small-scale instances but is intractable for larger ones. We thus propose a heuristic framework based on a randomized extreme-point constructive phase and a subsequent improvement phase. The latter phase iteratively destroys regions in the packing space where high penalties originate, and reconstructs them. Extensive numerical experiments involving different instances and penalties highlight the advantages of our method compared to a commercial optimization solver and a heuristic from the literature developed for a related problem. They also show that our approach significantly outperforms: (i) the hard unloading constraints approach, and (ii) a sequential heuristic that neglects unloading constraints first and evaluates the penalties afterwards. Our findings underscore the relevance of accounting for soft unloading constraints in the MDCLP.},

  abstract     = {A stagewise decomposition algorithm called “value function gradient learning” (VFGL) is proposed for large-scale multistage stochastic convex programs. VFGL finds the parameter values that best fit the gradient of the value function within a given parametric family. Widely used decomposition algorithms for multistage stochastic programming, such as stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP), approximate the value function by adding linear subgradient cuts at each iteration. Although this approach has been successful for linear problems, nonlinear problems may suffer from the increasing size of each subproblem as the iteration proceeds. On the other hand, VFGL has a fixed number of parameters; thus, the size of the subproblems remains constant throughout the iteration. Furthermore, VFGL can learn the parameters by means of stochastic gradient descent, which means that it can be easil0y parallelized and does not require a scenario tree approximation of the underlying uncertainties. VFGL was compared with a deterministic equivalent formulation of the multistage stochastic programming problem and SDDP approaches for three illustrative examples: production planning, hydrothermal generation, and the lifetime financial planning problem. Numerical examples show that VFGL generates high-quality solutions and is computationally efficient.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study mid-cap companies, i.e. publicly traded companies with less than US$10 billion in market capitalisation. Using a large dataset of US mid-cap companies observed over 30 years, we look to predict the default probability term structure over the short to medium term and understand which data sources (i.e. fundamental, market or pricing data) contribute most to the default risk. Whereas existing methods typically require that data from different time periods are first aggregated and turned into cross-sectional features, we frame the problem as a multi-label panel data classification problem. To tackle it, we then employ transformer models, a state-of-the-art deep learning model emanating from the natural language processing domain. To make this approach suitable to the given credit risk setting, we use a loss function for multi-label classification, to deal with the term structure, and propose a multi-channel architecture with differential training that allows the model to use all input data efficiently. Our results show that the proposed deep learning architecture produces superior performance, resulting in a sizeable improvement in AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve) over traditional models. In order to interpret the model, we also demonstrate how to produce an importance ranking for the different data sources and their temporal relationships, using a Shapley approach for feature groups.},

  abstract     = {In group decision making, an adjustment mechanism is activated when individual decision information is evidently discrepant. This situation requires some decision makers (DMs) to revise their original judgments. This paper assumes that DMs are selfish, so none of them willingly adjust their initial judgments, and each always hopes any required adjustment will be as minimal. However, the egoism of the DMs may lead to the failure to reach a consensus. To cope with this issue, a fair and reasonable consensus adjustment mechanism is fundamental, one which can counteract the selfishness of DMs and promote consensus-reaching. To do this, we build a model to identify the minimum consensus adjustment of each DM, which relates to the root of the selfish dilemma. Then, we introduce the concept of selfish-dilemma consensus adjustment cooperative games, whose coalition payoffs are defined as the consensus adjustments that they have to undertake to avoid the selfish-dilemma. Furthermore, two payoff indices, the Shapley value and the nucleolus, are introduced for the minimum total consensus adjustment allocation, ensuring the DMs’ adjustments are as fair and reasonable as possible. Finally, a numerical example is offered, and a comparative analysis is made. This method is the first to focus on Pareto-optimal consensus adjustment allocation in a fair and efficient way.},

  abstract     = {We consider production technologies in which several parallel component processes are characterized by both component-specific and shared inputs and outputs. The recently developed multicomponent variable and constant returns-to-scale (MVRS and MCRS) models of such technologies are based on the assumption that we have no information about the actual allocation of the shared inputs and outputs to the component processes, which is a common scenario in many applications. The MVRS model treats each component process as a separate convex technology. The MCRS model additionally assumes that each process is a scalable technology. Both models account for the most conservative, or worst-case, allocation of the shared inputs and outputs to the individual processes, which does not require any knowledge of the actual allocation of such measures. In the current paper, we develop a new class of MVRS and MCRS models, by integrating a mechanism for the specification of lower and upper bounds on the proportions in which the shared inputs and outputs can be allocated to different component processes. We show that such bounds may be supported by data and generally lead to a larger model of technology and improved differentiation on efficiency. As an illustration, we discuss the application of the developed approach in the context of higher education.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic classification decision making is a crucial issue in management decision making and data mining, which is widely applied in different areas such as human-machine collaborative decision making, network intrusion detection, and traffic data stream mining. However, the existing strategies of static classification decision making are always unable to achieve desired outcomes in ill-structured domains, as the standard machine learning approaches mainly focus on static learning, which is not suitable to mine evolving dynamic data to support decision making. In addition, the main factors regarding incorrect classification predictions are also important for knowledge management and decision making, which is often ignored in many standard learning systems. Therefore, inspired by the idea of divide and conquer, we in this article propose a novel dynamic concept learning framework, namely granular concept-cognitive computing system (gC3S), for dynamic classification decision making by transforming instances into concepts. More specifically, to better characterize the process of dynamic classification decision making, we give the objective function of gC3S via mathematical programming theory. For management decision making, gC3S emphasizes tracing the corresponding approximate concepts via the incorrect classification predictions. Finally, we also apply gC3S to traffic data stream mining, and the experimental results on the different real-world situations further demonstrate that our approach is very effective for dynamic classification decision making.},

  abstract     = {In group decisions, the decision-makers’ judgements and preferences will inevitably conflict. These discrepancies are caused by differing mental models, and a cooperative, rational group can usually arrive at a correct decision by sharing these mental models and agreeing on the most convincing one. Acceptability analysis was introduced as a decision analysis tool in cases where input data is missing or ambiguous and is therefore represented by random variables. It computes a statistical index that describes each alternative’s performance. We present a new type of acceptability analysis for group decisions called Combinatorial Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (CMAA). CMAA is not itself a new decision method, but a framework to be used in conjunction with the decision method of choice. It generates combinations of user inputs, resulting in a discrete computational problem. CMAA identifies the issues where unshared mental models prevent consensus and yields detailed insights into the dependence of acceptability scores on individual user inputs. Information entropy is used to identify the discrepancies whose resolution will improve consensus most quickly, which supports an interactive consensus-building function for a facilitator. An example demonstrates the new analytical and consensus-building possibilities offered by the combinatorial approach.},

  abstract     = {TOPSIS is a popular approach to creating rankings of alternatives characterized by multiple criteria. Over the decades, numerous versions and modifications of the method have been proposed. Nevertheless, the core of TOPSIS, based on calculating and aggregating distances to ideal and anti-ideal alternatives, remains unchanged. This paper aims to describe the inner algebraic aspects of this core, revealing important dependencies between the calculated distances and the mean and standard deviation of the alternative. To visualize the effect of these dependencies on different TOPSIS aggregations, we introduce a new space based on the mean (M) and standard deviation (SD), called MSD-space. MSD-space is a practical tool for comparing aggregations and visualizing the effects that changes to the values of criteria can have on the resulting ratings of alternatives. The advantage of MSD-space is that it can always be successfully illustrated in a plane regardless of the number of criteria describing the alternatives. Using two case studies, we show how MSD-space can help visually compare aggregation functions and formulate improvement actions for selected alternatives. The revealed inner-workings of TOPSIS can be considered a step towards increasing the explainability of TOPSIS itself as well as other multi-criteria ranking methods.

The algorithm occasionally presents pairs of solutions to the DM and asks which one is preferred.

Inventory stockpiling makes upstream production less sensitive to demand shocks, which reduces the variance of upstream production relative to the variance of downstream sales and thus dampens the bullwhip effect. Since too much inventory stockpiling reduces expected supply chain profits, there is a limit to how much stockpiling there should be, and thus to how much the bullwhip effect should optimally be dampened. We demonstrate that, when demand shocks are not too persistent, 2PTs outperform linear wholesale prices by generating greater expected supply chain profit while also eliminating the bullwhip effect. 2PTs may still help to reduce the bullwhip effect even if demand shocks are very persistent, but supply chains should generally accept a certain degree of bullwhip in this case.},

  abstract     = {Mobile app development is a fast-growing industry, with Google Play and App Store being the two largest platforms, which provide app developers with a global audience. While each platform has its own captive app users, developers have the freedom to distribute their app via either a single platform or both. In the latter case, developers need to create two versions of the app, which differ in terms of their conformance quality (dictated by the platform), but share the same design quality (defined by the developer). We demonstrate that the cross-platform design quality results in a fee-allocation mechanism, according to which when one platform increases the developer&#39;s revenue share, it pushes the other platform to reduce the revenue share that it offers to the developer. The innovation of this work lies in considering the co-creation of app quality in a two-platform supply chain operating under a revenue-sharing contract. We analyze a stylized model with two asymmetric platforms, where the developer may be either profit-driven or market-expansion driven. In the former case, the inferior platform is at risk of losing the contract and therefore has to adjust it. Equilibrium analysis is provided for two market-power structures — balanced and imbalanced. Several counterintuitive properties of the equilibrium are obtained: (i) by becoming less efficient in the apps’ approval process, the platforms may coordinate the supply chain; (ii) an increase in the market size of a platform may degrade its profit; and (iii) a low price of the in-app product is not necessarily linked to a poor-quality app.},

In this paper, we present a systematic framework that aims to optimize imperfect maintenance policies for warranted products subject to stochastic performance degradation. We propose a novel objective-oriented imperfect repair scheme, and consider two scenarios corresponding to different types of products/systems. In the first one, warranties are claimed by customers in a random manner driven by performance degradation, whereas in the second one, the manufacturer offers periodic inspection services to customers and implements imperfect repairs if necessary. In both scenarios, we derive critical closed-form results to facilitate computation and optimization, from which managerial insights are gleaned. We find that (i) the randomness in customers’ claiming behaviors leads to remarkably more conservative warranty policies in which repairs are suggested to be more substantial; and (ii) the variable objective repair level in the imperfect repair exercise can effectively reduce the total maintenance cost over a finite warranty period. Overall, this work will equip practitioners with quantitative tools to prescribe optimal maintenance policies for warranted degrading products in various practical scenarios.},

This paper investigates the sourcing problem of an LM with brand premium in the presence of government subsidy and differences in labor costs. An LM faces three options: producing in-house, outsourcing to an original brand manufacturer (OBM, he), which sells competitive substitutes without brand premium, or outsourcing to a non-competing contract manufacturer (NCM). We find that, first, the LM chooses reshoring if the external benefit or brand premium is sufficiently high. Second, if the LM decides to outsource, she chooses the OBM (NCM) if her brand premium is high (low). Third, the government prefers to subsidize LM reshoring or outsourcing to an NCM. If the government intends to induce LM to reshore, the subsidy should be at a moderate level. Interestingly, when the LM has a low brand premium but chooses outsourcing, the government still subsidizes her to improve her competitiveness.},

As drones are limited in their payload, a combination of trucks and drones can be beneficial in reducing last-mile delivery costs. There are two different delivery methods that combine truck and drone delivery: trucks and drones collaborating with each other with drones launched from trucks, and trucks and drones serving customers independently of each other with drones launched from microdepots or the central distribution center. We develop a tactical planning model that decides on the cost-optimal vehicle fleet and the location of dedicated drone stations of a logistics service provider that minimizes total costs. The problem setting is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program that allows the assessment of benefits of different transport concepts as well as the impact of mixing different delivery modes. To solve larger instances we develop a specialized adaptive large neighborhood search. We present a numerical study for parcel delivery in a rural area where customers live in scattered settlements, e.g., villages or hamlets. The case study shows that it is best to launch drones both from trucks and dedicated drone stations in 58\% of all scenarios considered. This fleet mix leads to average cost savings of 33.3\% 33.3\% compared to an only truck scenario and 14.1\% 14.1\% if trucks and drones launched from trucks are considered for delivery.

  abstract     = {We study a make-to-order (MTO) supply chain that includes a manufacturer and its supplier, both of which are MTO firms. Once a manufacturer receives an order from a customer, the manufacturer orders needed parts from its supplier. The supplier can adjust its delivery of parts in terms of locations, batches, schedule, etc., to address the manufacturer’s delivery preference. Information sharing is required for the supplier to make a delivery adjustment. We model the problem as a multi-stage game between the supplier and the manufacturer to analyze their incentives to share information. We abstract the information to be shared as the supplier’s production load (downstream information sharing) and the manufacturer’s ideal delivery plan (upstream information sharing). We find that the supplier shares information if its production load is distributed over higher values. The manufacturer shares information if the supplier’s production load is low enough or if the distribution of production loads is less than a threshold – depending on whether the supplier shares information. We also show that the supplier can design a price ceiling mechanism to motivate upstream information sharing, and that a price ceiling increases the supply chain’s profit and yields equivalent customer welfare. Finally, we show how an outside option can provide a naturally formed price ceiling. Our results find the root cause why information sharing in a MTO supply chain is sometimes easy to achieve, and sometimes difficult. The insights from this research can be easily applied in other types of supply chains with similar structures.},

  abstract     = {In cutting processes, one of the strategies to reduce raw material waste is to generate leftovers that are large enough to return to stock for future use. The length of these leftovers is important since waste is expected to be minimal when cutting these objects in the future. However, in several situations, future demand is unknown and evaluating the best length for the leftovers is challenging. Furthermore, it may not be economically feasible to manage a stock of leftovers with multiple lengths that may not result in minimal waste when cut. In this paper, we approached the cutting stock problem with the possibility of generating leftovers as a two-stage stochastic program with recourse. We approximated the demand levels for the different items by employing a finite set of scenarios. Also, we modeled different decisions made before and after uncertainties were revealed. We proposed a mathematical model to represent this problem and developed a column generation approach to solve it. We ran computational experiments with randomly generated instances, considering a representative set of scenarios with a varying probability distribution. The results validated the efficiency of the proposed approach and allowed us to derive insights on the value of modeling and tackling uncertainty in this problem. Overall, the results showed that the cutting stock problem with usable leftovers benefits from a modeling approach based on sequential decision-making points and from explicitly considering uncertainty in the model and the solution method.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a distributionally robust optimization method is applied to the single machine scheduling with release dates. Based on the risk attitude of the decision maker, two distributionally robust optimization models are proposed, namely, the risk-neutral and risk-averse scheduling. The two models concern with the worst-case performance and the robust conditional value-at-risk with respect to the total flow time, respectively. Since the proposed robust optimization models are intractable in nature, we reformulate them as two separate mixed-integer linear programming models, which can then be solved via off-the-shelf solvers. Interestingly, it is proved that the mean absolute deviation can be ignored in the risk-neutral robust model. Thus a more succinct reformulation is constructed, which can be rapidly solved to optimum. Furthermore, extensive numerical experiments are performed with the stochastic programming model as a benchmark. And it is observed that the risk-averse model outperforms the others on both the average and worst-case metrics in most cases. Meanwhile, the risk-neutral model is more preferable on the average metric when the jobs are sparsely released.},

However, when these time-varying covariates are endogenous, there are two major problems: estimation bias of the survival model and lack of a prediction framework for future values of both the event and the endogenous time-varying covariates. Joint models for longitudinal and survival data is an appropriate framework to model the mutual evolution of the survival time and the endogenous time-varying covariates. To the best of our knowledge, this paper explores for the first time the application of discrete-time joint models to credit scoring. Moreover, we propose a novel extension to the joint model literature by including autoregressive terms in modelling the endogenous time-varying covariates. We present the method via simulations and by applying it to US mortgage loans. The empirical analysis shows, first, that discrete joint models can increase the discrimination performance compared to survival models. Second, when an autoregressive term is included, this performance can be further improved.},

  abstract     = {Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition (DWD) is a classical algorithm for solving large-scale linear programs whose constraint matrix involves a set of independent blocks coupled with a set of linking rows. The algorithm decomposes such a model into a master problem and a set of independent subproblems that can be solved in a distributed manner. In a typical implementation, the master problem is solved centrally. In certain settings, solving the master problem centrally is undesirable or infeasible, such as in the case of decentralized storage of data, or when independent agents who are responsible for the subproblems desire privacy of information. In this paper, we propose a fully distributed DWD algorithm which relies on solving the master problem using a consensus-based Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method. We derive error bounds on the optimality gap and feasibility violation of the proposed approach. We provide preliminary computational results for our algorithm using a Message Passing Interface implementation on a delivery planning problem, the multi-commodity network flow problem, and synthetic instances where we obtain high quality solutions.

This paper develops a multi-period, dynamic programming model that provides a retailer with an optimal portfolio of generic and branded bids. We model two critical aspects of consumer search behavior: (i) the spillover effect of generic searches leading to branded search arrivals in subsequent periods and (ii) the memory effect that leads to a decline of consumer awareness of a brand over time. We find that the retailer can effectively shuffle his investments on generic and branded keywords depending on several consumer parameters, e.g., awareness level, brand retention and reservation price variances. We develop a bidding policy framework to highlight the shift in bid shares from generic to branded at different levels of consumer awareness. We find that harnessing the benefits of spillover from generic to branded keywords allows the retailer to save on generic bids at higher awareness and retention levels and lower variance in consumers’ reservation prices. Further, we extend our model to different consumer purchase situations/ product classifications, viz., Convenience, Shopping and Specialty purchasing. Our analysis suggests prevalence of generic bids for certain purchase/product situations, whereas branded bids remain salient in other situations.},

We establish intuitive and desirable properties of these sensitivities and discuss advantageous choices of scoring functions leading to scale-invariant sensitivities. Since elicitable functionals typically possess rich classes of (strictly) consistent scoring functions, we demonstrate how Murphy diagrams can provide a picture of all score-based sensitivity measures. We discuss the family of score-based sensitivities for the mean functional (of which the Sobol indices are a special case) and risk functionals such as Value-at-Risk, and the pair Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. The sensitivity measures are illustrated using numerous examples, including the Ishigami–Homma test function.

  abstract     = {Kidney exchange programs (KEPs) represent an additional possibility of transplant for patients suffering from end-stage kidney disease. If a patient has a willing living donor with whom the patient is not compatible, the pair recipient–donor can join a pool of incompatible pairs and, if compatibility between recipient and donor in two or more pairs exists, organs can be exchanged between them. The problem can be modelled as an integer program that in general aims at finding the pairs that should be selected for transplant such that maximum number of transplants is performed. In this paper, we consider that for each recipient there may exist a preference order over the organs that he/she can receive, since a recipient may be compatible with several donors but the level of compatibility with the recipient might vary for different donors. Under this setting, the aim is to find the maximum cardinality stable exchange, a solution where no blocking cycle exists, i.e., there is no cycle such that all recipients prefer the donor in that cycle rather than that in the exchange. For this purpose we propose four novel integer programming models based on the well-known edge and cycle formulations, and also on the position-indexed formulation. These formulations are adjusted for both finding stable and strongly stable exchanges under strict preferences and for the case when ties in preferences may exist. Furthermore, we study a situation when the stability requirement can be relaxed by addressing the trade-off between maximum cardinality versus number of blocking cycles allowed in a solution. The effectiveness of the proposed models is assessed through extensive computational experiments on a wide set of instances. Results show that the cycle-edge and position-indexed formulations outperform the other two formulations. Another important practical outcome is that targeting strongly stable solutions has a much higher negative impact on the number of transplants (with an average reduction of up to 20\% for the bigger instances), when compared to stable solutions.},

This paper aims to structure and review the family of synchronization problems that arise in this environment: If multiple orders demanding the same SKU can be serviced jointly, then a more efficient picking process and a relief of the bin supply system can be achieved. This paper classifies the family of slightly varying synchronization problems arising with different workstation setups in alternative warehouses. This classification scheme is applied to analyze computational complexity, to systematically quantify the gains of alternative workstation setups, and to benchmark the performance gains of synchronization with those of other well-established decision tasks. Our results show that the right workstation setup can greatly improve throughput performance, so that the gains of synchronization can outreach those promised by other well-researched decision tasks.},

  abstract     = {The current study contributes to the literature in efficiency analysis in two ways: 1) we build on the existing studies in Dynamic Network Data Envelopment Analysis (DNDEA) by proposing a sequential structure incorporating dual-role characteristics of the production factors; 2) we initiate the efforts to complement the proposal of our innovative sequential DNDEA through a behavioural-causal analysis. The proposal of this statistical analysis is very important considering it does not only validate the proposal of the efficiency analysis but also our practice can be generalized to the future studies dealing with designing innovative production process. Finally, we apply these two different analyses to the banking industry. Using a sample of 43 Chinese commercial banks including five different ownership types (state-owned, joint-stock, city, rural, and foreign banks) between 2010 and 2018, we find that the inefficiency level is around 0.14, although slight volatility has been observed. We find that the highest efficiency is dominated by state-owned banks, and although foreign banks are less efficient than joint-stock banks, they are more efficient than city banks. Finally, we find that rural banks have the highest inefficiency.},

  abstract     = {A growing number of retailers, especially those with both online and offline channels, have developed “buy online and pick up in store” (BOPS) channels that offer a seamless shopping experience as a means to compete for consumers. Nevertheless, few studies have examined the impact of shipping fees borne by consumers in online channels on the adoption of BOPS channels by competing retailers. This paper builds a game-theoretic model to analyze the price and channel strategies of two retailers, considering the difference in shipping fees between their online channels. Each retailer chooses between operating online and offline channels separately or integrating the two channels to develop a BOPS channel. We first explore the optimal prices and find that if one retailer has a significant advantage in shipping fee, this retailer sets a lower price when both retailers choose the integration strategy than when both choose the separation strategy. Moreover, we identify the conditions corresponding to different equilibriums. Specifically, when the shipping fees in online channels are low enough, retailers tend to adopt the separation strategy. Nevertheless, the prisoner&#39;s dilemma may appear when retailers adopt the integration strategy without considering the similarity in the shipping fees of their online channels. Interestingly, when the unit cost of operating a BOPS channel is high enough, as the unit cost of operating a BOPS channel increases, so does the profit of the sole retailer adopting an integration strategy. Our results provide competing retailers with managerial insights on when implementing BOPS channels is beneficial to them.},

  abstract     = {Healthcare services are often provided by a large network of physicians and clinic facilities to patients with various levels of health conditions and preferences. Appointment scheduling is used to manage access to these services by matching patient demand with physician availability. This raises tremendous challenges for providers due to the heterogeneity in patient preference and physician availability. We propose a preference-based “nested” network model that consists of most practical operational constraints. Our model considers patients with varied priorities who can visit any clinic location and provider of their preference, and request the day and time of the appointment of their choice. The common challenges of patient no-show, cancellation, and uncertainty of physician availability are taken into account. We formulate this model as a Markov decision process and propose an approximate dynamic programming approach to provide robust scheduling policies. We also analyze the joint appointment scheduling and physician capacity planning problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program. The proposed scheduling policies maximize revenue and minimize physician overtime and idle time while satisfying patient preferences. These policies are shown to perform within a close bound to the best achievable policy. They are also robust under patient demand uncertainties. We highlight the importance of considering patient heterogeneity and preference as well as systematic uncertainties to provide an optimal set of appointments.},

  abstract     = {The benefit of the doubt (BoD) is a non-parametric weighting method that aims to maximize the relative composite indicator value of each decision-making unit (DMU). A well-known issue of BoD-based ranking of DMUs is the rank reversal problem when DMUs are deleted or added. The fundamental reason for rank reversals is that deleting (or adding) a DMU influences the generated weight by changing the frontier surface. To address the rank reversal problem, this paper proposes a subgroup dominance-based BoD model (SD-BoD). Based on the individual weights obtained from a classic BoD model, a dominance-based pairwise comparison mechanism is put forward to ensure comparability of different DMUs. Moreover, motivated by the data envelopment analysis idea, we construct a sequential frontier surface partition technique and establish a DMU ranking framework based on subgroup dominance, which helps reduce weight variation due to DMU addition or deletion. Finally, the effectiveness of the SD-BoD method is illustrated by comparing and analyzing the Human Development Indices of the 28 European regions.},

The conditions for dynamic pricing to benefit the retailer with quick response are discussed.

Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach in coping with market size uncertainty. The effects of the parameter values on the retailer optimal decisions and on the expected profit are further examined through sensitivity analyses.

Its probability is quantified via simulations for the four groups of the 2022/23 UEFA Nations League A under two well-established tie-breaking rules, goal difference and head-to-head records. In these home-away round-robin contests with four teams and 12 matches, the competitiveness of the final four games can be promoted by giving priority to goal difference, which reduces the chance of a fixed position in the group ranking by at least two and usually five percentage points in the last round. Our findings, supported by sensitivity analysis in a theoretical model, provide important lessons on how to design ranking systems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, coproduction technology has been developed and adopted by many third-party coproduct manufacturers (CMs). Coproducts made of leftover materials from traditional manufacturing are strongly attractive to green consumers who are willing to pay a price premium for environmental protection. However, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) might hesitate to adopt coproduction technology because the coproduct cannibalizes the sales of their traditional products. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretical model to investigate the economic and environmental implications of coproduction that can be leveraged by one OEM or one CM. We find that, from the OEM’s perspective, the dominant strategy can be OEM coproduction, CM coproduction, or No coproduction, which is contingent on the demand from green consumers and the supply of raw materials. We also find that the size of green consumers and the unit cost of raw materials have non-monotone impacts on the CM’s profit. Interestingly, an enlarging size of green consumers might hurt the CM, while an increasing cost of raw materials might benefit the CM. Although coproduction recovers the value of leftover materials, the adoption of coproduction technology increases the total material consumption and the total material waste when the unit cost of raw materials is sufficiently high, making the environment worse off.},

  abstract     = {Small businesses with many stocking locations face high ordering costs and imbalanced inventories. To address those challenges, we consider an inventory system of multiple retailers: each has Poisson demand and backorders are permitted. They order together periodically and there is an opportunity to transship available inventory between retailers in each order cycle. Each order incurs a fixed cost, and there is a variable transshipping cost, a holding cost for inventory, and a penalty cost for backorders. The system aims to determine a feasible ordering and transshipping plan which minimizes the long-run average total cost over time. We provide an analytical approach to evaluating costs, construct bounds to search for the optimal order interval, order-up-to level, and timing of transshipment, and determine the amounts to transship based on a marginal cost. Our numerical studies find that, first, the optimal order interval is between that in the no-transshipment case and an EOQ-like calculation. Second, the optimal timing of transshipments is in the middle of an order cycle or a little later. Third, the optimal order interval and timing of transshipments are insensitive to the introduction of differences between retailers. Fourth, transshipment effectively reduces costs, especially when transshipment costs are low or different between retailers. These findings can simplify the task of cost optimization in complex inventory systems and develop practical measures to further reduce costs.},

  abstract     = {Today, e-commerce retailers commonly operate in a dual-channel mode. Return freight insurance (RFI) is an emerging measure to resolve online shopping disputes with product returns. If a consumer returns an insured product, the insurance company will compensate the consumer for the return-freight fee. In practice, we observe that some dual-channel e-commerce retailers offer RFI to consumers, while others do not. We build consumer-utility-based analytical models to study the retailer&#39;s optimal pricing decisions and values of RFI. In the basic models, the proportions of store-type consumers and online-type consumers are exogenously given; we examine three cases, namely Case N (RFIs are not provided), Case R (retailer purchases RFI for consumers), and Case C (consumers pay for RFI). Comparing these three cases, we uncover that the retailer who purchases RFI for consumers does not necessarily charge a higher price. We show that if the RFI premium is sufficiently (moderately) low, it is more beneficial for consumers (the retailer) to pay for the RFI. We analytically prove that (i) when the product&#39;s salvage value is polarized or the return freight cost is low, using RFI can help increase consumer surplus (CS), (ii) when the salvage value is sufficiently high, the social welfare (SW) with RFI is higher than the case without RFI. In the extended models, we explore the situation in which consumers can decide whether to purchase RFI as well as the channel to buy the products. In this case, we find that (i) the retailer should provide RFI only when the product&#39;s cost, salvage value, and return freight cost are all high, and (ii) offering RFI can increase CS but hurt SW. We also consider various extended models to prove the robustness of the research findings.},

  abstract     = {Many stockpiled personnel protective equipment (PPE) were of no use during COVID-19 because they have expired. The need for rethinking past approaches of building PPE stockpiles without planning for their timely rotation has become clear. We develop a game-theoretic pandemic preparedness model for single and multiple PPE products for a budget-constrained governmental organization (GO) supplied by a manufacturer. The GO maximizes preparedness, measured by the service rate of PPE, whereas the manufacturer maximizes profit. The manufacturer supplies the PPE stockpile in the first year. Thereafter, the manufacturer buys back a quantity of older PPE from the GO annually and sells the GO the same quantity of new PPE. The manufacturer sells older PPE in the market place. We find that this approach induces the manufacturer to rotate inventory in the stockpile. Joint determination of the stockpile size and its rotation results in no waste from expired PPE and is better than separately determining the stockpile size and then determining how to rotate it. Using insights from the single PPE model, we examine the optimal budget allocation among multiple PPE products. We also consider the effect of spot market prices of PPE during a pandemic on the optimal stockpile sizes. We find that spot market prices of PPE can have a significant effect on the optimal stockpile sizes. We examine the performance of the proposed approach in a manufacturers-distributor-GO supply chain and with an option for the GO to invest in the manufacturer’s volume flexibility and show its effectiveness.},

They also have great potential for the 3D printing (3DP) industry, offering users the choice between owning or renting 3DP capacity. For matching supply and demand, capacity pricing is crucial. In this paper we consider two fundamental questions concerning pricing: (i) What is the optimal pricing strategy for a 3DP capacity sharing platform? (ii) How do usage level and printer heterogeneity affect consumers’ choice between in-house printing (owning) and outsourcing (renting)? Using queuing analysis, we derive the structural properties of the solutions to the problems. Furthermore, we conduct numerical studies using real-world data to generate managerial insights from the analytical findings. A key finding is that governments should focus on encouraging technological progress to lower the printers’ prices in order to improve the well-being of the industry. When considering two types of printers, we find that it is more beneficial for the platform if the high capacity printer dominates the market, as the platform then retains the prominent role in “redistributing” the 3DP capacity.},

  abstract     = {Despite improvements in statistical forecasting, human judgment remains fundamental to business forecasting and demand planning. Typically, forecasters do not rely solely on statistical forecasts; they also adjust forecasts according to their knowledge, experience, and information that is not available to statistical models. However, we have limited understanding of the adjustment mechanisms employed, particularly how people use additional information (e.g., special events and promotions, weather, holidays) and under which conditions this is beneficial. Using a multi-method approach, we first analyse a UK retailer case study exploring its operations and the forecasting process. The case study provides a contextual setting for the laboratory experiments that simulate a typical supply chain forecasting process. In the experimental study, we provide past sales, statistical forecasts (using baseline and promotional models) and qualitative information about past and future promotional periods. We include contextual information, with and without predictive value, that allows us to investigate whether forecasters can filter such information correctly. We find that when adjusting, forecasters tend to focus on model-based anchors, such as the last promotional uplift and the current statistical forecast, ignoring past baseline promotional values and additional information about previous promotions. The impact of contextual statements for the forecasting period depends on the type of statistical predictions provided: when a promotional forecasting model is presented, people tend to misinterpret the provided information and over-adjust, harming accuracy.},

  abstract     = {We study the horizontal benefits of product recall (PR) insurance by considering a Bertrand competition with financially constrained suppliers. In the model, two suppliers produce homogeneous products and a buyer purchases from whoever offers the lowest price. Product’s quality is random and defective products would cause a product recall associated with a random recall cost for the faulty supplier. We find that PR insurance eases the suppliers’ financial constraints by reducing their external financing costs and intensifies the price competition. Interestingly, the more intensified price competition may not lead to lower profits for both suppliers. PR insurance enables the suppliers to use financial constraints more efficiently by charging higher prices and improve their profits. We also reveal how asymmetric financial capacities and production costs affect the role of the PR insurance in the price competition. PR insurance restrains the predation effect caused by the financial advantage. However, when the suppliers’ financial capacities are sufficiently high, PR insurance strengthens the predation effect initiated by the cost advantage. Finally, we conduct a numerical study with exponential and Pareto distributions.},

  abstract     = {Irregular demand in retail is characterized by stock keeping units (SKUs) that present high intermittency, and simultaneously, high erraticness (classified as lumpy demand) or low erraticness (classified as intermittent demand), following the classification of Syntetos et al. (2005). These SKUs are basically defined by periods of zero sales interleaved with positive sales producing series with some degree of variability. Many SKUs at the store/daily level can be characterized as presenting such a type of demand. Therefore methods for adequately forecasting irregular time series are necessary for proper inventory management. This article derives models for intermittent and lumpy time series using the framework of score-driven models as developed by Creal et al. (2013) and Harvey (2013). More precisely we derive Poisson, negative binomial, hurdle Poisson, and hurdle negative binomial models and apply them to real data obtained from a large Brazilian retail chain, comparing the performance of the proposed models to adequate competing methods from the ‘slow’/intermittent demand forecasting literature. Forecasting accuracy is evaluated based on point forecasts and the entire predictive distribution. Our results show that the score-driven models perform well compared to intermittent traditional forecasting methods, providing competitive forecasting models for irregular demand in retailing.},

Reducing the release of GHG emissions is becoming a thematic research topic in many research disciplines. In the reliability research community, there are research papers relating to reliability and maintenance for systems in power generation farms such as offshore farms. Nevertheless, there is sparse research that aims to optimise maintenance policies for reducing the GHG emissions from systems such as automotive vehicles or building service systems. To fill up this gap, this paper optimises replacement policies for systems that age and degrade and that produce GHG emissions (i.e., exhaust emissions) including the initial manufacturing GHG emissions produced during the manufacturing stage and the emissions generated during the operational stage. Both the exhaust emissions process and the failure process are considered as functions of two time scales (i.e., age and accumulated usage), respectively. Other factors that may affect the two processes such as ambient temperature and road conditions are depicted as random effects. Under these settings, the decision problem is a nonlinear programming problem subject to several constraints. Replacement policies are then developed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the proposed methods.},

The supply chain with platform-based retailing is faced with choice of sales formats and marketing decisions. We establish live streaming selling models with two sales formats of resale and agency sale, and three pricing strategies of same high, same low and differential strategies (HH, LL and D). We further explore the impacts of consumer returns, as they are typically higher in live streaming selling. Conventional wisdom believes that agency sale format can reduce double marginalization and benefit both the platform and the supplier, which cannot be achieved in resale format. Interestingly, our study shows that resale format may become a better choice for both the platform and the supplier when considering the impacts of consumer returns. This result holds in pricing strategies HH and D, where the key driver of sales format choice in strategy HH is commission rate while it is consumer&#39;s low valuation in strategy D. In strategy LL, resale is the supplier&#39;s preferred format and agency sale is better for the platform. Furthermore, we find with agency sale format, equilibrium pricing strategies HH and LL always exist; while with the resale format, equilibrium strategy HH exists only when considering consumer returns. Finally, we discuss the hybrid sales formats with and without price competition, and extend our models to encompass more scenarios.},

Considering the uncertainty of actual arrival time and departure time of flights, a two-stage optimization model for flight on-time service rate and service delay time is proposed in this paper. At the first stage, a capacity network with four types of nodes and five types of arcs is constructed. By setting appropriate arc capacity and cost parameters, a programming model based on the minimum cost flow is constructed to optimize the number of flights that can be served on time by a limited number of ferry vehicles. At the second stage, a new capacity network and a time-space network combined with a heuristic algorithm are constructed, and integer linear programming models are proposed to optimize the delay time of unserved flights in the first stage. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified by flight data from Beijing Capital International Airport and further analysis is carried out. This study can provide a decision-making reference for the scheduling optimization of airport ferry vehicles.},

The present study constructs an optimal control model to investigate how to incentivize logistics service providers’ efforts to preserve product freshness during transport. The freshness level constantly evolves, unobservable and unverifiable, and thus cannot be explicitly specified in the contract. We study a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a retailer and a logistics service provider. Our research aims to design a menu of contracts that will induce the logistics service provider to pick the actions desired by the retailer in the absence of information on product freshness. The results suggest that a flexible revenue-sharing policy is preferable, as it increases alignment on the target of delivering fresh products. It essentially coordinates the supply chain regardless of whether the retailer has sufficient oligopoly power to dictate sales prices. In contrast, a simple transfer payment contract and fixed lump-sum bonus policy are also useful for aligning the freshness-keeping action, but they rely on the retailer’s sufficient oligopoly power. The findings have managerial significance in decreasing the occurrence of customer complaints about product freshness. Retailers may be able to predict the regions that can offer a freshness guarantee.},

In this context, municipalities and logistics service providers aim towards sustainable and profitable city logistics, which are often conflicting goals. Whether to use single-echelon or two-echelon systems with micro-depots and city freighters as well as quantifying the benefits of shipment consolidation between independent providers under different system designs are unanswered questions in academia and practice. We provide a general methodological framework based on continuous approximation theory to study the design of city logistics networks with multiple logistics service providers that choose transportation strategies, each defined by a network structure and specific transportation modes. We provide analytical results on the comparison of different transportation strategies. By providing thresholds on the benefit of consolidated systems, we analytically quantify shipment consolidation effects in city centers. We then embed this continuous approximation into a mixed-integer non-linear program and study parameter sensitivities for a real-world case study. Our results show that higher customer density and longer distances between depots and distribution areas promote 2-tier transportation strategies. Consolidation between logistics service providers allows for emission reductions independent of the transportation strategy and correlate with cost reductions up to 50\% on the lower echelon. Outsourcing promotes 2-tier last-mile deliveries with city freighters and in a city with heterogeneous districts, it is beneficial to use a hybrid network that includes both single- and two-echelon strategies using multiple transportation modes for different demand classes.},

From the need of intertwining location decisions in discrete and in continuous sets, a general hybridized problem is considered in which some types of facilities are to be located in finite sets and the others in continuous normed spaces. A natural non-linear model is proposed for which an integer linear programming reformulation is derived. A branch-and-cut algorithm is developed for better tackling the problem. The study proceeds considering the particular case in which the continuous facilities are to be located in the Euclidean plane. In this case, by taking advantage from some geometrical properties it is possible to propose an alternative integer linear programming model. The results of an extensive battery of computational experiments performed to assess the methodological contribution of this work is reported. Apart from a synthetic dataset, the different approaches are tested on a real geographical and demographic data with up to 920 demand nodes.},

  abstract     = {A fortification game (FG) is a three-level, two-player hierarchical game, also known as defender-attacker-defender game, in which at the uppermost level, the defender selects some assets to be protected from potential malicious attacks. At the middle level, the attacker solves an interdiction game by depreciating unprotected assets, i.e., reducing the values of such assets for the defender, while at the innermost level the defender solves a recourse problem over the surviving or partially damaged assets. Fortification games have applications in various important areas, such as military operations, design of survivable networks, protection of facilities or power grid protection. In this work, we present an exact solution algorithm for FGs, in which the recourse problems correspond to (possibly NP-hard) combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm is based on a new generic mixed-integer linear programming reformulation in the natural space of fortification variables. Our new model makes use of fortification cuts that measure the contribution of a given fortification strategy to the objective function value. These cuts are generated when needed by solving separation problems, which correspond to (modified) middle-level interdiction games. We design a branch-and-cut-based solution algorithm based on fortification cuts, their strengthened versions and other speed-up techniques. We present a computational study using the knapsack fortification game and the shortest path fortification game. For the latter one, we include a comparison with a state-of-the-art solution method from the literature. Our algorithm outperforms this method and allows us to solve previously unsolved instances with up to 330 386 nodes and 1 202 458 arcs to optimality.},

  abstract     = {Given a graph, the maximum clique problem (MCP) asks for determining a complete subgraph with the largest possible number of vertices. We propose a new exact algorithm, called CliSAT , to solve the MCP to proven optimality. This problem is of fundamental importance in graph theory and combinatorial optimization due to its practical relevance for a wide range of applications. The newly developed exact approach is a combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm that exploits the state-of-the-art branching scheme enhanced by two new bounding techniques with the goal of reducing the branching tree. The first one is based on graph colouring procedures and partial maximum satisfiability problems arising in the branching scheme. The second one is a filtering phase based on constraint programming and domain propagation techniques. CliSAT is designed for structured MCP instances which are computationally difficult to solve since they are dense and contain many interconnected large cliques. Extensive experiments on hard benchmark instances, as well as new hard instances arising from different applications, show that CliSAT outperforms the state-of-the-art MCP algorithms, in some cases by several orders of magnitude.},

First, we show that the PANSC value is the only one satisfying efficiency and weak balanced externalities, the last axiom requiring that every player’s payoff is the same fraction of the total externality inflicted on the other players with her presence. This is a weakening of balanced externalities studied in the context of queueing problems to characterize the Shapley value. Our second characterization is obtained by investigating the dual relation between the PANSC value and the proportional division value, showing that the PANSC value is the only one satisfying complement consistency and dual proportional standardness. In addition, we discuss the relation between the PANSC value and two methods widely used in cost allocation problems: the separable costs remaining benefits method and the alternative cost avoided method.},

We show that our strategies can be derived under different utility functions and multifactor model assumptions. We prove that the probability measure varies with the utility function choice and that the logarithmic utility, in particular, results in an intuitive probability hedge under the physical measure. This makes it easier to communicate, without putting at risk the financial advice conducted by potentially misrepresenting the realism of the theoretical results.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of the share of energy generated via renewable sources highly challenges grid stability. Flexibility is key to balance the electricity supply and demand. As a relatively new player in the energy market, the Energy Storage System (ESS) is capable of providing such flexibility, acting as both a consumer and producer. Since the Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Union requires ESSs to be operated by an independent market player, ESSs are becoming an important player in different electricity markets. Crucially, it is difficult for, e.g., market-monitoring authorities, to compare the bid cost functions to the true opportunity costs of an ESS. Motivated by this, in this paper we elaborate on the potential of an ESS to exercise market power in a liberalized electricity market. In particular, we analyze how a monopolistic ESS operator may influence short-run market outcomes, e.g., prices and system costs, depending on different market designs including a nodal, a zonal, and a uniform pricing system. For this purpose, we propose a four-stage Stackelberg game where the monopolistic ESS operator first decides on its day-ahead market bids (level 1), followed by day-ahead market clearing (level 2), after which the ESS submits bids to the real-time balancing market (level 3), which is then cleared (level 4). Relying on a widely used case study, we illustrate that some market designs may be more favorable for the ESS operator, whereas other ones may be more attractive from the regulator’s point of view of minimizing the overall system costs.},

  abstract     = {For providers to stay competitive in a context of continued growth in e-retail sales and increasing customer expectations, same-day delivery options have become very important. Typically, with same-day delivery, customers purchase online and expect to receive their ordered goods within a narrow delivery time span. Providers thus experience substantial operational challenges to run profitable tours and generate sufficiently high contribution margins to cover overhead costs. We address these challenges by combining a demand-management approach with an online tour-planning approach for same-day delivery. More precisely, in order to reserve capacity for high-value customer orders and to guide customer choices toward efficient delivery operations, we propose a demand-management approach that explicitly optimizes the combination of delivery spans and prices which are presented to each incoming customer request. The approach includes an anticipatory sample-scenario based value approximation, which incorporates a direct online tour-planning heuristic. It does not require extensive offline learning and is scalable to realistically sized instances with multiple vehicles. In a comprehensive computational study, we show that our anticipatory approach can improve the contribution margin by up to 50\% compared to a myopic benchmark approach. We also show that solving an explicit pricing optimization problem is a beneficial component of our approach. More precisely, it outperforms both a pure availability control and a simple pricing rule based on opportunity costs. The latter idea is one used in other approaches for related dynamic pricing problems dealt with in the literature.},

We report experiences from deploying multiple operations research (OR) methods in a real decision-making setting and discuss the insights gained from this process. The applied methods were Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT), the project portfolio selection tool Your Own Decision Aid (YODA) and Robust Portfolio Modelling (RPM). The methods were applied in a portfolio case evaluating three peatland rewetting options (“No action”, “Restoration”, “Damming”) for 79 drained peatland stands in an important recreational and nature conservation area in southern Finland. The pros and cons of the methods were evaluated, as well as their key methodological challenges, in a participatory environmental portfolio case. The applied methods yielded similar results in terms of the superiority of rewetting options. The strength of MAVT was its ability to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of all three rewetting options for a single peatland stand. YODA&#39;s strength was its simplicity and the possibility to apply it independently via the Internet. RPM made it possible to determine the priority of peatland stands within constraints, even without precise preference information. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic evaluation of three methods representing different ‘method categories’ (MAVT, multi-criteria elimination, portfolio decision analysis) applied to a real environmental problem.},

The methodology is applied to needs arising from the field of Arctic maritime safety and security, in order to provide a roadmap for an ongoing multi-national European Union (EU) funded research project. A needs hierarchy containing topics, needs and sub-needs is first formed by utilization of multiple sources including facilitated stakeholder workshops, literature review and semi-structured questionnaires. A further round of stakeholder opinion is then sought in order to ascertain the importance and level of challenge involved in solving each identified sub-need. This information is utilized to form a PICK (Possible, Implement, Challenge, Keep Back) chart in order to visualize and categorize the sub-needs. A goal programming knapsack model is formulated to select a set of priority needs that satisfy goals relating to the maximization of overall importance, the balance between topics at the first level of the need hierarchy and the balance between more challenge (for longer term research) and implement (for shorter term implementation) needs. Sensitivity analysis is conducted around the number of chosen projects and the goal programming weights. Conclusions are hence drawn with respect to the methodology and the Arctic maritime safety and security field of application.},

  abstract     = {Even for sports leagues with a small number of teams, the construction of a round-robin timetable taking into account various constraints, e.g., venue availability or travel distance, can be challenging. It is therefore common to decompose the problem with the first-break-then-schedule approach, which first decides when teams play home or away after which it determines a compatible assignment of opponents. When there are more time slots than games per team, so-called relaxed timetables, an alternative is the first-day-off-then-schedule approach which starts by deciding when teams receive a day of rest. Despite the popularity of these approaches, a major unsolved question is how to efficiently backtrack between the different phases of the algorithm. Moreover, existing backtracking schemes can only cope with a very limited set of timetable requirements. The main contribution of this paper is to show how traditional Benders’ decomposition relates to the aforementioned approaches, and how Benders’ cuts can be used to organize backtracking. To show the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed framework, we construct compact timetables that minimize the total number of travel trips, and relaxed timetables that either balance the games over the season or minimize the total differences in rest time of opposing teams. Furthermore, we discuss the quality of the obtained Benders’ cuts and strengthen integer programming formulations from the literature to construct relaxed round-robin timetables.},

With Latour, we can say that there are no “separate chambers” in which facts (i.e., the use of public resources, different time horizons) and values (i.e., the values of different stakeholders, the legitimacy of public decisions) are discussed; rather, all these aspects are considered together in a cycle that encompasses them, progressively expanding and contracting to arrive at a tangible result: a decision. In the paper we illustrate the transposition of the concept of this cycle in our multi-methodology, the proposal of the combination of the Strategic Choice Approach (SCA) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP)—which is absent in the literature—and we then empirically test this theoretical contribution with a case study, the repurposing of a former hospital in Italy.},

Imposing an exact equality onn the bundles’ monetary values may produce unacceptable solutions. I drop the tight requirement and suggest a procedure in which the differences in the monetary values are explained in terms of satisfaction per monetary share as perceived by the agents. A robustness study shows the consequences of misspecification in the model parameters.},

We focus on two tractable fairness concepts: envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and proportionality up to one item (PROP1). We consider two computational problems: (1) Among the utilitarian-maximal allocations, decide whether there exists one that is also fair; (2) among the fair allocations, compute one that maximizes the utilitarian welfare. We show that both problems are strongly NP-hard when the number of agents is variable, and remain NP-hard for a fixed number of agents greater than two. For the special case of two agents, we find that problem (1) is polynomial-time solvable, while problem (2) remains NP-hard. Finally, with a fixed number of agents, we design pseudopolynomial-time algorithms for both problems. We extend our results to the stronger fairness notions envy-freeness up to any item (EFx) and proportionality up to any item (PROPx).},

  abstract     = {Access to adequate working capital is often a challenge for SMEs, especially if SME faces the risk of an uncertain yield. We identify conditions under which a strong buyer should either offer “backing” or guarantee for the purchase-order finance for a cash-constrained, risky SME supplier, or end the relationship. By offering a backing, buyer shares the default risk faced by the bank, in order to keep the SME supplier in business. To identify the possible benefits of this scheme, we compare the buyer’s operational and financial decisions under three financing mechanisms: buyer-backed purchase order financing, purchase order financing with no backing and purchase order financing with a fixed buyer-backing. The non-linear optimization problem is solved using KKT optimality conditions and sufficiency is established through invexity. We perform numerical experiments for all the models for different levels of yield risks of the supplier. We are able to separate conditions to suggest when (1) no backing is required; (2) when backing should be offered to sustain the supplier, and (3) when an alternative supplier should be located. We find that backing has the following benefits: buyer can use backing as a substitute to higher purchase price; it helps the supplier to stay operative till a higher shock level; shared risk of default leads the bank to offer financing at a lower rate; finally resulting in consistently higher buyer profits despite the added risk. The separation condition as described above can also be used by managers to compare two suppliers.},

The standard GS (S-GS) model employs safety stock as the only countermeasure to satisfy a specified demand bound, assuming any demand in excess of the bound will be addressed by countermeasures which are not modeled. We extend the S-GS model to explicitly include expediting as a second countermeasure. Thus, our two-countermeasure GS (2C-GS) formulation addresses more demand variability explicitly than the S-GS model. We characterize a stage’s optimal base-stock level as the maximum of two base-stock calculations, and show how the resulting optimization problem can be efficiently solved using existing GS solution techniques. For normally distributed demand, we analytically characterize when the S- and 2C-GS approaches deploy different configurations of safety stock. For a series of numerical experiments, we find that the 2C-GS model places safety stocks at more stages than the S-GS model. When compared to the 2C-GS solution, the suggested safety stock positioning of the S-GS approach results in an average cost increase of 7\%, and a maximum of 42\%, in real-world supply chain settings. Furthermore, the benefits from expediting increase when downstream stages have greater expediting capability.},

  abstract     = {Consumer multihoming behaviour challenges the sponsored data business model initiated by internet service providers (ISPs) associated with content providers (CPs). Different from data subsidization research which focuses on the CPs having no exclusive content and consumer exhibiting only single-homing behaviour, we explore the interplay between a monopolistic ISP and two competing CPs in the presence of consumer multihoming behaviour. We capture the effect of CPs’ differences in operational characteristics (e.g., exclusive content and revenue rate) on the ISP&#39;s data plan, CPs’ subsidy regime, and consumer multihoming behaviour. We develop a game-theoretical model with an ISP and two competing content providers (CPs) offering overlapping (i.e., non-exclusive) content and exclusive content to consumers who may have multihoming behaviour. The monopolist ISP designs its data plans by providing the subsidy options for neither, one, or both CPs (represented as strategies N, O, and B), and it announces a usage-based per-packet price. In response, the involved CPs decide the subsidy regime, based on which consumers choose between single-homing and multihoming. We find that the CPs’ exclusive content popularity and revenue rate are critical considerations for the ISP in designing the data plans. Only when the revenue rate is high will the ISP allow both CPs to subsidize data; otherwise, it prefers strategy N for high exclusive content (i.e., when a large amount of exclusive content) but strategy O for low exclusive content. For CPs, strategy O induces consumers to choose multihoming when the exclusive content is high, and strategy B further stimulates some consumers to switch from single-homing to multihoming for a high revenue rate. Interestingly, the subsidy amount is not affected by the revenue rate in strategy O after the revenue rate exceeds a threshold. Moreover, we identify conditions under which the ISP&#39;s data plan promotes the consumer surplus and social welfare. Our study sheds light on the influence of consumer multihoming behaviour on the co-opetition in the streaming industry. It provides insights for ISPs and CPs in the recent debate on the effect of sponsored data on consumer surplus and social welfare.},

  abstract     = {Different retail and e-commerce companies are facing the challenge of assembling large numbers of time-critical picking orders that include both small-line and multi-line orders. To reduce unproductive picker working time as in traditional picker-to-parts warehousing systems, different solutions are proposed in the literature and in practice. For example, in a mixed-shelves storage policy, items of the same stock keeping unit are spread over several shelves in a warehouse; or automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are used to transport the picked items from the storage area to packing stations instead of human pickers. This is the first paper to combine both solutions, creating what we call AGV-assisted mixed-shelves picking systems . We model the new integrated order batching and routing problem in such systems as an extended multi-depot vehicle routing problem with both three-index and two-commodity network flow formulations. Due to the complexity of the integrated problem, we develop a novel variable neighborhood search algorithm to solve the integrated problem more efficiently. We test our methods with different sizes of instances, and conclude that the mixed-shelves storage policy is more suitable than the usual storage policy in AGV-assisted mixed-shelves systems for orders with different sizes of order lines (saving up to 62\% on driving distances for AGVs). Our variable neighborhood search algorithm provides optimal solutions within an acceptable computational time.},

  abstract     = {The business of two-sided platforms, such as those used for online ride-sharing, has expanded rapidly thanks to opportunities to efficiently match supply- and demand-side users. However, the development of these platforms faces the challenge of complying with corporate social responsibility (CSR) regulations, particularly on the supply side of two-sided platforms. How to improve CSR investment, in order to reduce CSR violations while ensuring profitability, is now an important question. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model for a two-sided platform and analyze the impacts of network externalities (including customer network externality and provider network externality) and risk aversion on CSR investment decision-making. The analytical results show that, contrary to our intuition, greater network externalities do not necessarily stimulate the platform to invest in CSR. When the strength of customer network externality is high, investment in CSR may have a “dilution effect”, i.e., CSR investment may reduce the platform&#39;s number of users and profit. Conversely, risk aversion always has an “incentive effect” on CSR investment, thereby increasing the platform&#39;s willingness to invest in CSR. Second, both provider and customer network externalities will increase the platform&#39;s prices. Interestingly, when the strength of customer network externality is high, the platform attracts more customers, even at high prices. Finally, our analysis indicates that risk aversion may reduce customer surplus when the strength of customer network externality is high. This result contradicts the initial expectation that risk aversion inspires platforms to invest in CSR, thereby improving customer utility and customer surplus.},

Decision-making is decentralized and the supply chain operates with a simple linear wholesale price contract. We employ a game theoretic model in which the manufacturer is a Stackelberg leader. Although fresh product supply chains are ubiquitous in the marketplace, academic guidance is limited, particularly in the context of data sharing and when price is determined endogenously. Our analysis shows that although data sharing helps to improve product freshness and reduce waste, sufficiently improved product freshness is the key for both suppliers and retailers to benefit financially. Otherwise, either party or the entire supply chain can be worse off. We demonstrate that data sharing is most valuable when product is somewhat perishable and demand is volatile. For highly perishable or non-perishable products, the manufacturer benefits but the retailer is harmed. Our results suggest that the drivers that motivate retailers to share inventory data in a fresh product supply chain are distinct from extant knowledge. The results provide insight into strategies that not only improve both parties’ performance, but also reduce food waste at the same time.},

This paper addresses the problem of jointly optimising TC demurrage policy and TC flow, in the face of uncertain TC maintenance times, to maximise profits. A progressive hedging algorithm with expanded time-space network (PHA-ETSN) is designed to tackle this tactical level optimisation problem as other established techniques struggle with this optimisation in terms of computational time and memory requirements. Experiments are performed to illustrate how the optimisation tool can be used to investigate how demurrage policy affects different operational costs and TC hire revenue and thereby profit. These experiments demonstrate how the optimisation tool can be used by managers not only to optimise demurrage policy but also to explore and to understand more deeply the costs and profits in their operations.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a last-mile logistics delivery system which makes use of multiple localised storage depots and multi-modal delivery options. Multiple localised storage depots facilitate express and instant delivery services. Multi-modal delivery allows for use of alternative green vehicle types for performing deliveries where there may also be vehicle access restrictions. Additionally, when demand density is sufficiently high and parcel sizes small, utilising alternative delivery modes, such as electric cargo bike and porters, can be cost effective in their own right. The proposed model allows for vehicles to rendezvous at kerbside locations (mobile satellites) where parcels can be transferred between vehicles, a feature that is shown to reduce depot stem costs. For the purpose of generality and the potential for higher quality solutions, no fixed echelon or hierarchical structure is placed on the sequence of vehicles transporting any parcel, that is, the problem is one of variable-echelon. The last-mile delivery system described in the paper gives rise to a multi-modal delivery problem using a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles and with synchronisation constraints. The paper presents a mathematical formulation of the problem and a heuristic algorithm. Computational results are presented that validate the mathematical model and the heuristic on a set of benchmark instances, some of which are based on the literature. The paper also describes a new set of benchmark instances derived from real sales data in London, whose results demonstrate potential benefits from using the proposed delivery concept.},

When they occur, freight companies evaluate their effects on freightage in the pipeline and take the appropriate recovery actions by balancing customer service levels and increases in fuel consumption while accounting for environmental impact (greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions). The paper, therefore, develops an integrated mixed-integer programming problem (MIPP) that jointly minimizes the total voyage and transshipment costs and penalty charges for emitting GHG excess amounts beyond what is allowed. It does so by recovering a pre-established schedule of disrupted containerships. The solution to the MIPP suggests how to reconfigure the liner shipping network when skipping one or more call ports and determines the optimal velocity on assigned routes. The paper also develops and proposes a new and efficient algorithm based on the Crowd-Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (CLPSO) to solve this large-scale problem and shows the CLPSO to be superior to the potential ones in the literature. Computational experiments, based on data from a maritime shipping company, demonstrate the effectiveness of both the MIPP and CLPSO using several comparative metrics with suitable assumptions.

  abstract     = {The material handling systems used in warehouses involve important operations such as the usage of order picker forklifts. These order picker forklifts provide efficient utilization of the storage space by their ability in moving in narrow aisles and picking items from high level racks. Routing the order picker forklifts to pick ordered items belongs to the operational decision level and is done in high frequency. Therefore, finding an energy-efficient route for an order picker forklift can yield significant savings in the energy consumption in warehouses and the resulting CO 2 2 emission. In this paper, we introduce and study the energy minimizing order picker forklift routing problem (EMFRP) which aims to find an energy-efficient route for an order picker forklift to pick a given list of items. To our knowledge, this is the first study that considers the order picker forklifts in the context of the order picking problem. We calculate the forklift’s energy consumption in both horizontal and vertical moves considering the effects of friction forces, the acceleration and deceleration of the forklift, and its load. A mixed integer programming formulation and a dynamic programming approach are developed to solve small size instances of the EMFRP exactly. To solve larger instances, we provide tour construction and tour improvement heuristics and integrate them into a single solution approach. Computational results show that the proposed heuristic approach finds high quality solutions. Moreover, it is observed that significant energy savings can be achieved by solving the EMFRP instead of the classical distance minimization problem.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are frequently used in larger systems, known as AGV-based transportation systems, for the movement of goods and materials from one location to another. The design of an efficient and effective AGV-based transportation system requires to address many tactical and operational issues. Among the others, the scheduling of transfer jobs on the AGVs represents one of the main operational issues that has to be solved to overcome delays in production and material handling processes. In this context, a significant research activity on AGV systems and on related scheduling problems has been conducted in the last twenty years. However, most of the contributions neglected the issues related to the AGV battery depletion and recharge. Thus, in this work, we study the AGV scheduling problem with battery constraints ( ASP-BC ). It consists in determining the scheduling of transfer jobs and charging operations of a fleet of homogeneous AGVs such that the makespan of the handling process is minimized. The methodological contribution of our work is twofold. On one side, we propose an original mixed integer linear programming formulation based on the bottleneck generalized assignment problem. On the other side, we propose a three step matheuristic based on the sequential solution of the two subproblems arising from the natural decomposition of the ASP-BC and a local search heuristic. The proposed approaches have been tested and validated on simulated and real instances provided by a manufacturing company. The results show the effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed solution methods.},

  abstract     = {The minimum-cost arborescence problem is a well-studied problem in the area of graph theory, with known polynomial-time algorithms for solving it. Previous literature introduced new variations on the original problem with different objective function and/or constraints. Recently, the Precedence-Constrained Minimum-Cost Arborescence problem was proposed, in which precedence constraints are enforced on pairs of vertices. These constraints prevent the formation of directed paths that violate precedence relationships along the tree. We show that this problem is NP -hard, and we introduce a new scalable mixed integer linear programming model for it. With respect to the previous models, the newly proposed model performs substantially better. This work also introduces a new variation on the minimum-cost arborescence problem with precedence constraints. We show that this new variation is also NP -hard, and we propose several mixed integer linear programming models for formulating the problem.},

  abstract     = {We consider two neighboring generalizations of the classical bin packing problem: the temporal bin packing problem (TBPP) and the temporal bin packing problem with fire-ups (TBPP-FU). In both cases, the task is to arrange a set of given jobs, characterized by a resource consumption and an activity window, on homogeneous servers of limited capacity. To keep operational costs but also energy consumption low, TBPP is concerned with minimizing the number of servers in use, whereas TBPP-FU additionally takes into account the switch-on processes required for their operation. Either way, challenging integer optimization problems are obtained, which can differ significantly from each other despite the seemingly only marginal variation of the problems. In the literature, a branch-and-price method enriched with many preprocessing steps (for TBPP) and compact formulations (for TBPP-FU), benefiting from numerous reduction methods, have emerged as, currently, the most promising solution methods. In this paper, we introduce, in a sense, a unified solution framework for both problems (and, in fact, a wide variety of further interval scheduling applications) based on graph theory. Any scientific contributions in this direction failed so far because of the exponential size of the associated networks. The approach we present in this article does not change the theoretical exponentiality itself, but it can make it controllable by clever construction of the resulting graphs. In particular, for the first time all classical benchmark instances (and even larger ones) for the two problems can be solved – in times that significantly improve those of the previous approaches.},

These directed network design models are used to compute centralized two-level networks under capacity constraints: Circuits on the inner level and directed trees in the periphery. We develop non-compact arc-based and set-packing formulations and integrate cuts to strengthen polyhedral descriptions of their relaxations. Theoretical results on polyhedral structure are provided that serve as the foundation of our branch-and-cut-and-price methods. For the column generation component, we introduce new relaxations of the pricing problem that are based on not necessarily elementary ring arborescences: q - d q-d -Steiner-arb and n g ng -ring-Steiner-arbs. These models are related to q q -arbs and n g ng -route relaxations known to be state-of-the-art for related network optimization models including vehicle routing. Our effective algorithmic framework incorporates iterated local search based primal heuristics and exact pricing strategies that can be applied to all considered model variants and related network design problems. The novel methods clearly outperform existing approaches from the literature regarding both solution time and solution quality. In a computational study, we show that our algorithms are capable of closing most optimality gaps for unsolved literature instances with up to 51 vertices. Furthermore, we provide results for new larger instances with up to 101 vertices.},

Yet, several research challenges still exist in developing comprehensive decision-making tools that could inform optimized solutions. The goal of this work is to review the literature from an optimization perspective and provide a conceptual framework for planning the blood supply chain management through mathematical programming modeling. This is achieved by decomposing the planning problems according to the planning level and identifying the key linkages to consider in an integrated solution approach. The strategic and tactical planning decision-making levels are then described in detail. In addition, an innovative OR-Modeling Framework to address the planning of the blood supply chain is provided. This framework serves as a guide for developing optimization based decision-making models and as a basis for any research in the area.},

In comparing the rigid and the flexible contracts, we highlight their respective strengths of inducing firm effort and adaptation to the uncertainties. We present clear conditions under which each contract type can lead to better performance, measured by firm effort, firm profit, and consumer surplus. We have further investigated the effects of government subsidies on the comparison results. We show that government subsidies are able to improve the comparative advantages of the flexible contract, regardless of subsidy forms. The effects of different government subsidies in improving firm effort to the first-best level under the two contract types are also analyzed.},

While several methodologies exist to overcome such complexities, there is little consensus on the appropriate method of estimation. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of different dynamic panel estimators across a range of common settings experienced by researchers. Instead of focusing on one single criterion of assessment, we employ multiple evaluative metrics across multiple experiments to provide a more extensive analysis of dynamic panel estimators. Taking all simulations into account, we find the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator to be the most robust and reliable estimator across empirical settings. We illustrate our findings with two empirical applications and show that the choice of estimator significantly affects the interpretation of firms’ productivity and efficiency persistence.},

The evaluation budget may be small, limiting the effectiveness of conventional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Bayesian optimization algorithms (BOAs) are an alternative approach for expensive problems but are underdeveloped in terms of support for constraints and non-continuous design variables—both of which are prevalent features of real-world design problems. This study investigates two constraint handling strategies for BOAs and introduces the first BOA for mixed-integer problems, intended for use on a real-world engine design problem. The new BOAs are empirically compared to their closest competitor for this problem—the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II, itself equipped with constraint handling and mixed-integer components. Performance is also analysed on two benchmark problems which have similar features to the engine design problem, but are computationally cheaper to evaluate. The BOAs offer statistically significant convergence improvements of between 5.9\% and 31.9\% over NSGA-II across the problems on a budget of 500 design evaluations. Of the two constraint handling methods, constrained expected improvement offers better convergence than the penalty function approach. For the engine problem, the BOAs identify improved feasible designs offering 36.4\% reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions and 2.0\% reductions in fuel consumption when compared to a notional baseline design. The use of constrained mixed-integer BOAs is recommended for expensive engineering design optimization problems.},

However, most often, such a crisis will not last forever, and a firm at fault eventually recovers. Considering an optimal control model, we investigate the optimal pricing decisions, advertising and quality efforts of a firm while it anticipates a product recall and a subsequent recovery. We show that the decisions and profits of the manufacturer vary widely with the stochastic parameters: crisis likelihood, recovery likelihood, crisis impact and recovery intensity. We illustrate that myopic firms are more severely affected by a product recall than farsighted firms when the impact of recall is high. However, it might not be so detrimental to take myopic decisions for low impact recalls. In the absence of recovery, a product recall can lead to bankruptcy. High initial perceived quality may not insulate a firm against bankruptcy.},

Specifically, we show that Bowley-optimal contracts are indeed Pareto efficient but they make the insurer indifferent with the status quo (hence providing a partial first welfare theorem). Moreover, we show that only those Pareto-efficient contracts that make the insurer indifferent between suffering the loss and entering into the reinsurance contract are Bowley optimal (hence providing a partial second welfare theorem). We interpret these result as indicative of the limitations of Bowley optimality as an equilibrium concept in this literature.

The competition among agricultural firms and processing firms is studied through game theory, where the governing Cournot–Nash equilibrium conditions correspond to a variational inequality problem. The algorithm, at each iteration, yields explicit closed form expressions for the agricultural product path flows, the agricultural product shipments from agricultural firms to the processing firms, and the Lagrange multipliers.

  abstract     = {Determining optimal prices in non-convex markets remains an unsolved challenge. Non-convex costs are critical in electricity markets, as startup costs and minimum operating levels yield a non-convex optimal value function over demand levels. While past research largely focuses on the performance of different non-convex pricing frameworks in the short-run or uses convex approximations, we determine long-run adapted resource mixes associated with each pricing framework while preserving the full extent of the non-convex operations. We frame optimal pricing in terms of social surplus achieved and transfer of consumer to producer surplus in adapted long-run market equilibria. We find that convex hull pricing achieves the highest social surplus and is also associated with the lowest transfer of consumer to producer surplus. Marginal prices determined by fixing integer variables to their optimal values in the pricing run are also associated with high social surplus and high consumer surplus when the optimality gap in the original mixed integer linear program is very small. Other pricing frameworks tend to over-compensate inframarginal units, leading to resource mixes with lower social surplus and a greater transfer of consumer surplus to producer surplus in the long-run.},

The maintenance activities are optimised over a planning horizon by simultaneously coordinating the SOV and the STB. A mixed-integer linear programming model is designed, where the objective function is to minimise the total maintenance cost. As the proposed mathematical model is hard to solve with a commercial solver, a decomposition approach is developed. A two-stage stochastic programming model is also designed to tackle uncertain conditions, including the duration of maintenance and the STB’s travel time. The performance of the solution method is evaluated using the Thanet Offshore Wind Farm, in the southeast of the UK. The results of our experiments show that joint use of an SOV and an STB can yield a lower total maintenance cost than only using an SOV or crew travel vessels (CTVs) that are currently the common practice in maintaining offshore turbines.},

We consider round robin leagues with different numbers of teams, and hence also requiring different numbers of rounds. As the number of simultaneous home games that clubs can organize for their teams is limited by the capacity of their venue, the objective is to minimize capacity violations. Along with a mixed integer programming model which is formulated to optimize the starting round of each league as well as to settle when teams have their home games, we develop various methods to construct an initial solution, and a heuristic with several local search and perturbation components to improve on this. Extensive computational experiments reveal that our heuristic can efficiently provide high-quality solutions for artificial and realistic instances. We also illustrate the impact of using different sets of home-away patterns on the total venue capacity violations. Results on a real-life application from the Belgian national football association indicate that schedules based on our heuristic allow teams to substantially decrease their venue capacity without causing meaningfully more violations.},

In the respective scenarios, nine parameters are varied that reflect the specific structure of the data and knowledge about the competitive environment of the units to be evaluated. In contrast to other studies, we consider, e.g., multiple inputs and outputs. Furthermore, among other things, we assume lower levels of efficiency to reflect characteristics of markets with weaker competition. The methods compared are Data Envelopment Analysis, Stochastic Frontier Analysis, Stochastic Non-Smooth Envelopment of Data, and Normalized Additive Analysis. They are assessed with respect to two main purposes of efficiency measurement, the correct estimation of the efficiency degrees as well as the accurate determination of the ranking of the compared units. It is shown that, depending on the chosen purpose and the data scenario, there are major differences regarding the performance of the methods.

  abstract     = {Decision-makers are often faced with multi-faceted problems that require making trade-offs between multiple, conflicting objectives under various uncertainties. The task is even more difficult when considering dynamic, non-linear processes and when the decisions themselves are complex, for instance in the case of selecting trajectories for multiple decision variables. These types of problems are often solved using multiobjective optimization (MOO). A typical problem in MOO is that the number of Pareto optimal solutions can be very large, whereby the selection process of a single preferred solution is cumbersome. Moreover, preference between model-based solutions may not be determined only by their objective function values, but also in terms of how robust and implementable these solutions are. In this paper, we develop a methodological framework to support the identification of a small but diverse set of robust Pareto optimal solutions. In particular, we eliminate non-robust solutions from the Pareto front and cluster the remaining solutions based on their similarity in the decision variable space. This enables a manageable visual inspection of the remaining solutions to compare them in terms of practical implementability. We illustrate the framework and its benefits by means of an epidemic control problem that minimizes deaths and economic impacts, and a screening program for colorectal cancer that minimizes cancer prevalence and costs. These examples highlight the general applicability of the framework for disparate types of decision problems and process models.},

In this paper, we develop fully sequential procedures that can incorporate various adaptive sampling rules, based on a modification of Paulson’s bound Paulson (1964), while still preserving the finite-sample guarantee. In particular, we propose an adaptive sampling rule that utilizes the consecutively updated sample mean and sample variance information by solving a minimization problem of the approximated total sample size.

A company uses occasional drivers to complement its fleet in the activity of delivering products to its customers. We model it as a variant of the stochastic capacitated vehicle routing problem. Our approach is data-driven, where not only customer orders but also the availability of occasional drivers are uncertain. It is assumed that marginal distributions of the uncertainty vector are known, but the joint distribution is difficult to estimate. We optimize considering a worst-case joint distribution and model with a strategic planning perspective, where we calculate an optimal a priori solution before the uncertainty is revealed. A limit on the infeasibility of the routes due to the capacity is imposed using probabilistic constraints. We propose an extended formulation for the problem using column-dependent rows and implement a branch-price-and-cut algorithm to solve it.

The latter are based upon a location-allocation scheme, whose first step consists of considering either a problem with a sample of scenarios or a sample of single-scenario problems. This leads to two variants of a new heuristic. The second version calls for the use of a so-called attractiveness function as a means to find a good trade-off between the (approximate) solutions obtained for the single-scenario problems.

This discount is assumed to be a certain dollar amount or a certain percent of the regular price. However, many retailers use nonlinear pricing, e.g., “Buy one, get one for 50\% off,” which we refer to as BOGO. We analyze BOGO within the newsvendor model and identify the reasons for its popularity. We describe the type of products for which BOGO is suitable, identify the optimal BOGO discount, and its effect on the retailer’s profit. We compare BOGO to straight price reduction and analyze the newsvendor’s optimal choice between them. We also examine the two promotions in the presence of strategic consumers. We find that for reasonable values of consumer marginal utility and a given order quantity, BOGO reduces strategic consumers’ chances of obtaining a unit at a discount and their incentive to wait. Therefore, the newsvendor orders a larger quantity with BOGO than with a price reduction. Thus, BOGO can be used to counter strategic consumer behavior. Also, we find that in the presence of strategic consumers, there are cases where it is optimal for the retailer to wait and offer a straight discount at the end of the season. However, with BOGO, it is always optimal to offer a BOGO at the start of the season if realized demand is low. We examine the robustness of our results to different arrival rates and positive salvage value and find that they qualitatively hold.},

The problem consists in finding the set of vehicles to be loaded into auto-carriers over a planning horizon of multiple days while minimizing the total transportation cost and fulfilling the loading constraints and meeting the delivery deadlines. Our study considers that the loading sequence policy at each stop is not required, and a minimum cost of auto-carriers is calculated on a per trip basis. We propose a Multi-Start Local Search Heuristic (MSLSH) to solve large-scale instances that arise in practice. Computational experiments compare the solutions obtained by means of our heuristic with the exact solutions for four medium size instances faced by a major Brazilian 3PL as well as with the manual allocation for two larger instances comprising 3,865 and 3,809 vehicles that could not be solved using the exact model. The results show that the proposed heuristic is able to obtain the optimal solutions for all the tested medium-sized instances. For large-sized instances that cannot be solved to optimality, we could obtain significant total transportation cost reductions (up to 15.40\%) and lower number of vehicles delivered after the promised due date compared to the 3PL manual allocation. The 3PL was satisfied with the results and intends to deploy it into production environment as the MSLSH is robust, does not require extensive parameter calibration and it is easy to implement.},

  abstract     = {In two-sided markets, hardware/software platforms meet the unified and personalized demands of consumers through hardware and software products respectively, forming their own ecosystems. For platform enterprises, how to drive third-party value creation through interface extensibility investment (typically on application programming interfaces, or APIs) under different pricing schemes, has become a critical issue under intensified competition. In this paper, we build game theoretic models in four platform competition scenarios (NR, NRT, IR, IRT) considering both investment decisions—no investment (N), investment (I), and pricing decisions—registration fee only (R), registration fee and transaction fee (RT), and analyze the competitive equilibrium in each scenario. Our results show that: (1) Although “reducing price” and “enhancing investment” are partial substitutes, platforms are still incentivized to implement both strategies. Contrary to the traditional wisdom, when platforms with investment charge both registration and transaction fees, the strengthening of cross-side network effect may lead to an increase in registration fee on both sides. (2) The improvement of interface extension effectiveness (cost reduction for developers per unit of investment from platforms) shifts more developers from single-homing to multi-homing, leading to fiercer market competition and thus lower platform profit in equilibrium. (3) Although implementing investment may not be optimal from the profit perspective, it does help platforms in securing a larger market share on the developer side. (4) The existence of same-side network effect enhances both side users’ incentive to enter the market; however, for the platforms, they should carefully mind the irrational price competition to avoid falling into profit-hurting traps.},

  abstract     = {This study emerges from a real-world cargo securing application to ensure safer road transportation and falls into the category of container loading problems with practical constraints. The literature has lacked efficient methods for the secure loading of items with non-identical dimensions, weights and rotations into containers while ensuring that the securing efforts necessary are minimal when also taking into account multi-drop and axle weight constraints. This paper puts forward a new way of ensuring cargo stability that gives rise to a novel combinatorial optimization problem, which is a generalization of the two-dimensional rectangular strip packing problem with orthogonal rotations. We formally demonstrate the intractability of the problem and provide a mixed integer programming formulation. The formulation is based on a discretization of the packing polyhedron, enabling us to model a range of complicated and practical constraints. A group of practical constraints tends to be large in number and makes it difficult to solve the formulation in a reasonable amount of time. In order to overcome this difficulty, we develop an exact algorithmic framework. This framework initially solves certain relaxations of the problem to obtain strong lower bounds before subsequently embedding those lower bounds into a branch-and-cut algorithm. The experimental study serves three purposes: (i) evaluating the performance of the algorithmic framework and the mathematical formulation to assess the merits of the two methods, (ii) identifying the characteristics of hard problem instances and (iii) extracting insights regarding challenges in cargo securing to help managers and practitioners in decision making.},

  abstract     = {Last mile delivery shows an increasingly tough challenge for logistics service providers due to the rapidly expanding e-commerce sales around the globe. To ease the implementation of last mile delivery, an effective delivery strategy is to predetermine the service regions of vehicles before optimizing their delivery routes. On this ground, this paper proposes a new delivery strategy named Community Logistics (CL) to generate vehicle service region and departure time dynamically. Through adopting this new delivery strategy, we transform the original last mile delivery to a new type of research problem, namely dynamic community partitioning problem (DCPP), with an aim to strike a balance between vehicle service region range, order delay time and vehicle capacity usage based on the real-time order arrivals and vehicle availability status. We present a Markov decision process (MDP) model for the DCPP and develop a heuristic solution approach to solve this MDP model. Numerical results demonstrate significant benefits of the proposed solution framework and delivery strategy.},

The cost structure with monotone differences is more general than the additive cost structure usually assumed in literature. Using the notion of Monge sequences, we identify conditions under which the problem can be solved efficiently using greedy allocation. For problems that do not meet these conditions, we develop an efficient algorithm that solves the problem to optimality. For this specific problem, our algorithm has substantially lower computational complexity than existing efficient algorithms for the more general transportation problem; we numerically confirm this superior computational efficiency and illustrate the importance of using efficient algorithms at the allocation stage of the inventory management problem.},

Each product has a known demand in each period that must be satisfied over a finite planning horizon. The aim of this problem is to minimize the overall cost of placing orders and carrying inventory across all periods. The structure of an optimal solution is analyzed with respect to a type of period called regeneration period, which is a period where the inventory of one or both products reach zero. We show that there is an optimal arrangement of placing orders between consecutive regeneration periods. We propose a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to solve the two-product problem. First, we show how the optimal ordering pattern between two consecutive regeneration periods can be solved using a shortest path problem. Then, we explain how the optimal locations for regeneration periods can be found by solving a shortest path problem on a different network, where each arc corresponds to the shortest path in a subproblem network. We then show how this approach can be scaled up to a three-product problem and generalize this technique to any number of products, as long as it is small.},

  abstract     = {Driven by increasingly fierce market competition, many traditional retailers have started to adopt price matching under which they promise to match competitors’ lower prices for the same product, and many online retailers have started to conduct logistics service enhancement. Motivated by these observations, we use the Hotelling model to develop a duopoly game, in which a traditional retailer and an online retailer sell the same product to consumers, to examine the effectiveness of price matching and logistics service enhancement in improving profitability. The results show that in the scenario where the online retailer does not conduct logistics service enhancement, the traditional retailer benefits from price matching only when the transportation cost to the brick-and-mortar store is high. However, in the scenario where the online retailer conducts logistics service enhancement, when the transportation cost is relatively low, the traditional retailer also has a chance to benefit from price matching. In contrast, regardless of the traditional retailer’s price matching strategy, the online retailer always benefits from logistics service enhancement. We also reveal that regardless of the online retailer’s logistics service enhancement strategy, the traditional retailer’s price matching can lead to Pareto improvement for both retailers as long as the transportation cost is high enough. However, only when the traditional retailer adopts price matching does the online retailer’s logistics service enhancement have a chance to lead to Pareto improvement for both retailers.},

We first prove that a sequencing rule for the shortest nominal processing time is optimal for both s-batch and p-batch problems. We then propose polynomial-time algorithms based on the observation that the robust batch scheduling problems are reducible or partially reducible to a constrained shortest path problem through worst-case scenario analysis. We further present more efficient algorithms for the special case of uniform maximum deviation times for all jobs. The algorithms are evaluated computationally, and the results show that their performance is satisfactory on the tested instances.},

The goal is to define a set of minimum cost tours, one for each day or period of the time horizon, that satisfy the service requirements. For this problem we propose a two-phase algorithm that combines heuristics and mathematical programming. In the first phase, two different procedures are used to construct feasible solutions: a multi-start heuristic based on feasibility pump and a multi-start constructive heuristic. From these solutions, some fragments (parts of tours associated with the different days) are extracted. The second phase determines a solution for the P R P P PRPP – I S IS by combining the fragments by means of a mathematical model.

The quality of routing and scheduling decisions is a function of the total operational cost, consisting of customers’ waiting time, and the operator’s travel time, idle time and overtime. We propose and rigorously analyze a stochastic programming model and two distributionally robust optimization (DRO) models to solve the problem, assuming known and unknown service and travel time distributions, respectively. We consider two popular types of ambiguity sets for the DRO models: mean-support and 1-Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We derive equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulations of both DRO models that can be implemented and efficiently solved using off-the-shelf optimization software, thereby enabling practitioners to use these models. In an extensive numerical experiment, we investigate the proposed models’ computational and operational performance and derive insights into the problem.},

In this problem, customers’ preferences and subsets of sites that each customer is willing to accept as service centers are taken into account. It is assumed that centers can fail and, thus, the decision maker is risk-averse and makes his decision taking into account not only the most favourite centers of the customers but also the worst case situation whenever they evaluate their preferred second opportunity. Specifically, the new problem aims at choosing at most p p centers so that each demand point can visit at least two acceptable centers and the maximum sum of distances from any demand point to any of its preferred centers plus the distance from any of the preferred centers to any of the centers the user prefers once he is there is minimized. The problem is NP-hard as an extension of the p p -next center problem. The paper presents three different mixed-integer linear programming formulations that are valid for the problem. Each formulation uses different space of variables giving rise to some strengthening using valid inequalities and variable fixing criteria that can be applied when valid upper bounds are available. Exact methods are limited so that a heuristic algorithm is also developed to provide good quality solution for large size instances. Finally, an extensive computational experience has been performed to assess the usefulness of the formulations to solve DSpP using standard MIP solvers.},

  abstract     = {Robustness and vulnerability analysis of networked systems is often performed using the concept of vertex blockers. In particular, in the minimum cost vertex blocker clique problem, we seek a subset of vertices with the minimum total blocking cost such that the weight of any remaining clique in the interdicted graph (after the vertices are blocked) is upper bounded by some pre-defined parameter. Loosely speaking, we aim at disrupting the network with the minimum possible cost in order to guarantee that the network does not contain cohesive (e.g., closely related) groups of its structural elements with large weights; such groups are modeled as weighted cliques. In this paper, our focus is on designing networks that are resilient to clique blockers. Specifically, we construct additional connections (edges) in the network and our goal is to ensure (at the minimum possible cost of newly added edges) that the adversarial decision-maker (or the worst-case realization of random failures) cannot disrupt the network (namely, the weight of its cohesive groups) at some sufficiently low cost. The proposed approach is useful for modeling effective formation and preservation of influential clusters in networked systems. We first explore structural properties of our problem. Then, we develop several exact solution schemes based on integer programming and combinatorial branch-and-bound techniques. Finally, the performance of our approaches is explored in a computational study with randomly-generated and real-life network instances.},

  abstract     = {Modern wholesale electricity markets often have producers who exercise market power. The standard way to model market power in an oligopoly with a competitive fringe is by using Mixed Complementarity Problems (MCPs) and conjectural variations. However, such models can lead to myopic (sub-optimal) behaviour for oligopolists. We first build on existing literature to show that an oligopoly with a competitive fringe where all firms have investment decisions will also lead to myopic behaviour when modelled using MCPs with conjectural variations. To overcome this issue, we develop an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC) to model such an electricity market structure. The EPEC models two types of players: price-making firms, who have market power, and price-taking firms, who do not. Our model is the first in the literature to consider an oligopoly with a competitive fringe where all firms have investment decisions. Our results indicate that an EPEC can model investment decisions in an oligopoly with a competitive fringe more credibly and thus overcome the myopic behaviour observed in MCPs. The EPEC found multiple equilibria for investment decisions and firms’ profits. Despite this, market prices and consumer costs were found to remain relatively constant across the equilibria. A further contribution of the modelling approach is that it shows how it may be optimal for price-making firms to accept losses in some time periods in order to disincentivize price-taking firms from investing further into the market. We conclude our paper with a discussion of the computational limitations of our approach.},

Time-varying traffic conditions provide particular challenges, both from network-level interactions (e.g. slowing to consume more fuel locally may be beneficial to avoid congested periods downstream) and link-level phenomena (e.g. interaction between acceleration and gradient profiles). A multi-level, discrete-time decomposition of the problem is presented in which: (i) [sub-problems] speed profiles are optimized within each link, given boundary conditions of entry/exit times and speeds; (ii) [master problem] a space-time extended network representation is used to encode the dynamic interactions, within which the joint choice of path and speed profile is made. By instantiating the space-time network in (ii) with the optimal link profiles from (i), we are able to devise a tractable algorithm while optimizing speed profiles over a fine timescale. The solution approach is to pre-solve offline the computationally-intensive step (i), meaning that the representation in (ii) can be efficiently produced online in response to the real-time predictive information, whereby optimization of the path and speed profile is solved by a single shortest path search in the space-time network, for which many exact algorithms exist. The method is extended to additionally consider choice of discretionary stops and (pre-trip) departure time. Two representations are presented and investigated, depending on whether constraints are additionally imposed to ensure consistency of speed profiles across link boundaries. Numerical experiments are reported on a small illustrative example and a case-study network.},

We conclude by studying the optimal compression problem for specific networks; this permits us to study, e.g., the so-called robust fragility of certain network topologies more generally as well as the potential benefits and costs of network compression.

By considering two common collaboration strategies, i.e. investment sharing and innovation sharing , and comparing them with a non-collaborative strategy, independent development , we are able to provide competing firms with managerial insights on the pros and cons of these collaboration strategies. We find that the innovation sharing strategy produces the most expensive products, as well as the products with the highest environmental quality. Additionally, we find that the independent development and investment sharing strategies can lead to products with inferior environmental quality, depending on the competitors’ demand sensitivity to their quality and price. When the consumers’ quality responsiveness is relatively greater than their price responsiveness, the independent development strategy should be avoided. Furthermore, the innovation sharing strategy provides the highest profits for the firm, whereas the independent development strategy leads to the lowest profits. Lastly, numerical experiments illustrate that the outcomes of collaborative strategies are robust under demand uncertainty, but not necessarily under nonlinear demand.},

In some equilibria, the defender can use signaling to deter an attacker and increase its payoff.

  abstract     = {The networked structure of investor relationship has been documented by many researches. This paper proposes a dynamic model based on investor network, and investigate the impacts of investor interactions on market stability. Two learning patterns are taken into account. The herd behavior is characterized with the imitation and diffusion of trading strategies in investor network. The behavioral equilibria and their stability conditions are studied with mathematical analysis. As the findings show, herd behavior can affect trader structure as well as market stability. Although it is a potential source of bubbles, there exist some cases where herd behavior is beneficial to market stability. The impacts of network structure are closely related with the imitation mechanism. If investors mainly care about the absolute number of neighbors who adopt different strategies, the network effect could weaken market stability. To guarantee the stability conditions, the variance of degree distribution should fit with other parameters. A high variance of degree distribution might lead to market instability.},

  abstract     = {We investigate how to secure reliable access to personal protective equipment (PPE) in pandemics, which are characterized by random occurrences and durations, at the lowest expected cost. The policymaker’s strategy is based on a mix of (1) holding ready-to-use strategic stockpile that is acquired at regular price but incurs a holding cost, (2) building partnership with PPE manufacturers to relocate offshore production locally, which guarantees some local supply but requires offering subsidies, and (3) buying PPE from the spot market, which is characterized by long supply lead times and high prices. We model the problem as a Stackelberg game between a policymaker (leader) and a manufacturer (follower). The policymaker decides the PPE stockpile, the subsidy offered to the local manufacturer, and the quantity to buy from the spot market. The manufacturer determines whether to move production onshore. We determine the optimal strategy for each player and study the effect of spot market conditions and pandemic characteristics. Analytical results show that attracting local manufacturers is less costly for the government when the variability of pandemic duration increases. While it is sub-optimal to rely only on the strategic stockpile, holding some stockpile may be necessary even when the PPE can be obtained from the spot market as soon as the pandemic starts. Results reveal policymaker’s preference for subsidizing onshore production in the following cases: products with low spot prices (counter-intuitively), spot market with long supply lead time, less frequent pandemics, and shorter pandemics.},

In this paper, an agent-based model and simulator (PABIM) is developed to investigate the impact of noncopatenting and copatenting strategies on economic and innovation performance. Economic performance is evaluated by observing turnover, whereas innovation performance is evaluated using the Innovation Patent Index (IPI). IPI is based on five patent features, each of them defined using machine learning algorithms. The results show that, depending on the innovation intensity of the sector, both noncopatenting and copatenting strategies can be effective to improve both the economic and innovation performance.},

  abstract     = {In many practical applications, the end-goal of multi-objective optimization is to select an implementable solution that is close to the Pareto-optimal front while satisfying the decision maker’s preferences. The decision making process is challenging since it involves the manual consideration of all solutions. The field of multi-criteria decision making offers many methods that help the decision maker in this process. However, most methods only focus on analyzing the solutions’ objective values. A more informed decision generally requires the additional knowledge of how different preferences affect the variable values. One difficulty in realizing this is that while the preferences are often expressed in the objective space, the knowledge required to implement a preferred solution exists in the decision space. In this paper, we propose a decision support system that allows interactive knowledge discovery and knowledge visualization to support practitioners by simultaneously considering preferences in the objective space and their impact in the decision space. The knowledge discovery step can use either of two recently proposed data mining techniques for extracting decision rules that conform to given preferences, while the extracted knowledge is visualized via a novel graph-based approach that allows the discovery of important variables, their values and their interactions with other variables. The result is an intuitive and interactive decision support system that aids the entire decision making process — from solution visualization to knowledge visualization. We demonstrate the usefulness of this system on benchmark optimization problems up to 10 objectives and real-world problems with up to six objectives.},

The consensus principle keeps the consensus reaching process (CRP) always moving in a better direction, and the tolerance level characterizes the individual’s psychological receptivity, while the consensus level guarantees the quality of consensus results, then the minimum cost consensus models (MCCMs) based on these three points are proposed. Thereafter, we add a feedback regulation mechanism based on tolerance threshold rewards to the proposed MCCMs, the mechanism connects individual weight with tolerance threshold, avoiding the subjective disadvantage caused by the two values need to be given in advance. Meanwhile, the framework and specific algorithm of CRP under the tolerance threshold reward feedback regulation mechanism are given, providing a precise method for solving the realistic consensus problems.

We focus on three research questions for the seller and platform as follows: (1) Which is the optimal choice between unilateral and bilateral promotion under different promotion scenarios? (2) How will the promotion scenarios affect their joint promotion? (3) To a seller/platform, is it always better to proactively initiate promotion event? Result shows that the optimal promotion strategy varies from Seller Promotion Only to joint promotion and then to Platform Promotion Only, along with an increasing commission rate. Joint promotion is optimal only when the commission rate is moderate and when the product&#39;s list price is relatively high. The promotion scenario affects the scope and intensity of joint promotion and the profit of the entities. The joint promotion leader has the first-mover advantage, which helps him/her offer fewer coupons but obtain higher profits. To a platform or seller, launching promotion events proactively is not always the best choice. Experiments show that the subjects behaved as predicted. Moreover, the subjects demonstrate distinct decision patterns under different promotion scenarios. Ultimately, our conclusions can provide valuable decision-making guidance to marketing managers in the online marketplace. They can also choose appropriate scenarios on the basis of certain promotion objectives with knowing decision patterns under each scenario.},

  abstract     = {More brick-and-mortar retailers open an online channel to increase sales. Often, they use the store to fulfil online orders and to receive returned products. The uncertain product returns however complicate the replenishment decision of a retailer. The inventory also has to be rationed over the offline and online sales channels. We therefore integrate the rationing and ordering decisions of an omni-channel retailer in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that maximises the retailer’s profit. Contrary to previous studies, we explicitly model multi-period sales-dependent returns, which is more realistic and leads to higher profit and service levels. With Value Iteration (VI) an exact solution can only be computed for relatively small-scale instances. For solving large-scale instances, we constructed a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm. The different methods are compared in an extensive numerical study of small-scale instances to gain insights. The results show that the running time of VI increases exponentially in the problem size, while the running time of DRL is high but scales well. DRL has a low optimality gap but the performance drops when there is a higher level of uncertainty or if the profit trade-off between different actions is minimal. Our approach of modelling multi-period sales-dependent product returns outperforms other methods. Furthermore, based on large-scale instances, we find that increasing online returns lowers the profit and the service level in the offline channel. However, longer return windows do not influence the retailer’s profit.},

In online shopping festivals, selection of the selling format is a key strategy for the suppliers. In this paper, we develop a model to analyze a supplier selling its products to loyal consumers and general shoppers through an online retailer platform who offers either the marketplace or reselling mode or both modes. We characterize the supplier’s optimal selling format selection under the minimum quantity contract in different market structure settings. We find that when the platform offers at most one mode, the supplier should select the marketplace mode under a low minimum quantity contract to avoid the double marginalization effect of the reselling mode. If the minimum quantity contract in the marketplace mode is relatively high, the supplier should select the reselling mode under a low minimum quantity contract. When the platform offers both modes, the supplier’s optimal selling format selection depends on the market structure. When the potential market of the loyal consumers is sufficiently small, even if the platform allows the supplier to use both modes, the supplier tends to choose only one platform mode to avoid channel competition. The more loyal consumers there are, the more willing the supplier will use both modes for larger potential market. Finally, we discuss the managerial implications for the supplier and platform in selecting the selling format and setting the minimum quantity contract, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In light of the existing practical applications of the two-dimensional loading on vehicle scheduling and many-to-many supply-demand relationships between suppliers and customers, we address a many-to-many heterogeneous vehicle routing problem with cross-docking and two-dimensional loading constraints (or the heterogeneous 2L-MVRPCD). The newly proposed problem can be regarded as a generalized problem of the many-to-many vehicle routing with cross-docking (MVRPCD) and capacitated vehicle routing problem with two-dimensional loading constraints (2L-CVRP). To solve small-scale 2L-MVRPCDs, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed, whereas two hybrid optimization heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve large-scale 2L-MVRPCDs. The first heuristic incorporates a basic adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm and a new best-fit-skyline (BFS) packing heuristic, while the second heuristic, a Tabu-based ALNS (ALNS/TS), extends the first one by embedding an insert-tabu strategy to enhance the intensity and diversity of search. Wide-ranging instances with various many-to-many supply-demand scenarios and different loading configurations are employed to verify the efficacy of the proposed MILP model and two heuristics. Numerical results show that small-scale heterogeneous 2L-MVRPCD instances with and without the rotation constraints can be solved to optimality by commercial solvers, and the proposed heuristics can achieve high-quality solutions within a reasonable computational time for large-scale instances. Meanwhile, the comparison between the proposed heuristics and existing methods verifies the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed heuristics for solving MVRPCD and 2L-CVRP.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional cutting and packing problems including irregular items (nesting problems) are common, e.g., in the clothing, paper, glass and leather industries. In the irregular strip packing problem considered in this work a finite number of rotations of convex as well as non-convex polygons with and without holes are permitted. To deal with the geometry of irregular items, direct trigonometry is applied. The focus is on aspects and characteristics that are typical for many affected industries and have been neglected so far. In the mentioned sectors, it is conceivable that items can be created from smaller parts by assembling them using various techniques. There might be several possible combinations of parts to be joined together to result in the desired item, i.e., there might be several cutting patterns to choose from. Also, whether the large material, i.e., large object is single-colored or has a particular structure or design is of great importance. In the latter case, special attention must be paid to the rotation of certain items or parts in order to achieve the desired (uniform or non-uniform) appearance of the final product. The utilized data structure is introduced, to address the mentioned aspects in the presented mixed-integer linear model which is an extension of a formulation published by previous authors. Furthermore, the method of calculating “critical vertices” is introduced, which requires only a reduced number of comparisons between edges and vertices of two items to ensure overlap-free positioning. Industry-relevant examples are highlighted in the computational study to illuminate the versatility of the model.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the retail industry, we consider a stochastic inventory routing problem where retailers are replenished from a central warehouse using a time-based shipment consolidation policy. Such a time-based dispatching policy, where retailers facing stochastic demand are repetitively replenished at fixed times, is essential in practice. It allows for easy incorporation with dependent up- and downstream planning problems such as personal staffing and warehouse operations, and has become a standard part of transportation contracts. We provide a new chance-constrained model that determines an optimal clustering of retailers in groups, their associated routing and shipment interval, and each retailers’ optimal inventory level. A newly developed branch-price-and-cut algorithm solves our model to optimality. Its efficiency comes from a tailored labeling algorithm for solving the pricing problem that relies, among others, on an optimality pruning criterion based on the approximate solution of a 0,1-knapsack problem. Computational experiments show that our exact method can solve instances of up to 60 retailers to optimality. Besides, we accommodate practitioners by providing a fast heuristic that provides excellent solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1\%. Finally, we show that incorporating uncertainty already in the planning process is essential for stochastic inventory routing with time-based shipment consolidation, as it results in overall cost-savings of 7.7\% compared to the current state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Increases in last-mile transport contribute to congestion and pollution in urban environments. To make deliveries more sustainable, they may be integrated with existing public transport infrastructure, e.g., metros or trams. This integration can rely on alternative operational modes: shared infrastructure lets passenger and cargo vehicles share the same rail network, whereas shared vehicles simultaneously transport cargo and passengers. To explore the effects of integrated planning under different operational modes, we introduce a linear mixed-integer program that optimises the train schedule and allocates cargo. It features a lexicographical objective function that prioritises passenger transport while minimising cargo delivery delay. We analyse the interplay of operational modes, scheduling solutions, and demand settings in a simulation study.The results show that a well-planned train schedule significantly contributes to service quality and reduces the system’s sensitivity to increasing freight demand. Furthermore, a system with shared vehicles is more robust towards fluctuating demand, whereas a system with only shared infrastructure is a valid option to allow a high dwell time for freight vehicles.},

  abstract     = {This work addresses a variant of the job shop scheduling problem in which jobs need to be transported to the machines processing their operations by a limited number of vehicles. Given that vehicles must deliver the jobs to the machines for processing and that machines need to finish processing the jobs before they can be transported, machine scheduling and vehicle scheduling are intertwined. A coordinated approach that solves these interrelated problems simultaneously improves the overall performance of the manufacturing system. In the current competitive business environment, and integrated approach is imperative as it boosts cost savings and on-time deliveries. Hence, the job shop scheduling problem with transport resources (JSPT) requires scheduling production operations and transport tasks simultaneously. The JSPT is studied considering the minimization of two alternative performance metrics, namely: makespan and exit time. Optimal solutions are found by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. However, since integrated production and transportation scheduling is very complex, the MILP model can only handle small-sized problem instances. To find good quality solutions in reasonable computation times, we propose a hybrid particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing algorithm (PSOSA). Furthermore, we derive a fast lower bounding procedure that can be used to evaluate the performance of the heuristic solutions for larger instances. Extensive computational experiments are conducted on 73 benchmark instances, for each of the two performance metrics, to assess the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed PSOSA algorithm. These experiments show that the PSOSA outperforms state-of-the-art solution approaches and is very robust.},

  abstract     = {Graph layout problems are a family of combinatorial optimization problems that consist of finding an embedding of the vertices of an input graph into a host graph such that an objective function is optimized. Within this family of problems falls the so-called Two-Dimensional Bandwidth Minimization Problem (2DBMP). The 2DBMP aims to minimize the maximum distance between each pair of adjacent vertices of the input graph when it is embedded into a grid host graph. In this paper, we present an efficient heuristic algorithm based on the Iterated Greedy (IG) framework hybridized with a new local search strategy to tackle the 2DBMP. Particularly, we propose different designs for the main IG procedures (i.e., construction, destruction, and reconstruction) based on the trade-off between intensification and diversification. Additionally, the improvement method incorporates three advanced strategies: an efficient way to evaluate the objective function of neighbor solutions, a tiebreak criterion to deal with “flat landscapes”, and a neighborhood reduction technique. Extensive experimentation was carried out to assess the IG performance over state-of-the-art methods, emerging our approach as the most competitive algorithm. Specifically, IG finds the best solutions for all instances considered in considerably less execution time. Statistical tests corroborate the merit of our proposal.},

  abstract     = {We propose an approximate algorithm to dynamically assign a multi-skilled workforce to the stations of a job shop, with demand uncertainty and variability in the availability of the resources, to maximize productivity. Our proposed model is inspired by automotive glass manufacturing, where maximizing the surface area of manufactured safety glass during a given time frame is the key performance measure. We first develop the model of a traditional job shop with a set of stations, each with a particular number of machines, with distinct production performance levels, according to their utilization stage. Each product type needs to be processed on a subset of these stations according to a predefined sequence. Customers place their orders independently over time, specifying the units required of each product type. The inter-arrival of orders (demand) and processing times are assumed to be stochastic. We also suppose that the technicians have varied skill sets, according to which they can only work at a certain subgroup of stations, and variable availability depending on sick leave, vacations, etc. Hence, in order to maximize the predefined productivity index, the optimal assignment of technicians to the stations based on their skill sets and availability during each shift becomes a complex decision-making process. Given the stochastic and dynamic nature of this problem, we model the setting as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Given its size, we propose to solve it using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP). We address the exponential growth of the action space by using a hill-climbing algorithm for action selection. To show the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we use real company data and compare the results of the algorithm with the current policy in use, as well as other proposed policies. Applying our proposed method resulted in an average improvement of 15\% 15\% in productivity compared to the best performing benchmark policy.},

Motivated by the significant recent progress on VRPSD research, we begin this paper by summarizing the key new results and methods for solving the problem. In doing so, we discuss the main challenges associated with solving the VRPSD under the chance-constraint and the restocking-based perspectives. Once we cover the current state-of-the-art, we introduce two major methodological contributions. First, we present a branch-price-and-cut (BP&amp;C) algorithm for the VRPSD under optimal restocking. The method, which is based on the pricing of elementary routes, compares favorably with previous algorithms and allows the solution of several open benchmark instances. Second, we develop a demand model for dealing with correlated customer demands. The central concept in this model is the “external factor”, which represents unknown covariates that affect all demands. We present a Bayesian-based, iterated learning procedure to refine our knowledge about the external factor as customer demands are revealed. This updated knowledge is then used to prescribe optimal replenishment decisions under demand correlation. Computational results demonstrate the efficiency of the new BP&amp;C method and show that cost savings above 10\% may be achieved when restocking decisions take account of demand correlation. Lastly, we motivate a few research perspectives that, as we believe, should shape future research on the VRPSD.},

The purpose of this article is to examine the evolution of OR through linear programming, its leading methodology, and some of its derivatives, concentrating on one of them—data envelopment analysis (DEA)—developed by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes in 1978. We focus on DEA and its derivatives, as this article is the most cited in a search performed using the main OR journals. Although we found LP to be mentioned much more than DEA in our search of Google Scholar and beyond, DEA is still well represented in the OR literature. Furthermore, based on insights gained from examining DEA vis-á-vis LP and the “secret” of their spread, we conclude with suggestions to further enhance OR&#39;s visibility, implementing ideas from OR founders and others over the years. Thus, future directions include combining hard and soft OR, involving interdisciplinary teams, consulting of OR academic researchers, and more.},

We provide a tractable reformulation of the proposed distributionally robust chance-constrained OPF problem under the popular conditional-value-at-risk approximation. By way of numerical experiments run on a modified IEEE-118 bus network with wind uncertainty, we show how the power system can substantially benefit from taking into account the well-known statistical dependence between the point forecast of wind power outputs and its associated prediction error. Furthermore, the experiments conducted also reveal that the distributional robustness conferred on the OPF solution by our probability-trimmings-based approach is superior to that bestowed by alternative approaches in terms of expected cost and system reliability.},

While to define such problems is easy, to solve them is quite difficult, since they are of infinite dimension. Numerical solution can only be found by solving an approximate, easier problem. In this paper, we show good approximations can be found, where we emphasize the recursive structure of the involved algorithms and data structures. In a second part, the problem of coping with the model error of approximations is discussed. We present algorithms for finding distributionally robust solutions for the model error problem. We also review some application cases of such situations from the literature.},

  abstract     = {The idea of a smart city is one that utilises Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies and data analytics to optimise the efficiency of city operations and services, so as to provide a high quality of life for its citizens. Due to reduced public funding, many public transport systems are already facing challenges to maintain their services. For a smart city, the goal of public transport is not simply the movement of people, but the provision and enhancement of mobility for living. This will be particularly challenging due to changes in habitation trends and work patterns. For example, the growth of mega-cities has led to extreme traffic congestion in city centres and urban sprawl on their outskirts. In order to provide sufficient coverage and frequency of service, an integrated co-ordinated multi-modal public transport system is needed, leading to substantial increase in operational complexity. Environmental concerns and the recent pandemic may also change work and commuting patterns in the future, with more people working from home and companies adopting flexible work shifts. For smart cities, public transport must offer ubiquitous access, real-time response to demand, convenience and quality service, and energy-efficient operations. This paper will discuss the challenges in network design, operations planning, scheduling and management of smart public transport systems. A brief survey of recent research and innovations will also be presented.},

  abstract     = {This paper contributes to research on the corporate social responsibility (CSR) field and the inefficiency measurement of firms by proposing a new method for evaluating inefficiency accounting for firms’ CSR activities. The new approach considers the imprecise nature of CSR data through the fuzzy data envelopment analysis (FDEA) method and further extends it by allowing for the dynamic interdependence of firms’ production decisions through adjustment costs, related to firms investments. In addition, the new method deals with zero or negative values for inputs and/or outputs of the data. The empirical application used in this paper considers a dataset of CSR activities of European firms for three industries (capital, consumption, and other) over the period 2014–2016. Two main results are found with this data. First, the study shows that fuzzy dynamic inefficiencies tend to be lower than these obtained from the conventional crisp evaluation of inefficiency. Second, the study finds some differences in dynamic inefficiencies at distinct levels of fuzziness. Overall, the results seem to confirm that the usage of dynamic fuzzy methodology adds some value to the standard crisp approach.},

We analyse over one million online loans and find that the rates for both default and prepayment are relatively high compared to traditional bank loans. A preliminary nonparametric life-table estimate shows that loans with different terms exhibit varying patterns of hazards. We use a proportional hazard model with competing risks to predict the time to default and prepayment, and parameterise those covariates affecting the time to both events. Two dimensions of predictive performance, the discriminant power and the probability calibration, are then examined. To further support the primacy of profit-driven decisions, we propose a framework based on competing risks survival analysis to estimate the profitability of loans and the return of loan portfolios. Profitability forecasts incorporating both the time to default and prepayment are compared to the profitability of real assets, and finally a penalty is suggested to compensate for those losses incurred by prepayment.},

Most approved waivers seek to establish state subsidized reinsurance programs, which help offset potential losses of high-cost enrollees in individual markets. State subsidized reinsurance programs are expected to reduce premiums, but may induce moral hazard and adverse selection issues. In response, this research examines state reinsurance programs’ impacts on premiums, expenses, and efficiency in individual and other major health insurance markets. We use the non-oriented slacks-based efficiency model and the entropy-balancing difference-in-differences regression model. We pool all the states with reinsurance programs and use insurer-level data and a rich set of predictors for our outcome variables. We find that, overall, state reinsurance programs reduce premiums and do not decrease consumer efficiency in individual markets. However, their impacts are differential across states, with no significant effects in at least half of the states. We find mixed effects on expenses and medical utilization efficiency in individual markets, and there are no significant spillover effects in other major health insurance markets. This research informs the public and provides insights for the U.S. individual health insurance operations in implementing, regulating, and evaluating state reinsurance programs and refining premium benchmarking.},

The dimension (codimension) of a simple game is the minimum number of weighted voting games such that their intersection (union) is the given game. In this work, we analyze some subclasses of weighted voting games and their closure under intersection or union. We introduce generalized notions of dimension and codimension regarding some subclasses of weighted voting games. In particular, we show that not all simple games can be expressed as intersection (union) of pure weighted voting games (those in which dummy players are not allowed) and we provide a characterization of such simple games. Finally, we experimentally study the generalized dimension (codimension) for some subclasses defined by establishing restrictions on the representations of weighted voting games.},

To overcome these challenges, this paper studies the day-ahead scheduling of cascaded hydroelectric systems in a restructured electricity market with the presence of uncertainties in electricity price and natural water inflow. To properly model the uncertainty, we consider the unique characteristics of these two types of uncertainties and capture them via the uncertainty set and stochastic scenarios, respectively. A hybrid robust-stochastic optimization model is developed to simultaneously hedge against these two types of uncertainties, which is formulated as a large-scale non-convex optimization problem with mixed integer recourse. After introducing linearization of nonlinear terms, a tailored hybrid decomposition scheme combining Lagrangian relaxation and Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition is adopted to achieve efficient computation of the proposed model. Two real-world cases are conducted to demonstrate the capability and characteristics of the proposed model and algorithms.},

Our study is based on a unique dataset of maintenance records from the network of 64 UK garages of BT Fleet Solutions , and we consider a large number of predictor variables, with condition, manufacturing, geographical, and calendar-related information. The application of LASSO enables the identification of relevant predictor variables for forecasting purposes. Based on the Brier score and the ranked probability score (and their skill scores), we document substantial predictive ability of our method which outperforms five benchmarks, including the method used by the company. More importantly, we demonstrate explicitly how to associate the predicted probabilities with a loss function in order to make operational decisions in garages. We find that the best choice of job scheduling does not always correspond to the predicted categories, especially when the loss function is asymmetric. We show that scheduling jobs on the basis of our method can help the company reduce loss value. Finally, we identify opportunities for further improvements in the operations of the company and for garage maintenance operations in general.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a Multistage Distributionally Robust Optimization (MDRO) approach to water allocation under climate uncertainty. The MDRO is formed by creating sets of conditional distributions (called conditional ambiguity sets ) on a finite scenario tree. The distributions in the conditional ambiguity sets remain close to a nominal conditional distribution according a ϕ ϕ -divergence (e.g., Kullback-Leibler divergence, Hellinger distance, Burg entropy, etc.). The paper discusses a decomposition algorithm to solve the resulting MDRO with ϕ ϕ -divergences, which uses the dual formulation and solves only linear subproblems instead of convex ones. Some properties of the algorithm such as generating feasible policies and valid upper/lower bounds are established. The paper then applies the modeling and solution techniques to allocate water in a rapidly-developing area of Tucson, Arizona. Tucson, like many arid and semi-arid regions around the world, faces considerable uncertainty in its ability to provide water for its citizens in the future. The primary sources of uncertainty in the Tucson region include (1) unpredictable population growth, (2) the availability of water from the Colorado River, and (3) the effects of climate variability on water consumption. This paper integrates forecasts for all these sources of uncertainty into a single optimization model for robust and sustainable water allocation. Then, it uses this model to analyze the value of constructing additional treatment facilities to reduce future water shortages. The results indicate that the MDRO approach can be very valuable for water managers by providing insights to minimize their risks and help them plan for the future.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicle scheduling is concerned with assigning a fleet of electrically powered vehicles to a set of timetabled trips. Since the range of these vehicles is limited, charging breaks need to be scheduled in-between trips, which require detours and time. This paper presents a novel electric vehicle scheduling problem with multiple charging stations in an in-plant logistics setting with the objective of minimizing the required fleet size. Contrary to previous works, we consider constant, linear and non-linear battery charging functions, which, among other things, allows to model realistic non-linear lithium-ion battery charging. We present an integer programming model and an exact branch-and-check solution procedure, which is based on decomposing the problem into a master and a subproblem. The former is concerned with assigning vehicles to trips while relaxing the battery constraints. The latter schedules charging breaks and checks if the master problem’s solution is feasible with regard to the non-relaxed battery constraints. Our computational tests show that solving the IP model with a standard solver (CPLEX) is inferior to the branch-and-check approach, which generally performs well even for practically relevant instance sizes. Furthermore, we derive some insights into the influence of the charging mode and maximum battery capacity on the required fleet size. Lastly, we investigate the effects of the number of warehouses (with respective charging stations).},

In particular, we examine the social theories that OR researchers have adopted, what data was captured, and how it was analysed in order to establish empirical grounding in case studies involving workshops and meetings published by OR researchers. The cases thus provide a useful empirical basis for comparison to outline the prospects for the use of practice theories by OR academic researchers.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of second-degree price discrimination when the type distribution is unknown or imperfectly specified by means of an ambiguity set. As robustness measure we use a performance index, equivalent to relative regret, which quantifies the worst-case attainment ratio between actual payoff and ex-post optimal payoff. We provide a simple representation of this performance index, as the lower envelope of two boundary performance ratios, relative to beliefs that lie at the boundary of the ambiguity set. A characterization of the solution to the underlying robust identification problem is given, which leads to a robust product portfolio, for which we also determine the worst-case performance over all possible consumer types. For a standard linear-quadratic specification of the robust screening model, a worst-case performance index of 75\% guarantees that the robust product portfolio exhibits a profitability that lies within a 25\%-band of an ex-post optimal product portfolio, over all possible model parameters and beliefs. Finally, a numerical comparison benchmarks the robust solution against a number of alternative belief heuristics.},

  abstract     = {Attempts to examine so-called ‘behavioural effects’ have reached into many different fields and are in full sway across OR. This paper considers whether this can be applied to System Dynamics modelling in a useful way. The idea is that humans frequently do not employ strict rationality in their daily lives but make errors and are subject to fallacies. This can shed light on the cognitive and human interaction aspects of the process and outcomes of modelling. The paper first raises concerns about the current state of ‘Behavioural OR’ – BOR. To refocus the underlying ideas it then returns to the Decision Theory roots, takes a broader view using an illustration from the history of science and then builds on work which first proposed a link to System Dynamics (SD). The core of the paper then explores in depth how behavioural ideas apply to SD. This is done using examples dealing with complex systems in a ‘naïve’ versus a ‘sophisticated’ way, and then using a mind map. It then offers a new and detailed framework of the stages of an SD-based intervention, indicating the presence of behavioural effects and providing a fine-grained discussion of those effects as they apply to SD. It builds on this by proposing a definition of ‘Behavioural System Dynamics’ (BehSD) in terms of its perspective on phenomena, five new, constitutive axioms, and its potential for improving practice. The paper closes by reprising the nature and potential of ‘BehSD’ and by sketching how research that adopts this perspective might go forward.},

  abstract     = {Agreement in Group Decision-Making problems has recently been tackled through the use of Minimum Cost Consensus (MCC) models, which are associated with solving convex optimization problems. Such models minimize the cost of changing experts’ preferences towards reaching a mutual consensus, and establish that the distance between the modified individual preferences and the collective opinion must be bounded by the threshold ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 . A recent MCC-based model, called the Comprehensive Minimum Cost Consensus (CMCC) model, adds another constraint related to a parameter γ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] γ∈[0,1] to the above constraint related to the parameter ε ε to enforce modified expert preferences in order to achieve a minimum level of agreement dictated by the consensus threshold 1 − γ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] 1−γ∈[0,1] . This paper attempts to analyze the relationship between the aforementioned constraints in the CMCC models from two different perspectives. The first is based on inequalities and allows simple bounds to be determined to relate the parameters ε ε and γ γ . The second one is based on Convex Polytope Theory and provides algorithms that compute more precise bounds to relate these parameters, and could also be applied to other similar optimization problems. Finally, several examples are provided to illustrate the proposal.},

  abstract     = {Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) service is one of the fastest-growing segments of financial technology in 2021. The BNPL program is a type of short-term finance that allows consumers to make purchases and pay for them interest-free over a predetermined brief period of time, usually weeks or months. In general, BNPL payment is instant-approval and no-credit-check right at checkout. As a result, BNPL payment is appealing to young adults who have existing student loans and cannot access credit. In this paper, we develop a brand-new model interfaced with finance, marketing, and operations in which a young store owner orders a product, receives a BNPL program at checkout with a good-faith down payment, and then pays off the remainder in interest-free installments. The store owner sells the product to consumers with price- and timing-dependent demand. The objective for the store owner is to determine an optimal selling price and replenishment time simultaneously to maximize total profit. We then derive the optimal solution and characterize its properties based on theoretical results. Furthermore, we present three examples and find that the optimal price moving through its life cycle coincides with price skimming. Finally, we perform a sensitivity analysis to gain managerial insights. For instance, an increase in fraction of installments or initial demand significantly raises total profit and order quantity meanwhile tremendously reduces selling price and cycle time. Also, an increase in demand slope or return rate on investment compels the store owner substantially to increase the unit price, cycle time, order quantity, and total profit.},

  abstract     = {The paper focuses on investors whose strength of interest in sustainability issues (such as environmental, social, and governance) causes ESG to become a third criterion alongside risk and return in portfolio selection. This causes the efficient frontier to become an efficient surface. This means that an investor’s optimal portfolio is no longer the point of most preferred risk/return tradeoff on the mean-variance (M-V) efficient frontier, but is the point of most preferred risk/return/ESG tradeoff on the investor’s M-V-ESG efficient surface. However, to find such a point requires non-trivial ESG integration which is the name given to the process of integrating ESG into the portfolio construction process after screening. With the third objective transporting the problem into 3D-space, it is difficult to search the efficient surface in any kind of comprehensive fashion using M-V based or other bi-criterion techniques as this is akin to a 2-dimensional being trying to view a 3-dimensional object. To remedy the situation, the paper proposes a tri-criterion approach that computes efficient surfaces and special non-contour curves (called NC-efficient fronts in the paper) that are stretched across the efficient surface so as to dragnet it for the points of best ESG integration within it. Using the methodology and data from the S&amp;P500, the paper conducts computational tests on problems with up to 500 securities and under different constraint conditions so as to know what to expect from the new approach over a range of situations.},

  abstract     = {We consider a routing problem where orders are transported just-in-time from several suppliers to an original equipment manufacturer (OEM). This implies that shipments cannot be picked up before their release date when they are ready at the supplier and should be delivered as close as possible to their due date to the OEM. Every shipment may have a distinct due date but all shipments loaded onto the same truck arrive at the same time. The performance of the transportation network is optimized by finding an allocation of shipments to trucks and routes for each truck that minimizes the total earliness-tardiness cost. These penalties are caused by deviations between the truck arrival times at the OEM and the due dates of the loaded shipments. To solve the problem, we introduce a metaheuristic approach based on large neighborhood search, which we combine with an efficient local search scheme that allows the evaluation of neighborhood solutions in worst-case logarithmic time despite the nonlinear objective function. Our algorithm can find high-quality solutions to large instances with 200 shipments in less than 12 minutes of CPU time. From a practical perspective, our computational tests indicate that a too small truck fleet or very limited time differences between release and due date can dramatically affect the punctuality of the deliveries.},

  abstract     = {We develop a framework for forecasting multivariate data that follow known linear constraints. This is particularly common in forecasting where some variables are aggregates of others, commonly referred to as hierarchical time series, but also arises in other prediction settings. For point forecasting, an increasingly popular technique is reconciliation, whereby forecasts are made for all series (so-called base forecasts) and subsequently adjusted to cohere with the constraints. We extend reconciliation from point forecasting to probabilistic forecasting. A novel definition of reconciliation is developed and used to construct densities and draw samples from a reconciled probabilistic forecast. In the elliptical case, we prove that true predictive distributions can be recovered using reconciliation even when the location and scale of base predictions are chosen arbitrarily. Reconciliation weights are estimated to optimise energy or variogram score. The log score is not considered since it is improper when comparing unreconciled to reconciled forecasts, a result also proved in this paper. Due to randomness in the objective function, optimisation uses stochastic gradient descent. This method improves upon base forecasts in simulated and empirical data, particularly when the base forecasting models are severely misspecified. For milder misspecification, extending popular reconciliation methods for point forecasting results in similar performance to score optimisation.},

Compared with original brand consumables, remanufactured and compatible consumables enjoy a cost advantage, but they suffer from different consumer trust discounts in the market. In order to capture the scenarios that before and after compatible products enter, we develop two independent static game models and explore equilibrium market structures for three types of consumables. Surprisingly, we find that (1) the more obscure consumer trust in remanufactured and compatible products, the more favorable to the coexistence of the three products, however, the appropriate distinction between remanufactured and compatible products is beneficial to a remanufacturer; (2) reduction of the failure rate by the remanufacturer will give free-riding opportunities to compatible products that also have non-original brand characteristics; and (3) the entry of compatible products cannot always improve consumer surplus and social welfare. These findings provide management suggestions for three types of manufacturing enterprises to sort out their competitive relationships, and also give policy implications for the government to promote the remanufacturing industry.},

In this study, we present a series of constraint programming models to optimally solve the premarshalling problem. Extensive computational comparisons show that the best proposed constraint programming formulation yields better results than the state-of-the-art integer programming approach. A salient finding in this paper is that the logic behind the model construction in constraint programming is radically different from that of more traditional mixed integer linear programming models.},

  abstract     = {Given the emergence of two-echelon distribution systems in several practical contexts, this paper tackles, at the strategic level, a distribution network design problem under uncertainty. This problem is defined as the two-echelon stochastic multi-period capacitated location-routing problem (2E-SM-CLRP). It considers a network partitioned into two capacitated distribution echelons: each echelon involves a specific location-assignment-transportation schema that must cope with the future demand. It aims to decide the number and location of warehousing/storage platforms (WPs) and distribution/fulfillment platforms (DPs), and on the capacity allocated from first echelon to second echelon platforms. In the second echelon, the goal is to construct vehicle routes that visit ship-to locations (SLs) from operating distribution platforms under a stochastic and time-varying demand and varying costs. This problem is modeled as a two-stage stochastic program with integer recourse, where the first-stage includes location and capacity decisions to be fixed at each period over the planning horizon, while routing decisions of the second echelon are determined in the recourse problem. We propose a logic-based Benders decomposition approach to solve this model. In the proposed approach, the location and capacity decisions are taken by solving the Benders master problem. After these first-stage decisions are fixed, the resulting sub-problem is a capacitated vehicle-routing problem with capacitated multiple depots (CVRP-CMD) that is solved by a branch-cut-and-price algorithm. Computational experiments show that instances of realistic size can be solved optimally within a reasonable time and provide relevant managerial insights on the impact of the stochastic and multi-period settings on the 2E-CLRP.},

We find that the ICO will be successful if and only if the capacity-cost-to-customer-valuation ratio is low. There may also exist multiple equivalent ICO decisions that yield the same revenue for the firm. We also compared the ICO mechanism with the traditional bank-financing mechanism. We find that when the capacity cost is low, the ICO mechanism is better than the bank-financing mechanism. We also explore the impact of the speculator’s risk attitude on the firm’s profitability. In general, the firm will be better-off when the speculator (those who participates in the ICO and trades tokens) is more risk-seeking.},

To move larger volumes more cost effectively, express carriers use sort technologies to consolidate parcels that share similar geographic and service characteristics for reduced per-unit handling and transportation costs. This paper focuses on an operational planning problem that arises in two-stage sort systems operating within parcel transportation networks. In this context, primary sorters perform an initial grouping of parcels into “piles” that are subsequently dispatched when necessary to secondary sorters; there, each pile’s parcels are fine-sorted based on their final destinations and service class for packing into outbound transportation vehicles. Such systems must be designed to handle a high degree of uncertainty in the quantity and timing of arriving parcels, yet must also group and sort the parcels to meet tight departure deadlines. Thus motivated, this paper presents robust planning models that assign parcels to sort equipment while protecting against different sources of demand uncertainty commonly faced by parcel carriers. We demonstrate the computational viability of the proposed models using realistic-sized instances based on industry data, and show their value in providing sort plan alternatives that trade off operational costs and levels of robustness.},

We model the DVRPSR as a multi-stage optimization problem, where the first-stage decision defines route plans for serving scheduled requests. Our main contributions are knapsack-based linear models to approximate accurately the expected reward-to-go, measured as the number of accepted requests, at any state of the stochastic system. These approximations are based on representing each vehicle as a knapsack with a capacity given by the remaining service time available along the vehicle’s route. We combine these approximations with optimal acceptance and assignment decision rules and derive efficient and high-performing online scheduling policies. We further leverage good predictions of the expected reward-to-go to design initial route plans that facilitate serving dynamic requests. Computational experiments on very large instances based on a real street network demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in prescribing high-quality offline route plans and online scheduling decisions.},

  abstract     = {The branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) procedure is one of the most widely used techniques to get optimal solutions for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). Recently, various components from the literature have been assembled by Coelho and Vanhoucke (2018) into a unified search algorithm using the best performing lower bounds, branching schemes, search strategies, and dominance rules. However, due to the high computational time, this procedure is only suitable to solve small to medium-sized problems. Moreover, despite its relatively good performance, not much is known about which components perform best, and how these components should be combined into a procedure to maximize chances to solve the problem. This paper introduces a structured prediction approach to rank various combinations of components (configurations) of the integrated B&amp;B procedure. More specifically, two regression methods are used to map project indicators to a full ranking of configurations. The objective is to provide preference information about the quality of different configurations to obtain the best possible solution. Using such models, the ranking of all configurations can be predicted, and these predictions are then used to get the best possible solution for a new project with known network and resource values. A computational experiment is conducted to verify the performance of this novel approach. Furthermore, the models are tested for 48 different configurations, and their robustness is investigated on datasets with different numbers of activities. The results show that the two models are very competitive, and both can generate significantly better results than any single-best configuration.},

We present an efficient ( 3 / 2 3/2 )-approximation algorithm with time complexity O ( n m log ( n m ) ) O(nmlog(nm)) (for m &gt; n m&amp;gt;n ) and O ( n 2 log n ) O(n2logn) (for m ≤ n m≤n ).

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the two-dimensional Variable-Sized Cutting Stock Problem (2D-VSCSP) with guillotine constraint, applied to the home textile industry. This is a challenging class of real-world problems where, given a set of predefined widths of fabric rolls and a set of piece types, the goal is to decide the widths and lengths of the fabric rolls to be produced, and to generate the cutting patterns to cut all demanded pieces. Each piece type considered has a rectangular shape with a specific width and length and a fixed demand to be respected. The main objective function is to minimize the total amount of the textile materials produced/cut to satisfy the demand. According to Wäscher, Haußner, &amp; Schumann (2007), the addressed problem is a Cutting Stock Problem (CSP), as the demand for each item is greater than one. However, in the real-world application at stake, the demand for each item type is not very high (below ten for all item types). Therefore, addressing the problem as a Bin-Packing Problem (BPP), in which all items are considered to be different and have a unitary demand, was a possibility. For this reason, two approaches to solve the problems were devised, implemented, and tested: (1) a CSP model, based on the well-known Lodi and Monaci (2003) model (3 variants), and (2) an original BPP-based model. Our research shows that, for this level of demand, the new BPP model is more competitive than CSP models. We analyzed these different models and described their characteristics, namely the size and the quality of the linear programming relaxation bound for solving the basic mono-objective variant of the problem. We also propose an ϵ − ϵ− constraint approach to deal with a bi-objective extension of the problem, in which the number of cutting patterns used must also be minimized. The quality of the models was evaluated through computational experiments on randomly generated instances, yielding promising results.},

  abstract     = {We discuss minimum weight clustered dominating trees that find applications in the wireless sensor network design based on a clustered independent set structure. A cluster consists of a master sensor and the sensors belonging to its sensing radius. Masters collect, filter, and transmit the sensed data to a central sensor responsible for processing all sensed information. The data sent from a cluster to the central sensor follow a unique path. It alternates between a master and a bridge node, in this order. A bridge allows data communication between two neighboring clusters. The larger the distance between masters and bridges, the higher the energy consumption for data transmission. To reduce energy consumption and increase the network lifetime, we investigate a clustered tree structure of minimum total link distances. We propose hop- and flow-based models, introduce valid inequalities for them, and discuss five exponential families of cuts when embedded into the branch-and-cut framework of the CPLEX solver. Our models benefit properly of the CPLEX Benders’ decomposition. We also highlight the differences between the topology of the clustered tree of minimum cost and the one of the (non-clustered) minimum dominating tree of the corresponding instances in terms of cost and number of solution nodes.},

Specifically, for the first model, its optimal solution is represented analytically, and thus determined precisely. The second and third ones can be solved exactly for small and medium, and approximately with high accuracy within reasonable time for large scale projects.

  abstract     = {In logistics and mobility services, new business models such as “attended home delivery”, “same-day delivery”, and “mobility-on-demand” have been successfully established over the last decade. They have in common that customers order online, while the services are provided offline. To make such online-to-offline services profitable, the efficient operation of a vehicle fleet is an essential prerequisite. Therefore, researchers began to explore approaches for integrating demand management and vehicle routing to support such operations, and a rapidly growing body of literature emerged. However, due to the diversity of existing business models, the analysis and comparison of decision problems and solution concepts are challenging, especially across applications, making the search for appropriate models and algorithms for new problem settings non-trivial. Therefore, in this survey, we structure this innovative research area and review the existing literature from a methodological perspective. We present a generalized problem definition of integrated demand management and vehicle routing, derive a high-level formulation for the underlying sequential decision process, and present a corresponding mathematical model. We then describe and characterize solution concepts and algorithms from the literature in a structured way. We also present a tabular overview of the literature that connects applications and problem characteristics with solution concepts and allows researchers to quickly step through already studied combinations. Finally, we comment on the state-of-the-art from a cross-application perspective and discuss future research opportunities.},

Indeed, according to CryptoQuant, almost $80 billion of positions on centralised exchanges were liquidated during 2021, that is an average of over $200 million per day. So hedgers of bitcoin price risk should account for the possibility of automatic liquidation when taking positions on bitcoin futures. We derive a semi-closed form for an optimal hedging strategy with dual objectives – to minimize both the variance of the hedged portfolio and the probability of liquidation due to insufficient collateral. The solution depends on the statistical characteristics of the spot and futures extreme returns, and other parameters that characterize the hedger by choice of leverage, loss aversion and collateral management. An empirical analysis based on minute-level data compares the performance of the major direct and inverse bitcoin hedging instruments traded on five major exchanges.},

We also analyze the impacts of hybrid reverse factoring (an extension of the reverse factoring programme) on supply chain profit. We find that the supply chain finance programme with reverse factoring brings higher profits to the manufacturer and retailer than the other programmes. However, when the market size is sufficiently large, the trade credit programme generates a higher total supply chain profit than the other programmes. We also find that the retailer and manufacturer prefer reverse factoring and non-reverse factoring to hybrid reverse factoring, even though the total supply chain profit is almost equal in both cases.

Firms invest in production capacity and R&amp;D knowledge stock, where the R&amp;D knowledge stock and the current R&amp;D investment determine the hazard rate of innovation. Our findings show that the firms’ optimal R&amp;D strategies are driven by a subtle interplay between the relative positions of their R&amp;D knowledge stocks and their current relative positions on the established market. First, we find that under symmetric investment costs the knowledge leader should spend more on R&amp;D than the knowledge laggard only if it has a substantially smaller market share on the established market. If the knowledge leader’s market share is sufficiently large, its optimal investment in R&amp;D is so small that its innovation rate is lower than the knowledge laggard’s. Second, optimal investment in R&amp;D knowledge is negatively affected by the opponent’s production capacity on the established market if the competitor has not innovated yet. However, we find that this effect is reversed after the competitor has successfully introduced the new product on the submarket. Third, the manufacturing firm with higher costs of adjusting production capacity for the established product has a higher incentive to engage in product innovation and might even achieve a higher total discounted profit than its more efficient competitor.},

However, modeling and optimizing a biorefinery plant’s operations is challenging and requires innovative approaches and solutions. In this paper, we model and solve the integrated production and distribution scheduling problem faced by an industrial partner. We propose three models for the waste valorization production and distribution scheduling problem: a time-discretized integer linear program, and two mixed-integer linear program with continuous timing variables. Moreover, several powerful and problem-specific valid inequalities and variable reduction procedures are proposed. We study some variants of the problem and propose a simple heuristic algorithm that mimics the logic of a decision maker. Through a series of computational experiments, we determine how critical operational parameters affect the performance of the system and demonstrate how significant improvements can be achieved in our industrial partner’s biorefinery plant.},

The model proves to be a considerable improvement on linear regression, and the advanced performance metrics further improve the predictions.

However, extant BFP research that incorporates textual company information is very scarce. Based on a dataset containing 13,571 European companies provided by the largest European data aggregator, this study investigates the added value of extending traditional BFP models with textual website content. We further benchmark various feature extraction techniques in natural language processing (i.e. the vector-space approach, neural networks-based approaches and transformers) and assess the best way of representing and integrating textual website features for BFP modelling. The results confirm that including textual website data improves BFP predictive performance, and that textual features extracted by transformers add the most value to the BFP models in this benchmark setting.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel multivariate shortfall risk measure to evaluate the systemic risk of a financial system, where the allocation weight is scenario-dependent and optimally chosen from a predetermined feasible set, and examine its properties such as (quasi-)convexity and translation invariance. To compute the proposed risk measure, we reformulate it as a two-stage stochastic program. When the underlying risk is discretely distributed, the second-stage program is a finite convex program while for the continuous case, is a semi-infinite program. To tackle the latter, we use the polynomial decision rule to approximate it and reformulate it as a tractable optimization program via the standard sums-of-squares techniques. Some convergence results are established for the approximation scheme. Moreover, we apply the proposed risk measure to the risk capital allocation problem and introduce the scenario-dependent allocation strategy. In contrast to the existing allocation methods, the new approach considers losses of all scenarios and minimizes the systemic risk. We then carry out some numerical tests on the proposed model and computational schemes for a continuous system, a discrete system, and a risk capital allocation problem in life insurance. The results show that our allocation strategy performs better than the Euler allocation rule based on the expected shortfall and the method by Armenti et al., 2018, and is robust to the (un-)systemic changes of the considered dataset. Finally, we extend our model by incorporating the cost of risk capital and investigate its impact on the optimal total amount of risk capital.},

  abstract     = {To analyze a strategic conflict involving composite decision makers (CDMs), this paper uses the methodology of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR). A CDM is a group of individuals with differing decision characteristics – conservative or aggressive – any one of whom can make a decision on behalf of the group. In our model, a conservative CDM makes moves that take into account the interests of all group members, aiming to protect each one from possible sanctions; an aggressive CDM gives priority to some individuals that will benefit and does not necessarily consider the interests of other group members when making moves. Based on these different decision characteristics, two versions of hesitant fuzzy stability definitions, indexed I and II , are proposed. To facilitate the stability analysis of the graph model with multiple decision makers (DMs), including at least one CDM, a matrix-based method called Matrix Representation for Hesitant Fuzzy Stability is developed to identify the equilibria of the model, or states that are stable for all DMs and are therefore possible resolutions of the conflict. A water resource conflict in the Lancang-Mekong River basin is utilized to demonstrate the system. The results reveal how the decision characteristics of CDMs can influence the equilibria of a conflict.},

  abstract     = {Dealing with multi-objective problems by using generation methods has some interesting advantages since it provides the decision-maker with the complete information about the set of non-dominated criterion vectors (Pareto front) and a clear overview of the different trade-offs of the problem. However, providing many solutions to the decision-maker may also be overwhelming. As an alternative approach, showing a representative set of the Pareto front may be advantageous. Choosing such a representative set is by itself also a multi-objective problem that must consider the number of alternatives to present, the uniformity, and/or the coverage of the representation, to guarantee its quality. This paper proposes three algorithms for the representation problem for multi-objective integer linear programming problems with two or more objective functions, each one of them dealing with each dimension of the problem (cardinality, coverage, and uniformity). Such algorithms are all based on the ϵ ϵ -constraint approach. In addition, the paper also presents strategies to overcome poor estimations of the Pareto front bounds. The algorithms were tested on the ability to efficiently generate the whole Pareto front or a representation of it. The uniformity and cardinality algorithms proved to be very efficient both on binary and on integer problems, being amongst the best in the literature. Both coverage and uniformity algorithms provide good quality representations on their targeted objective, while the cardinality algorithm appears to be the most flexible, privileging uniformity for lower cardinality representations and coverage on higher cardinality.},

In the regulation game, the operating costs of sub-units are divided into several cost levels. To describe the unknown cost levels, a nested frontier-based approach, called context-dependent data envelopment analysis (CD-DEA), is introduced. By using CD-DEA, the efficient feasible incentive contract to the regulation game is proposed, and the condition that guarantees optimality of the proposed contract is also presented. Moreover, the efficient feasible incentive contract shows that the best responses of sub-units in the regulation game are to announce their actual cost levels, which constitute the Nash equilibrium. Several discussions are further provided to ensure the applicability of the proposed approach in realistic environments.

Specifically, we study three operational drivers of abandonment – waiting time, queue length, and service rate – within the context of a hospital emergency department (ED) where patients often leave without being seen by a physician. We examine the shape of the hazard function for these patients and identify a dynamic Weibull distribution that is parameterized by queue length and service rate, effectively characterizes abandonment behavior in this context. We conduct a numerical study and demonstrate the benefit of using state-dependent abandonment times. Specifically, we show that a scaled arrival model that overlooks abandonment behavior, a prevailing model in discrete-event simulations of the ED, results in significant bias in resource planning (e.g., staffing levels, bed capacity, etc.) and performs poorly compared to our proposed Weibull model.

In this problem, there is a mixture of known demand and uncertain future demand. Prior to having full knowledge of the demand, we must decide upon how many jobs we plan to complete on each day in the planning horizon. Any jobs that are not completed by the end of their due date incur a cost and become due the following day. We present two distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) models for this problem. The first is a non-parametric model with a phi-divergence based ambiguity set. The second is a parametric model, where we treat the number of uncertain jobs due on each day as a binomial random variable with an unknown success probability. We reformulate the parametric model as a mixed integer program and find that it scales poorly with the sizes of the ambiguity and uncertainty sets. Hence, we make use of theoretical properties of the binomial distribution to derive fast heuristics based on dimension reduction. One is based on cutting surface algorithms commonly seen in the DRO literature. The other operates on a small subset of the uncertainty set for the future demand. We perform extensive computational experiments to establish the performance of our algorithms. We compare decisions from the parametric and non-parametric models, to assess the benefit of including the binomial information.},

Discrete choice modeling lies at the core of this challenge, yet existing models do not sufficiently account for the complex shopping behavior of customers in an omnichannel environment. In this paper, we introduce a discrete choice model called the multichannel attraction model (MAM). A key feature of the MAM is that it specifically accounts for both the product substitution behavior of customers within each channel and the switching behavior between channels. We formulate the corresponding assortment optimization problem as a mixed integer linear program and provide a computationally efficient heuristic method that can be readily used for obtaining high-quality solutions in large-scale omnichannel environments. We also present three different methods to estimate the MAM parameters based on aggregate sales transaction data. Finally, we describe general effects of the implementation of widely-used omnichannel initiatives on the MAM parameters, and carry out numerical experiments to explore the structure of optimal assortments, thereby gaining new insights into omnichannel assortment optimization. Our work provides the analytical framework for future studies to assess the impact of different omnichannel initiatives.},

  abstract     = {This study extends the multi-depot vehicle scheduling problem with time windows (MDVSPTW) to the case of electric vehicles which can recharge at charging stations located at any point of the service operation area. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear model for the electric bus multi-depot vehicle scheduling problem with time windows (EB-MDVSPTW). Our formulation considers not only the operational cost of vehicles, but also the waiting times. In addition, it explicitly considers the capacity of charging stations and prohibits the simultaneous charging of different vehicles at the same charger. Chargers are modeled as task nodes of an extended network and can be placed at any location utilizing the charging infrastructure of a city instead of using only bus-dedicated chargers. Further, we linearize the MINLP formulation of the EB-MDVSPTW by reformulating it to a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that can be solved to global optimality. Because EB-MDVSPTW is NP-Hard, we also introduce valid inequalities to tighten the search space of the MILP and we investigate the trade-off between the compactness and the tightness of the problem in benchmark instances with up to 30 trips. In the numerical experiments, we show that the valid inequalities reduce the problem’s compactness by increasing up to three times the number of constraints, but, at the same time, improve tightness resulting in computational time improvements of up to 73\% in 20-trip instances. The implementation of our exact approach is demonstrated in a toy network and in the benchmark instances of Carpaneto et al. (1989).},

  abstract     = {The refueling station location problem with routing (RSLP-R) is defined as a maximal coverage problem that locates alternative fuel refueling stations (AFSs) on a road network to maximize the refueled alternative fuel vehicle flows by considering the limited range of vehicles and the willingness of drivers to deviate from their paths for refueling. In this study, we introduce the robust counterpart of RSLP-R using a decision-dependent polyhedral uncertainty set. We model the flow uncertainty set using a hybrid model that comprises a hose model and individual flow bounds. To take into account the fact that vehicle flows are affected by AFS deployment decisions in their neighborhoods, we incorporate the decision-dependency notion into the flow uncertainty set. We propose two linear mixed integer programming formulations and a Benders reformulation. Our computational experiments on instances based on the road network of Belgium confirm the effectiveness of the reformulation in solving larger instances. We also report the results of experiments to assess the value of incorporating uncertainty and decision-dependency into the problem.},

  abstract     = {Cleaning debris in urban areas after major disasters is very relevant to inhabitants to recover from their effects. In natural disasters, an unexpected and large area can be affected. Moreover, the time and the costs to perform the cleaning operations can be very high. In this work, the integrated multi-period scheduling routing problem to clean debris (SRP-CD) after major disasters is investigated. The problem includes strategical (scheduling) and operational (routing) decisions and, considering complex issues such as two levels of synchronization between work-troops and dump trucks. The goal of SRP-CD is twofold: minimizing the number of days for the overall cleaning, in the strategical level; and minimizing the total costs of vehicles routes in the operational level. A new mathematical model based in a dynamic multi-flow formulation, constructive heuristics and Large Neighborhood Search (LNS)-based metaheuristics are proposed. Comparison experiments for the model and the approaches are carried out, to measure performance and robustness of the proposed methods. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first contributions in the literature for SRP-CD, including all aspects addressed here.},

E-sellers can buy RI to offer it to consumers (Strategy O) or allow consumers to buy it (Strategy N). This paper develops a duopoly model to investigate how this new practice (introducing RI) affects the pricing strategies and demand of two e-sellers with different qualities and their RI decisions (producing four scenarios: NN, NO, ON, OO). First, we confirm that the introduction of RI does not necessarily lead to market expansion. The increase in demand of the low-quality e-seller (E-seller L) hinges on its low RI premium, the competitor&#39;s high RI premium, and the high return-freight compensation. Counterintuitively, the high return-freight compensation may prevent consumers from buying from the high-quality e-seller (E-seller H) who offers RI. Second, in contrast to E-seller L, E-seller H is inclined to lower the selling price if RI is introduced. In an online platform with RI, offering RI will induce e-sellers to increase their selling prices. Third, e-sellers prefer to offer RI only if the RI premium is low, the probability of product fit is low, and the return-freight compensation is high. The RI premium is the most important, and the probability of product fit is more important than the return-freight compensation. An interesting result is that the e-seller&#39;s preference for offering RI is not affected by the competitor&#39;s RI decision. Therefore, the equilibrium scenario can be NN, NO, ON, or OO.},

  abstract     = {Real-life parallel machine scheduling problems can be characterized by: (i) limited information about the exact task duration at the scheduling time, and (ii) an opportunity to reschedule the remaining tasks each time a task processing is completed and a machine becomes idle. Robust optimization is the natural methodology to cope with the first characteristic of duration uncertainty, yet the existing literature on robust scheduling does not explicitly consider the second characteristic the possibility to adjust decisions as more information about the tasks duration becomes available, despite that re-optimizing the schedule every time new information emerges is standard practice. In this paper, we develop an adaptive robust optimization scheduling approach that takes into account, at the beginning of the planning horizon, the possibility that scheduling decisions can be adjusted. We demonstrate that the suggested approach can lead to better here-and-now decisions and better makespan guarantees. To that end, we develop the first mixed integer linear programming model for adaptive robust scheduling, and a two-stage approximation heuristic, where we minimize the worst-case makespan. Using this model, we show via a numerical study that adaptive scheduling leads to solutions with better and more stable makespan realizations compared to static approaches.},

More specially, the memory properties of fractional-order calculus is incorporated into onlooker bee phase to improve the local-search capability. Each time generating a new candidate solution, the previous foraging behaviors stored in memory are referred. Another enhanced search strategy is adopted in employed bee phase to avoid losing the balance between diversification and intensification.

The GSC members’ equilibrium solutions and payoffs are examined under each information structure. The retailer&#39;s information disclosure strategies under voluntary disclosure are further analyzed. Finally, we identify GSC members’ best information structure option. The results show that the supplier always prefers mandatory disclosure, while the retailer&#39;s preference depends on the joint impact of the wholesale price and the greenness level on demand. When the joint impact is higher (lower) than a specific threshold, the retailer favors no disclosure (mandatory disclosure). Regardless of the joint impact faced by the retailer, voluntary disclosure is always a robust compromise, attractive to the retailer.

In this study, we review, compare and analyze first-order methods for CHMP, namely, Frank-Wolfe type methods, Projected Gradient methods and a recently introduced geometric algorithm, called Triangle Algorithm (TA). We discuss the connections between this algorithm and Frank-Wolfe, showing that TA can be interpreted as an inexact Frank-Wolfe. Despite this similarity, TA is strongly based on a theorem of alternatives known as distance duality. By using this theorem, we propose suitable stopping criteria for CHMP to be integrated into Frank-Wolfe type and Projected Gradient, specializing these methods to the membership decision problem. Interestingly, Frank-Wolfe integrated with such stopping criteria coincides with a greedy version of the Triangle Algorithm which is, in its turn, equivalent to an algorithm due to von Neumann. We report numerical experiments on random instances of CHMP, carefully designed to cover different scenarios, that indicate which algorithm is preferable according to the geometry of the convex hull and the relative position of the query point. Concerning potential applications, we present two illustrative examples, one related to linear programming feasibility problems and another related to image classification problems.},

This paper attempts to understand such a target’s sellout timing and pricing decisions by developing a target-initiated model, in which the firm randomly and periodically meets high- and low-type acquirers and makes take-it-or-leave-it price offers. The model captures the illiquidity and heterogeneity of sellout opportunities. Optimally, the firm takes either a high-price strategy—making only a high-price offer in a good economic state— or a flexible strategy—even making a low-price offer in a very good economic state— based on a tradeoff between sellout pricing and timing efficiency. With higher frequency and heterogeneity of acquirers, the firm makes a high-price offer more eagerly and a low-price offer more restrictively. With asymmetric information, where the acquirer types are unobservable, the firm reduces the acquirer’s information rent by making a high-price offer more eagerly and restricting a low-price offer more severely. With higher economic state volatility, the low-type sellout probability increases because the economic state has a higher potential to increase beyond the low-price sellout threshold. The jump in firm value at the sellout time (i.e., target stock price reaction) is not monotonic with respect to the economic state and arrival rate due to the interactions between the sellout price and timing.},

  abstract     = {Modern life insurance policies embed a surrender option that entitles policyholders to terminate their policy early for its cash value. Mass surrenders–spiking surrenders of life insurance policies within a short period–are widely documented prior to many life insurer failures, but their impacts on insurers are rarely quantified. This paper builds a model of mass surrenders in a heterogeneous pool consisting of a minority of financially guided policyholders who make rational surrender decisions and a majority of individual policyholders who are subject to herd. By revising the self-excitation in the Hawkes process to a contingent event-accumulation-excitation, we introduce a history-dependent surrender process for the individuals whose contagious behavior can be triggered contingent on past surrenders becoming salient. We then incorporate it into a life insurance pricing framework and study mass surrenders’ impacts on contract valuation and default risk of the insurer, allowing for its structural default under regulatory solvency intervention. Our numerical results show that while contagion aligns individual policyholders’ surrender behavior with the optimal surrender of financially guided ones, it jeopardizes their financial positions in favor of equity holders. Surprisingly, surrender contagion only mildly enlarges an insurer’s bankruptcy rate, which is not driven by strict solvency regulation. Despite its public perception of posing a significant risk to insurers as similar to a bank run, surrender contagion does not critically threaten insurers’ solvency: To prevent insurers’ bankruptcies, their investment riskiness and leverage pose more of a concern to regulators.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the estimation of semiparametric spatial stochastic frontier (SF) models, in which the spatial dependence is modeled by adding the spatially lagged dependent variable as an additional independent variable (following the convention of spatial autoregressive models) and specifying various spatial structures on the inefficiency and/or idiosyncratic error. Thus, the proposed models are inclusive compared with most previous studies. Efficiency modeling in the SF literature has not given enough attention to the spatial interaction of inefficiency, primarily because the estimation of inefficiency in spatial models is challenging using the conventional maximum likelihood method. Therefore, we propose a two-step estimation procedure for our spatial frontier models under the framework of the generalized method of moments (GMM). The proposed method is easy to implement. Further, Monte Carlo Simulations show that our GMM estimators have good finite-sample performance. We apply our GMM estimators to examine the technical efficiency of 41 European countries and the effects of spatial dependence on production (GDP).},

  abstract     = {Military air battle managers face several challenges when directing operations during quickly evolving combat scenarios. These scenarios require rapid assignment decisions to engage moving targets having dynamic flight paths. In defensive operations, the success of a sequence of air battle management decisions is reflected by the friendly force’s ability to maintain air superiority and defend friendly assets. We develop a Markov decision process (MDP) model of a stochastic dynamic assignment problem, named the Air Battle Management Problem (ABMP), wherein a set of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAV) must defend an asset from cruise missiles arriving stochastically over time. Attaining an exact solution using traditional dynamic programming techniques is computationally intractable. Hence, we utilize an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) technique known as approximate policy iteration with least squares temporal differences (API-LSTD) learning to find high-quality solutions to the ABMP. We create a simulation environment in conjunction with a generic yet representative combat scenario to illustrate how the ADP solution compares in quality to a reasonable, closest-intercept benchmark policy. Our API-LSTD policy improves mean success rate by 2.8\% compared to the benchmark policy and offers an 81.7\% increase in the frequency with which the policy performs perfectly. Moreover, we find the increased success rate of the ADP policy is, on average, equivalent to the success rate attained by the benchmark policy when using a 20\% faster UCAV. These results inform military force management and defense acquisition decisions and aid in the development of more effective tactics, techniques, and procedures.},

Thus, in order to solve realistic instances in a reasonable amount of time, two heuristics are proposed. The first one applies machine learning techniques in order to quickly select the majority of the items, while the second makes use of genetic algorithms to solve the problem.

  abstract     = {We study a new variant of the vehicle routing problem, called the Mobile Production Vehicle Routing Problem (MoP-VRP). In this problem, vehicles are equipped with 3D printers, and production takes place on the way to the customer. The objective is to minimize the weighted cost incurred by travel and delay of service. We formulate a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and develop an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) heuristic for this problem. To show the advantage of mobile production, we compare the problem with the Central Production Vehicle Routing Problem (CP-VRP), where production takes place in a central depot. We also propose an efficient ALNS for the CP-VRP. We generate benchmark instances based on Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) benchmark instances, and realistic instances based on real-life data provided by the Danish Company 3D Printhuset. Overall, the proposed ALNS for both problems are efficient, and we solve instances up to 200 customers within a short computational time. We test different scenarios with varying numbers of machines in each vehicle, as well as different production time. The results show that these are the key factors that influence travel and delay costs. The key advantage of mobile production is flexibility: it can shorten the time span from the start of production to the delivery of products, and at the same time lower delivery costs. Moreover, long-term cost estimations show that this technology has low operation costs and thus is feasible in real life practice.},

We find that machine learning methods have higher prediction accuracy compared to linear models with the differences being larger for longer prediction horizons. The likely reason for this is the presence of stronger interaction effects for longer prediction horizons compared to short horizons. Among all methods, tree-boosting has the highest prediction accuracy. Further, the frailty component of the newly proposed “LaGaBoost frailty model” is overall large and exhibits strong variation over time. In contrast to prior research, we find that upper tail predictions of loan portfolio losses of frailty models are not consistently higher throughout time compared to models ignoring frailty correlation, but they show more temporal variation.},

These issues are viewed through a real-options lens and we develop an SIRD-like continuous-time Markov chain model to analyze a sequence of options: the option to intervene and introduce measures and, after intervention has started, the option to remove these. Measures can be imposed multiple times. We implement our model using estimates from empirical studies and, under fairly general assumptions, our main conclusions are that: (1) measures should be put in place not long after the first infections occur; (2) if the epidemic is discovered when there are many infected individuals already, then it is optimal never to introduce measures; (3) once the decision to introduce measures has been taken, these should stay in place until the number of susceptible or infected members of the population is close to zero; (4) it is never optimal to introduce a tier system to phase-in measures but it is optimal to use a tier system to phase-out measures; (5) a more infectious variant may reduce the duration of measures being in place; (6) the risk of infections being brought in by travelers should be curbed even when no other measures are in place.

The first stage samples risk factors that specify a second stage simulation optimization problem. The second stage solves a simulation optimization problem and outputs the best performance of the system under the realized risk factors, which are then aggregated across all first stage samples to produce an estimate of the risk measure. Applications of such an estimation scheme arise frequently in important industries such as financial, healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing. Because a large number of first stage samples are typically needed, each of which requires solving a computationally expensive simulation optimization problem, the two-stage simulation optimization approach faces a major computational efficiency challenge. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a sequential simulation budget allocation procedure that determines the allocation of simulation budget based on a score known as revised probability of sign change for each decision under each scenario. The consistency of the proposed procedure is proved and the computational efficiency gain of the proposed is demonstrated using both benchmark test functions and two test cases in the context of financial portfolio risk estimation and healthcare system resilience estimation.},

The retailer also manages online product returns by selecting appropriate return policies. A robust omnichannel pricing and ordering optimization model is proposed with two, i.e., a full-refund and a no-refund, return policies. The online demand and the offline demand depend on the prices of the e-store and the brick-and-mortar stores, where the online demand also depends on the refund of the e-store. A linearization technique is adopted to deal with nonlinearity of the model. A data-driven robust optimization approach is used to construct uncertainty sets based on available historical data using support vector clustering to handle demand uncertainties. Furthermore, the proposed model is transformed into an approximate mixed integer linear programming model which can be solved by using commercial software. An electronics retailer in China is used as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model and the solution method. A comparison with the box uncertainty set reveals that the data-driven uncertainty set is less conservative and performs better by obtaining higher profit for the retailer. Furthermore, sensitive analysis results indicate that return policies and the return rate of the product affect the optimal pricing and ordering decisions and the total profit.},

In this work, we introduce two exact algorithms for determining the Kemeny ranking. The best of these algorithms guarantees a reasonable search time up to 14 alternatives, showing an important reduction of the execution time in comparison to other algorithms found in the literature.

The classification methods designed with the new rules fulfill a set of fundamental properties, as the ones stated for ELECTRE TRI. The conditions required to the limiting and the representative profiles are weakened by eliminating the dominance-based separability requirements of other popular pairwise classification methods. Since reflexivity is the single condition on S , many ordinal classification methods can be obtained from our proposal. Each method consists of two correlative assignment rules that have relevant symmetry and must be applied together. The “pessimistic” and “optimistic” ELECTRE TRI-nB procedures, the descending and ascending ELECTRE TRI-nC procedures, their hierarchical extensions with interacting criteria, and some recent interval extensions of these methods are basically particular cases of the generalized framework.},

The first approach does not always guarantee a valid Markov chain, whereas the second one can. We show that both construction methods yield a first-order simulation scheme, which can capture the sticky behavior and is free from the curse of dimensionality.

  abstract     = {Investigating stability of stochastic programs with respect to changes in the underlying probability distributions represents an important step before deploying any model to production. Often, the uncertainty in stochastic programs is not perfectly known, thus it is approximated. The stochastic distribution’s misspecification and approximation errors can affect model solution, consequently leading to suboptimal decisions. It is of utmost importance to be aware of such errors and to have an estimate of their influence on the model solution. One approach, which estimates the possible impact of such errors, is the contamination technique. The methodology studies the effect of perturbation in the probability distribution by some contaminating distribution on the optimal value of stochastic programs. Lower and upper bounds, for the optimal values of perturbed stochastic programs, have been developed for numerous types of stochastic programs with exogenous randomness. In this paper, we first extend the current results by developing a tighter lower bound applicable to wider range of problems. Thereafter, we define contamination for decision-dependent randomness stochastic programs and prove various lower and upper bounds.

  abstract     = {This research describes the development and application of a 3-player game theoretic model between two queueing systems and a service that distributes individuals to them. The resultant model is used to explore dynamics between all players. The first aspect of this work is the development of a queueing system with two consecutive waiting spaces where the strategic managerial behaviour corresponds to how individuals use these waiting spaces. Two modelling techniques are deployed: discrete event simulation and Markov chains. The state probabilities of the Markov chain system are used to extract the performance measures of the queueing model (e.g. mean time in each waiting room, mean number of individuals in each room, etc.). A 3-player game theoretic model is subsequently proposed between the two queueing systems and the service that distributes individuals to them. In particular this can be viewed as a 2-player normal-form game where the utilities are determined by a third player with its own strategies and objectives. A backwards induction technique is used to get the utilities of the normal-form game between the two queueing systems. This particular system has many applications, including those in healthcare where it captures the emergent behaviour between the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and the Emergency Department (ED). The impact of time-target measures on patient well-being is explored in this paper.},

This paper analytically characterizes the optimal operational strategies for the platform supply chain with the two different channel modes. The paper also conducts a comprehensive comparison between the two channel modes, by which an analytical examination is developed to reveal how to select the optimal channel modes and the critical factors affecting this choice in the platform supply chain.

  abstract     = {Shared mobility systems have become a frequently used inner-city mobility option. In particular, free-floating shared mobility systems are experiencing strong growth compared to station-based systems. For both, many approaches have been proposed to optimize operations, e.g., through pricing and vehicle relocation. To date, however, optimization models for free-floating shared mobility systems have simply adopted key assumptions from station-based models. This refers, in particular, to the models’ part that formalizes how rentals realize depending on available vehicles and arriving customers, i.e., how supply and demand match. However, this adoption results in simplifications that do not adequately account for the unique characteristics of free-floating systems, leading to overestimated rentals, suboptimal decisions, and lost profits. In this paper, we address the issue of accurate optimization model formulation for free-floating systems. Thereby, we build on the state-of-the-art concept of considering a spatial discretization of the operating area into zones. We formally derive two novel analytical matching functions specifically suited for free-floating system optimization, incorporating additional parameters besides supply and demand, such as customers’ maximum walking distance and zone sizes. We investigate their properties, like their linearizability and integrability into existing optimization models. Our computational study shows that the two functions’ accuracy can be up to 20 times higher than the existing approach. In addition, in a pricing case study based on data of Share Now, Europe’s largest free-floating car sharing provider, we demonstrate that more profitable pricing decisions are made. Most importantly, our work enables the adaptation of station-based optimization models to free-floating systems.},

  abstract     = {Component maintenance, repair and overhaul is often performed under long-term service agreements with service providers. After receiving a request for quotation , the provider can quote a price for the contract. When the contract is awarded, the profit depends on the quoted price. To gain such contracts and make profit, service providers have to make an accurate estimation of the value of the contract. Therefore, it is crucial to collect attributes from multiple sources that improve the knowledge about the specific contract. However, due to time and effort investment, it is preferred to collect this information in a smart and dynamic way, i.e., responsive to the available collected information. This paper introduces a model of optimal information acquisition for profit maximization that can be used for such situations. Moreover, we introduce a specific model refinement that can be used for quotation optimization. The model utilizes a function that includes the information attributes as variables and returns the profit. Each piece of information is modelled as an attribute for which the true value can be retrieved and the corresponding retrieval effort is translated in a cost. We introduce three heuristic policies with different levels of dynamism for the order and the number of information attributes to be retrieved. We find out that fixing the order in which attributes are retrieved decreases the expected profit by only 4\%, while also fixing the number of attributes has much worse consequences.},

  abstract     = {Altruistic behaviors, which refer to the behaviors such as caring for benefits of others, exist in practice. Altruistic behaviors are widely explored in sociology and economics but under-studied in operational research (OR). In this paper, by exploring the classic newsvendor inventory problems in a two-echelon supply chain, we uncover how an altruistic newsvendor would affect its upstream manufacturer as well as the supply chain&#39;s systems performance. To be specific, we model the altruistic newsvendor as one which includes the upstream manufacturer&#39;s profit in its objective function. Under the base model with an exogenous wholesale price, we find that the altruistic behavior of the newsvendor who is risk-neutral or risk-seeking appears to be beneficial to the manufacturer and supply chain. However, when the newsvendor is risk-averse, its altruistic behavior is harmful to the manufacturer and supply chain. In the extended model in which the wholesale price is endogenously decided by the manufacturer, we find that the newsvendor&#39;s altruistic behavior prompts the manufacturer to raise its wholesale price, which can decrease the expected profits of the newsvendor and the whole supply chain. Owing to the increased wholesale price, if the supply chain consists of two newsvendors, a newsvendor&#39;s altruistic behavior can harm both newsvendors and the supply chain. On the contrary, the manufacturer&#39;s altruistic behavior can increase the expected profit of the whole supply chain. Moreover, in the presence of a risk-averse or risk-seeking newsvendor, the altruistic manufacturer has an incentive to maximize the whole supply chain&#39;s expected profit.},

  abstract     = {Downtime of industrial assets such as wind turbines and medical imaging devices comes at a sharp cost. To avoid such downtime costs, companies seek to initiate maintenance just before failure. Unfortunately, this is challenging for the following two reasons: On the one hand, because asset failures are notoriously difficult to predict, even in the presence of real-time monitoring devices which signal early degradation. On the other hand, because the available resources to serve a network of geographically dispersed assets are typically limited. In this paper, we propose a novel model referred to as the dynamic traveling maintainer problem with alerts that incorporates these two challenges and we provide three solution approaches on how to dispatch the limited resources. Namely, we propose: (i) Greedy heuristic approaches that rank assets on urgency, proximity and economic risk; (ii) A novel traveling maintainer heuristic approach that optimizes short-term costs; and (iii) A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that optimizes long-term costs. Each approach has different requirements concerning the available alert information. Experiments with small asset networks show that all methods can approximate the optimal policy when given access to complete condition information. For larger networks, the proposed methods yield competitive policies, with DRL consistently achieving the lowest costs.},

  abstract     = {Many manufacturers have recently taken the initiative to enhance their demand forecasts with the help of modern data analytics tools. Motivated by this trend, this paper examines the implications of encroachment when an upstream manufacturer privately observes the demand information. We analyze a signaling game between a manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer privately observes the actual forecast signal of the customer’s marginal utility of a product, and then determines a wholesale price, which may signal its private information. Upon receiving the wholesale price, the retailer decides how much to sell in the retail channel. The manufacturer, if in possession of a direct channel, finally determines how much to sell in this channel. Our analysis reveals that encroachment by a better-informed manufacturer has many different implications that have not been documented in the literature. In particular, we find that compared with the prior literature focusing on a better-informed retailer, when the upstream manufacturer is better informed, encroachment will more likely result in a lose-lose outcome. Additionally, if better informed, the retailer may not opt to credibly share information. By contrast, we show that in the presence of a better-informed manufacturer, both supply chain parties are willing to establish the capability of credible information sharing unless it is too costly to do so. Interestingly, we demonstrate that a greater degree of information asymmetry or a larger direct selling cost has the potential to benefit both supply chain parties; however, more accurate information may hurt them and inhibit the manufacturer from encroachment.},

  abstract     = {Firms in major polluting industries have different carbon intensities. The degree of emission asymmetry varies in different industries. In some industries, the carbon intensity of some firms may be several times higher than that of others. Yet surprisingly, emission asymmetry has been largely ignored in the literature. In this paper, we adopt a game-theoretical framework that incorporates emission asymmetry with a carbon tax and imperfect competition. We show that emission asymmetry plays a key role in shaping firms’ production and investment decisions toward green technologies. Due to emission asymmetry, among other factors, a carbon tax does not necessarily induce the adoption of green technology. Nevertheless, upon the introduction of a carbon tax, the carbon-inefficient firm is more likely to benefit from the green technology than the carbon-efficient firm because the green technology can mitigate or even eliminate the initial emission asymmetry. This might be an important driver for firms to further invest in new technology to have an edge over their rivals. One particularly compelling insight is that besides social welfare, industry profit may also improve upon the introduction of a carbon tax if it is properly enacted. Our findings therefore provide renewed support for alleviation of the economic concerns of governments as well as businesses and the general public about the impact of tightening environmental regulations. Policymakers may also foster green technology through well-designed carbon regulations.},

For fairness reasons, most mechanisms use randomness, and therefore result in a probabilistic assignment. We study the problem of decomposing these probabilistic assignments into a weighted sum of ex-post (Pareto-)efficient matchings, while maximizing the worst-case number of assigned agents. This decomposition preserves all the assignments’ desirable properties, most notably strategy-proofness. Next to discussing the complexity of the problem, we obtain tight lower and upper bounds on the optimal worst-case number of assigned agents. Moreover, we propose two alternative column generation frameworks for the introduced problem, which prove to be capable of finding decompositions with the theoretically best possible worst-case number of assigned agents, both for randomly generated data, and for real-world school choice data from the Belgian cities Antwerp and Ghent. Lastly, the proposed column generation frameworks are inherently flexible, and can therefore also be applied to settings where other ex-post criteria are desirable, or to find decompositions that satisfy other worst-case measures.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the order- and rack-sequencing problem at a single picking station in the context of robotic mobile fulfillment systems, a warehouse technology typically applied in large distribution centers. Following the parts-to-picker concept, items are stored on movable racks that are lifted and transported by automated guided vehicles from the storage area to picking stations for order-processing. The order-picking process involves two linked decisions: How to sequence the processing of orders and how to sequence the rack visits to supply the picking station with the requested items. We present a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation achieving stronger linear programming bounds than a previous formulation. Including preprocessing techniques it quickly solves instances of medium-size to proven optimality for the first time in literature. For large real-world instances, we provide a three-stage heuristic solution procedure suitable in a dynamic environment, while providing competitive solutions within a short run time. Computational experiments on a broad set of benchmark instances and a comparative study with approaches from literature verify our results.},

  abstract     = {Humanitarian logistics often faces the challenge of dealing with uncertainties when developing a rescue strategy in response to the occurrence of a disaster. We develop a distributionally robust model (DRM) for the multi-period location-allocation problem with multiple resources and capacity levels under uncertain emergency demand and resource fulfilment time with only limited distributional information being available in humanitarian logistics. We show that the model can be equivalently reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program, and develop a tailored branch-and-Benders-cut algorithm to solve it. To enhance the efficiency of the algorithm, we propose some improvement strategies, including in-out Benders cut generation, dual lifting, and normalization of the dual variables. We perform extensive numerical studies to verify the performance of the developed algorithm, assess the value of the DRM over the corresponding deterministic and stochastic models, and discuss the impacts of key model parameters to gain managerial insights, particularly for the decision-maker planning on allocating resources based on tradeoff among the operating cost, equity and efficiency. We also demonstrate how our model performs had it been used in the actual earthquake that occurred in Jiuzhaigou, China.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies optimal criteria for the appointment scheduling of outpatients in a medical imaging center. The main goal of this study is to coordinate the assignments of radiopharmaceuticals and the scheduling of outpatients on imaging scanners. We study a case of a molecular imaging center that offers services for various diagnostic procedures for outpatient requests. Most procedures in molecular imaging involve several steps limited by strict time windows and require a time-sensitive chemical element, technetium-99m (99mTc) with a limited half-life, to produce the radiopharmaceuticals. We investigate the mathematical dynamics of 99mTc dosages to construct optimal schedules for preparing the radiopharmaceuticals. We develop a rigorous mixed-integer programming model to coordinate the assignment of the radiopharmaceuticals and the scheduling of outpatients on the scanners. The objective is to minimize the total deviation from the scheduled scanning times. We also develop a novel, less conservative robust optimization approach to capture the uncertainty raised by the availability of 99mTc. We propose an uncertainty handling mechanism to reduce the uncertainty interval over time recursively. The proposed mechanism avoids over-conservatism and increases the reliability of mathematical robust models. We evaluate the proposed models by multiple criteria. The final results suggest that the robust model is able to schedule up to 40 outpatients with at most 20 percent of deviation from the scheduled scan times with a decent degree of the constraint violation versus 30 outpatients with at most 50 percent according to the current practice.},

These properties center on whether jobs in a schedule can be naturally partitioned into subsets or whether a complete schedule is the outcome of blending distinct subsequences and/or whether the overall scheduling objective is a compromise of conflicting objectives. We propose generalizations of existing DP algorithms so they can be applied to more general problems such as proportionate flow shops. In some cases, we show how the running time of a DP algorithm can be improved. We also survey models where a DP formulation is part of a hybrid enumerative algorithm. A discussion on how pseudo-polynomial DP algorithms can be converted to fully polynomial time approximation schemes is also presented. We conclude our review with a timeline of DP algorithmic development during the last 50 years.},

Small business clusters can be defined based on different companies’ characteristics, for example, economic sector or geographical location. These aspects are usually included as fixed effects to predict the defaults of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, this approach however ignores the interactions between the company groups and only captures the heterogeneity across the clusters. To include both contagion effects between and within groups, a Bayesian spatial hierarchical model for binary data is proposed and applied to a dataset of SMEs located in London in 2016. The empirical analysis shows that the contagion component at the lower level, based on the geographical location, is not significant if the industry clustering is ignored. However, it becomes significant if the industry group effect is included, and also the upper-level interdependence also becomes significant. Finally, the suggested model improves the predictive accuracy and the expected shortfall estimate compared to standard scoring models.},

Especially challenging are those contracts which involve an explicit interest rate (fixing) dependence in the cashflows, which stretches typical measure-change approaches beyond their practical limit. We introduce a framework for pricing equity swaps, equity cap/floors, and other hybrid derivatives under general stochastic short-rate models with a correlated equity. By utilizing the machinery of Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) approximation, and a decoupled representation of the equity-rate model, we derive semi-closed-form approximations for the hybrid contract prices based on a regime-switching model and prove theoretical convergence. The numerical implementation of the method is fast and very accurate, achieving superquadratic convergence in numerical experiments. The framework also provides a practical alternative to traditional approaches such as trees for pricing bonds and bond options under short-rates models which lack closed-form solutions.},

However, if firms operate in non-optimal scales, then such a methodological treatment can be restrictive. In our case, we adopt the minimum distance. We utilize a strongly revenue-efficient frontier and model a DEA based Lerner index which is less restrictive. We apply our index to a sample of global biotechnology and pharmaceutical (B&amp;P) firms over the period 2015–2019. We further investigate the effect of firms’ research and development (R&amp;D) on firms’ market power estimated by the input-market DEA-based Lerner indexes.

The results show that setting a minimum recycling standard of 0.65 and implementing a strategy of rewards as the primary factor and punishment as a supplement helps enterprises to choose the more environmentally friendly EPR approach. The conversion rate and the level of enterprise effort positively affect the adoption of EPR by enterprises and can speed up the evolution of local governments to equilibrium strategies. What&#39;s more interesting is that controlling the government&#39;s regulatory investment to prevent enterprises from “free-riding” helps to promote the coordinated recycling of abandoned bicycles. This research is based on the current situation in China and offers a new perspective on recycling abandoned bicycles. The conclusions provide a reference for other countries seeking to formulate effective policies for the management of abandoned bicycles.},

In our MSSP, a company has to staff multiple shifts for each workday in the presence of uncertain arrival rates that vary throughout the day and patient “customers” that do not abandon the queue while waiting for a service, but who must be served by some pre-defined time. Drawing on established methods in both capacity management and prescriptive analytics, we propose to use fluid and stationary approximations of the demand arrival process to apply tailored prescriptive analytics approaches to determine staffing levels for multiple interrelated shifts. The prescriptive analytics approaches rely on machine learning techniques that incorporate a detailed representation of the non-stationary structure of arrivals and leverage extensive auxiliary data. In particular, we adapt established prescriptive analytics approaches—weighted sample average approximation and kernelized empirical risk minimization—and propose a new optimization prediction approach to solving the multi-shift staffing problem. Using a case study that is based on extensive data from our project partner, the maintenance service provider, we demonstrate the applicability of these approaches, highlight their benefits over traditional “estimate then optimize” approaches, and shed light on their structural properties and performance drivers.},

The goal of the pension manager is to maximize the performance ratio of the real terminal wealth under the VaR constraint. An auxiliary process is introduced to transform the original problem into a self-financing problem. We obtain the optimal terminal wealth under different cases by combining the linearization method, the Lagrange dual method, the martingale method, and the concavification method. There are fourteen cases for the convex penalty function, and there are six cases for the concave penalty function. Besides, when the penalty and reward functions are both power functions, the explicit forms of the optimal investment strategies are obtained.

  abstract     = {In order to deliver effective care, health management must consider the distinctive trajectories of chronic diseases. These diseases recurrently undergo acute, unstable, and stable phases, each of which requires a different treatment regimen. However, the correct identification of trajectory phases, and thus treatment regimens, is challenging. In this paper, we propose a data-driven, dynamic approach for identifying trajectory phases of chronic diseases and thus suggesting treatment regimens. Specifically, we develop a novel variable-duration copula hidden Markov model (VDC-HMMX). In our VDC-HMMX, the trajectory is modeled as a series of latent states with acute, stable, and unstable phases, which are eventually recovered. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our VDC-HMMX model on the basis of a longitudinal study with 928 patients suffering from low back pain. A myopic classifier identifies correct treatment regimens with a balanced accuracy of slightly above 70\%. In comparison, our VDC-HMMX model is correct with a balanced accuracy of 83.65\%. This thus highlights the value of longitudinal monitoring for chronic disease management.},

  abstract     = {Individual treatment effect models allow optimizing decision-making by predicting the effect of a treatment on an outcome of interest for individual instances. These predictions allow selecting instances to treat in order to optimize the overall efficiency and net treatment effect. In this article, we extend upon the expected value framework and introduce a cost-sensitive causal classification boundary for selecting instances to treat based on predictions of individual treatment effects and for the case of a binary outcome. The boundary is a linear function of the estimated individual treatment effect, the positive outcome probability and the cost and benefit parameters of the problem setting. It allows causally classifying instances in the positive and negative treatment class in order to maximize the expected causal profit, which is introduced as the objective at hand in cost-sensitive causal classification. We present the expected causal profit ranker which ranks instances for maximizing the expected causal profit at each possible threshold that results from a constraint on the number of positive treatments and which differs from the conventional ranking approach based on the individual treatment effect. The proposed ranking approach is experimentally evaluated on synthetic and marketing campaign data sets. The results indicate that the presented ranking method outperforms the cost-insensitive ranking approach.},

More specifically, an inverse preference optimization model is formulated to solve the problem of adjusting the preferences of decision makers so as to make a specified state an equilibrium. To this end we define an algorithm which incorporates the hybridization of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. The proposed algorithm adopts a random neighbor strategy for population initialization, the elite reservation and mixed selection operation, and a diversity strategy for population update to improve its efficiency and effectiveness when searching for the required preferences. This approach can help decision makers or third parties to focus their resources on guiding them toward preferences that lead to a specified resolution.

As a concrete application of these models, we use Artificial Neural Networks with up to five hidden layers. Their components and architecture are designed to ensure high interpretability, which supports the models’ acceptance by domain experts. To learn the most favorable values of all parameters at once, we use a variant of a gradient descent optimization algorithm called AdamW. In this way, we make the MCDA methods suitable for handling vast, inconsistent information. The extensive experiments on various benchmark problems indicate that the introduced algorithms are competitive in predictive accuracy quantified in terms of Area Under Curve and the 0/1 loss.

  abstract     = {Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), provides an empirical estimation of the production frontier, based on an observed sample of decision making units (DMUs). Except for the single input-single output case, the asymptotic distribution of the DEA estimator can only be approximated through bootstrapping approaches. Therefore, bootstrapping techniques have been widely applied in the DEA literature to make statistical inference for the cases when the production process has a single-stage structure. However, in many cases, the transformation of inputs into outputs has an inner structure that needs to be considered. This paper examines the applicability of the subsampling bootstrap procedure in the approximation of the asymptotic distribution of the DEA estimator when the production process has a network structure, and in the presence of undesirable factors. Evidence on the performance of subsampling bootstrap is obtained through Monte Carlo experiments for the case of two-stage series structures, where overall and stage efficiency estimates are calculated using the additive decomposition approach. Results indicate great sensitivity both to the sample and subsample size, as well as to the data generating process. Subsampling methodology is then applied to construct confidence interval estimates for the overall and stage efficiency scores of railways in 22 European countries, where the railway transport process is decomposed into two stages and the railway noise pollution problem is considered as an undesirable output.},

The state-of-the-art approaches first estimate the missing data values and then separately solve the corresponding stochastic programming. Accurate estimation of missing values is typically inaccessible as it requires enormous data and sophisticated statistical methods. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated approach, a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework, that simultaneously tackles the missing data problem and data-driven stochastic optimization by hedging against the uncertainties of the missing values. This paper adds to the DRO literature by considering the practical scenario where the data can be incomplete and partially observable; it particularly focuses on data distributions with finite support. We construct several classes of ambiguity sets for our DRO model utilizing the incomplete data sets, maximum likelihood estimation method, and different metrics. We prove the statistical consistency and finite sample guarantees of the corresponding models and provide tractable reformulations of our model for different scenarios. We perform computational studies on the multi-item inventory control problem and portfolio optimization using synthetic and real-world data. We validate that our method outperforms the traditional estimate-then-optimized approaches.},

  abstract     = {The increasing penetration of renewable energy in power systems calls for secure and reliable system operations under significant uncertainty. To that end, the chance-constrained AC optimal power flow (CC-ACOPF) problem has been proposed. Most research in the literature of CC-ACOPF focuses on one-sided chance constraints; however, two-sided chance constraints (TCCs), albeit more complex, provide more accurate formulations as both upper and lower bounds of the chance constraints are enforced simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce a fully two-sided CC-ACOPF problem (TCC-ACOPF), in which the active/reactive generation, voltage, and power flow all remain within their upper/lower bounds simultaneously with a predefined probability. Instead of applying Bonferroni approximation or scenario-based approaches, we present an efficient second-order cone programming (SOCP) approximation of the TCCs under Gaussian Mixture (GM) distribution via a piecewise linear (PWL) approximation. Compared to the conventional normality assumption for forecast errors, the GM distribution adds an extra level of accuracy representing the uncertainties. Moreover, we show that our SOCP formulation has adjustable rates of accuracy and its optimal value enjoys asymptotic convergence properties. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed to speed up the solution procedure by optimally selecting the PWL segments. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches with both real historical data and synthetic data on the IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus systems. We show that our formulations provide significantly more robust solutions (about 60\% reduction in constraint violation) compared to other state-of-art ACOPF formulations.},

We use a stylized, single-server queue to incorporate customer patience into the queuing problem, with the assumption that customers will not enter the queue when the waiting time exceeds their inherent patience time, reflecting the decision whether to wait. We focus on queue design, structure, and revenue and consider two homogeneous and heterogeneous customer scenarios. Our findings show that, for homogeneous customers, price-raising and price-discounting strategies can mitigate revenue loss. We examined which policy is better for service providers in different scenarios. For heterogeneous customers, we draw two conclusions. First, a revenue-maximizing service provider should increase her priority fee if customers have patience in regard to waiting time, regardless of whether they are regular customers, priority customers, or a mix of both. Second, contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that the service provider should abandon a portion of his or her regular customers to attract more customers who are willing to pay a higher priority fee for better service when the value of regular customers is small. Under this situation, customers’ patience times can bring more revenue to the service provider. If the value of regular customers is high, however, then an increased priority fee cannot compensate for the revenue loss from abandoning these customers and losing their revenue. Overall, our findings confirm that customers’ patience times result in a high net monetary cost for the time-sensitive customer.},

One firm, the so-called leader, has already located several stores, while a second firm, the follower that offers a different product, considers locating its stores in the same area. Both products have some degree of complementarity. Marianov et al. (2018) studied this problem considering a customer decision rule that is binary (winner-take-all) and deterministic (there are no uncertainties related to customers’ behavior). In that work, they concluded that multipurpose shopping has a strong influence on optimal store location. This paper extends that work by introducing random utility customer choice rules based on the Multinomial Logit model. Along these lines, we propose the new Partially Binary Logit rule, applicable to the case in which all stores of a firm have identical attributes, except for their location. In this case, a customer always chooses the least cost trip store of the firm to purchase its product. We propose one nonlinear and three linear formulations for the follower location problem, and a Branch and Cut method for one of them. Two of the formulations have a good performance for instances of up to at least 200 nodes. We compare the binary, Multinomial Logit, and Partially Binary Logit rules by analyzing the captured markets and location patterns for a large set of randomly generated 100-node instances.},

Hazardous material transportation risk of is proportional to the volume of materials transferred, the length of the link, and the population density, which varies over time. By modeling the effects of time on population density, this paper presents a multi-objective time-dependent hazardous materials routing problem for efficiently managing hazardous material transportation. The proposed model&#39;s objectives include the reduction of transportation risks and travel costs. Given the uncertainty associated with hazardous materials routing, an interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller is used to estimate risk; its inputs include population density, vehicle load, link length, and time of day. A type-2 fuzzy multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition is used to optimize the proposed model and an adaptive large neighborhood search to enhance the local neighbor search mechanism. Additionally, by utilizing the nadir reference point, the distribution of Pareto front approximation is improved. Furthermore, a new metric is introduced to evaluate the dispersion of Pareto front approximation. The proposed method is compared to three other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms using eleven different performance metrics for validation. Then, using the multiple-criteria decision-making approach, the meta-heuristics algorithms are evaluated. The obtained results demonstrate the proposed solution method algorithm&#39;s competitiveness and superiority over the other three evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the cyclic inventory routing problem with stochastic demand. A geographically dispersed set of retailers with stochastic demand rates is replenished from a single depot using vehicles with limited capacity. For an infinite horizon, a fixed-partition policy is adopted that partitions the retailers into subsets that are always replenished together in the same route being cyclically repeated. The objective is to provide cost efficient buffering of the demand variability within a cyclic distribution plan by providing carefully calibrated safety stock levels at the retailers. In doing so, the vehicle capacity needs to be taken into account, since cumulative demand during a cycle of the retailers in a route may exceed this capacity. In that case, shortfall remains at the retailer inventories because they are not fully replenished, which affects the service level (and cost balance) in the consecutive cycle(s). An approximate method is presented for determining the safety stock levels and is integrated into a state-of-the-art metaheuristic solution approach for cyclic inventory routing. An illustrative example and experiments on benchmark instances show (i) the effect of the vehicle capacity on the cost balance in a route, (ii) the accuracy of the approximation, and (iii) the added value of taking demand variability and shortfall due to limited vehicle capacity into account during the route design.},

  abstract     = {The retailer, who is closer to customers, usually has more information on demand than its manufacturer does. This paper focuses on a manufacturer&#39;s information acquisition strategy in a supply chain, and the design of the first-best contract to achieve a win-win for the manufacturer and its retailer. We consider a manufacturer encroachment supply chain in which the manufacturer sells products both directly to the consumer and indirectly through a retailer. The retailer has private demand information while the manufacturer has the option of acquiring demand information. The manufacturer sets the retail price in its direct channel, and the retailer sets the retail price in the retail channel. We consider the two retail price leadership cases, either the manufacturer decides the retail price first or the retailer decides the retail price first. We find that the manufacturer can be hurt by acquiring information, even when the cost is negligible, because competition between the two channels is intensified. Moreover, while one might expect that the retailer is better off from having more information, we show that the retailer can in fact benefit when the manufacturer acquires information. Lastly, we find that the retailer may be worse off from being the retail price leader when the manufacturer acquires demand information, and price competition can be intensified if more customers prefer the direct channel (indirect channel) when the manufacturer (the retailer) acts as the price leader.},

  abstract     = {Credit purchasing has seen dramatic growth recently, stimulating online platforms to provide online credit services in competition with the credit card. We build a game-theoretical model to explore the platform&#39;s credit entry strategy when facing the credit card competition. Consumers differ in their credit card ownership and disposable personal incomes (DPI), and perceive a hassle cost of the credit purchase. We find that online credit offering brings an increased retail price. When the proportion of credit card ownership is high, the bank and platform subsidize consumers when the credit misfit cost is low, but charge an interest rate otherwise in an integrated system where the platform acts as a seller. However, the platform will never subsidize consumers in independent system where the retailer sells through the platform. The platform will enter the credit market only when the fixed entry cost is sufficiently low in integrated system, but only when the commission fee or misfit cost is large in independent system. When the proportion of credit card ownership is low, the platform will subsidize consumers when consumer dispersion in DPI is large or misfit cost is low. In addition, the platform has a high willingness to choose the entry strategy when the commission fee is large or misfit cost is low in independent case. Discussion and extension verify the robustness of basic model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce the multiple Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone Stations (mTSP-DS), which is an extension to the classical multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP). In the mTSP-DS, we have a depot, a set of trucks, and some packet stations that host a given number of autonomous vehicles (drones or robots). The trucks start their mission from the depot and can supply some packet stations, which can then launch and operate drones/robots to serve customers. The goal is to serve all customers either by truck or by drones/robots while minimizing the makespan. We formulate the mTSP-DS as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve small instances. To address larger instances, we first introduce two variants of a decomposition-based matheuristic . Afterwards, we suggest a third approach that is based on populating a solution pool with several restarts of an iterated local search metaheuristic , which is followed by determining the best combination of tours using a set-partitioning model. To verify the performance of our algorithms, we conducted extensive computational experiments. According to the numerical results, we observe that the use of drone stations leads to considerable savings in delivery time compared to traditional mTSP solutions. Furthermore, we investigated the energy consumption of trucks and drones. Indeed, depending on the energy consumption coefficients of trucks and drones as well as on the distance covered by drones, the mTSP-DS can also achieve energy savings in comparison to mTSP solutions.},

One may visualize the reordered dissimilarity matrix with a heat map and thus understand the structure of the data, while still displaying the full matrix of dissimilarities. Good orderings produce heat maps that are easy to read and allow for clear interpretation. We consider two popular seriation methods, minimizing path length by solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO), which minimizes path length among all orderings consistent with a given tree structure. Learning from the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods, we introduce a new hybrid seriation method, tree-penalized Path Length (tpPL). The objective is a linear combination of path length and the extent of violations of the tree structure, with a parameter that transitions the optimal paths smoothly from TSP to OLO. We present a detailed study over 44 synthetic datasets which are designed to bring out the strengths and weaknesses of the three methods, finding that the hybrid nature of tpPL enables it to overcome the weaknesses of TSP and OLO.},

Our findings provide an affirmative answer to an open research question posed by Kovalev et al.

Moreover, we show when a generic two-stage no-wait proportionate flow shop scheduling problem is solvable in O ( n l o g n ) O(nlogn) time. We present practical applications where TADZ is more suitable than TADC as a scheduling objective. We also introduce a new metric defined as the sum of all partial schedule lengths SPSL and show that the two-stage no-wait proportionate flow shop with the SPSL objective is solvable in O ( n l o g n ) O(nlogn) time; thus, an additional solvable variant of the two-stage no-wait proportionate flow shop with the SPSL objective is identified and solved.

This method belongs to the stochastic optimization method and is mainly driven by two random streams utilized in the stochastic search mechanism, namely, individual (cognition) and social randomness effects. To our best knowledge, no research work has been conducted about the manipulation of the random stream assignment for stochastic search mechanism in the PSO algorithm. In this work, the influences of controlling randomness in the searching scheme of PSO is studied by introducing different pseudo random number (PRN) assignment strategies. The order-1 and order-2 stability analyses for particle dynamics under different PRN assignment strategies are also conducted to understand the influences. Stability analysis is carried out using the stochastic process theory. Our results show that the correlation caused by PRN has no effect on the unbiasedness of the expectation of particle position, but it would reduce or increase the variance of particle dynamics. Second, the convergent conditions of the PSO system under different PRN assignment strategies and the corresponding parameter selection ranges are provided. Finally, an empirical analysis via experimental simulations evaluated by six common swarm diversity measures, eight benchmark test functions, and two parameter tuples is presented.},

We study the problem of selecting a subset of practices that minimizes pollutant load—subject to budgetary and environmental constraints—as simulated in a widely used regulatory watershed model. Mimicking the computation of pollutant load in the regulatory model, we formulate this problem as a continuous optimization model with a linear multiplicative objective function and linear constraints. To lay the groundwork for incorporating additional stakeholder requirements in the future, especially those that would require integer variables, we present and study a continuous linear optimization model that approximates the nonlinear model. The linear model, which requires an exponential number of variables, arises naturally as an alternative model for the same underlying physical process. We examine the theoretical behavior of these optimization models and investigate restrictions of the linear model to handle its large number of variables. Through extensive computational tests on real and randomly generated instances, we demonstrate that the linear model and its restrictions provide optimal solutions close to those of the nonlinear model in practice, despite poor approximation properties in the worst case. We conclude that the linear model—together with our approach to handling its large number of variables—provides a viable framework from which to extend the optimization model to better meet the needs of the Chesapeake Bay watershed management stakeholders.},

Given a number of cells of type single-row or directed circular, pairwise distances between the cells and a set of one-dimensional departments with pairwise transport weights between them, the CCLP asks for an assignment of the departments to the cells such that departments in the same cell do not overlap and such that the sum of the weighted center-to-center distances is minimized. Distances between departments in the same cell are measured according to the layout type of the cell and otherwise their distance equals the sum of the distances to the associated (un)loading positions of the cells plus the distance between the cells. The CCLP and its variations have wide applications. Nevertheless approaches for solving the CCLP exactly have not been presented in the literature before. We solve the CCLP exactly by enumerating over all assignments of the departments to the cells and solving several CCLP with fixed-cell assignment. We show how to reduce the number of distinguishable cell assignments significantly by merging two cells of type single-row. This leads to a new well-performing exact approach for the CCLP where arising subproblems are solved via (new) mixed-integer linear programming models.

  abstract     = {Promoting participation and combining evidence with expert knowledge in constructing composite indices that can be meaningfully interpreted are key open challenges identified in performance measurement literature. To address them, this article proposes a sociotechnical decision-aid process, under a collaborative value-modelling framework, rooted in both process consultation and multicriteria value measurement principles. It consists of two phases (structuring and model building), each one developed in a sequence of non-face-to-face (Web-Delphi) and face-to-face (decision conferencing) group processes, designed to allow for increased participation. Performance indicators are selected and structured in a value-tree (phase one), upon which a group hierarchical additive value-function model is built (phase two), supported by the MACBETH multicriteria decision-support system. Collaborative questioning protocols allow to elicit and reconcile individual qualitative value judgements, in a Web-Delphi platform. The collective knowledge thus acquired is used in decision conferencing with a core group to define value functions and weights. Extensive sensitivity and robustness analyses serve to test the requisiteness of the model, giving rise to a shared structure of composite indices. The proposed approach was shaped within the EURO-HEALTHY project, to create a Population Health Index intended to be a tool enabling policymakers to analyse population health and related inequalities at the regional level across the European Union, and design improvement policies. Many stakeholders and experts from different intervention and knowledge areas, and located across Europe, participated in the different modelling activities, as detailed in this article. Research paths derived from learnings acquired are suggested to further improve process effectiveness and flexibility.},

While this concept has demonstrated its usefulness for empirical studies and been extended in several directions, two major shortcomings are the fixed number of groups and the static allocation of entities across groups. This is particularly problematic when dealing with panel data. In this paper, we extend the meta-frontier approach when technology switchers are considered, and quantify the impacts of the switchers on inefficient behavior and technology gap.

Taking these potential co-movements of financial and non-financial risks into account, we study the portfolio problem of an agent who is aware that a future pandemic can affect her health and personal finances. The corresponding stochastic dynamic optimization problem is complex: It is characterized by a system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations which are coupled with optimality conditions that are only given implicitly. We prove that the agent’s value function and optimal policies are determined by the unique global solution to a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations. We show that the optimal portfolio strategy is significantly affected by the mere threat of a potential pandemic.},

  abstract     = {The cover of a transport, social, or communication network is a computationally complex problem. To deal with it, this paper introduces a special class of simple games in which the set of minimal winning coalitions coincides with the set of least covers. A distinctive feature of such a game is that it has a weighted form, in which weights and quota are sets rather than real numbers. This game class is termed set-weighted games. A real-life network has a large number of least covers, therefore this paper develops methods for analyzing set-weighted games in which the weighted form is taken into account. The necessary and sufficient conditions for a simple game to be a set-weighted game were found. The vertex cover game (Gusev, 2020) was shown to belong to the set-weighted game class, and its weighted form was found. The set-weighted game class has proven to be closed under operations of union and intersection, which is not the case for weighted games. The sample object is the transport network of a district in Petrozavodsk, Russia. A method is suggested for efficiently deploying surveillance cameras at crossroads so that all transport network covers are taken into account.},

  abstract     = {Assessing a humanitarian transportation network at an early stage after disaster occurrence plays a crucial role in the mitigation of casualties. As a class of uncrewed aerial vehicles, drones have the potential to perform such assessment operations. We consider a drone arc routing problem in which road segments are evaluated selectively with the goal of maximizing the collected arc informative profits within a predefined time limit. The problem allows drones to travel between nodes without following the physical road network; i.e., drones can travel along the road network for assessment purposes, but they can also travel off the network to save travel time. This feature raises a novel challenge compared to the conventional arc routing problem, as multiple edges exist between two nodes, with different corresponding benefits. To address this challenge, a graph transformation technique is presented in which the multigraph-based arc routing problem is reduced to a node-based routing problem on a simple graph. Due to the significant uncertainties and limited information regarding the post-disaster transportation network, the problem is modeled as a new variant of a robust team orienteering problem with uncertain assessment time. Since the original robust formulation is intractable, we leverage path-based reformulation and apply Lagrangian decomposition to the robust counterpart, which allows us to solve the robust subproblem efficiently through a series of deterministic auxiliary problems. We propose an efficient exact branch-and-price (B&amp;P) framework to solve this problem exactly. In computational experiments, we examine the efficiency of our solution approach using various instances, including instances generated from real-world data as well as simulation, to demonstrate its practical applicability. The results show that compared with the traditional arc orienteering problem, our model achieves an approximately 30\% improvement in the objective value.},

The objective is to minimize a weighted combination of two criteria, the number of biopsies to conduct over a patient’s lifetime and the delay in detecting high-risk cancer that warrants more aggressive treatment. Our study also considers the impact of parameter ambiguity caused by variation across models fitted to different clinical studies and variation in the weights attributed to the reward criteria according to patients’ preferences. We introduce two fast approximation algorithms for the proposed model and describe some properties of the optimal policy, including the existence of a control-limit type policy. The numerical results show that our approximations perform well, and we use them to compare the model-based biopsy policies to published guidelines. Although our focus is on prostate cancer active surveillance, there are lessons to be learned for applications to other chronic diseases.},

A KEP involving pairs from pools of several hospitals, regions, or countries has the potential to increase the number of transplants. These entities may behave strategically and strive to maximize the transplant benefit for their patients. Recently, a decentralized non-cooperative game was formulated to model this situation, and the game solutions (equilibria) for the 2-player case were characterized when each player’s utility is the number of her patients receiving a kidney and exchanges are restricted to pairwise. In this paper, we generalize the result on the existence of social welfare equilibra for N N -players and discuss the impact in the game solutions when transplant information quality is introduced, changing the players’ utilities. Furthermore, the game theory model is analyzed through computational experiments on instances generated by leveraging data of the Canadian Kidney Paired Donation Program. These experiments highlight the importance of using the concept of Nash equilibrium, as well as, the need of further research to assist policy makers once measures on transplant quality are available.},

The results revealed a trend of improvement in the performance of education systems in most European countries in the period analysed.

It is worth exploring the effects of multihoming, a key feature in platform businesses, on platform strategies and decision-making. In this paper, we establish a game-theoretic model in which two competing platforms generate profits from consumer subscriptions, and consumers decide to subscribe to one (singlehoming) or both (multihoming) platforms. In addition, we examine whether multihoming leads to negative synergy because of the content overlap between the platforms but mitigates price competition, where a platform that can create new content itself decides whether to distribute the content exclusively or to cooperate with the rival by licensing the newly developed content. We derive the equilibrium price and content decisions of the platforms and further elaborate their optimal strategic choices regarding content development and distribution. We find that in the absence of multihoming, developing exclusive content is an efficient competitive strategy for platforms but may cause worse social welfare than would be the case without the development of new content. However, in the presence of multihoming, developing exclusive content is a dominant strategy that benefits platforms, consumers, and society. Managerial insights are provided for platform managers in terms of the rival reactions and changes in content-and market-related factors.},

We model ethicality as a continuous spectrum between zero (no ethicality) and one (absolute ethicality). Customers are assumed to be distributed such that their density decreases the higher they are in the ethical spectrum. Boycotting is used as a strategic tool, and customers will boycott only if this increases their total utility, which comprises a positive utility from consumption and a disutiity from doing business with an unethical firm. We study the optimal location of a monopolist and compare it with the central planner’s optimal location. The analysis characterizes the threshold ratio of ethically concerned to ethically indifferent customers above which the monopoly or the central planner will (partially) yield to boycott threats. Furthermore, the monopolist will always locate below the social optimum. We describe when the difference between the two are the greatest, implying conditions about when government intervention may be beneficial. In a market with multiple firms we show that if consumers engage in buycotting in addition to boycotting then there is no pure strategy equilibrium outcome. Absent buycotting, however, equilibrium is demonstrated when customer disutility is sufficiently high. The numerical illustration demonstrates that the monopolist will locate above the average customer only if the customer disutility is sufficiently high.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we analyze an endogenous determination of a credit guarantee provided by a downstream buyer to a capital-constrained supplier to help the latter access a bank loan. Specifically, the capital-constrained supplier, who relies on bank loans to finance its production, sells a product to the buyer during a single selling season. When offering a purchase contract to the supplier, the buyer has the option to decide how much to guarantee in the supplier&#39;s loan payments. Although buyer-provided credit guarantee secures a required supply quantity and reduces the purchase price paid to the supplier (by lowering the supplier&#39;s financing costs), it results in financial losses for the buyer when the supplier&#39;s realized revenue is not sufficient for repaying the loan. Hence, there exists a tradeoff between the value and cost in designing an appropriate credit guarantee scheme. We explicitly characterize the optimal credit guarantee policy and identify the conditions under which full guarantee is optimal. Furthermore, we show that bankruptcy cost plays a critical role in the impact of the supplier&#39;s wealth on the buyer&#39;s profit. The buyer is better off working with a less wealthy supplier if there is no bankruptcy cost, but this may not be the case when the bankruptcy cost is high. With buyer-provided guarantee, the existence of bankruptcy cost may incentivize the buyer to provide (ex post) bailout to rescue a supplier that is prone to bankruptcy. We show that the bailout option improves the buyer&#39;s profit, although it does not affect the optimality of implementing a full guarantee policy (ex ante).},

The choice-based optimization model can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers and is therefore ready to use by management.

After considering the time window constraints, the PDP-T is further generalized to the pickup and delivery problem with time windows and transshipments (PDPTW-T). In this paper, we review two state-of-the-art models for the PDP-T and PDPTW-T. We point out the possible issues existing in the models and provide our revisions. In addition, we develop a new mixed-integer linear programming formulation to solve the PDP-T and PDPTW-T. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by solving 340 generated PDP-T instances and 360 open-access PDPTW-T instances. Computational results show that the proposed model outperforms the existing models in terms of solution quality and computing time. PTP-T instances with up to 25 requests and 2 transfer stations are solved to optimality by using the proposed model. As a comparison, the best-known benchmarks in the literature are instances with 5 requests and 1 transfer station. In addition, the computing time is significantly reduced. In our experiments, the average computational time for solving PDP-T is reduced by 96\%. For PDPTW-T instances, the solvable scale is increased from 3 requests and 4 transfer stations to 5 requests and 4 transfer stations. The average computing time is reduced by 40\%.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the effect of the upstream entry in a supply chain, where one manufacturer (she), facing the entry of one potential supplier, makes technology investments into the incumbent supplier (he) or the entrant supplier. We first find the upstream entry may motivate the manufacturer to make more investments into the incumbent, unless the entrant has a production cost advantage over the incumbent, given a high investment cost. Our work further reveals a ‘triple win’ outcome may be achievable for all players, as not only the manufacturer but surprisingly the incumbent can receive higher profits after the upstream entry, no matter which supplier she invests in. Moreover, the manufacturer’s optional strategies of technology investee are offered in the presence of the entrant. Given a low production cost of the incumbent, the manufacturer should invest in the entrant, if the production cost ratio between the two suppliers is large and the investment cost difference between them is small, or if the ratio is very large, and the difference is small while the incumbent’s investment cost is small; and she should invest in the incumbent otherwise. Given a high production cost of the incumbent, the manufacturer should invest in the entrant, if the production cost ratio is medium (large), and meanwhile the incumbent’s investment cost, holding a small difference with the entrant’s, is large (small); and she should invest in the incumbent otherwise. Finally, one extension, where the manufacturer invests into both suppliers, is discussed.},

  abstract     = {As a special Traveling Salesman Problem, the order picking problem is theoretically challenging and practically significant. Therefore, it has received the attention of many scholars for many years. Compared with a single block layout with parallel picking aisles, the optimal solution for a multi-block layout is much more difficult to find due to the increase in cross-aisles. In this paper, two mathematical optimization formulations are proposed to deal with the multi-block layout problem. One takes the picking position as a unit, and the other takes the picking aisle as a unit. Since picking aisles are connected to each other through specific cross aisles, different picking configurations, access modes, and constraints are introduced. The distance between picking positions is divided into horizontal distance and vertical distance, forming different parts in the objective function. On this basis, two mathematical planning models for the single picker routing problem are constructed. The scale and solution time of the two models are independent of the number of cross aisles, so they have good overall performance when compared with other optimization algorithms through numerical experiments. These models can be expanded to include important features of modern inventory systems, such as scattered storage.},

  abstract     = {We analyze a supply-chain setting in which a manufacturer sells to a retailer, who in turn sells to a market with uncertain demand. A two-wholesale-price contract governs the relationship between the two parties. Before the selling season begins, the retailer preorders from the manufacturer, who stocks to at least satisfy the preorder. After the actual demand is realized, the retailer can place an at-once order, which is satisfied up to the manufacturer&#39;s stock availability. The contract specifies the preorder and at-once order wholesale prices. The retailer&#39;s preorder and the manufacturer&#39;s stocking level determine that the contract functions in one of three regimes, namely Push, Pull, or partial advance booking (PAB). The retailer undertakes all inventory responsibilities in Push, whereas the manufacturer does so in Pull, and they share inventory responsibilities in PAB. An overconfident party holds a biased belief that the demand is less variable than it actually is. We investigate the influences of overconfidence by either one or both parties on the allocation of inventory responsibilities and profitability. Each party can benefit from a biased belief by the other party, and the manufacturer may even benefit from its unilateral overconfidence. The presence of overconfident channel parties could weaken the negative effect of double marginalization in certain circumstances. Furthermore, channel parties’ overconfidence reduces the Pareto-improvement opportunities for most single or two-wholesale-price contracts, and the manufacturer&#39;s overconfidence plays a more prominent role in this reduction. We also compare channel parties’ perceived Pareto-improvement sets with their real Pareto-improvement sets to identify profit improvement opportunities.},

This study proposes a novel approach to simultaneously optimize the train timetable and rolling stock circulation plan with flexible train compositions on an urban rail transit line in order to better match the passenger demand and supplied transport capacity, and further improve operation flexibility and extract gains in efficiency, in which the dynamic passenger demand is particularly considered in the formulation process. We first propose two integer linear programming models that are formulated on time-space networks by considering flexible coupling/splitting activities. The models consist of restricted master problems for optimizing the total generalized cost and subproblems that are used to generate different train composition routes. An effective column-generation-based diving heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the problem of interest, and it is able to simultaneously obtain the train timetable and rolling stock circulation plan. Several sets of experimental scenarios, involving relatively small-scale cases and a case derived from real-world Shanghai Metro data, are tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle capacity and number-of-transfers constraints are critical in transit network equilibrium because (1) transit vehicles cannot carry passengers over their capacity and (2) transit passengers typically avoid paths with numerous transfers. In this paper, we propose a strategy-based transit stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) model that considers capacity and number-of-transfers constraints for an urban congested transit network. A route-section-based method is used for the transit network representation. The transit passengers’ route choice behavior is assumed to obey the logit model, and a route-section-based path size correction factor is developed to handle the route overlapping issue. The transit line capacity and maximum number-of-transfers constraints are considered in the model. We then formulate the strategy-based transit SUE problem as a variational inequality (VI) problem. A transit path-set generation procedure is proposed to identify a transit path with a limited number of transfers using the route-section-based network representation. The diagonalization method is chosen to solve the VI problem due to the asymmetric cost function, and the diagonalized problem can be solved using a path-based partial linearization algorithm embedded with an iterative balancing scheme, which is used here to handle the numerous capacity constraints. Numerical examples are conducted to demonstrate the features of the proposed model and performance of the developed algorithm. The results show that the vehicle capacity and number of transfers would strongly impact the passenger flow patterns.},

  abstract     = {In response to increasingly fierce competition and highly customized demands, many companies adopt a distributed production model but manage their orders in a centralized manner. Coordination between multiple factories requires unified information and resources to provide a close match between supply and demand. One of the crucial tasks is to solve the order assignment and scheduling problem with uncertainties introduced by unexpected changes in upstream supply, labor supply, and transportation capacity. Managing uncertainties in production and distribution is important, as they can significantly interrupt and delay the timely and constant supply of orders if not appropriately managed. We address an order assignment and scheduling problem with direct distribution under uncertainties in processing and distribution time. The aim is to achieve a minimum of weighted sum cost and timeliness, which involves the optimization of the order assignments to multi-factory and production scheduling for orders at each site. We first formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic programming model. To manage a large scale of possible scenarios, we apply a sample average approximation (SAA) method to approximate the model. We propose a novel model with fewer binary variables and big-M constraints. An exact logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) method is developed to deal with practical-sized instances. Numerical results indicate the superiority of our new model and the LBBD method. Managerial implications are discussed to demonstrate its advantages and potential applicability in practice.},

  abstract     = {This research proposes a game theory model in a supply chain (SC) involving one manufacturer and one retailer. The SC works in a global market in which consumers are located worldwide and subject to traceability issues that can create distrust of the product quality. This issue can be resolved by implementing blockchain technology which provides benefits in terms of high traceability along with low transaction costs. However, blockchain negatively impacts the environment because of their high energy consumption. Therefore, in this study, we capture the trade-offs between traceability and sustainability for blockchain adoption by characterizing a game theory model. Our findings show that high levels of distrust pushes firms to avoid the implementation of blockchain. In such circumstances, blockchain is not sufficient to make consumers recognize the product quality and trust the firms’ practices. In contrast, low levels of distrust can make blockchain an economically suitable technology conditioned to minimal environmental damages; otherwise, firms need to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between distrust and sustainability. Since the adoption of blockchain leads to an increase in prices and decrease of distrust, two factors determine whether to pursue this technology or not: low consumer sensitivity to price and high sensitivity to quality. In this study, we develop three specific cases where we model: 1) the direct impact of blockchain on distrust, 2) a stochastic distrust term, and 3) a Stackelberg game. Each case confirms our results and strengthens the robustness of our findings.},

Although there is a vast literature on modeling pricing and e-tailers’ operational issues, research on PL sourcing has been lacking. This paper seeks to fill this gap by investigating an e-tailer (she) who can manufacture her PL in-house or source it from an external third-party manufacturer or a national brand manufacturer (he). The e-tailer simultaneously sells the PL directly and the product of the national brand (NB) manufacturer with agency selling. Furthermore, she provides consumer service for both products. Our analysis leads to the following major results. First, the e-tailer would charge the highest agency fee and provide the highest service level when sourcing from the NB manufacturer. Second, the PL sourcing preference of the e-tailer mainly depends on the production cost and consumer service sensitivity. In contrast, the profit of the NB manufacturer is influenced primarily by the consumer preference for PL and the sourcing strategy of the e-tailer. Third, there is always a PL sourcing strategy that can benefit the NB manufacturer and the e-tailer. Our model extensions explore how price elasticity, product quality, consumer loyalty, and exogenous fees affect our main results, which are shown to be robust.},

To find efficient maintenance schedules, we formulate a bi-objective optimization problem, which considers the limited availability of maintenance personnel, and we propose an algorithm that finds a set of maintenance schedules, which are a good approximation of the Pareto front in terms of costs and productivity. Through sensitivity analysis we show the extent to which adding maintenance personnel improves system productivity at the expense of increased maintenance costs and idle time of some resources. Besides solving the Pareto-optimal schedules, we show how the developed model is useful in maintenance personnel planning, and we outline limitations and future developments of the present work.},

  abstract     = {Many reports indicate that manufacturers may initially provide trade credit for a capital-constrained retailer to enhance product output. However, with the easy access to introduce a direct channel nowadays, whether the benefits of trade credit in adjusting product output still hold needs to be examined. In response to this problem, this study analyzes firms’ preferences for trade credit versus bank credit in the absence/presence of a direct channel and examines the interactions between firms’ credit and channel strategies. We find that in the absence of a direct channel, both firms prefer trade credit for a low opportunity cost; however, after introducing a direct channel, the manufacturer prefers to offer a trade credit for either (i) a low opportunity cost and a high sales cost or (ii) a high opportunity cost and a low sales cost. Comparing the two, we present that introducing a direct channel always strengthens the manufacturer’s preference for trade credit but weakens (strengthens) the retailer’s preference given a low (high) sales cost. This finding suggests that for the upstream manufacturer, trade credit becomes even more beneficial after introducing a direct channel. Moreover, relative to bank credit, trade credit weakens (strengthens) the manufacturer’s preference for introducing a direct channel yet strengthens (weakens) the retailer’s preference given a low (high) opportunity cost. We also extend our analysis to price competition, uncertain demand, and sequential quantity decisions.},

  abstract     = {Last-mile collection and delivery services often rely on multi-echelon logistic systems with many types of practical spatial, temporal, and resource constraints. We consider three extensions of the basic 2-echelon vehicle routing problem that are of practical interest: First, second-echelon vehicles need to simultaneously deliver and collect goods at customers within their specified time window. Second, first-echelon vehicles are allowed to perform multiple trips during the planning horizon. Third, the intermediate facilities, called satellites, allow temporary storage of goods, but the quantity that can be stored at a time is limited. This paper integrates these complicating features in a single mathematical model. To solve the problem, we design a decomposition-based matheuristic. It employs a reduced and refined mixed-integer programming formulation and two echelon-specific large neighborhood searches (LNS) to produce improving routes for the respective echelon. The most important algorithmic component is the feasibility check of LNS that relies on a sequence of constant-time and low-complexity tests. The final test allows re-scheduling of the operations taking place at a satellite. Extensive computational experiments systematically evaluate the new components of the matheuristic and benchmark it against a recent exact method for a related problem. Moreover, the impact of the main problem features such as the number and capacity of satellites as well as the integration of forward and reverse flows is analyzed.},

Maximizing the objective adequately, i.e., quickly enough and with sufficient realism, can have substantial positive impact in terms of human lives saved. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently optimizing search paths in the context of the NP-hard optimal search path problem with visibility, based on search theory. To that end, we evaluate and develop ant colony optimization algorithm variants where the goal is to maximize the probability of finding a moving search object with Markovian motion, given a finite time horizon and finite resources (scans) to allocate to visible regions. Our empirical results, based on evaluating 96 variants of the metaheuristic with standard components tailored to the problem and using realistic size search environments, provide valuable insights regarding the best algorithm configurations. Furthermore, our best variants compare favorably, especially on the larger and more realistic instances, with a standard greedy heuristic and a state-of-the-art mixed-integer linear program solver. With this research, we add to the empirical body of evidence on an ant colony optimization algorithms configuration and applications, and pave the way to the implementation of search path optimization in operational decision support systems for search and rescue.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the continuous maximum capacity path interdiction problem, where two players, user and interdictor, compete in a capacitated network. The user wants to send the maximum possible amount of flow through a path, whose capacity is given by the minimum capacity among its arcs. The budget-constrained interdictor decreases arc capacities by any continuous amount to reduce the quality of the user’s chosen path. We present an efficient algorithm based on a discrete version of the Newton’s method, which helps us solve the problem in polynomial time. We also prove that the problem can be transformed into a zero-sum game, which has always a pure Nash equilibrium point. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm over a set of randomly generated networks.},

  abstract     = {Location covering models are important spatial analytic methods, and have been widely applied to different facility siting problems in order to support decision making processes. It is common to observe facilities that have significantly different workloads when traditional coverage models are relied upon. This can and does impact system efficiency, reliability and service quality. Several approaches have been used to make service allocation more equitable, attempting to better balance facility workloads. However, the relative capabilities of such approaches to address equity remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of location coverage analytics. This paper studies modeling approaches that can be used to explicitly balance facility workloads, focusing on maximal coverage. Approaches are evaluated comparatively, with completeness, inferiority and maximum gap measures introduced to support this. Empirical results show that if a model does not appropriately reflect workload balancing explicitly, optimality is unlikely. A cost, however, is the need to track explicit variation between sited facilities, which proves to require significantly more computational effort than approximate approaches.},

Spatial coverage refers to the possibility of considering nodes that are not directly served by a vehicle as visited for the purpose of the objective function or constraints. Despite similarities between the underlying problems, solution approaches have been developed in different disciplines independently, leading to different terminologies and solution techniques. This paper proposes a unified view of the approaches: Based on a formal introduction of the concept of spatial coverage in vehicle routing, it presents a classification scheme for core problem features and summarizes problem variants and solution concepts developed in the domains of operations research and robotics. The connections between these related problem classes offer insights into common underlying structures and open possibilities for developing new applications and algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Return of products within the warranty coverage induces additional cost and loss of reputation to manufacturers. It is of practical interest to predict the return rate by experimental means before introducing a product to the market. In this paper, we propose to optimize accelerated reliability tests to achieve the goal within limited time. To describe the heterogeneity in the customers’ usage mode, a discrete random variable is employed to model the degradation rate in addition to the continuous stress variable. To further characterize the heterogeneity in the customers’ behavior, two models of product return are investigated: one assumes that customers return products once the degradation level reaches the minimum eligible return threshold and the other assumes that the threshold varies among different customers. Optimal reliability tests are planned under the large-sample assumption with two novel test schemes: global optimal planning and stress constrained planning. Insights regarding the optimal plans are gleaned to ameliorate the test planning procedure and verify the optimality. A real example from the battery industry is then presented along with the simulation study and sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the methods. We find that the randomness in return level results in different test plans. Furthermore, the constrained optimal plans offer more robustness to the compromise plans.},

In this multi-curve setting, the challenge is to jointly capture the risk-factor relationships within each curve and the risk-factor relationships between the curves. Contributing to the existing literature, we develop a novel two-step Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method, which we label PCA 2 2 , that addresses this challenge. The concept of PCA 2 2 first derives components describing the dynamics of each curve, and then, second, combines these to describe the dynamics across all the curves. The benefits of PCA 2 2 over PCA are: (i) improved scalability allowing for greater computational efficiency and smaller data structures rendering multi-threading more feasible; (ii) components that remain identifiable at the curve level; and (iii) leveraging the last property, PCA 2 2 , unlike PCA, offers the capability of proxying new curves for which limited historical data exists, using the first-step components from a related curve and estimating second-level correlations empirically. PCA 2 2 is a novel multi-curve modelling approach that will appeal, for these reasons, to many practitioners, especially those working in risk management.},

According to different supply chain partners adopting BCT, we analyze the game equilibrium of the no, upper-stream, lower-stream, and entire BCT-driven accounts receivable chains (NBC, UBC, LBC, and EBC) to understand participants’ motivation and condition to adopt BCT and the different roles of participants in blockchain introduction. We find that trade credit management cost-saving and repayment risk-sharing effects, as facilitated by BCT, help increase the equilibrium order quantity, thereby increasing supply chain efficiency and participants’ profits, although BCT cannot fully coordinate the supply chain. Regarding supply chain efficiency, EBC is superior to LBC, which is better than UBC or NBC. As a supply chain leader and creditor, the supplier plays a passive role in achieving the positive effect of BCT. Given that the retailer and manufacturer are supply chain followers and debtors, their adoption of BCT is the key to enhancing supply chain efficiency and profits. The BCT platform can set appropriate technology-usage fees to guide participants to form the EBC structure through different paths. Meanwhile, the retailer’s initial working capital can evaluate the risk-sharing degree of the supply chain, and the stable EBC selection region defined by the risk-sharing degree can be ascertained. We further find that with the trade credit insurance premium increasing, supply chain participants have become more active in adopting BCT.},

  abstract     = {The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led public health authorities to face the unprecedented challenge of planning a global vaccination campaign, which for most protocols entails the administration of two doses, separated by a bounded but flexible time interval. The partial immunity already offered by the first dose and the high levels of uncertainty in the vaccine supplies have been characteristic of most of the vaccination campaigns implemented worldwide and made the planning of such interventions extremely complex. Motivated by this compelling challenge, we propose a stochastic optimization framework for optimally scheduling a two-dose vaccination campaign in the presence of uncertain supplies, taking into account constraints on the interval between the two doses and on the capacity of the healthcare system. The proposed framework seeks to maximize the vaccination coverage, considering the different levels of immunization obtained with partial (one dose only) and complete vaccination (two doses). We cast the optimization problem as a convex second-order cone program, which can be efficiently solved through numerical techniques. We demonstrate the potential of our framework on a case study calibrated on the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy. The proposed method shows good performance when unrolled in a sliding-horizon fashion, thereby offering a powerful tool to help public health authorities calibrate the vaccination campaign, pursuing a trade-off between efficacy and the risk associated with shortages in supply.},

We estimate management as a latent variable using a structural equation production model and Bayesian techniques. The key advantage of the Bayesian approach is the use of informative priors from survey-based management estimation methods, which are however available for a limited number of firms. Subsequently, we examine the effect of management on takeover events. We first show that management, on average, increases the probability of M&amp;A deals. However, we also uncover a nonlinear U-shaped effect, which is consistent with the theoretical premise that poor management leads to many value-decreasing M&amp;A deals, whereas good management leads to many value-increasing M&amp;A deals.},

A hidden model can provide key information about the system dependability such as the failed component of the system, the reliability of the system and related measures. A maximum-likelihood estimator of the system reliability is obtained and its asymptotic properties are studied. Finally, the maintenance of the system is considered in this context and new preventive maintenance strategies are defined and their efficiency is measured in terms of expected cost.

The apprentices rotate through vocational school-blocks followed by assignments to hospital units, where they receive practical education. This program is regulated in high detail. Hospital units offer some slots for apprentices but expect just enough apprentices to be trained and educated. We create two mixed-integer programming models to optimally solve the underlying planning problems of (1) scheduling classes to theoretical and practical education blocks and (2) assigning apprentices to hospital units. The first model determines the number and length of school- and work-blocks on a class level, where its result is input to the second model, which finds individual unit-assignments for every apprentice fulfilling detailed curriculum requirements. Furthermore, it tries to exploit the units&#39; educational capacities as well as possible. To solve the second model, we develop a heuristic decomposition procedure that enables good feasible solutions in short time. Our computational study is based on real-world data of our cooperation partner and provides valuable insights for management. The dataset consists of manually created schedules over the full 3-year program horizon and information on hospital units and their respective capacities. We test different parameter settings for our heuristic procedure and how they influence solution quality and runtime. Finally, we test, if students can be enabled to request individual vacations and evaluate benefits and drawbacks of different degrees of flexibility.},

A two-step semiparametric procedure is developed using a combination of local GMM and maximum likelihood approaches. We also derive the estimators of direct and indirect average partial effects and predictors of technical efficiency. We work out the asymptotic theory for the proposed second step estimator and propose a test of the relevance of the environmental factors.

  abstract     = {Private companies (PCs) in restructured electricity industries determine facility investment timing and sizing. Such decisions maximize the PC’s expected profit (rather than social welfare) under uncertainty. By anticipating the PC’s incentives, a welfare-maximizing transmission system operator (TSO) shapes the network to align public and private objectives. Via an option-based approach, we first quantify welfare losses from the PC’s and TSO’s conflicting objectives. We show that by anticipating the optimal timing and capacity decisions of the profit-maximizing PC, the TSO is able to reduce, though not eliminate, welfare loss. Next, we exploit the dependence of the PC’s capacity on the TSO’s infrastructure design to devise a proactive transmission-investment strategy. Hence, we mitigate welfare losses arising from misaligned incentives even in relatively uncertain markets.},

Since, however, their number along with other parameters exceeds the sample size, an adaptive LASSO estimator is a reasonable way to overcome the problem, especially in view of the oracle properties of the estimator under broad conditions. It is shown that the adaptive LASSO estimator can be thought of as the posterior mean of a usual stochastic frontier model with a special prior that benchmarks inefficiencies on known quantities. We take these quantities from DEA scores to obtain technical inefficiencies having oracle properties. The LASSO parameters can be estimated routinely in the Bayesian context without the need for cross-validation. In an application to a data set of large U.S. banks we find that adaptive LASSO outperforms significantly traditional stochastic frontier models.},

  abstract     = {The use of space through satellites is more and more important for nations, companies, and individuals. However, since the first satellite was sent up in 1957, mankind has been polluting space with debris (i.e., artificial objects with no function), especially in low orbits (between 100 and 2000 km). The current situation is such that: 1/ space agencies send on average several collision risk alerts every day, and 2/ satellites as well as the International Space Station regularly perform avoidance maneuvers to escape being damaged or simply destroyed. In addition, in the last few years, these problems have become more worrisome and may permanently change dimension with the advent of mega-constellations of satellites. Indeed, in order to develop telecommunications and high-speed Internet, several companies (e.g., Starlink, Kuiper, OneWeb, Hongyan, Hongyun, Leosat, Athena) are planning to send several tens of thousands of satellites into low orbits, which are already the most polluted. The purpose of this paper is to provide an economic analysis in terms of dynamic games of the trade-off between constellation size and cost of preserving the space environment. Our goal is to contribute to provide a framework for a sustainable development of a space economy.},

Although there is a large amount of literature on its application to group decisions, very little attention has been paid to the strategic issue: a group decision can be biased by strategically dishonest individuals. We aim to draw attention to the problem and provide a formal perspective to deal with it. We consider a scenario of group decision-making where the inputs are the individuals’ pairwise preferences and the outcome is in their interest. We formulate this situation as a strategic game where the individuals decide how to submit their pairwise preferences. Theoretical results show that truthful reporting can be a dominant strategy only in very limited situations, and moreover it is often weakly dominated.},

Governments provide feed-in tariffs (FiT) for biomass power plants to help reduce the negative impacts of high raw material costs. Using a game-theoretic approach, we study the optimal government FiT for biomass power plants and explore the effects of biomass feedstock competition and the presence of independent biomass feedstock suppliers on FiT strategy. Our results show that governments should subsidize biomass power plants whose competitiveness exceeds a certain threshold. The entry of a feedstock competitor into the biomass supply chain raises this threshold, but the involvement of an independent biomass supplier will not. However, the involvement of an independent biomass supplier reduces the efficiency of the FiT. In addition, FiT for biomass power plants should not be provided if government funds are below a certain threshold, as it does not increase social welfare. By comparing FiT with an alternative use of government funds, the technology subsidy, we find that the technology subsidy should be adopted instead of FiT if the government funds are below a threshold.},

  abstract     = {We present a unified theory that posits three fundamental models as necessary and sufficient for modelling the bivariate scores in possessive ball-sports. These models provide the basis for perhaps more complicated models that can be used for prediction, experimentation, and explanation. First is the Poisson-match, for when goals are rare, or when goals are frequent but the restart after a goal is contested. Second is the binomial-match, for when goals are frequent and the restart uses the alternating rule. Third is the Markov-match, for when the restart uses the catch-up rule. We describe in detail the new model amongst these, the Markov-match, which is complementary to rather than competing with the binomial-match. The Markov-match is a bivariate generalisation of the Markov-binomial distribution. Its structure (catch-up restart) induces a larger correlation between the scores of competitors than does the binomial-match (alternating restart) but slightly more tied outcomes. The Markov-match is illustrated using handball, a high-scoring sport. In our analysis the time-varying strengths of 45 international handball teams are estimated. This poses some mathematical and computational problems, and in particular we describe how to shrink the strength-estimates of teams that play fewer games in tournaments because they are weaker. For the handball results, the Markov-match gives a better fit to data than the Poisson-match.},

  abstract     = {Portfolio decision analysis models support decisions on the allocation of resources among assets with uncertain outcomes (e.g., investments, projects or stocks). These models require information on the decision maker’s risk-preferences which can be difficult to obtain in practice. Stochastic dominance criteria show promise in this regard as they can compare portfolios without exact specification of risk-preferences, but the current literature lacks practical approaches for generating the efficient frontier, i.e., the set of those portfolios that are not stochastically dominated by any other portfolio. We address this gap by developing models to identify sets of portfolios that are efficient in the sense of second- or third-order stochastic dominance (SSD, TSD). These models provide novel insights into the composition of portfolios belonging to the efficient frontier by, e.g., identifying those assets that are included in all efficient portfolios. Moreover, the identification of the efficient frontier makes it possible to utilize additional information on the decision maker’s risk-preferences to further reduce the set of admissible portfolio alternatives, and to analyze the implications this information has on the amount of capital that should be allocated to each individual asset. We illustrate the usefulness of these models with applications in project portfolio selection and financial portfolio diversification.},

Renovation implies that each customer, when leaving the system upon its service completion, may also remove customers waiting in the queue. The number of customers to be removed is selected each time independently of the previous decisions and probabilistically based on the given probability distribution. The renovation with the delay considered in this paper means that the system must accumulate the (known) fixed number of service completions before the next renovation can be triggered. First in the literature numerical evidence is given, that the long-run performance of the system with such delayed renovation mechanism can be similar to that of the systems with the well-known active queue management mechanisms such as random early detection, at least in its basic version. The key stationary performance characteristics reported are the loss probability and the mean number of customers in the system. The unified analytical framework for the computation of the key performance characteristics, which is of independent interest, is also developed.},

  abstract     = {Quality issues in supply networks can adversely affect the performance of suppliers and their downstream customers. Since suppliers might fail to comply with quality guidelines, decentralized quality controls by each firm in a supply network may be insufficient; thus, a complete network perspective on risk management could help to minimize supply disruptions. Here, we develop a novel modeling framework drawing on epidemiology, to demonstrate how network structure impacts the propagation of quality issues—akin to the spread of an infectious disease. We formulate an SIS model in which nodes represent individual suppliers while directed edges represent the movement of goods between suppliers; these nodes can be either susceptible (S) to or infected (I) by a disruption. Applying the model to 21 real-world networks, we find that a quality issue’s magnitude depends strongly on its origin node and the network archetype. The network’s maximum Authority value—based on the relationship between relevant authoritative nodes and hub nodes — is highly correlated with the extent of a supply disruption in our simulation. We examine different network-level strategies for containing an outbreak and find that improving quality control at critical nodes —those characterized by a high Authority value or customer proximity—is an effective measure. Adjusting the network structure by focusing on an upstream-centric flow of goods, thereby reducing the maximum Authority value, decreases vulnerability to quality issues. Managers can reduce the impact of quality disruptions through a combination of conventional firm-level strategies and novel network risk management strategies.},

  abstract     = {In online-to-offline (O2O) on-demand services, customers place orders online and the O2O platform delivers products from stores to customers within a prescribed time. The platform usually hires crowd-sourced drivers as a cost-effective option owing to their flexibility. However, the delivery speed and delivery capacity of the crowd-sourced drivers vary considerably. This service inconsistency brings challenges in precisely matching the delivery supply and customer demand, which may significantly decrease the delivery efficiency. This study aims to address the challenges by proposing a personalized dispatch model, which integrates the order and driver’s characteristics in the order assignment and routing decisions. To achieve this objective, two machine learning-based models are proposed to forecast the delivery speed of individual drivers in real time and customize their delivery capacity dynamically to develop a portrait of each driver’s behaviour. Next, a personalized O2O order assignment and routing model is proposed with the integration of the two aforementioned models. We validate our model with a real dataset of one mainstream O2O platform in China. We run a comprehensive simulation to show the improvement in terms of on-time ratio and average delay time brought by the personalization of each characteristic, namely, delivery speed and delivery capacity. We then show that the proposed personalized model can reduce the average delay by 21.60\% through comparison with actual routing decisions by the drivers,. The theoretical and numerical results shed light on the delivery management of the O2O on-demand services.},

  abstract     = {Cox&#39;s proportional hazards model is widely used to describe the hazard rate of a system deteriorating with age and diagnostic covariates. Existing maintenance in the proportional hazards model was primarily concerned with replacement, resulting in excessive maintenance for many repairable systems. This paper develops a novel hybrid repair-replacement model in the proportional hazards model with a stochastically increasing Markovian covariate process. Preventive repair reduces both age and covariate, and the reduction rate decreases as the number of repairs increases. At an inspection epoch where the system age, covariate state, and repair number are available, the decision-maker considers three possible actions, i.e., no maintenance, preventive repair, and preventive replacement. The objective is to derive the optimal policy that minimizes the long-run average maintenance cost rate. The optimization problem is formulated in the semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) framework. The structural properties of the optimal policy are examined to reduce the policy space. Then a policy-iteration algorithm with a backward policy-improvement step is developed for efficiently finding the optimization results. A practical numerical example with sensitivity analysis is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A comparison with two heuristic policies confirms the superiority of the proposed policy in reducing maintenance costs.},

  abstract     = {In contemporary international remanufacturing supply chains, whether an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) engages in remanufacturing operations or outsources to a third-party remanufacturer (TPR) is influenced by tax and tariff regulations. This study develops a two-stage game model for the decision-making of an OEM from an exporting country showing that the optimal remanufacturing model is significantly affected by the tax and tariff regulations of the importing country and more particularly, the difference between sales tax on remanufactured products and the unit product import tariffs on new products. The model selections for the OEM and the importing country align when this difference is close to zero. This paper is one of the few examining the impact of tax and tariff regulations on outsourcing decisions in remanufacturing contexts, which is largely neglected in the extant literature but has become increasingly important, especially with recent development trends of deglobalization (e.g., Brexit, the US–China trade war, and various sanctions). The significance of this study is threefold: the work makes novel theoretical contributions to the decision-making game model with tax and tariff constructs taken into consideration, has practical implementations for optimizing the strategic business deployment of OEMs, and has implications for consideration of policy and social welfare by policy makers of the destination country.},

  abstract     = {In a servicizing business model, the service provider sells a product’s functionality, not the product per se. This study aims to find the best profit-maximizing pricing strategies for this business model that can also yield the highest consumer welfare with minimal environmental impact. This approach identifies win-win-win strategies satisfying profit, planet, and people objectives. As providers charge consumers based on usage (pay-per-use) versus a regular flat fee (pay-per-period), the economic, environmental, and welfare implications of such strategies remain unclear. We tackle this problem using a stylized game-theoretic model where the service provider first designs the pricing schemes, and consumers react by adjusting use. When offering a single product, we observe that pay-per-use policies outperform pay-per-period when the service provider is cost-inefficient or small-scale. Also, where per-use consumers are not very sensitive to payment frequency, service providers tend to exclude low usage-valuation users. Outperformance also prevails when the proportion of low-use consumers is sufficiently low. Our results show that a win-win strategy can be achieved by offering a pay-per-use policy to high usage-valuation consumers, however, a win-win-win strategy is never possible. We also analyze the problem for a situation where the service provider offers a product line including green and regular products. Then, we characterize possible win-win-win strategies that hinge on environmental impact from different phases of a product’s lifecycle. We extend the models to allow SP i) influence the size of market segments and ii) decide on product greenness levels in different phases of its lifecycle.},

  abstract     = {In short-term demand forecasting, it is often difficult to estimate seasonality accurately, owing to short data histories. However, companies usually have multiple products with similar seasonal demand patterns. A possible solution in this case is to use the components of several time series from a homogeneous family, thus estimating seasonal coefficients based on cross-sectional information. Motivated by this practical problem, we propose a new taxonomy of Parameters, Initial States and Components (PIC), which exploits homogeneous features of time series. We then apply this framework to vector exponential smoothing. We develop a model selection mechanism based on information criteria to select the appropriate PIC restrictions. We then conduct a simulation experiment and empirical analysis on retail data in order to assess the performance of point forecasts and prediction intervals of the models within this framework.},

  abstract     = {To expand users’ scale and enhance competitiveness, many third-party platforms have focused on investing in value-added service (VAS). This study focuses on bilateral VAS and pricing decisions of two competing platforms with different investment costs. Platforms’ bilateral users, including manufacturers and suppliers, can access one or two platforms (i.e., bilateral users can be multihomed). By developing a Hotelling model, we study the differences in VAS investment and pricing between two platforms considering cross-side network effects (CNEs) and propose the strategies of bilateral VAS and pricing for platforms. Then, compared to the situation of no VAS, we analyze the influence of VAS investment on platform pricing. The results show that unlike the platform with high marginal investing cost, the platform with low marginal investing cost offers a higher VAS level to its bilateral users, but may charge them less. Under some conditions, the platform with low marginal investing cost should provide a high level of VAS for manufacturers but charge them a low fee, and simultaneously provide a low level of VAS for suppliers but charge them a high fee. While the platform with high marginal investing cost should provide a high level of VAS with subsidies for manufacturers but a low level of VAS with charges for suppliers. Moreover, we also find that regardless of platforms’ marginal investing costs being high or low, they always charge suppliers more after investing in VAS, but may charge manufacturers less, or subsidize them more.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we study the resource constrained project scheduling problem with transfer times, where the transfer of resources between activities takes a certain amount of time. For the problem, we propose an improved serial schedule generation scheme, a new lower bound, and a tree search heuristic. To generate a schedule, the improved serial schedule generation scheme iteratively schedules an activity by breaking some existing resource flows and decides the earliest start time in an efficient way. The new lower bound is adapted from the critical capacity lower bound by additionally considering resource transfer times. The tree search heuristic utilizes the improved serial schedule generation scheme to schedule an activity at its earliest start time and the new lower bound to prune unpromising nodes in the search tree. Several priority rules are introduced in the heuristic for the selection of the next activity during branching and also used in a greedy algorithm to compute an upper bound for node evaluation. Computational experiments on benchmark instances show that the improved serial schedule generation scheme reduces the computational time by 91.30\% on average compared to an existing serial schedule generation scheme from literature, the new lower bound dominates the known adapted critical path lower bound and achieves an average improvement of 7.95\%, and the tree search heuristic performs better than three existing algorithms for the problem.},

It is modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem, where the feasible solutions are subsets of orchestral sounds, and the function to minimize measures a distance between the chosen subset of orchestral sounds and the target. In this article, we focus on this optimization problem and analyse it through the lens of computational complexity and approximation algorithms. We first study the so-called static case where there is no temporality in the target sound (we want to reproduce a ‘single’ constant sound). We show that the problem is already NP-hard, but is solvable by a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm. We also provide an approximation algorithm with additive error. We then consider the more general case with temporality, when the target sound can be seen as a sequence of sounds over a time horizon. We show how the previous results in the static case generalize in this temporal case. We conclude our study with some experiments on real target sounds.},

We show that this problem is NP-hard, and adapt Cooper’s alternating locate-allocate heuristic to find locally optimal solutions for both the point-coverage and area-coverage scenarios. Experiments show that most locally optimal solutions perform similarly well, suggesting their sufficiency for practical use. The one-dimensional variant of the problem, in which the service area is reduced to a line segment, permits recursive algorithms that are more efficient than mathematical optimization approaches in practical cases. The solution also provides the best-known lower bound for the original problem at a negligible computational cost.},

At most one item can be chosen from each group and the aim is to maximize the total profit of the selected items while respecting the knapsack capacity constraint. The DKP is a relatively recent problem in the literature. It was considered in several recent works where metaheuristics are implemented to solve instances from the literature. In this paper we propose a two-phase approach in which the problem is reduced by applying exact and / or heuristic fixation rules in a first phase that can be viewed as a preprocessing phase. The remaining problem can then be solved by dynamic programming. Experiments performed on available instances in the literature show that the fixation techniques are very useful to solve these instances. Indeed, the preprocessing phase greatly reduces the size of these instances, leading to a significant reduction in the time required for dynamic programming to provide an optimal solution. Then, we generate a new set of instances that are more difficult to solve by exact methods. The hardness of these instances is confirmed experimentally by considering both the use of CPLEX solver and our approach.},

We assume an estimate of the fire propagation times between adjacent nodes and use the minimum travel time principle to model the fire propagation at a landscape-level. The effect of locating a resource in a node is that it becomes protected and the fire propagation to its unburned adjacent nodes is delayed. Therefore, the problem is to identify the most promising nodes to locate the resources, which is solved by a novel iterated local search (ILS) metaheuristic. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model from the literature is used to validate the proposed method in 32 grid networks with sizes 6x6, 10x10, 20x20 and 30x30, with two different number of fire suppression resources (64 problems). Our ILS produced optimal solutions in 40 cases out of 41 known optimal lower bounds. The proposed method’s effectiveness is also due to its short computing times and small coefficients of variation of the objective function values. We also provide a categorised literature review on fire suppression deterministic optimisation models, from which we conclude that approximate collaborative approaches seldom have been applied in the past and, according to the results obtained, can successfully address the complexity of fire suppression, reaching good quality solutions even for large scale instances.},

We obtain an exact analytical solution for investors with unit elasticity of intertemporal substitution of consumption and an approximate solution otherwise. We find that the optimal consumption policy is more sensitive to ambiguity aversion with respect to diffusion risks than the jump risk. The optimal exposures to diffusion and jump risks are significantly affected by the corresponding ambiguity aversions in the complete market; however, the optimal stock investment is relatively insensitive to jump misspecification in the incomplete market. We also show that taking into consideration ambiguity aversion to diffusion risks and participating in the derivatives market are essential to reduce the potential welfare loss, while the impact of jump misspecification is marginal.},

We reveal the macroeconomic drivers of dynamic correlations between European and US sectoral Credit Default Swaps (CDS) markets. The CDS conditional equicorrelations are explained by common macro-financial and news proxies. Our results demonstrate the counter-cyclical behaviour of the time-varying sectoral CDS interdependence, that is elevated sectoral correlations are associated with higher economic policy and financial uncertainty, stronger infectious disease news impact on equity markets, tighter credit conditions, economic activity slowdown, and negative sentiment. We further focus on economic policy uncertainty (EPU) as a potent catalyst of the CDS markets integration process and conclude that EPU magnifies the macro effects across credit risk correlations. Moreover, crisis events play a crucial role in the time-varying impact of the correlation macro drivers. Both financial and health crises amplify the influence that the macro factors exert on the evolution of credit risk correlations, leading to credit risk contagion and threatening financial stability. Lastly, we show that understanding the credit contagion mechanisms has clear implications for operational research applications on risk and portfolio management.},

  abstract     = {Stated-choice experiments have been useful in helping to make a number of operations management decisions. Many recent advances in this area have raised questions about estimating consumers’ preferences when they partially ignore the information provided in discrete choice experiments, a problem introduced as attribute non-attendance (ANA). This line of research explores the consequences of assuming that consumers consider all available information concerning attributes to evaluate product alternatives, when in fact, they might ignore some attributes completely. Diverse choice models, such as latent class models, have been developed to accommodate ANA using choice data. Due to the combinatorial nature of such an approach, researchers typically explore a limited number of specifications. Furthermore, although diverse modeling approaches have been proposed to accommodate ANA, no research has investigated the capability of these approaches to correctly identify ANA at the individual level. In this work, we propose the use of a machine learning approach based on support vector machines to identify ANA at the individual level and to predict consumer choices in conjoint experiments. We conduct an extensive simulation study varying the degree of non-attendance and the noise in the choice data to investigate the performance of the proposed approach. Our results with simulated data show good performance in terms of the identification of attended and non-attended attributes. We test our approach in two empirical applications and compare it to state-of-the-art benchmarks in the field. We demonstrate the usefulness and the alternative insights derived from our method.},

  abstract     = {With the ever increasing volume of air traffic comes an enormous environmental impact, specifically due to carbon emissions. A promising approach to reduce this impact is the introduction of en route air-to-air refueling, allowing for the design of aircraft with reduced weight and a decreased fuel burn. Aside from the design of aircraft, the key challenge lies in the planning of the refueling operation in order to minimize the fuel burn of the feeder fleet. The air-to-air refueling problem is a variant of a vehicle routing problem in which a fleet of feeders are to perform air-to-air refueling operations for a fixed set of cruisers. In this paper, we devise an IP-based method capable of solving this problem supported by an ODE model of the feeders’ fuel consumption. The algorithmic key to solve the air-to-air refueling problem lies in separating the problem of finding routes serving cruisers and assigning sets of routes to individual feeders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods both on real-world and artificial instances, solving all problems to optimality and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art heuristic methods.},

  abstract     = {Replacing fossil fuels by renewable liquid fuels produced from electricity, biomass, and carbon dioxide can substantially reduce emissions in the transport sector. A multitude of planning tasks arise as the widespread use of renewable fuels requires extensive investments in renewable electricity generation, fuel production plants, storage facilities, and pipeline-based transport infrastructures. Hence, we develop a mathematical model determining the optimal design and operation of renewable fuel supply chains to support policy decisions for the transport sector. Strategic decisions include multi-period locational decisions on installing wind and solar generation capacities and investment in fuel production plants, storage capacities, and pipeline-based transport infrastructure. Tactical decisions include production, transport, and storage quantities along with the annual seasonal utilization of resources. Our mathematical formulation is able to consider various resource origins as well as production, transport, and storage processes. To reduce the number of consecutive time periods, we divide the planning horizon into strategic and tactical decision levels connected by a cyclic storage formulation. We apply the model to a European case study to support policy makers with insights into advantageous designs of transnational fuel supply chains to enable a climate-neutral European transport sector. Furthermore, we provide additional scenario analyses regarding the maximum installable capacity for renewable electricity generation as well as biomass and carbon dioxide availability, and fuel demand development.},

The determination of super-efficiency has been a way of solving this problem by providing a method to differentiate between the performance of observations. Despite the existence of some approaches dealing with the notion of super-efficiency in the literature, there have been few attempts to address this problem from the standpoint of machine learning techniques. In this paper, we fill this gap by adapting Random Forest to determine super-efficiency in the context of the Free Disposal Hull (FDH) technique. The new super-efficiency approach is robust to resampling on inputs and data. Additionally, we show how the new approach could be a possible solution for dealing with the curse of dimensionality problem; typically associated with FDH. Furthermore, exploiting the adaptation of Random Forest, a new method for assessing the importance of input variables is introduced. Finally, the advantages of the proposed approach are illustrated through a real example.},

In a two-parameter model, which we call Subjective Conditional Probability (SCP), auctioneers have subjective judgement of conditional probabilities. We theoretically show that the SCP explains two intuitive, but sub-optimal, reserve price setting patterns. It predicts and provides rationalizations for ex-ante reserve prices that decrease in the number of bidders and ex-post reserve prices that increase in the realized auction price. We conduct two experiments; one with a uniform cost distribution and another with a left-skewed cost distribution. We validate the SCP model internally and externally by comparing it to a wide range of models, including reduced form linear regression, risk aversion, anticipated regret model, and subjective probability judgement via in-sample and out-of-sample predictions. We conclude that the SCP has strong external validity across a variety of procurement environments.},

The effectiveness of direct marketing greatly depends on the assignment of customers to campaigns. In this paper, we consider a real-world planning problem of a major telecommunications company that assigns its customers to individual activities of its direct marketing campaigns. Various side constraints, such as budgets and sales targets, must be met. Conflict constraints ensure that individual customers are not assigned too frequently to similar activities. Related problems have been addressed in the literature; however, none of the existing approaches cover all the side constraints considered here. To close this gap, we develop a matheuristic that employs a new decomposition strategy to cope with the large number of conflict constraints in typical problem instances. In a computational experiment, we compare the performance of the proposed matheuristic to the performance of two mixed-binary linear programs on a test set that includes large-scale real-world instances. The matheuristic derives near-optimal solutions in short running times for small- to medium-sized instances and scales to instances of practical size comprising millions of customers and hundreds of activities. The deployment of the matheuristic at the company has considerably increased the overall effectiveness of its direct marketing campaigns.},

In this work, we propose a novel approach, complementary to measuring inconsistency, able to integrate and evaluate the concept of uncertainty in PCMs in order to verify the credibility of the final outcome. Such approach characterizes how SMEs’ uncertainty reflects into rank reversal.

  abstract     = {Formal expert elicitation is a widely used method for quantifying uncertain variables in decision and risk analysis. When estimating uncertain variables, experts and laypeople exhibit overprecision, meaning that the ranges of their estimates are too narrow. Overprecision, a form of overconfidence, is pervasive and hard to correct, thus posing a challenge to expert elicitation. Following the increasing interest toward improving judgments in Behavioral Operational Research (OR), and the limited evidence about the effectiveness of debiasing tools, the aim of our research is to test the effectiveness of commonly employed practices for debiasing overprecision. We conducted two experiments, testing a set of debiasing techniques when eliciting points of a cumulative distribution functions for general knowledge questions. The debiasing procedures included hypothetical bets, counterfactual argumentation, and automatic stretching to increase the ranges of subjects’ initial estimates. We find that two debiasing strategies that require further reasoning after initial estimates (hypothetical bets and counterfactuals) were not very effective for reducing overprecision, while the use of multipliers that increase the initial range of distributions, coupled with a re-elicitation of the distribution with the new range, provided more positive results. We provide some recommendations for expert elicitation in OR practice, based on our findings, and suggest avenues for further research into debiasing overprecision.},

Under the proposed policy, upon an arrival, a subset of ξ ξ stations will be randomly collected, with their state information being retrieved, where ξ ξ is a positive integer-valued random variable satisfying P { ξ ≥ 2 } &gt; 0 P{ξ≥2}&amp;gt;0 ; then, this new customer will be routed to: (i) the station with minimum expected delay modified by c c when all the collected stations are fully occupied; or otherwise (ii) the station with maximum idleness ratio modified by d d among the collected stations with idle servers. The parameters c c and d d are employed to control the relative expected delay and utilization levels across stations. Using asymptotic analysis, we derive diffusion limits of queue-length processes as well as their stationary distributions under the LB ( ξ , c , d ) LB(ξ,c,d) policy in the Halfin–Whitt regime. Based on these stationary diffusion limit results, we develop a solution procedure to determine policy parameters under different optimization criteria.

The main application of the problem is last-mile delivery in urban areas. We propose mathematical models to formulate both cases of cooperation and non-cooperation as multi-objective optimization problems in which carriers seek two objectives, including maximizing profit and increasing customer coverage. To allocate the coalition outcomes to participating carriers in the proposed cooperative game, we develop mathematical conditions to define a generalized core solution concept. In addition, we develop a generalized form of the well-known Shapley value ensued by a detailed discussion on the trust issue in these games. Thereafter, two methods of reaching a compromise among coalition members are proposed. Moreover, a heuristic algorithm and a full-enumeration method are developed to find Pareto-optimal solutions for the bi-objective cooperative game. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed models and algorithms, a set of benchmark instances having up to 225 customers are devised. Computational results indicate that cooperation can lead to profit improvement ranging from 9.07\% in small-size instances to 14.7\% in large-size instances on average, without worsening the customer coverage.},

Moreover, we validate the model and the solution methods through an extensive case study with different scenarios based on large-scale real-world data. We study the correlation among the objectives and analyse their variation trends when adjusting the influential factors. Finally, in this paper, useful managerial insights are provided for decision-makers of the platforms, such as how to balance the triple-bottom-line in a smart way.},

  abstract     = {To promote customer loyalty and generate revenue in after-sales service, many companies provide field repair services to their customers. Service technicians who perform these repair jobs typically carry a set of spare parts called a repair kit in their company van. The repair kit problem aims to determine which parts to include in this kit and in what quantity. Currently, many appliances are equipped with sensors that monitor their different functionalities. If an appliance breaks down because one of these functionalities is disturbed, then the respective sensor triggers a failure code that describes the appliance’s condition. From the service technician’s perspective, this failure code serves as potentially imperfect advance demand information for spare parts. In this paper, we present an extension of the repair kit problem that uses this information for the replenishment decision. We formulate this repair kit problem with advance demand information as a Markov decision process and propose two heuristic solution procedures. Our first heuristic is far-sighted and optimizes the inventory of all parts individually, while our second heuristic is a myopic greedy algorithm that considers all parts at once. We conduct an extensive numerical study to evaluate the performance of both heuristics and to identify which heuristic performs best under which circumstances. Comparing both heuristics to a state-of-the-art algorithm that disregards any available advance demand information, we find that utilizing this information yields substantial cost savings.},

This system can represent many real-world settings: forbidden returns, minimum order quantities, and capacity constraints for example. We show that this problem can be translated into a stopping time problem where the distributions of orders and inventory can be represented by a countably infinite mixture of truncated and convoluted demand distributions. This result can be extended to the cases of arbitrary lead time and auto-correlated demand. A state space algorithm is developed to approximate the first- and second-order moments of the order quantity and inventory level. Via a numerical analysis, we investigate the performance of the approximation, as well as the operational and economic impact of the order constraint. In particular, the constraint impacts order and inventory variances via different combinations of the mixture and truncation effects. We show how tuning the constraint can improve the operational and financial performance of the inventory system by acting as a smoothing mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Recent technological developments allow to connect vehicles via digital data transmission, so that a queue of trucks can safely be driven in close proximity. The lower air resistance of these truck platoons decreases fuel consumption and, thus, contributes to reducing the carbon footprint of road-based freight transportation. The efficiency of platooning depends not only on the aerodynamic drag, which considerably reduces with decreasing inter-vehicle distance. Whether a suitable platooning partner can be found also depends on the trucks’ willingness-to-wait and on a successful platoon formation process. Electric vehicles have to wait while loading their batteries anyway. Therefore, it might be possible to successfully coordinate charging with waiting for partner trucks. Furthermore, driving in a platoon reduces energy consumption, so that electric trucks can increase their driving ranges, which gives them an additional motive for platooning. This paper provides optimization approaches to schedule the platoon formation process of electric commercial vehicles via a central platform. Given a set of trucks with predetermined routes and time windows for their on-time arrivals at their destinations, we derive driving, charging and platoon formation schedules, such that total energy costs are minimized. We formulate the problem, analyze its computational complexity, and provide a novel matheuristic. Its suitable performance is documented by extensive computational experiments. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to quantify the performance gains when platooning electric trucks and benchmark these outcomes with individual driving schedules of electric trucks and with platoons of traditional trucks powered by a combustion engine.},

The problem aims at minimizing the total number of relocations for retrieving containers from a storage yard according to a specific order. The purpose of this study is to develop an efficient iterative deepening branch-and-bound algorithm for exactly solving one of the most practical variants of the problem, namely the unrestricted container relocation problem with duplicate priorities, which has received less attention in the literature. To improve the search efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we design two new lower bounds that can be computed quickly to incorporate them into the branch-and-bound algorithm. We also present a set of mutually consistent dominance rules to reduce the search space while avoiding over-pruning. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by extensive computational experiments on three commonly used benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art exact algorithm for the unrestricted container relocation problem with distinct priorities, although our algorithm is applicable to a more general variant of the problem. Moreover, it can still provide competitive results for small- and medium-sized instances under a strict time limit of one second in comparison to existing metaheuristic approaches.},

These contracts cover all maintenance-related costs for a fixed, upfront fee during a predetermined horizon. Charging each contract a price proportional to its risk prevents adverse selection by incentivizing low risk (i.e., maintenance-light) profiles to not renege on their agreements. We borrow techniques from non-life insurance pricing and tailor them to the setting of maintenance contracts to assess the risk and estimate the expected maintenance costs under a full-service contract. We apply the framework on a portfolio of about 5 000 5000 full-service contracts of industrial equipment and show how a data-driven analysis based on contract and machine characteristics, or risk factors , supports a differentiated, risk-based break-even tariff plan. We employ generalized additive models (GAMs) to predict the risk factors’ impact on the frequency (number of) and severity (cost) of maintenance interventions. GAMs are interpretable yet flexible statistical models that capture the effect of both continuous and categorical risk factors. Our predictive models quantify the impact of the contract and machine type, service history, and machine running hours on the contract cost. We additionally utilize the predictive cost distributions of our models to augment the break-even price with the appropriate risk margins to further protect against the inherently stochastic nature of the maintenance costs. The framework shows how maintenance intervention data can set up a differentiated tariff plan.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss the order batching problem in manual order picking systems. In such systems, order pickers move through a warehouse to collect items that are requested by customers. Customer orders have to be grouped into picking orders of limited size to ensure that the total length of the picker tours to collect all items is minimized. Motivated by real-world restrictions, we assume that the pick devices are heterogeneous, i.e., it is not necessarily possible to transport each customer order with each device. Since the order batching problem is NP-hard, we propose both serial and parallel versions of a variable neighborhood search (VNS) scheme to tackle large-sized problem instances in a reasonable amount of time. Moreover, the VNS scheme is hybridized with a set partitioning problem formulation. Based on computational experiments, we show that the proposed VNS scheme is a very fast approach that is able to provide solutions for benchmark instances with homogeneous pick devices that are of comparable quality or even partly superior to the best performing approaches from the literature. New benchmark instances for heterogeneous pick devices are proposed. High-quality solutions are obtained for these instances. We also consider large-scale problem instances from a real-world e-commerce warehouse. The VNS scheme outperforms the heuristic applied for order batching in this warehouse. Moreover, we demonstrate that a warehouse setup with heterogeneous pick devices is highly beneficial with respect to operating cost savings.},

We present an approximation algorithm, i.e., an algorithm with proven worst-case guarantees both in terms of running time and solution quality, for the general capacitated version of this problem, in which both vehicles and facilities are capacitated. Before, such approximation algorithms were only known for the special case where facilities are uncapacitated or where their capacities can be extended arbitrarily at linear cost. Previously established lower bounds that are known to approximate the optimal solution value well in the uncapacitated case can be off by an arbitrary factor in the general case. We show that this issue can be overcome by a bifactor approximation algorithm that may slightly exceed facility capacities by an adjustable, arbitrarily small fraction of the vehicle capacity while approximating the optimal cost by a constant factor. In addition to these proven worst-case guarantees, we also assess the practical performance of our algorithm in a comprehensive computational study, showing that the approach allows efficient computation of near-optimal solutions for instance sizes beyond the reach of current state-of-the-art heuristics.},

Instance Space Analysis (ISA) is a methodology that provides insights into such per-instance analysis. In this paper, the instance space of MFP is constructed and analysed for the first time. Novel features from the networks are extracted, capturing the performance of MFP algorithms. Additionally, this paper expands the ISA methodology by addressing the issue of how benchmark instances should be selected to reduce bias in the analysis. Using the enhanced ISA methodology with MFP as the case study, this paper demonstrates that the most important features can be detected, and machine learning methods can identify their impact on algorithm performance, whilst reducing the bias caused by over-representation within the selected sample of test instances. The enhanced methodology enables new insights into the performance of state-of-the-art general purpose MFP algorithms, as well as recommendations for the construction of comprehensive and unbiased benchmark test suites for MFP algorithm testing.},

To achieve this balance, there exist a wide variety of methods. In particular, several methods based on optimization models have been recently proposed in the causal inference literature. While these optimization-based methods empirically showed an improvement over a limited number of other causal inference methods in their relative ability to balance the distributions of covariates and to estimate causal effects, they have not been thoroughly compared to each other and to other noteworthy causal inference methods. In addition, we believe that there exist several unaddressed opportunities that operational researchers could contribute with their advanced knowledge of optimization, for the benefits of the applied researchers that use causal inference tools.

  abstract     = {Post COVID-19 vaccine development, nations are now getting ready to face another challenge: how to effectively distribute vaccines amongst the masses to quickly achieve herd immunity against the infection. According to some experts, herd immunity for COVID-19 can be achieved by inoculating 67\% of the population. India may find it difficult to achieve this service level target, owing to several infrastructural deficiencies in its vaccine supply chain. Effect of these deficiencies is to cause frequent lead time disruptions. In this context, we develop a novel modelling approach to identify few nodes, which require additional inventory allocations (strategic inventory reserves) to ensure minimum service level (67\%) under the possibility of lead time disruptions. Later, through an illustrative case study on distribution of Japanese Encephalitis vaccine, we identify conditions under which strategic inventory reserve policy cannot be practically implemented to meet service level targets. Nodes fulfilling these conditions are termed as critical nodes and must be overhauled structurally to make the implementation of strategic inventory policy practically viable again. Structural overhauling may entail installation of better cold storage facilities, purchasing more quality transport vans, improving reliability of transport network, and skills of cold storage manager by training. Ideally, conditions for identifying critical nodes for COVID-19 vaccine distribution must be derived separately by substituting COVID-19 specific parametric values in our model. In the absence of the required data for COVID-19 scenario, JE specific criteria can be used heuristically to identify critical nodes and structurally overhaul them later for efficiently achieving service level targets.},

  abstract     = {The global health crisis caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the importance of efficient disease detection and control strategies for minimizing the number of infections and deaths in the population and halting the spread of the pandemic. Countries have shown different preparedness levels for promptly implementing disease detection strategies, via mass testing and isolation of identified cases, which led to a largely varying impact of the outbreak on the populations and health-care systems. In this paper, we propose a new pandemic resource allocation model for allocating limited disease detection and control resources, in particular testing capacities, in order to limit the spread of a pandemic. The proposed model is a novel epidemiological compartmental model formulated as a non-linear programming model that is suitable to address the inherent non-linearity of an infectious disease progression within the population. A number of novel features are implemented in the model to take into account important disease characteristics, such as asymptomatic infection and the distinct risk levels of infection within different segments of the population. Moreover, a method is proposed to estimate the vulnerability level of the different communities impacted by the pandemic and to explicitly consider equity in the resource allocation problem. The model is validated against real data for a case study of COVID-19 outbreak in France and our results provide various insights on the optimal testing intervention time and level, and the impact of the optimal allocation of testing resources on the spread of the disease among regions. The results confirm the significance of the proposed modeling framework for informing policymakers on the best preparedness strategies against future infectious disease outbreaks.},

  abstract     = {Despite its efficiency in reducing the impact of pandemics (e.g., the COVID-19), whether to introduce telemedicine as an additional way to serve chronically ill patients remains controversial for hospitals in many countries. This paper builds a stylized model to investigate a hospital’s telemedicine strategy and the corresponding impacts on its operations regarding outpatient management of chronic diseases. We implement our analysis from three key concerns of the hospital in the presence of a pandemic: the differences in medical consumption and reimbursement between in-person and telemedicine modalities and the effort cost of infection reduction resulting from the pandemic. We find that in the absence of the pandemic, the hospital prefers to introduce telemedicine when the differences in medical consumption and reimbursement are both small. In the presence of the pandemic, we find that the introduction of telemedicine does not always benefit the hospital and that it is better not to introduce telemedicine in some cases since it may exacerbate the negative influence of the pandemic on the hospital’s total costs. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that the hospital may set greater in-person capacity but less telemedicine capacity in response to the outbreak of the pandemic under certain conditions, which contradicts public beliefs. Finally, we show that social welfare can be improved by introducing telemedicine when the effort cost of infection reduction and the difference in reimbursement are both of moderate size. The condition under which social welfare is improved tightens with a greater difference in medical consumption.},

In this study, we address capacity planning decisions of a hemodialysis clinic, located within a major public hospital in Istanbul, which serves both infected and uninfected patients during the COVID-19 pandemic with limited resources (i.e., dialysis machines). The clinic currently applies a 3-unit cohorting strategy to treat different types of patients (i.e., uninfected, infected, suspected) in separate units and at different times to mitigate the risk of infection spread risk. Accordingly, at the beginning of each week, the clinic needs to allocate the available dialysis machines to each unit that serves different patient cohorts. However, given the uncertainties in the number of different types of patients that will need dialysis each day, it is a challenge to determine which capacity configuration would minimize the overlapping treatment sessions of different cohorts over a week. We represent the uncertainties in the number of patients by a set of scenarios and present a stochastic programming approach to support capacity allocation decisions of the clinic. We present a case study based on the real-world patient data obtained from the hemodialysis clinic to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. We also compare the performance of different cohorting strategies with three and two patient cohorts.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a new risk-averse multi-stage stochastic epidemics-ventilator-logistics compartmental model to address the resource allocation challenges of mitigating COVID-19. This epidemiological logistics model involves the uncertainty of untested asymptomatic infections and incorporates short-term human migration. Disease transmission is also forecasted through a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over space and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage stochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic individuals while optimizing the distribution of resources, such as ventilators, to minimize the total expected number of newly infected and deceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated into the multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted expected loss due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios. We apply our multi-stage mean-risk epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling COVID-19 in highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate, and test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. We also define a new region-based sub-problem and bounds on the problem and then show their computational benefits in terms of the optimality and relaxation gaps. The computational results indicate that short-term migration influences the transmission of the disease significantly. The optimal number of ventilators allocated to each region depends on various factors, including the number of initial infections, disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a geographical location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our data-driven modeling framework can be adapted to study the disease transmission dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and pandemics.},

  abstract     = {Amidst a pandemic, operators of emergency medical service (EMS) systems aim at upholding service at sufficiently low response times while reducing the infection probability of their personnel. Designating ambulances to serve only infected patients and suspected cases may reduce the outage probabilities of ambulances and consequently the response times of the EMS. We investigate the benefits that EMS personnel and patients can gain from such a split. As a solution method to quantify these benefits, we apply a two-stage approach. First, we run a first-stage optimization model to pre-select ambulance splits with the highest emergency call coverage. Second, we solve the approximate Hypercube Queuing Model (AHQM) to evaluate the performance of the pre-selected ambulance splits at the second stage. We contribute to the existing literature by including multiple incident categories and outages of ambulances in the AHQM and combining it with the first-stage optimization model. Further, we conduct a case study for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic to draw conclusions on the benefits of splitting. We observe that an ambulance split would not reduce the average response time for the examined data set since the Covid-related call volume in Munich and the infection probability are too low. However, a sensitivity analysis shows that long isolation times and high infection probabilities make an ambulance split beneficial for patients and EMS personnel, as an ambulance split reduces the average response time without significantly increasing the mean infection probability for EMS personnel.},

To calculate the transmission rate, we propose a function that accounts for contact rate, duration of the contact, age structure of the population, susceptibility to infection, and the number of transmission events per contact. Moreover, the COVID-19 cases are divided into different groups according to the severity of their disease and are allocated to appropriate health facilities that provide care tailored to their needs. The multi-stage fuzzy stochastic programming approach is applied to cope with uncertainty, in which the probability associated with nodes of the scenario tree is treated as fuzzy variables. To handle the probabilistic model, we use a more flexible measure, M e Me measure, which allows decision-makers to adopt varying attitudes by assigning the optimistic-pessimistic parameter. This measure does not force decision-makers to hold extreme views and obtain the interval solution that provides further information in the fuzzy environment. We apply the proposed model to the case of Tehran, Iran. The results of this study indicate that assigning patients to appropriate medical centers improves the performance of the healthcare system. The result analysis highlights the impact of the demographic differences on virus transmission, and the older population has a greater influence on virus transmission than other age groups. Besides, the results indicate that behavioral changes in the population and their vaccination play a key role in curbing COVID-19 transmission.},

The number of patients requiring scarce healthcare resources is uncertain and dependent on the speed of the pandemic&#39;s transmission through a region. We develop a multi-stage stochastic program to optimize various strategies for planning limited and necessary healthcare resources. We simulate uncertain parameters by deploying an agent-based continuous-time stochastic model, and then capture the uncertainty by a forward scenario tree construction approach. Finally, we propose a data-driven rolling horizon procedure to facilitate decision-making in real-time, which mitigates some critical limitations of stochastic programming approaches and makes the resulting strategies implementable in practice. We use two different case studies related to COVID-19 to examine our optimization and simulation tools by extensive computational results.

Given the abruptness of epidemic outbreaks, quick access to sufficient medical supplies is essential. Most existing research focuses on reserving physical stocks only, while some authors also consider reserving production capacity. This study is the first to consider capital reserves besides physical stocks, a practice that is for instance used in China. We characterize in closed form and graphically under what conditions a certain reserve policy (no reserves, safety stock only, capital reserve only, mixed reserves) is optimal. A key insight is that increased demand uncertainty sometimes leads to lower safety stock levels, although the combined reserves do increase. In such situations, to limit the risk of obsolescence, it is optimal to rely less on safety stocks and more on capital reserves.},

We assume that specimens can be collected in two ways: either by means of a mobile test-team or by means of a stationary test-team in a test-centre. After the specimens have been collected they must be delivered to a laboratory in order to be analysed. The problem we address aims at deciding how many test-centres to open and where, how many mobile test-teams to use, which suspected cases to assign to a test-centre and which to visit with a mobile test-team, which specimen to assign to which laboratory, and planning the routes of the mobile test-teams. The objective is to minimise the total cost of opening test-centres and routing mobile test-teams. We introduce this new problem, which we call the contagious disease testing problem (CDTP), and present a mixed-integer linear-programming formulation for it. We propose a large neighbourhood search metaheuristic for solving the CDTP and present an extensive computational study to illustrate its performance. Furthermore, we give managerial insights regarding COVID-19 test logistics, derived from problem instances based on real world data.},

  abstract     = {The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has seriously affected the whole world, and epidemic research has attracted increasing amounts of scholarly attention. Critical facilities such as warehouses to store emergency supplies and testing or vaccination sites could help to control the spread of COVID-19. This paper focuses on how to locate the testing facilities to satisfy the varying demand, i.e., test kits, caused by pandemics. We propose a two-phase optimization framework to locate facilities and adjust capacity during large-scale emergencies. During the first phase, the initial prepositioning strategies are determined to meet predetermined fill-rate requirements using the sample average approximation formulation. We develop an online convex optimization-based Lagrangian relaxation approach to solve the problem. Specifically, to overcome the difficulty that all scenarios should be addressed simultaneously in each iteration, we adopt an online gradient descent algorithm, in which a near-optimal approximation for a given Lagrangian dual multiplier is constructed. During the second phase, the capacity to deal with varying demand is adjusted dynamically. To overcome the inaccuracy of long-term prediction, we design a dynamic allocation policy and adaptive dynamic allocation policy to adjust the policy to meet the varying demand with only one day’s prediction. A comprehensive case study with the threat of COVID-19 is conducted. Numerical results have verified that the proposed two-phase framework is effective in meeting the varying demand caused by pandemics. Specifically, our adaptive policy can achieve a solution with only a 3.3\% gap from the optimal solution with perfect information.},

  abstract     = {The spread of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 brought new challenges to our society, including a stronger focus on safety across all businesses. Many countries have imposed a minimum social distance among people in order to ensure their safety. This brings new challenges to many customer-related businesses, such as restaurants, offices, theaters, etc., on how to locate their facilities (tables, seats etc.) under distancing constraints. We propose a parallel between this problem and that of locating wind turbines in an offshore area. The discovery of this parallel allows us to apply Mathematical Optimization algorithms originally designed for wind farms, to produce optimized facility layouts that minimize the overall risk of infection among customers. In this way we can investigate the structure of the safest layouts, with some surprising outcomes. A lesson learned is that, in the safest layouts, the facilities are not equally distanced (as it is typically believed) but tend to concentrate on the border of the available area—a policy that significantly reduces the overall risk of contagion.},

  abstract     = {Due to dense social contacts, metropolises are considered as epicenters of contagious infectious diseases. Developing models for infection transmission and mitigation in metropolises is a challenging problem because of spatiotemporal variations in their population structures. Employing the fact that intra-urban mobility is mainly shaped by the transportation infrastructure and reflected in the traffic flux information, a novel multi-scale reaction-diffusion process is developed to model infection transmission in a metropolis. To mitigate the infection, the impact of three non-pharmaceutical preventive interventions (movement restrictions, social distancing, and proactive testing/screening) is analytically investigated on the reaction-diffusion process. We show that imposing movement restrictions between sub-urban areas is only beneficial when they have different reproduction numbers. The social distancing reduces the infection peak in sub-urban areas, but its impact on the entire metropolis is various: The social distancing reduces a metropolis&#39;s infection peak if its implementation disperses the reproduction number of sub-urban areas. We show that allocation schemes of proactive testing/screening teams to sub-urban areas have intractable impacts on the infection peak. This demonstrates the necessity of employing optimization techniques to design the best allocation scheme. Finally, three mathematical models and their solution approaches are developed to optimize the implementation of the interventions with the least economic burden. The performance of the optimization models is compared with two simpler implementation schemes (uniform and pro rata implementations of interventions) using the information of Sioux Falls metropolitan area in the U.S.},

Pandemic response policies guided by geospatial approaches are appropriate additions to traditional epidemiological responses when addressing this disaster. However, little is known about finding the optimal set of locations or jurisdictions to create policy coordination zones. In this study, we propose optimization models and algorithms to identify coordination communities based on the natural movement of people. To do so, we develop a mixed-integer quadratic-programming model to maximize the modularity of detected communities while ensuring that the jurisdictions within each community are contiguous. To solve the problem, we present a heuristic and a column-generation algorithm. Our computational experiments highlight the effectiveness of the models and algorithms in various instances. We also apply the proposed optimization-based solutions to identify coordination zones within North Carolina and South Carolina, two highly interconnected states in the U.S. Results of our case study show that the proposed model detects communities that are significantly better for coordinating pandemic related policies than the existing geopolitical boundaries.},

Crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic create dilemmas for policymakers because the long-term implementation of restrictive social distancing policies may cause massive economic damage and ultimately harm healthcare systems. This paper proposes an epidemic control framework that policymakers can use as a data-driven decision support tool for setting efficient social distancing targets. The framework addresses three aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are related to social distancing or community mobility data: modeling, financial implications, and policy-making. Thus, we explore the COVID-19 pandemic and concurrent economic situation as functions of historical pandemic data and mobility control. This approach allows us to formulate an efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic feedback control problem that minimizes the aggregated risks of disease transmission and economic volatility. We further demonstrate the use of a deep learning algorithm to solve this control problem. Finally, by applying our framework to U.S. data, we empirically examine the efficiency of the U.S. social distancing policy.},

Our model is non-convex in decision variables, and we develop two heuristics to obtain fast and high-quality solutions. Our results indicate that when anticipated economic consequences are higher, healthcare overcapacity will emerge. When the projected economic costs of the pandemic are large and the illness severity is low, however, a no-intervention strategy may be preferable. As the severity of the infection rises, the cost of intervention climbs accordingly. The death toll also increases with the severity of both the economic consequences of interventions and the infection rate of the disease. Our models suggest earlier mitigation strategies that typically start before the saturation of the healthcare system when disease severity is high.},

The article reviews early transmission dynamics featuring exponential growth in infections, and links this to a renewal epidemic model where the current incidence of infection depends upon the expected value of incidence randomly lagged into the past. This leads directly to simple formulas for the fraction of the population infected in an unmitigated outbreak, and reveals herd immunity as the solution to an optimization problem. The model also leads to direct and easy-to-understand formulas for aligning observable epidemic indicators such as cases, hospitalizations and deaths with the unobservable incidence of infection, and as a byproduct leads to a simple first-order approach for estimating the effective reproduction number R t Rt . The model also leads naturally to direct assessments of the effectiveness of isolation in preventing the spread of infection. This is illustrated with application to repeat asymptomatic screening programs of the sort utilized by universities, sports teams and businesses to prevent the spread of infection.},

  abstract     = {A critical operations management problem in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is cognizance of (a) the number of all carriers at large (CaL) conveying the SARS-CoV-2, including asymptomatic ones and (b) the infection rate (IR). Both are random and unobservable, affecting the spread of the disease, patient arrivals to health care units (HCUs) and the number of deaths. A novel, inventory perspective of COVID-19 is proposed, with random inflow, random losses and retrials (recurrent cases) and delayed/distributed exit, with randomly varying fractions of the exit distribution. A minimal construal, it enables representation of COVID-19 evolution with close fit of national incidence profiles, including single and multiple pattern outbreaks, oscillatory, periodic or non-periodic evolution, followed by retraction, leveling off, or strong resurgence. Furthermore, based on asymptotic laws, the minimum number of variables that must be monitored for identifying CaL and IR is determined and a real-time identification method is presented. The method is data-driven, utilizing the entry rate to HCUs and scaled, or dimensionless variables, including the mean residence time of symptomatic carriers in CaL and the mean residence time in CaL of patients entering HCUs. As manifested by several robust case studies of national COVID-19 incidence profiles, it provides efficient identification in real-time under unbiased monitoring error, without relying on any model. The propagation factor, a stochastic process, is reconstructed from the identified trajectories of CaL and IR, enabling evaluation of control measures. The results are useful towards the design of policies restricting COVID-19 and encumbrance to HCUs and mitigating economic contraction.},

Predictions of mortality, cases and hospitalisations help governments meet planning and resource allocation challenges. In this paper, we consider the weekly forecasting of the cumulative mortality due to COVID-19 at the national and state level in the U.S. Optimal decision-making requires a forecast of a probability distribution, rather than just a single point forecast. Interval forecasts are also important, as they can support decision making and provide situational awareness. We consider the case where probabilistic forecasts have been provided by multiple forecasting teams, and we combine the forecasts to extract the wisdom of the crowd. We use a dataset that has been made publicly available from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. A notable feature of the dataset is that the availability of forecasts from participating teams varies greatly across the 40 weeks in our study. We evaluate the accuracy of combining methods that have been previously proposed for interval forecasts and predictions of probability distributions. These include the use of the simple average, the median, and trimming methods. In addition, we propose several new weighted combining methods. Our results show that, although the median was very useful for the early weeks of the pandemic, the simple average was preferable thereafter, and that, as a history of forecast accuracy accumulates, the best results can be produced by a weighted combining method that uses weights that are inversely proportional to the historical accuracy of the individual forecasting teams.},
