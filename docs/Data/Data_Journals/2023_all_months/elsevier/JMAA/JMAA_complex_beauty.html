  abstract     = {Given a self-adjoint operator H 0 H0 and a relatively compact self-adjoint perturbation V , we study in some detail the spectral properties of the product ( H 0 − z ) − 1 V (H0−z)−1V , z ∈ C z∈C . The eigenvalues of this product are related simply to those of the corresponding product in the situation when the operator H 0 H0 is perturbed to H 0 + s V H0+sV for s ∈ C s∈C . For some numbers r z rz , the eigenvalues of ( H 0 + s V − z ) − 1 V (H0+sV−z)−1V , s ∈ C s∈C , are ( s − r z ) − 1 (s−rz)−1 . We study the root spaces of the eigenvalues ( s − r z ) − 1 (s−rz)−1 and complex-analytic properties of the functions r z rz such as branching points. In particular, for a generic case, we give a variety of necessary and sufficient conditions for branching. The functions r z rz , called coupling resonances, are important in the spectral analysis of H 0 + r V H0+rV for any real number r ∈ R r∈R . For instance, they afford a description of the spectral shift function (SSF) of the pair H 0 H0 and V , as well as the absolutely continuous and singular parts of the SSF. A thorough study of real-valued coupling resonances r λ rλ for real λ outside of the essential spectrum was carried out in a recent work by the first author. Here we extend this study to the complex domain, motivated by the fact, which is well known in the case of a rank-one perturbation, that the behaviour of coupling resonances r z rz near the essential spectrum provides valuable information about the latter.},

First, in the spirit of [52] and [18] , we demonstrate the convergence of the JKO scheme (derived from the Optimal Transport theory) to an L ∞ L∞ -weak solution that is local in time. Recently, L ∞ L∞ solutions have shown to be important to obtaining uniqueness results. Since the death rate case does not ensure the existence of global L ∞ L∞ solutions for arbitrary initial data , we establish sufficient conditions that lead to the finite-time blow-up phenomenon and describe several stages at which this occurs. This part can be seen as a partial generalization of the blow-up results reported in [22] . Finally, we conduct some numerical simulations that explore solutions for initial data types not covered in the main convergence result.},

Their pioneering paper has been extended in different directions by several authors. In 2017, Fonda and Ureña established a deeper relation between the results by Conley and Zehnder and the Poincaré–Birkhoff Theorem. In 2020, Fonda and Gidoni pursued along this path in order to treat systems whose Hamiltonian function includes a nonresonant quadratic term. It is the aim of this paper to further extend this fertile theory to Hamiltonian systems which, besides the periodicity-twist conditions always required in the Poincaré–Birkhoff Theorem, also include a term involving a pair of well-ordered lower and upper solutions. Phase-plane analysis techniques are used in order to recover a saddle-type dynamics permitting us to apply the above mentioned results.},

This problem differs significantly from what can be found in the literature since we assume that the dissipation mechanism is mechanical while the heat conduction mechanism is conservative. We first prove the existence of a semigroup of contractions defining the solutions in a suitable Hilbert space . Exponential stability of the solutions is also proved by means of a known characterization of the exponentially stable semigroups. The lack of differentiability of the semigroup is also proved. Finally, we use energy arguments to show that the only solution that can be zero after a finite time is the null solution.},

  abstract     = {The Khinchin–Kahane inequality is a fundamental result in the probability literature, with the most general version to date holding in Banach spaces . Motivated by modern settings and applications, we generalize this inequality to arbitrary metric groups which are abelian. If instead of abelian one assumes the group&#39;s metric to be a norm (i.e., Z &gt; 0 Z&amp;gt;0 -homogeneous), then we explain how the inequality improves to the same one as in Banach spaces . This occurs via a “transfer principle” that helps carry over questions involving normed metric groups and abelian normed semigroups into the Banach space framework. This principle also extends the notion of the expectation to random variables with values in arbitrary abelian normed metric semigroups G G . We provide additional applications, including studying weakly ℓ p ℓp G G -valued sequences and related Rademacher series. On a related note, we also formulate a “general” Lévy inequality, with two features: (i) It subsumes several known variants in the Banach space literature; and (ii) We show the inequality in the minimal framework required to state it: abelian metric groups.},

We prove this conjecture. Thanks to earlier work by Seo and Yee, the conjecture would follow from the non-negativity of the coefficients of this infinite product. Using a variant of the circle method along with Euler–Maclaurin summation , we establish this non-negativity, thereby confirming the Coll–Mayers–Mayers Conjecture.},

Such a matrix is often recognized as a third-order tensor. The product between tubal scalars, tubal vectors, and tubal matrices can be done by the powerful t -product. In this paper, we define nonnegative/positive/strongly positive tubal scalars/vectors/matrices, and establish several properties that are analogous to their matrix counterparts. In particular, we introduce irreducible tubal matrices and provide two equivalent characterizations. Then, the celebrated PF theorem is established on the nonnegative irreducible tubal matrices. We show that some conclusions of the PF theorem for nonnegative irreducible matrices, such as the existence of a positive eigenvector, can be generalized to the tubal matrix setting, while some are not. For those conclusions that can not be extended, weaker conclusions are proved. We also show that, if the nonnegative irreducible tubal matrix contains a strongly positive tubal scalar, then most conclusions of the matrix PF theorem hold.},

  abstract     = {We consider the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation ∂ t 2 u ( x , t ) − ∂ x 2 u ( x , t ) + α u ( x , t ) = ± | u ( x , t ) | p − 1 u ( x , t ) ∂t2u(x,t)−∂x2u(x,t)+αu(x,t)=±|u(x,t)|p−1u(x,t) on a periodic metric graph (necklace graph) for p &gt; 1 p&amp;gt;1 with Kirchhoff conditions at the vertices. Under suitable assumptions on the frequency we prove the existence and regularity of infinitely many spatially localized time-periodic solutions (breathers) by variational methods . Compared to previous results obtained via spatial dynamics and center manifold techniques our results provide existence for all values of α ≥ 0 α≥0 as well as multiplicity. Moreover, we deduce regularity properties of the solutions and show that they are weak solutions of the corresponding initial value problem . Our approach relies on the existence of critical points for indefinite functionals, the concentration compactness principle, and the proper set-up of a functional analytic framework. Compared to earlier work for breathers using variational techniques, a major improvement of embedding properties has been achieved. This allows in particular to avoid all restrictions on the exponent p &gt; 1 p&amp;gt;1 and to achieve higher regularity.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the Liouville-type theorems for three-dimensional stationary incompressible MHD and Hall-MHD systems in a slab with periodic boundary condition . We show that, under the assumptions that (uθ,bθ) or (ur,br) is axisymmetric, or (rur,rbr) is bounded, any smooth bounded solution to the MHD or Hall-MHD system with local Dirichlet integral growing as an arbitrary power function must be constant. This improves the result of Theorem 1.2 in Pan (2021) [33] , where the Dirichlet integral of u is assumed to be finite. Inspired by Bang et al. (2022) [3] , our proof relies on establishing Saint-Venant&#39;s estimates associated with our problem, and the result in the current paper extends that for stationary Navier-Stokes equations shown by [3] to MHD and Hall-MHD equations. To achieve this, more intricate estimates are needed to handle the terms involving b properly.},

It is assumed that jump parameters ( λ and Q ), as well the continuous and boundary costs ( C g Cg and C i Ci respectively), depend on an unknown parameter ⁎ β ⁎ β⁎ . It is shown that the principle of estimation and control holds, that is, the strategy consisting of choosing, at each stage n , an action according to an optimal stationary policy, where the true but unknown parameter ⁎ β ⁎ β⁎ is replaced by its estimated value β ˆ n βˆn , is asymptotically discount optimal, provided that the sequence of estimators { β ˆ n } {βˆn} of ⁎ β ⁎ β⁎ is strongly consistent, that is, β ˆ n βˆn converge to ⁎ β ⁎ β⁎ almost surely. In the framework of PDMPs, the so-called discrepancy function depends on the derivative along the flow of the value function as well as on some boundary conditions, which brings new challenges in the analysis of this problem.},

Moreover, we show that the domain equalities ⁎ dom A = dom A ⁎ domA=domA⁎ and dom Re A = dom A R domReA=domAR are equivalent to problems of invariant operator ranges of bounded selfadjoint or unitary operators as well as to the existence of bounded operators with specific operator range properties.},

We show that on the space of continuous function uo convergence is weaker than the compact open convergence iff the underlying topological space contains a dense locally compact subspace . For a large class of convergences we prove that a positive operator is order continuous if and only if its restriction to a dense regular sublattice is order continuous, and that the closure of a regular sublattice is regular with the original sublattice being order dense in the closure.

First, we note that only finite-dimensional spaces have the Hölder-FPP. Moreover, the unit ball B X BX of any infinite-dimensional space fails the FPP for Hölder maps with d ( T , B X ) &gt; 0 d(T,BX)&amp;gt;0 , where d ( T , K ) d(T,K) denotes the minimal displacement of T . We further show that reflexivity and weak sequential continuity are sufficient conditions to capture fixed points of Hölder-Lipschitz maps with bounded orbits. Next we focus on the existence of fixed point free α -Hölder maps T : K → K T:K→K with d ( T , K ) ≤ φ ( α ) d(T,K)≤φ(α) where either φ ( α ) = 0 φ(α)=0 or φ ( α ) → 0 φ(α)→0 as α → 1 α→1 .

  abstract     = {For any operator T on ℓ 2 ℓ2 , its associated Foguel operator F T FT is [ S ⁎ 0 T S ] [S⁎0TS] on ℓ 2 ⊕ ℓ 2 ℓ2⊕ℓ2 , where S is the (simple) unilateral shift. It is easily seen that the numerical radius w ( F T ) w(FT) of F T FT satisfies 1 ≤ w ( F T ) ≤ 1 + ( 1 / 2 ) ‖ T ‖ 1≤w(FT)≤1+(1/2)‖T‖ . In this paper, we study when such upper and lower bounds of w ( F T ) w(FT) are attained. For the upper bound, we show that w ( F T ) = 1 + ( 1 / 2 ) ‖ T ‖ w(FT)=1+(1/2)‖T‖ if and only if w ( S + T ⁎ S ⁎ T ) = 1 + ‖ T ‖ 2 w(S+T⁎S⁎T)=1+‖T‖2 . When T is a diagonal operator with nonnegative diagonals, we obtain, among other results, that w ( F T ) = 1 + ( 1 / 2 ) ‖ T ‖ w(FT)=1+(1/2)‖T‖ if and only if w ( S T ) = ‖ T ‖ w(ST)=‖T‖ . As for the lower bound, it is shown that any diagonal T with w ( F T ) = 1 w(FT)=1 is compact. Examples of various T &#39;s are given to illustrate such attainments of w ( F T ) w(FT) .},

A transformation used to address nonnegativity subsequently results in classical solutions for strictly positive initial states. An alternating construction introduced to obtain solutions via monotone limits from above and below is somewhat reminiscent of the method of upper and lower solutions. Subsolution/supersolution comparison results that follow are applied to analyze boundedness , positivity, and blow up in finite time of solutions for power law cases of localized absorption and memory driven dissipation at the boundary. This connects the present work with our previous analyses of models having memory driven absorption at the boundary, shown to exactly parallel known results in cases of localized absorption, and begins to reveal comparative strengths of each.},

  abstract     = {The electromagnetic scattering problem for a time-harmonic plane wave by a perfectly conductive body embedded in a chiral medium is considered. Potentials in terms of the fundamental solution in dyadic form for chiral media are defined. The well-posedness of the scattering problem is studied using defined potentials in terms of the fundamental solution for chiral environment and the boundary integral operators associated with them. An extension of the method of fundamental solutions for electromagnetic scattering in chiral media is applied in order to approximate the solution. The electric scattered field is approximated by a finite linear combination of the dyadic fundamental solutions of the equation governing the problem for singularities placed on an auxiliary surface outside the domain of the problem and for unknown coefficients determined by the boundary conditions. Density properties on the surface of the scatterer are proven for a defined system of functions consisting of the tangential components of the dyadic fundamental solution. These density properties together with the well-posedness of the scattering problem are used to reduce the approximation of the solution to the approximation of the known boundary data. The linear system obtained from the boundary conditions in order to determine the appropriate unknown coefficients of the finite linear combination is presented. Using these results we approximate the far-field patterns and the scattering cross section. Numerical results for the special case of a spherical scatterer and an ellipsoidal scatterer are presented.},

We consider two distinct scenarios of values of the exponents p and q . These results complement the classical strong ( p , p ) (p,p) results and their generalizations considered by some authors. For applications, we provide the corresponding continuous and discrete results when T = R T=R , T = N T=N , and T T is the quantum space ℓ N 0 ℓN0 for ℓ &gt; 1 ℓ&amp;gt;1 , respectively. As special cases, we capture some consequences for the results obtained by Anderson, Heinig, Kufner, Flett, and Saker.},

  abstract     = {Closed shift-invariant subspaces of Hilbert space are the core idea of important classes of signal and image analysis methods such as wavelets, shearlets, radial basis functions and many more. In 1994 de Boor, DeVore and Ron [4] gave a full characterization of the order of approximation in such shift-invariant subspaces of L 2 ( R n ) L2(Rn) , n ∈ N n∈N . Ron and Holtz extended this work in [10] to Sobolev norms, and gave specific criteria on the generating functions to guarantee certain orders of approximation. However, not for all generating functions these criteria are easy to verify. We here give new criteria which are designed for generating functions given explicitly in Fourier domain. We show by various examples on spline functions that in these cases our new criteria give better estimates on the order of approximation.},

Here we identify ( π n ) n ∈ N ⊆ P (πn)n∈N⊆P such that f π n ( μ ) → d ν a d μ μ a.s. as n → ∞ ; fπn(μ)→dνadμμ a.s. as n→∞; in the setting of separable F F , a (rather trivial) way to do this was already known. To do all this, we characterise the case of equality in Jensen&#39;s conditional inequality (generalising the known case of the standard Jensen inequality), and use this to determine how, given a p -uniformly integrable martingale ( f i ) i ∈ I (fi)i∈I , one can identify a sequence ( i n ) n ∈ N ⊆ I (in)n∈N⊆I such that ( f i n ) n (fin)n converges in L p Lp to some f which closes the whole net ( f i ) i (fi)i . We also give a new proof of the (already-known) characterisation of p -uniformly integrable martingales, without relying on the martingale a.s. convergence theorem.},

The moving liquid-solid interface is explicitly fulfilled as the energy and momentum equations are solved over the full physical domain. Under particular assumptions, we derive various a priori estimates and prove well-posedness results.

It is shown in a new, quantitative way that all limit points of these empirical distributions have the same distance from the uniform distribution and form a continuum homeomorphic to a circle. Sharp rates of convergence to that circle are identified for several classes of examples. The results strengthen and complement known facts in the literature.

Our estimates allow us to deal with globally defined narrow regions with possibly non-trivial topology. We also prove the sharpness of our estimates in terms of the distance between the perfect conductors. The precise optimality statement we give is new even in the setting of Bao-Li-Yin.},

We pose several questions that still remain open, particularly regarding the range of wave speeds and the number of solutions.

Assuming a topologically mixing condition and the uniqueness of equilibrium state for the associated skew product map, we establish a samplewise (quenched) almost-sure level-2 weighted equidistribution of ‘random cycles’, with respect to a natural stationary measure as the periods of the cycles tend to infinity. This result implies an analogue of Bowen&#39;s theorem on periodic orbits of topologically mixing Axiom A diffeomorphisms . We also prove another almost-sure convergence theorem, as well as an averaged (annealed) theorem that is related to semigroup actions. We apply our results to the random β -expansion of real numbers, and obtain almost-sure convergences of average digital quantities in random β -expansions of random cycles that do not follow from the application of the ergodic theorems of Birkhoff or Kakutani. Our main results are applicable to random dynamical systems generated by finitely many maps with common neutral fixed points.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide a similar environment for operator-valued stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In our approach, we use a modified version of Kurzweil&#39;s original definition of his integral by replacing full divisions by belated partial divisions. This allows us to extend the Itô-Henstock integral to include a larger class of SDEs, which can contain highly oscillatory (operator-valued) functions of unbounded variation. We provide a detailed discussion of a few examples which highlight our main results.},

As an application, the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality between the quermassintegrals A 0 A0 and A n − 1 An−1 is established in view of their opposite monotonicity along the considered flow.

This allows us to prove that the pseudogroup of these transformations has exactly two connected components. That is, the heat equation admits a single independent discrete symmetry, which can be chosen to be alternating the sign of the dependent variable. We introduce the notion of pseudo-discrete elements of a Lie group and show that alternating the sign of the space variable, which was for a long time misinterpreted as a discrete symmetry of the heat equation, is in fact a pseudo-discrete element of its essential point symmetry group . The classification of subalgebras of the essential Lie invariance algebra of the heat equation is enhanced and the description of generalized symmetries of this equation is refined as well. We also consider the Burgers equation because of its relation to the heat equation and prove that it admits no discrete point symmetries. The developed approach to point-symmetry groups whose elements have components that are linear fractional in some variables can directly be extended to many other linear and nonlinear differential equations.},

For this class of problems classical optimal controls may fail to exist, or to be relevant in practice, and dynamic programming is not easily applicable. Therefore, the notion of optimality is defined through a game-theoretic framework by means of subgame-perfect equilibrium: we interpret our preference changes which, realistically, are inconsistent over time, as players in a game for which we want to find a Nash equilibrium . The approach followed in our work relies on the stochastic (Pontryagin) maximum principle: we adapt the classical spike variation technique to obtain a characterization of equilibrium strategies in terms of a generalized second-order Hamiltonian function defined through pairs of backward stochastic differential equations , even in the multidimensional case. The theoretical results are applied in the financial field to finite horizon investment-consumption policies with non-exponential actualization. Here the existence of non-trivial equilibrium policies is also ascertained.},

Based in the work by Hure, Pham and Warin [25] concerning the finite dimensional case, and our previous work [9] dealing with Lévy based processes, we generalize an Euler scheme and consistency results for the Forward Backward Stochastic Differential Equations to the infinite dimensional Hilbert valued case. Since our framework is general, we require the recently developed DeepOnets neural networks [10] , [29] to describe in detail the approximation procedure. Also, the framework developed by Fuhrman and Tessitore [17] to fully describe the stochastic approximations will be adapted to our setting.},

We first prove a convexity result for the metric derived from the operator norm on the full unitary group. We also prove strong convexity results for the squared metrics in Hilbert-Schmidt unitary groups and unitary groups of finite von Neumann algebras . In both cases the tangent spaces are endowed with an inner product defined with a trace.

We analyze the canard phenomena (relaxation oscillation and canard cycles) of our proposed model by applying the singular perturbation theory. Firstly, we apply the blow-up techniques and visualize the behavior near the special fold point, which allows us to prove the existence of the unique attractive limit cycle and imply the appearance of the canard phenomenon when crossing the fold point, and the numerical simulations verify the theoretical results. Then we further use the singular perturbation theory to investigate the existence and cyclicity of the canard cycle without head and the existence of the canard cycle with head. Our main results of the complex canard phenomenon reveal the fact that some certain species in the ecosystem suddenly burst back many years after being about extinct.},

The seasonally forced intrinsic incubation period is the period of time that pathogens spend in completing their development in the host, which extends the concept of the fixed latency period by introducing the seasonal impacts of the environment. We derive the basic reproduction number ℜ 0 ℜ0 and investigate the threshold dynamics for exploring whether the model retains the core properties that are highly desirable in epidemic models, that is, the spread of cholera can be characterized by ℜ 0 ℜ0 .

  abstract     = {We consider a stochastic differential game in the context of forward-backward stochastic differential equations , where one player implements an impulse control while the opponent controls the system continuously. Utilizing the notion of “backward semigroups” we first prove the dynamic programming principle (DPP) for a truncated version of the problem in a straightforward manner. Relying on a uniform convergence argument then enables us to show the DPP for the general setting. Our approach avoids technical constraints imposed in previous works dealing with the same problem and, more importantly, allows us to consider impulse costs that depend on the present value of the state process in addition to unbounded coefficients. Using the dynamic programming principle we deduce that the upper and lower value functions are both solutions (in viscosity sense) to the same Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs obstacle problem . By showing uniqueness of solutions to this partial differential inequality we conclude that the game has a value.},

  abstract     = {Based on the Baker-Akhiezer functions on Riemann surfaces , a general method is proposed to construct rogue-wave solutions and breather solutions of integrable nonlinear evolution equations associated with higher-order matrix spectral problems on theta-function periodic backgrounds. The derivative Yajima-Oikawa long wave-short wave equation associated with a 3 × 3 3×3 matrix Lax pair is chosen as an illustrative example of our method. First, a theta-function seed solution for the derivative Yajima-Oikawa long wave-short wave equation is derived by using the Weierstrass functions . Then, the general solution of the 3 × 3 3×3 matrix spectral problem and its derivatives with respect to the spectral parameter are obtained with the help of the Baker-Akhiezer functions. Finally, by means of Darboux transformations, explicit exact solutions such as rogue waves and breathers on theta-function backgrounds for the derivative Yajima-Oikawa long wave-short wave equation are constructed. Taking the advantage of the Jacobi θ -functions, these new solutions are numerically calculated and illustrated. In addition, by observing the explicit solutions, it is found that two rogue waves of different shapes may appear in one solution, which is a new phenomenon different from the solutions on constant backgrounds.},

Additionally, we show that the logarithmic differential operator is also Hecke equivariant under the multiplicative Hecke operator and the Hecke operator on integral weight meromorphic modular forms. As applications of Hecke equivariance of the two operators, we obtain relations for twisted traces of singular moduli modulo prime powers and congruences for twisted class numbers modulo primes, including those associated to genus 1 modular curves.},

First, we show the convergence of solutions of the Cattaneo equation to the ones of the heat equation. Assuming the same right-hand side and compatible initial conditions for the equations, we prove a linear convergence rate. Moreover, we show linear convergence of the optimal states and optimal controls for the Cattaneo equation towards the ones for the heat equation.

The parameter α controls the interpolation between these two cases, while γ further parametrises the type of distribution from which the underlying random variables are drawn. It is known that in the normed limit, for α = 0 α=0 the Fréchet density arises, whereas for α = 1 α=1 the limit is a stable random variable which has the well-known identification with a particular Fox H-function. It is known [21] that for intermediate α an entirely new distribution function appears, which is not one of the extensions to the hypergeometric function considered to date.

We also present the local decay estimates using the extrapolation techniques, and the mixed weak type estimates corresponding to Sawyer&#39;s conjecture by means of a Coifman-Fefferman inequality. Beyond that, we consider other weak type estimates including the restricted weak-type ( p , p ) (p,p) for S α , L Sα,L and the endpoint estimate for commutators of S α , L Sα,L .

Due to discontinuities of the material parameters, the solution of the Maxwell equations is less than H 2 H2 -regular in space. For the ADI scheme, we prove a rigorous time-discrete error bound with a convergence rate that is half an order lower than the classical one. Our statement imposes only assumptions on the initial data and the material parameters, but not on the solution. To establish this result, we analyze the regularity of the Maxwell equations in detail in an appropriate functional analytical framework. The theoretical findings are complemented by a numerical experiment indicating that the proven convergence rate is indeed observable and optimal.},

Main results consist of well-posedness in a strong formulation, qualitative properties of strong solutions (i.e., comparison principle and the three properties mentioned above) and long-time dynamics of strong solutions (more precisely, convergence to an equilibrium). The well-posedness will be proved based on a minimizing movement scheme without parabolic regularization, which will also play a crucial role for proving qualitative and asymptotic properties of strong solutions. Moreover, the variational inequality under consideration will be characterized as a singular limit of some (generalized) gradient flows .},

Special attention is paid to the modeling of the time delays to incorporate associated nonlocal spatial terms which account for the drift of individuals to their present position from their possible positions at previous times. We first discuss the stability of the positive equilibrium of system without diffusion and give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of positive equilibrium of diffusion system. Then we investigate Turing instability and deduce the amplitude equation of Turing patterns by using multiple scale method. The numerical simulations show the spots pattern and stripes pattern and verify the results of theoretical analysis. Our research reveals that nonlocal time delay plays an important role in the formation of pattern.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we examine the global existence of classical solutions for the gas flows near vacuum through ducts expanding with space and time. It is described by the initial-boundary value problem of compressible Euler equations together with a sufficiently small variable parameter, which can be viewed as a hyperbolic system of balance laws whose source is a non-dissipative term when Riemann invariants are applied. We prove a couple of global existence theorems of classical solutions under the suitable conditions of expanding ducts and the initial-boundary data whose C 0 C0 norms can be large. The analysis depends primarily on the local existence theorem and on uniform a priori estimates , which are obtained by giving the maximum principle and introducing new generalized Lax transformations. Furthermore, the limit behavior of expanding ducts at infinity and the long-time behavior of global classical solutions along all characteristic curves and vertical lines are also determined. Lastly, we explore the feasibility of the initial value problem for such expanding ducts.},

  abstract     = {This first article in a two-part series (the second article being [ arXiv:2205.13197 ]) assumes a weak form of the integrated local energy decay estimate and proves that solutions to the linear wave equation with variable coefficients in R 1 + 3 R1+3 , first-order terms, and a potential decay at a rate depending on how rapidly the vector fields of these functions decay at spatial infinity. Roughly speaking, given metric perturbation terms and first-order terms whose vector fields decay at least as rapidly as the rate r − 1 − a r−1−a , and potentials whose vector fields decay at least as rapidly as the rate r − 2 − a r−2−a , our results imply that | Z J ϕ ( t , x ) | ≤ C t − 2 − a |ZJϕ(t,x)|≤Ct−2−a for bounded | x | |x| , where Z denotes vector fields and J is a multi-index. We expect that this is a sharp decay rate. We prove results for both stationary and nonstationary metrics and coefficients. The proof uses integrated local energy decay to achieve an initial decay rate, and then uses an iteration involving the one-dimensional reduction (due to the positivity of the fundamental solution of the wave equation in three spatial dimensions) to achieve the full decay rate. For second-order perturbations of the Minkowski metric with coefficients that are not necessarily spherically symmetric, we analyze these coefficients&#39; decay rates in a novel way to obtain a higher rate of pointwise decay for the solution than might be expected, assuming only weak pointwise decay on up to two time derivatives of the coefficients (and vector fields thereof); the latter weak decay is satisfied if, for example, the metric is stationary.},

This system was proposed in [4] for modelling the probabilistic evolution of chemical reaction kinetics associated with spatial diffusion of individual particles. Using some basic tools and ideas from infinite dimensional Gaussian analysis we are able to reformulate the aforementioned infinite system of Fokker-Planck equations as a single evolution equation solved by a generalized stochastic process and written in terms of Malliavin derivatives and differential second quantization operators. Via this alternative representation we link certain finite dimensional projections of the solution of the original problem to the solution of a single partial differential equations of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type containing as many variables as the dimension of the aforementioned projection space.},

  abstract     = {In 1967, Kadison raised the following question, if a self-adjoint operator algebra on a Hilbert space is finitely generated (algebraically) and each self-adjoint operator in it has finite spectrum, is it finite dimensional? In 2021, M. Mori connected the Kadison&#39;s question to von Neumann&#39;s concept of regular rings given in 1930&#39;s, and introduced a notion of ⁎ R ⁎ R⁎ -algebras. In this paper, we study ⁎ R ⁎ R⁎ -algebras, the Kadison&#39;s question, and a related question of uniqueness of ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -norm on pre- ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebras. Precisely, we study atomic ⁎ R ⁎ R⁎ -algebras, and find a maximal ultramatricial ⁎ R ⁎ R⁎ -subalgebra of an atomic ⁎ R ⁎ R⁎ -algebra, which properly contains the maximal purely atomic ⁎ R ⁎ R⁎ -subalgebra generated by all finite projections of the algebra. We prove that the set of all ⁎-algebras for which the Kadison&#39;s question has an affirmative answer is closed under direct sum, tensor product, and crossed product, but it is not closed under free product. From the aforementioned stable properties of the algebra in the Kadison&#39;s question, we find plentiful examples of ⁎-algebras for which the Kadison&#39;s question has an affirmative answer, for instance, the crossed product ⁎-algebra B ⋊ α G B⋊αG , where G is a locally finite group and B B is one of the following algebras: an algebra of finite rank operators , an abelian algebra, a finite dimensional algebra, a twisted group algebra satisfying a certain condition, a rotation algebra, or a group measure space construction algebra. We characterize uniqueness of ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -norm on a pre- ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebras in terms of its ⁎-representations, weak containment of its ⁎-representations, ideals of its enveloping ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebra, or the primitive ideal space of the ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebra. We also prove that a unital pre- ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebra has a unique ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -norm if and only if, for a faithful ⁎-representation of the algebra, invertibility of a self-adjoint element of the algebra, as an operator on the representation Hilbert space , is independent of the choice of the ⁎-representation. These characterizations provide answers to the question raised by M. Mori in 2021 on finding a sufficient and necessary condition for a ⁎-algebra to have a unique ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -norm. For discrete groups, we give a characterization for a group algebra to have a unique ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -norm in terms of the group&#39;s unitary representations, providing an answer to the question raised by Alekseev in 2019 on characterizing ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -unique discrete groups.},

In particular, we consider a nonlinear eigenvalue problem similar to the standard Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for the p -Laplacian, but due to the presence of the curl, we see that eigenfunctions of the general p -div-curl operator do not enjoy nice regularity as in the p -Laplacian case. We first show that weak solutions of a particular nonlinear p -div-curl eigenvalue problem split into a good and bad part, where the good part is not even divergence free. We then show that the general p -div-curl system admits a Ljusternik-Schnirelman sequence of eigenvalues. Finally, we show a general chain rule for the curl and divergence.},

We study the coexistence of crossing limit cycles and sliding limit cycles by establishing Poincaré maps for two subsystems that have the same Jacobi matrix . Using expressions and properties of Poincaré maps, we can clarify the relationship between trajectories of two subsystems. Our main results reveal that (1) the numbers of crossing limit cycles and sliding limit cycles can be 2; (2) the coexistence number of limit cycles can be 3. Moreover, by a complete discussion of classification and analysis, we show saddle-node bifurcation and critical crossing cycle bifurcation existing in generic Filippov systems. Finally, four numerical examples are given to verify the correctness of the obtained theoretical results.},

In the first part we consider McKean-Vlasov Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), obtained as thermodynamic limits of interacting particle systems (i.e. in the limit N → ∞ N→∞ , where N is the number of particles). It is well-known that, even when the particle system has a unique invariant measure (stationary solution), the limiting PDE very often displays a phase transition: for certain choices of (coefficients and) parameter values, the PDE has a unique stationary solution , but as the value of the parameter varies multiple stationary states appear. In the first part of this paper, we add to this stream of literature and consider a specific instance of a McKean-Vlasov type equation, namely the Kuramoto model on the torus perturbed by a symmetric double-well potential, and show that this PDE undergoes the type of phase transition just described, as the diffusion coefficient is varied. In the second part of the paper, we consider a rather general class of McKean-Vlasov PDEs on the torus (which includes both the original Kuramoto model and the Kuramoto model in double well potential of part one) perturbed by (strong enough) infinite-dimensional additive noise . To the best of our knowledge, the resulting Stochastic PDE , which we refer to as the Stochastic McKean-Vlasov equation , has not been studied before, so we first study its well-posedness. We then show that the addition of noise to the PDE has the effect of restoring uniqueness of the stationary state in the sense that, irrespective of the choice of coefficients and parameter values in the McKean-Vlasov PDE, the Stochastic McKean-Vlasov PDE always admits at most one invariant measure.},

To explore how these two strains developed in this competitive spread, a new compartmentalized model was established. First, we analyzed the fundamental properties of the model, obtained the expression of the basic reproduction number , proved the local and global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Then by means of the cubic spline interpolation method, we obtained the data of new Omicron and Delta cases in the United States of new cases starting from December 8, 2021, to February 12, 2022. Using the weighted nonlinear least squares estimation method, we fitted six time series (cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative deaths, new cases, new deaths, new Omicron cases, and new Delta cases), got estimates of the unknown parameters, and obtained an approximation of the basic reproduction number in the United States during this time period as R 0 ≈ 1.5165 . Finally, each control strategy was evaluated by cost-effectiveness analysis to obtain the optimal control strategy under different perspectives. The results not only show the competitive transmission characteristics of the new strain and existing strain, but also provide scientific suggestions for effectively controlling the spread of these strains.},

We combine this process with smoothness results and techniques to solve two open problems posed in the recently published monograph [7] by A. J. Guirao, V. Montesinos and V. Zizler. Specifically, on the one hand we construct in every separable Banach space admitting a C k Ck -smooth norm an equivalent norm which is C k Ck -smooth but fails to be uniformly Gâteaux in any direction; and on the other hand we produce in c 0 ( Γ ) c0(Γ) for any infinite Γ a C ∞ C∞ -smooth norm whose ball is dentable but whose sphere lacks any extreme points.},

To this end, we first introduce an artificial stability term to build a modified Crank-Nicolson FD (MCNFD) scheme, and then prove that the MCNFD scheme satisfies the intrinsic maximum principle of the phase-field model. Secondly, we discuss that the MCNFD scheme satisfies the intrinsic energy stability of the phase-field model, and obtain the optimal error estimation of the MCNFD solution based on the conclusion of the discrete maximum principle. Finally, two numerical examples of one-dimensional and two-dimensional phase-field models are given to verify that the solution of the MCNFD scheme satisfies the above theoretical results.},

The corresponding reaction system has two locally asymptotically stable steady states and two unstable steady states . Using the abstract theory established for monotone semiflows, we obtain the existence of monotone bistable traveling wave solutions . The uniqueness of wave speed is confirmed by constructing appropriate upper and lower solutions. When the initial value satisfies proper conditions, it is proved that the wave speed is the expansion speed of two functions defined by the corresponding Cauchy problem, which implies that the sign of wave speed determines the relative competitiveness in population dynamics. Numerically, it seems that the species with stronger degeneracy may have stronger competitiveness under bistable assumption and other proper conditions.},

We prove that the Lipschitz-free space F ( M U ) F(MU) is finitely representable in F ( M ) F(M) . We also characterize the metric spaces that are finitely Lipschitz representable in a Banach space as those that biLipschitz embed into an ultrapower of the Banach space. Thanks to this link, we obtain that if M is finitely Lipschitz representable in a Banach space X , then F ( M ) F(M) is finitely representable in F ( X ) F(X) .

  abstract     = {In this paper we investigate the massive Sine-Gordon model in the ultraviolet finite regime in thermal states over the two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime . We combine recently developed methods of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory with techniques developed in the realm of constructive quantum field theory over Euclidean spacetimes to construct the correlation functions of the equilibrium state of the Sine-Gordon theory in the adiabatic limit. First of all, the observables of the Sine-Gordon theory are seen as functionals over the free configurations and are obtained as a suitable combination of the S −matrices of the interaction Lagrangian restricted to compact spacetime regions over the free massive theory. These S −matrices are given as power series in the coupling constant with values in the algebra of fields over the free massive theory. Adapting techniques like conditioning and inverse conditioning to spacetimes with Lorentzian signature, we prove that these power series converge when evaluated on a generic field configuration. The latter observation implies convergence in the strong operator topology in the GNS representations of the considered states. In the second part of the paper, adapting the cluster expansion technique to the Lorentzian case, we prove that the correlation functions of the interacting equilibrium state at finite temperature (KMS state) can be constructed also in the adiabatic limit, where the interaction Lagrangian is supported everywhere in space.},

Upon utilizing the bilinear method, we derive solitons, breathers and rational solutions to the lattice equation both on the constant and periodic background. These solutions are given in terms of determinants whose matrix elements have simple algebraic expressions. In particular, we find three types of breather solutions, including Kuznetsov-Ma breather, Akhmediev breather and general one. By introducing two differential operators applied to the soliton solutions , we obtain rational solutions in terms of Schur polynomials. We demonstrate that rational solutions can exhibit algebraic solitons and lump solitons. We explore the asymptotic analysis to the algebraic solitons and find asymptotic algebraic solitons localized in the straight. By taking higher-order differential operators , we present multiple and higher-order rational solutions. The dynamical behaviors of these obtained solutions are illustrated and analyzed.},

Then we discuss the local and global stability of the equilibrium point by means of analyzing the characteristic equation of linearized system and Lyapunov functional. In the heterogeneous model, based on the analysis of the existence of the rumor-spreading equilibrium points, we derive the basic reproduction numbers R 0 2 R02 . Besides, by utilizing the linearized system and LaSalle&#39;s invariance principle , the stability of the rumor-free equilibrium point was proved. What&#39;s more, the system exhibits bifurcation behavior at R 0 2 = 1 R02=1 by choosing a system parameter as the bifurcation parameter. Additionally, optimal control problems in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks with three control measures are discussed.

Several operator theorists have studied the one-step backward extension of generalized Bergman weighted shifts such as Agler shifts, Bergman-like shifts, and Bergman-type weighted shifts to detect gap for these two bridges. Obviously the class of homographic shifts S ( a , b , c , d ) S(a,b,c,d) contains these all generalized Bergman weighted shifts above. In this paper we obtain some equivalent conditions for the n -hyponormality and n -contractivity of the one-step backward extension of S ( a , b , c , d ) S(a,b,c,d) , which may induce the known results about Agler shifts, Bergman-like shifts, and Catalan-like weighted shifts etc.},

We prove in this paper that if X is assumed to be uniformly convex and uniformly smooth then the set of bounded linear operators attaining their numerical radius is not only a dense subset but also the complement of a σ -porous subset. In fact, we generalize the notion of numerical radius to a large class Z Z of vector-valued operators defined from ⁎ X × X ⁎ X×X⁎ into a Banach space W and we prove that the set of all elements of Z Z strongly (up to a symmetry) attaining their numerical radius is the complement of a σ -porous subset of Z Z and moreover the “numerical radius” Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property is also satisfied for this class. Our results extend (up to the assumption on X ) some known results in several directions: (1) the density is replaced by being the complement of a σ -porous subset, (2) the operators attaining their numerical radius are replaced by operators strongly (up to a symmetry) attaining their numerical radius and (3) the results are obtained in the vector-valued framework for general linear and non-linear vector-valued operators (including bilinear mappings and the classical space of bounded linear operators).},

For K ( u 0 ) &gt; K ( Q d , α ) K(u0)&amp;gt;K(Qd,α) , the solution blows up in finite time. For K ( u 0 ) K(u0)&amp;lt;K(Qd,α) , the solution is global and scatters to a linear solution in energy space if u 0 , u 1 u0,u1 are radial functions . To show the scattering, we use the concentration-compactness argument of Kenig-Merle [15] and the Morawetz-virial type estimate obtained in [7] .},

  abstract     = {There is an increasing worldwide concern on the several diseases transmitted by vectors like Dengue, Zika, or Chikungunya. Thus, in recent years studies about the calculation of summary measurements such as the final size of the epidemic have acquired importance. In particular, this quantity allows estimating the impact that the disease has on the affected population. However, advances in calculating analytical expressions to estimate this measure in the case of infectious transmitted by vectors have been scarce. Most of the applicability of this quantity has been limited to the classic epidemiological model of Kermack McKendrick. This article proposes a methodology to estimate the final size of a vector-borne epidemic. The methodology can be generalized to meta-population models and thus be applied to extended geographical regions. The methodology for a vector-borne disease is presented, and then the case of two distinct geographic regions connected by human mobility is shown. Numerical simulations were carried out to compare with the precision of the analytical approximation. It was observed that the proposed methodology provides a good estimate for the two analyzed cases.},

  abstract     = {On the space of continuous functions , we consider a multivalued superposition operator, a Nemytskii operator valued in the space of p -integrable functions with 1 ≤ p 1≤p&amp;lt;∞ . The Nemytskii operator is generated by a multivalued mapping defined on the direct product of a segment of the real line and a separable reflexive Banach space and having closed values in this space. At each point of the phase variable, the mapping either has a closed graph and is convex-valued or it is lower semicontinuous in some neighborhood of this point. In recent years, such mappings are called mappings with mixed semicontinuity properties. We prove that the restriction of the Nemytskii operator onto any compact subset of the space of continuous functions with the sup-norm has a multivalued selector with convex closed values that is upper semicontinuous in the weak topology of the space of p -integrable functions. This result generalizes some well-known results of the author valid in the case when the multivalued mapping generating the Nemytskii operator has compact values. A multivalued selector theorem is used to study an evolution inclusion in a separable Hilbert space with a time-dependent maximal monotone operator and a composite perturbation that is the sum of two multivalued mappings. The values of the first multivalued mapping are closed, bounded, not necessarily convex sets . The second multivalued mapping has closed values and possesses mixed semicontinuity properties. The existence of an absolutely continuous solution is proved. The proof is based on the theorem on an upper semicontinuous convex-valued selector and the author&#39;s theorem on selectors continuous in parameter and passing through fixed points of a parameter-dependent multivalued mapping with closed, nonconvex, decomposable values in the space of p -integrable functions as well as on the classical Ky Fan&#39;s fixed point theorem . Our approach is fairly simple, concise and clear as compared to other known approaches based on discretization .},

In particular, we obtain that the typical nonexpansive mapping in this setting has a unique fixed point which can be reached by iterating the mapping. Nevertheless, it turns out that the typical mapping is not a Rakotch contraction on the whole space and that it has the maximal possible Lipschitz constant of one on a residual subset of its domain. By typical we mean that the complement of the set of mappings with this property is σ - ϕ -porous, that is, small in a metric sense.

Over the past few years, fractional boundary value problems (FBVP) in real variables have been extensively studied but there are few attempts on these types of problems in complex variables. In this study, the existence and uniqueness for the solutions of fractional differential equation (FDE) in complex domain with boundary conditions is examined. We established the existence of solutions using the Krasnoselskii fixed point theorem ; however, the uniqueness result is proved by applying the Banach contraction principle. To explain our findings, an illustrative example is presented. The special cases of the derived findings are equivalent to the theorems that already exist.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to study the extension of a bijective ε -isometry and the existence of the Figiel operator of an isometric embedding between two unit spheres of Banach spaces . In the first part, we introduce and study the quasi-Figiel problem about a quasi-isometric embedding between unit spheres of two Banach spaces . Consequently, a quasi-anti-Lipschitz type inequality is obtained when the domain space is l ∞ n l∞n . Based on this quasi-anti-Lipschitz type inequality, the corresponding quasi-anti-Lipschitz type inequality is also obtained for an ε -isometric embedding defined on the unit sphere of an L ∞ , 1 + L∞,1+ space, i.e., a Banach space whose finite-dimensional subspaces can be any close to the finite-dimensional subspaces of l ∞ l∞ in the sense of the Banach-Mazur distance. As an application of the quasi-anti-Lipschitz type inequality, we show that every bijective ε -isometry between the unit spheres of an L ∞ , 1 + L∞,1+ space and another Banach space can be extended to a bijective 5 ε -isometry between their corresponding unit balls. In particular, this implies that every L ∞ , 1 + L∞,1+ space admits the Mazur-Ulam property. Furthermore, in this paper, some attempts are also made to generalize the classical Figiel&#39;s theorem to the local case with respect to an isometric embedding between unit spheres.},

Secondly, we propose the pseudopotential of the DcmKdV equation, from which a Darboux-Bäcklund transformation is established. Thirdly, starting from vanishing and plane wave backgrounds, a variety of nonlinear wave solutions, including bell-shaped one-soliton, three types of breathers, W-shaped soliton, periodic solution and rogue wave are given, the relationship between parameters and solutions&#39; structures is discussed and analyzed in detail. Finally, the integrable properties of the DcmKdV equation, including the Lax pair , Darboux-Bäcklund transformation and solutions, are shown for their continuous counterparts of the cmKdV equation. The method and technique used in this paper can also be extended to other nonlinear integrable equations. The results in this paper might be helpful for understanding some physical phenomena in electromagnetic waves and nonlinear optics.},

More precisely, it is shown that, for initial data in a Sobolev space , the difference of the nonlinear and linear evolutions lies in a smoother space. The smoothing gain we obtain depends very much on the arithmetic nature of the coupling parameter a which determines the structure of the resonant sets in the estimates. In the second part, we address the forced and damped Hirota-Satsuma system and obtain counterpart smoothing estimates. As a consequence of these estimates, we prove the existence and smoothness of a global attractor in the energy space.},

We then apply our results to study series of delta functions and the division problem for tempered distributions.},

Using an original integral identity for compact free boundary minimal hypersurfaces that are immersed in a domain whose boundary is a regular level set, we study the case where this domain is a quadric or, more generally, a rotational domain. This existence study is done without topological restrictions. We also obtain a new gap theorem for free boundary hypersurfaces immersed in an Euclidean ball and in a rotational ellipsoid.},

Recently, Brezis, Van Schaftingen and Yung provided a different approach by replacing the strong L p Lp norm in the Gagliardo s -seminorm by the weak L p Lp quasinorm. They characterized the case for s = 1 s=1 that complements the BBM formula. The corresponding MS formula for s = 0 s=0 was later established by Yung and the first author.

It is worth noting that the gas will diffuse to infinity, that is, there is no vacuum boundary in this work. The essence of this problem is the interaction of the centered simple wave with the planar rarefaction wave, which can be solved by the Goursat problem for the two-dimensional self-similar Euler equations . Through the methods of characteristic decompositions and invariant regions, we establish a priori C 1 C1 estimates and the hyperbolicity of the solution in the wave interaction domain.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a precision preserving Crank–Nicolson (CN) mixed finite element (MFE) lowering dimension (PPCNMFELD) method for the unsteady nonlinear conduction-convection problem is developed by using proper orthogonal decomposition. The PPCNMFELD method only lowers the dimension of unknown coefficient vectors of MFE solutions for the classical CN MFE (CCNMFE) format but keeps the MFE basis functions unvaried. Under this circumstance, the PPCNMFELD method possesses the same basis functions and the same precision as the CCNMFE method but has fewer unknowns. Thus, the PPCNMFELD method can greatly reduce CPU runtime, slow the accumulation of computing errors in the numerical calculating process, and improve real-time calculation precision. In particular, the existence and stability together with convergence for the PPCNMFELD solutions are proved using a matrix method, which leads to a fine theory and analysis. Additionally, the superiority of the PPCNMFELD method is verified by the numerical experiments for flow around an aerofoil. The PPCNMFELD method possesses time second-order precision and unconditional stability, which are distinct from the other existing reduced-order FE and MFE methods .},

In contrast to most existing multiplicity results in the literature, we do not need the restriction p &gt; 3 p&amp;gt;3 . For the case N ≥ 4 N≥4 , we use a scaling technique to prove that the energy on the set of solutions to ( K ) (K) is bounded.

By using the chaotic mapping theory and the method of characteristic, we prove the onset of chaos in the sense of exponential growth of total variation of the 2D wave equation. Moreover, We also prove that the system has not the chaotic oscillations when the parameters enter certain ranges. Numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

Existing decomposition methods impose constraints on the behavior of vector fields at infinity and require solving convolution integrals over the entire coordinate space. To allow a Helmholtz decomposition in R n Rn , we replace the vector potential in R 3 R3 by the rotation potential, an n-dimensional, antisymmetric matrix-valued map describing n ( n − 1 ) / 2 n(n−1)/2 rotations within the coordinate planes . We provide three methods to derive the Helmholtz decomposition: (1) a numerical method for fields decaying at infinity by using an n -dimensional convolution integral, (2) closed-form solutions using line-integrals for several unboundedly growing fields including periodic and exponential functions, multivariate polynomials and their linear combinations , (3) an existence proof for all analytic vector fields. Examples include the Lorenz and Rössler attractor and the competitive Lotka–Volterra equations with n species.},

More precisely, for the type III system, we show that the decay property is not of regularity-loss type in both the subcritical and critical cases. The result matches with the system in a bounded domain , where the system is known to be exponentially stable in the subcritical case. For the Gurtin-Pipkin thermal law system, there is a regularity-loss phenomenon in the critical case. We also study the asymptotic expansion of the eigenvalues to prove the optimality of the obtained decay rates for both models.},

In particular, it is assumed that the spread rate of predators can change depending on the satisfaction of predators according to the amount of available prey in the vicinity of predators in the habitat. First, how prey-dependent dispersal sensitively affects the migration mechanism of predators is examined. More precisely, it is shown that predators via such prey-dependent diffusion can invade a habitat region by investigating stability analysis of the semitrivial solution of the system where the predator is absent. Additionally, the existence and uniqueness of a positive steady state are studied using the fixed point index theory in a positive cone in a Banach space . The coexistence state is found to be unique if the diffusion rate of the prey is above a certain threshold and the average of the resource function of the prey is within a specific range represented through the equilibrium value of the prey.},

In the second model, M and H satisfy the Langevin magnetization law M = M s L ( b 1 | H | ) | H | 1 Ω f H M=MsL(b1|H|)|H|1ΩfH , where L is the Langevin function given by L ( x ) = 1 tanh ⁡ x − 1 x L(x)=1tanh⁡x−1x , M s Ms is the saturation magnetization and b 1 b1 is a positive physical constant. The velocity and the pressure satisfy the Stokes equation with a Kelvin magnetic force. We perform the homogenization of the equations of each of the two models. Using the two-scale convergence method, we rigorously derive the homogenized equation for the magnetic potential and determine the asymptotic limit of the magnetization. Then we rigorously derive a Darcy law.},

Analyzing the qualitative properties of singular points on switching line and in whole Poincaré disc as well as all kinds of closed loops, we obtain the global bifurcation diagram and all corresponding global phase portraits. From our result, in the case of small parameters we find the heteroclinic bifurcation in this system, which does not appear in previous publications. Moreover, in the case of general parameters we find some new bifurcations in this system not appearing for small parameters such as double tangency bifurcation, pseudo-saddle-node bifurcation and some new bifurcation phenomena of boundary node and boundary saddle.},

Then all steady states are considered, and the conditions under which they are stable are analyzed in light of the model parameters. For the non-delayed model, local/global stability and bifurcations are studied at constant steady states. For the delayed model, we use the delay as the bifurcation parameter to study the Hopf bifurcation and Turing-Hopf bifurcation. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to validate our theoretical findings. It demonstrates that the system exhibits a variety of spatiotemporal patterns as a result of spatial memory delay and nonlocal fear effect delay.},

However, regarding beta-type operators, the preservation of log concavity does not hold based on such a probabilistic method used in Badía and Sangüesa [10] . In this study, we explore the preservation of log concavity for the beta operator using alternative probabilistic tools.

We present their principal structural characterizations, their composition principles and invariance under convolution products. After that, we provide several applications of our abstract theoretical results to partial differential equations and to the abstract integral equations in Banach spaces.},

We obtain analogues of the Rota&#39;s model theorem for operators with spectral radius less than one, the refinement obtained by Foiaş and by de Branges and Rovnyak for similarity to strongly stable contractions, and the Sz.-Nagy characterization of operators similar to isometries (or unitary operators). The results are new even in the particular case when k = 1 k=1 for certain classes of admissible noncommutative domains which were recently introduced. Joint similarity problems to tuples of operators in noncommutative varieties in admissible polydomains are also discussed. This includes, in particular, the commutative setting.},

In order to establish theoretical results, it is often beneficial to regularize the nonsmooth functions in an intermediate step. In this work, we investigate the properties of a generalization of the Moreau–Yosida regularization on a normed space where we replace the quadratic kernel in the infimal convolution with a more general function. More precisely, for a function f:X→(−∞,+∞] defined on a normed space (X,‖⋅‖) and given parameters p&amp;gt;1 and ε&amp;gt;0 , we investigate the properties of the generalized Moreau–Yosida regularization given by fε(u)=infv∈X⁡{1pε‖u−v‖p+f(v)},u∈X. We show that the generalized Moreau–Yosida regularization satisfies the same properties as in the classical case for p=2 , provided that X is not a Hilbert space. We further establish a convergence result in the sense of Mosco -convergence as the regularization parameter ε tends to zero.},

  abstract     = {We study the interior and exterior moduli of polygonal quadrilaterals. The main result is a formula for a conformal mapping of the upper half plane onto the exterior of a convex polygonal quadrilateral. We prove this by a careful analysis of the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation and obtain the so-called accessory parameters and then the result in terms of the Lauricella hypergeometric function . This result enables us to understand the dissimilarities of the exterior and interior of a convex polygonal quadrilateral. We also give a Mathematica algorithm for the computation. Then we study the special case of an isosceles trapezoidal polygon L and obtain two-sided estimates for the coefficient of quasiconformal reflection over L in terms of special functions and geometric parameters of L .},

(i) We establish two abstract criteria on the upper semicontinuity and the residual continuity of the pullback D D -attractor with respect to the perturbations, and an equivalence criterion between their continuity and the pullback equi-attraction, which generalize the continuity theory of attractors developed recently in [27] , [28] to that in time-dependent spaces. (ii) We propose the notion of pullback D D -exponential attractor, which includes the notion of time-dependent exponential attractor [33] as its spacial case, and establish its existence and Hölder continuity criterion via quasi-stability method introduced originally by Chueshov and Lasiecka [12] , [13] . (iii) We apply above-mentioned criteria to the semilinear damped wave equations with perturbed time-dependent speed of propagation: ϵ ρ ( t ) u t t + α u t − Δ u + f ( u ) = g ϵρ(t)utt+αut−Δu+f(u)=g , with perturbation parameter ϵ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] ϵ∈(0,1] , to realize above mentioned continuity of pullback D D and D D -exponential attractors in time-dependent phase spaces, and the method developed here allows to overcome the difficulty of the hyperbolicity of the model. These results deepen and extend recent theory of attractors in time-dependent spaces in literatures [15] , [20] , [29] .},

We derive universal lower and upper bounds on the polarization of spherical designs of fixed dimension, strength, and cardinality. The bounds are universal in the sense that they are a convex combination of potential function evaluations with nodes and weights independent of the class of potentials. As a consequence of our lower bounds, we obtain the Fazekas-Levenshtein bounds on the covering radius of spherical designs. Utilizing the existence of spherical designs, our polarization bounds are extended to general configurations. As examples we completely solve the min-max polarization problem for 120 points on S 3 S3 and show that the 600-cell is universally optimal for that problem. We also provide alternative methods for solving the max-min polarization problem when the number of points N does not exceed the dimension n and when N = n + 1 N=n+1 . We further show that the cross-polytope has the best max-min polarization constant among all spherical 2-designs of N = 2 n N=2n points for n = 2 , 3 , 4 n=2,3,4 ; for n ≥ 5 n≥5 , this statement is conditional on a well-known conjecture that the cross-polytope has the best covering radius .

Looking at this mapping N as a whole, basic properties of B-spline functions imply that it has the following algebraic properties: (1) N ( a 0 , … , a k ) N(a0,…,ak) has local support contained in the interval [ a 0 , a k ] [a0,ak] ; (2) N ( a 0 , … , a k ) N(a0,…,ak) allows refinement, i.e. for every a ∈ ∪ j = 0 k − 1 ( a j , a j + 1 ) a∈∪j=0k−1(aj,aj+1) we have that if ( α 0 , … , α k + 1 ) (α0,…,αk+1) is the increasing rearrangement of the points { a 0 , … , a k , a } {a0,…,ak,a} , the ‘old’ function N ( a 0 , … , a k ) N(a0,…,ak) is a linear combination of the ‘new’ functions N ( α 0 , … , α k ) N(α0,…,αk) and N ( α 1 , … , α k + 1 ) N(α1,…,αk+1) ; (3) N is translation and dilation invariant. It is easy to see that derivatives of N ( a 0 , … , a k ) N(a0,…,ak) satisfy properties (1)–(3) as well. Let F be a mapping taking ( k + 1 ) (k+1) -tuples of increasing real numbers to some generalized function. In this paper we show that under some additional mild condition on the size of the supports of F ( a 0 , … , a k ) F(a0,…,ak) relative to the interval [ a 0 , a k ] [a0,ak] , properties (1)–(3) are already sufficient to deduce that F ( a 0 , … , a k ) F(a0,…,ak) is a non-zero multiple of (some derivative of) a B-spline function. However, and somewhat surprisingly, we explicitly give examples of choices of F satisfying (1)–(3) but are not of this form.},

Thus, the geometric properties of the solutions of P ( z 1 , … , z n ) P(z1,…,zn) reveal some information of the zeros of p ( z ) p(z) . Several geometric properties related to invariant circles of multi-affine polynomials were studied in [10] and [11] . Unfortunately, they seem to be too restrictive, when the degree of the polynomial is large, say four or more. This work investigates a relaxed notion for circles ( C 1 , … , C n ) (C1,…,Cn) to be invariant with respect to multi-affine polynomials P of degree n , given a vector ( u 1 , … , u n ) (u1,…,un) . This weaker definition allows us to formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for invariant circles to exist, given ( u 1 , … , u n ) (u1,…,un) .

However, many practical problems are characterized by temporal dependence and strong correlation between the marginals of the data-generating process, suggesting that the i.i.d. assumption is not always justified. This problem has been already considered in the context of Markov chains satisfying the Doeblin condition. This condition, among other things, implies that the chain is not singular in its behavior, i.e. it is irreducible. In this article, we focus on the case when the training data set is drawn from a not necessarily irreducible Markov chain . Under the assumption that the chain is uniformly ergodic with respect to the L1 -Wasserstein distance, and certain regularity assumptions on the hypothesis class and the state space of the chain, we first obtain a uniform convergence result for the corresponding sample error, and then we conclude learnability of the approximate sample error minimization algorithm and find its generalization bounds. At the end, a relative uniform convergence result for the sample error is also discussed.},

Assuming that the medium consists of a conducting and a non-conducting part, the derivative with respect to time is not fully entering, whence the system can be described by an abstract differential-algebraic equation. Furthermore, via magnetic induction, the system is coupled with an equation which contains the induced electrical currents along the associated voltages, which form the input of the system. The aim of this paper is to study well-posedness of the coupled MQS system and regularity of its solutions. Thereby, we rely on the classical theory of gradient systems on Hilbert spaces combined with the concept of E E -subgradients using in particular the magnetic energy.

Furthermore, we present a stability result for the state, and show that the solution of the linearized equation coincides with the Gâteaux derivative of the control-to-state mapping. Next, we prove the existence of an optimal solution and establish the first order optimality conditions. Finally, an uniqueness result of the coupled system constituted by the state equation, the adjoint equation and the first order optimality condition is established.},

We then briefly discuss the connection between Ramanujan&#39;s master theorem and identities of Hardy and Carr before extending the latter identities in the same way we extended Ramanujan&#39;s.

Then, making use of the obtained outcomes, exploiting higher integrability and regularity of the random field control/state variables, and employing Banach space-valued integration techniques, we derive Fritz-John necessary optimality conditions , with integrable functions and (countably additive) measures singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure as multipliers, for local weak Pareto solutions of studied problems.},

We consider a general convex equation of state which makes this problem complicated as well as interesting in the context of the general theory for transonic flows. Such type of patches appear in many transonic flows over an airfoil and flow near the nozzle throat. Here the main difficulty is the coupling of nonhomogeneous terms due to axisymmetry and the sonic degeneracy for the relativistic flow. However, using the well-received characteristic decompositions of angle variables and a partial hodograph transformation we prove the existence and regularity of solution in the partial hodograph plane first. Further, by using an inverse transformation we construct a smooth solution in the physical plane and discuss the uniform regularity of solution up to the associated sonic curve. Finally, we also discuss the uniform regularity of the sonic curve.},

  abstract     = {The main goal of this paper is to classify the first transitions of a class of 1D second order reaction diffusion equation with a non-self-adjoint linear part and semilinear nonlinearity on a bounded interval subject to homogeneous boundary conditions . The emphasis is on the interaction of the nonlinear terms , the boundary conditions and the strength of the first order derivative term which makes the linear operator non-self-adjoint. The equations admit a trivial steady state solution which loses stability as a control parameter exceeds a threshold. According to our results, the first transitions of the system are either continuous, jump or mixed type. We compare our results with a recent study where only self adjoint linear operator was considered. In the Dirichlet, Neumann and periodic boundary condition cases, the first transition occurs via a transcritical/pitchfork bifurcation and the dynamics remain unchanged between the self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint cases. However, for the periodic case, with imposed zero mean condition, in the non-self adjoint case, the first transition is always accompanied by a Hopf bifurcation with a stable/unstable bifurcated limit cycle which is different than the self-adjoint case. Finally, we apply our results to determine the first transitions of some well-known reaction diffusion equations such as the Kolmogorov-Fisher, Chaffee-Infante equation and the Burger&#39;s equation.},

  abstract     = {Consider d commuting C0 -semigroups (or equivalently: d -parameter C0 -semigroups) over a Hilbert space for d∈N . In the literature ( cf. [31] , [27] , [28] , [24] , [18] , [26] ), conditions are provided to classify the existence of unitary and regular unitary dilations. Some of these conditions require inspecting values of the semigroups, some provide only sufficient conditions, and others involve verifying sophisticated properties of the generators. By focussing on semigroups with bounded generators, we establish a simple and natural condition on the generators, viz. complete dissipativity , which naturally extends the basic notion of the dissipativity of the generators. Using examples of non-doubly commuting semigroups, this property can be shown to be strictly stronger than dissipativity. As the first main result, we demonstrate that complete dissipativity completely characterises the existence of regular unitary dilations, and extend this to the case of arbitrarily many commuting C0 -semigroups. We furthermore show that all multi-parameter C0 -semigroups (with bounded generators) admit a weaker notion of regular unitary dilations, and provide simple sufficient norm criteria for complete dissipativity. The paper concludes with an application to the von Neumann polynomial inequality problem, which we formulate for the semigroup setting and solve negatively for all d⩾2 .},

In this paper, we show that if T is a nonexpansive self-mapping defined on a nonempty compact convex set C of X so that S ≡ { T n : n ∈ N } S≡{Tn:n∈N} forms a distal flow, then T : C → C T:C→C is a surjective isometry; in particular, if C is of finite dimension, then T is a surjective affine isometry. Consequently, i) every distal S S of nonexpansive mappings on a convex compact set C consists of surjective self-isometries on C ; ii) all S in the distal S S have a common fixed point in the Chebyshev center of C ; iii) if, in addition, C is finite dimensional, then every S in S S is a surjective affine self-isometry on C . Therefore, it can also be understood as a refinement of a recent common fixed point theorem due to Wiśnicki. We also show that the conclusion i) is not true if C is not compact.

  abstract     = {A net ( x γ ) γ ∈ Γ (xγ)γ∈Γ in a locally solid Riesz space ( X , τ ) (X,τ) is said to be unbounded τ -convergent to x if | x γ − x | ∧ u ⟶ τ 0 |xγ−x|∧u⟶τ0 for all u ∈ X + u∈X+ . We recall that there is a locally solid linear topology u τ uτ on X such that unbounded τ -convergence coincides with u τ uτ -convergence. It turns out that u τ uτ is characterised as the weakest locally solid linear topology which coincides with τ on all order bounded subsets . It is with this motivation that we introduce, for a uniform lattice ( L , u ) (L,u) , the weakest lattice uniformity u ⁎ ⁎ u⁎ on L that coincides with u on all the order bounded subsets of L . It is shown that if u is the uniformity induced by the topology of a locally solid Riesz space ( X , τ ) (X,τ) , then the u ⁎ u⁎ -topology coincides with u τ uτ . This allows comparing results of this paper with earlier results on unbounded τ -convergence. It will be seen that despite the fact that in the setup of uniform lattices most of the machinery used in the techniques of [24] is lacking, the concept of ‘unbounded convergence’ well fittingly generalizes to uniform lattices. We shall also answer Questions 3.3, 5.10 of [24] and Question 18.51 of [22] .},

The global existence of solution for the proposed model is proved. Under weak competition, the existence and stability of the positive steady state are obtained, when the random diffusion rates are large enough, by using implicit function theorem and some priori estimations. However, when memory-based diffusions dominate the dynamics, spatial-temporal patterns can be observed. We also consider the case that both competition coefficients equal to one, showing that the stabilities of semi-trivial steady states, existence of positive steady state by the method of upper and lower solutions, and bistable dynamics of the model. The results reveal that the memory-based diffusion plays an important role on the competition outcomes. Specifically, the species with slower random diffusion may not help itself to wipe out its competitor because of disadvantageous memory-based diffusion, while the species with faster random diffusion but with advantageous memory-based diffusion may win the competition.},

Basic observations relate approximate invertibility with concepts of topological divisors of zero and density of (modular) ideals. We exemplify approximate invertibility in the group algebra, Wiener algebras, and operator ideals . For Wiener algebras with approximate identities (in particular, for the Fourier image of the convolution algebra), the approximate invertibility of an algebra element is equivalent to the property that it does not vanish. We also study approximate invertibility and its deeper connection with the Gelfand and representation theory in non-unital abelian Banach algebras as well as abelian and non-abelian C*-algebras.},

In particular, this criterion is independent of the micro-rotational velocity. Then as an immediate application, we prove that the Cauchy problem of micropolar fluid equations has a unique global strong solution, provided that the kinematic viscosity is sufficiently large, or the upper bound of initial density or initial kinetic energy is small enough.},

In particular, several GPI-related results from Wei [32] and Liu et al. [15] are extended in two ways: by replacing the power functions with more general classes of functions, and by replacing the usual Gaussian and multivariate gamma distributional assumptions by the more general trace-Wishart distribution assumption. These findings suggest that a Kronecker product form of the GPI holds for diagonal blocks of any Wishart distribution .},

The key point is to establish an observability inequality for the backward structurally damped stochastic plate equation. For this purpose, we derive a new global Carleman estimate for the damped stochastic plate operator with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the solution and the laplacian of the solution and with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions of first and third order, respectively. Such an estimate is obtained by using the Carleman estimate for stochastic parabolic operators with complex coefficients in an iteration manner.},

Regarding the reaction term, we consider a balanced bistable function f = − F ′ f=−F′ , with F a generic double well potential with wells of equal depth. In particular, we assume that the potential F has two global minima at ±1 and that F ( u ) ∼ | 1 ± u | 2 + θ F(u)∼|1±u|2+θ , for some θ &gt; − 1 θ&amp;gt;−1 , when u ≈ ± 1 u≈±1 , and we consider the corresponding equation in a bounded interval with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions . We prove that if θ ∈ ( − 1 , 0 ) θ∈(−1,0) , then there exist special steady states, named compactons , with a transition layer structure. In contrast, if θ ≥ 0 θ≥0 the interface layers are not stationary and two different phenomena emerge: for θ = 0 θ=0 solutions exhibit a metastable behavior and maintain an unstable structure for an exponentially long time, while if θ &gt; 0 θ&amp;gt;0 the exponentially slow motion is replaced by an algebraic one.},

The harvesting action is introduced by means of two switching control actions defined on the predator species. A well-known result in the study of ecosystem modeling is that there are two states of coexistence of one of the predatory species with the prey species assuming that the principle of competitive exclusion or coexistence of competing species is fulfilled. In this sense, the three species cannot coexist in this class of system. In this work, it is proved that there is a global stable equilibrium point where the three species can coexist due to the proposed harvesting action.},

Shimorin-Wold-type decomposition for completely bounded covariant representations, which are close to isometric representations, is obtained in [25] . This paper extends this decomposition for regular, completely bounded covariant representation having reduced minimum modulus ≥1 that satisfies the growth condition. To prove the decomposition, we introduce the terms regular, algebraic core, and reduced minimum modulus in the completely bounded covariant representation setting and work out several fundamental results. Consequently, we shall analyze the weighted unilateral shift introduced by Muhly and Solel and introduce and explore a non-commutative weighted bilateral shift.},

The structure is applied to the calculation of the solitons corresponding to the uniform motion and rotation of the particle. We calculate effective masses and momenta of inertia of the soltions. As an example, the Poisson structure is applied to the construction of the momentum map corresponding to the symmetry group of translations. All calculations are rigorously justified by the proof of the well-posedness and smooth approximations of solutions. The investigation is inspired by the problems of stability of solitons.},

The main part of the paper is a theory of derivations, based on LRT, which we develop. Its aim is to establish well-posedness results, not only for evolution in time but also for more general settings in terms of this new notion of derivation. One application concerns non-autonomous evolution equations with a new kind of boundary condition where values at the initial and final time are mixed.},

We study vector fields which are analogues of the gradient vector field of a function in the smooth case. Our goal is to define a nice theory of trajectories of such vector fields, so that the set of them captures the topology of the polyhedral complex, as in classical Morse theory. Since we do not assume the polyhedral complex to be a manifold, the definition of vector fields on it is very different from the smooth case. Nevertheless, we will show that there exist nice classes of functions and metrics which give gradient vector fields with desired properties. Our construction relies on Forman&#39;s discrete Morse theory. In particular, the class of functions we use is an improvement of Forman&#39;s discrete Morse functions . A notable feature of our theory is that our gradient vector fields are defined purely from functions and metrics as in the smooth case, contrary to the case of discrete Morse theory where we need the data of dimension of cells. This allows us to implement several useful constructions which were not available in the discrete case.},

To explore the influence of spatial factors on rumors, a new spatial distance on online social networks is first defined by considering friendship hops and the intimacy level among friends. On that basis, a novel reaction-diffusion SIR rumor spreading model with the general nonlinear propagation function is proposed in multi-lingual environments. Firstly, the global existence and ultimate boundedness of solutions are strictly proven. Theoretical analysis further reveals the existence of equilibrium points and the global stability of the rumor-free/prevailing equilibrium points of the proposed model. Secondly, an optimal control strategy with an education mechanism and a forced silence method is introduced to better curb rumor propagation. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of the threshold is conducted to discuss the relative importance of model parameters on rumor propagation. Finally, some necessary numerical simulations are performed to verify the validity of the theoretical analysis.},

For the singular short range communication case, collision avoidance is the key of both well-posedness and large time behavior. In this paper, by an inequality of second-order velocity-position moment, collision avoidance 1 is proved for the delayed C−S with some singular short range communication weights. Then, asymptotic flocking is established for some restricted initial data .},

Based on ultrasonic echo time measurements, we identify the surface heat flux and thickness simultaneously, and then achieve the reconstruction of the internal transient temperature field. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we show the uniqueness recovery result for the multiparameter identification problem. By reformulating the inverse problem as an optimization problem, we propose an efficient alternating iteration algorithm in solving the related optimization problem and provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the algorithm. Finally, the reliability and feasibility of this algorithm are verified by some numerical examples.},

The topological equivalence of f and g implies the topological equivalence of F ( f ) F(f) and F ( g ) F(g) , but the converse is not true, in general. In this paper, we introduce the class of linear-like submersion functions, which is wide enough in order to contain non-trivial behaviors, and provide conditions for the validity of the converse implication for functions inside this class. Our results lead us to a complete topological invariant for topological equivalence in a certain subclass of linear-like submersion functions.},

By utilizing a change of variables, the quasilinear equations are reduced to semilinear equations , whose associated functionals satisfy the geometric hypotheses of the mountain pass theorem. We establish the existence of nontrivial solutions via Mountain-Pass theorem. Furthermore, by using a Pohozaev type identity we prove the nonexistence of nontrivial solution under certain conditions.},

Further, we discuss the existence problem of Hopf bifurcation deduced by delay. Finally, the theoretical results in this article are verified by carrying out some numerical simulations. The research results show that density dependent diffusion does not affect the stability of the positive equilibrium of the model, but delay does.},

While this famous result holds for sequences of pairwise independent identically distributed real-valued random variables, a closely related result, the Hsu–Robbins–Erdös strong law of large numbers may fail if the underlying random variables are only assumed to be pairwise independent identically distributed. This note develops Rio&#39;s method and uses an approximation technique to establish the Hsu–Robbins–Erdös strong law of large numbers for the maximum partial sums of quadruplewise independent identically distributed random variables. We consider random variables taking values in a real separable Banach space X X , but the main result is new even when X X is the real line. Previous contributions so far considered the complete convergence of the partial sums or restricted to dependence structures satisfying a Kolmogorov-type maximal inequality.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the Rayleigh–Taylor instability in the system of equations of the two-dimensional nonhomogeneous incompressible Euler–Korteweg equations in a horizontal periodic domain with infinite height. First, we use variational method to construct (linear) unstable solutions for the linearized capillary Rayleigh–Taylor problem. Then, motivated by the Grenier&#39;s idea in [21] , we further construct approximate solutions with higher-order growing modes to the capillary Rayleigh–Taylor problem due to the absence of viscosity in the system, and derive the error estimates between both the approximate solutions and nonlinear solutions of the capillary Rayleigh–Taylor problem. Finally, we prove the existence of escape points based on the bootstrap instability method of Hwang–Guo in [28] , and thus obtain the nonlinear Rayleigh–Taylor instability result, which presents that the Rayleigh–Taylor instability can occur in the capillary fluids for any capillary coefficient κ &gt; 0 κ&amp;gt;0 if the critical capillary number is infinite.},

And an appropriate matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem is formulated. A closed system is solved for the explicit N -soliton solutions to the Kundu equation in the case of the reflectionless potential. Besides, the trace formula for the analytic scattering coefficients and the so-called theta condition for the phase difference between the boundary values are derived. A consistent framework is constructed to obtain solutions associated with double zeros to the analytic scattering coefficients. The solitons in the simple and double poles case of the Chen-Lee-Liu equation as a reduced example are studied, including any combination of dark, bright and breather solitons, and the dynamical properties of these solutions are displayed and analyzed.},

Taking α = − 1 / 2 α=−1/2 we get Λ − 1 / 2 = d / d x Λ−1/2=d/dx and E − 1 / 2 ( z ) = e z E−1/2(z)=ez , hence, the classic derivative and exponential are particular cases. In recent years, some papers have generalized, in a Dunkl sense, number theoretic concepts such as Appell sequences, and then they are called Appell-Dunkl sequences; in particular, the so called Bernoulli-Dunkl and Euler-Dunkl polynomials have been defined, among others. Here we generalize, also in a Dunkl sense, some Hurwitz or Lerch zeta functions such as ζ ( s , x ) = ∑ n = 0 ∞ 1 / ( n + x ) s ζ(s,x)=∑n=0∞1/(n+x)s and, in addition, we get properties that relate those functions, extended to the s -complex plane and evaluated at negative integers s , with Bernoulli-Dunkl and Euler-Dunkl polynomials. One of the results we get for the “Dunkl zeta function” ζ α ( s ) ζα(s) is ζ α ( 1 − s ) = Γ ( s ) cos ⁡ ( π s 2 ) ∑ n = 1 ∞ 1 s n s , Re ( s ) &gt; 1 ζα(1−s)=Γ(s)cos⁡(πs2)∑n=1∞1sns,Re(s)&amp;gt;1 (where s n sn are the positive zeros of the Bessel function J α + 1 ( x ) Jα+1(x) ).

Through investigating the spectrum of the system operator associated with the system on the imaginary axis, we show that the time-dependent solution of the system is strongly stable in the natural Banach state space. When the server failure rate is equal to zero, we show that the system admits a unique positive time-dependent solution and the solution is strongly convergent to its steady-state solution. In addition, when the service completion rate of server is a constant, the spectrum of the system operator lies on the left real axis. Finally, the corresponding C 0 C0 -semigroup generated by the system operator is uniformly exponentially stable, irreducible, uniformly mean ergodic, quasi-compact but not compact and not eventually compact.},

In a special case, asymptotic dynamics and bifurcation behaviors under p = 1 are analyzed in terms of the basic reproduction number . Asymptotic profiles of the endemic equilibrium for small and large diffusion rates of the susceptible and infected populations are investigated. It is found that the infectious disease is hard to control even under a policy of mobility regulation when 0 1 .},

By computing the associated Euler-Kronecker constant γ k , q γk,q , which depends on the arithmetic of certain subfields of Q ( ζ q ) Q(ζq) , we obtain the second order term in the asymptotic expansion of S k , q ( x ) Sk,q(x) . Using a method developed by Ford, Luca and Moree (2014), we determine the pairs ( k , q ) (k,q) with ( k , q − 1 ) = 1 (k,q−1)=1 for which Ramanujan&#39;s approximation to S k , q ( x ) Sk,q(x) is better than Landau&#39;s. This entails checking whether γ k , q γk,q&amp;lt;1/2 or not, and requires a substantial computational number theoretic input and extensive computer usage. We apply our results to study the non-divisibility of Fourier coefficients of six cusp forms by certain exceptional primes, extending and placing into a general context the earlier work of Moree (2004), who disproved several claims made by Ramanujan on the non-divisibility of the Ramanujan tau function by five such exceptional primes.},

It is natural to characterize individuals based on age when we consider the modelling of crime, as we do not expect a child to commit a crime. Also, a particular age group may be more prone to commit crimes. Keeping this in mind, we consider an age-structured model of the criminal and noncriminal-minded population in a society. The criminal-minded population is further divided into three categories. We develop a model and study the interaction between them. One crucial factor which we study is the effect of law enforcement. The global existence of steady state is shown using the method of induction on the real line. We check the stability of steady states by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. We have established the stability of the crime-free equilibrium. This equilibrium is more important as every society wants to achieve it. We also show the existence of forward bifurcation. It is interesting to see that the outcomes are very natural and enhance our understanding of such classes. Numerical simulations are also given for better illustration.},

Then, some algebraic operations of CC q -ROFS are defined, and the distance measure, score function , accuracy function, comparison method and desirable properties are studied in detail. Further, we develop weighted average and geometric aggregation operators based on CC q -ROFS information, and propose a new decision method for complex decision-making problems.

We are particularly interested in knowing when the number of sampling points M can be chosen on the order of the dimension N . For the case p = 2 p=2 it is known that M may always be chosen on the order of N as long as the subspace X N XN satisfies a natural L ∞ L∞ bound, and for the case p = ∞ p=∞ there are examples where M may not be chosen on the order of N . We show for all 1 ≤ p 1≤p&amp;lt;2 that there exist classes of subspaces of L p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) Lp([0,1]) which satisfy the L ∞ L∞ bound, but where the number of sampling points M cannot be chosen on the order of N . We show as well that the problem of discretizing the L p Lp norm of subspaces is directly connected with frame theory. In particular, we prove that discretizing a continuous frame to obtain a discrete frame which does stable phase retrieval requires discretizing both the L 2 L2 norm and the L 1 L1 norm on the range of the analysis operator of the continuous frame.},

  abstract     = {The local (central) limit theorem precisely describes the behavior of iterated convolution powers of a probability distribution on the d -dimensional integer lattice , Zd . Under certain mild assumptions on the distribution, the theorem says that the convolution powers are well-approximated by a single scaled Gaussian density which we call an attractor . When such distributions are allowed to take on complex values, their convolution powers exhibit new and striking behaviors not seen in the probabilistic setting. Following works of I. J. Schoenberg, T. N. E. Greville, P. Diaconis, and L. Saloff-Coste, the author and L. Saloff-Coste provided a complete description of local limit theorems for the class of finitely supported complex-valued functions on Z . For convolution powers of complex-valued functions on Zd , much less is known. In a previous work by the author and L. Saloff-Coste, local limit theorems were established for complex-valued functions whose Fourier transform is maximized in absolute value at so-called points of positive homogeneous type and, in that case, the resultant attractors are generalized heat kernels corresponding to a class of higher order partial differential operators . By considering the possibility that the Fourier transform can be maximized in absolute value at points of imaginary homogeneous type, a notion motivated by V. Thomée, this article extends previous work of the author and L. Saloff-Coste to broaden the class of complex-valued functions for which it is possible to obtain local limit theorems. These local limit theorems contain attractors given by certain oscillatory integrals and their convergence is established using a generalized polar-coordinate integration formula, due to H. Bui and the author, and the Van der Corput lemma. The article also extends recent results on sup-norm type estimates of H. Bui and the author.},

After reviewing some classic results on the two main exterior boundary value problems for the vector Helmholtz equation , i.e., the so-called electric boundary condition and the magnetic boundary condition, we prove reciprocity results for scattering of plane waves and point sources. Then we make use of them for obtaining uniqueness results for the inverse obstacle scattering problem to determine the shape of the scatterer from knowing the far field pattern of the scattered waves and results on the so-called far field operator for the two scattering problems. These results are generalizations of corresponding results for the Maxwell equations and analogues to results for the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition for the scalar Helmholtz equation. We also briefly consider the extension of the so-called DB boundary condition from the Maxwell equations to the vector Helmholtz equation.},

We then generalise another recent result by Enciso and Peralta-Salas, namely that the points of any rotationally symmetric optimal domain with connected boundary in Euclidean space which are closest to the symmetry axis must disconnect the boundary, to the hyperbolic setting, as well as strengthen it in the Euclidean case by removing the connected boundary assumption.},

First, we obtain a logarithm growth condition to guarantee the finiteness of the expected risk-sensitive discounted payoffs, which is an extension of the bounded reward/cost functions in the existing literature. Second, an example with unbounded payoff functions is given, where the solution to the (associated) Shapley equation (SE) no longer has the boundaries as in the existing research. This motivates us to replace the boundaries of the SE with new ones. Third, using the new boundaries and novel arguments, we not only establish the existence of a solution to the SE, but also prove the existence of the value of the game and a Nash equilibrium . Furthermore, we develop an iteration algorithm for computing (at least approximating) the value and Nash equilibria of the games. Finally, we use an inventory system to illustrate our results and show the difference between our conditions and those in the existing articles.},

The continuity was proved in [15] under the extra condition that the speeds are nonzero in all directions. Here, we revisit this continuity result without the extra condition. Secondly, we provide some sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of pulsating waves in rapidly oscillating media, which allow the equations to have multiple stable steady states.},

We prove all three algorithms are unconditionally long time stable. Numerical examples are provided to verify the convergence rate, unconditional stability, and computational efficiency.},

Although counterexamples to this conjecture have been found by Kobayashi and Lafontaine, it has recently been proved by Cernea and Guan that the Fischer-Marsden conjecture holds, provided that the space of nonconstant solutions of the Fischer-Marsden equation is of dimension at least n , the authors actually proving that in this case ( M , g ) (M,g) is nothing but a standard sphere. The main aim of this article is to show that any compact Riemannian manifold of positive Ricci curvature that admits a nontrivial concircular vector field with the potential function satisfying the Fischer-Marsden equation must be isometric to a standard sphere and the converse is also valid. Moreover, we prove that the existence of a nontrivial solution to another remarkable differential equation on Riemannian manifolds , namely the stationary Schrödinger equation , it also leads to a characterization of the sphere, provided that some pinching conditions are satisfied.},

This study elucidates the sufficient conditions under which the zero solution of a nonautonomous nonlinear dynamical system of second order is uniformly globally asymptotically stable . From the results obtained, a certain first-order nonlinear differential equation associated with the second-order dynamical system plays a vital role in uniform global asymptotic stability . More precisely, under several reasonable assumptions, if the integral from σ to t + σ of a particular solution of the first-order differential equation diverges uniformly with respect to σ , then the zero solution of the dynamical system is guaranteed to be uniformly globally asymptotically stable . For the proof, the behavior of the solutions of the dynamical system is carefully tracked. An example that also includes a linear case is provided to illustrate the main result. Simulations are also presented to facilitate understanding of the example, and a local theorem corresponding to the main result and its application to an ecosystem model are discussed.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the global stability problem for the two-dimensional magnetic Bénard system. The focus here involves only horizontal dissipation, horizontal magnetic diffusion, and horizontal thermal diffusivity . The lack of vertical dissipation makes it difficult to study the stability and long-time behavior of the magnetic Bénard system. To handle these, we use a new method to decompose the velocity u , magnetic field b , and temperature Θ into the horizontal average (u‾,b‾,Θ‾) and the oscillation part (u˜,b˜,Θ˜) . Then we establish the global stability by using several anisotropic inequalities when the initial data are small in H2(Ω) . Moreover, we mathematically show that the H1 -norm of the oscillation part eventually decays exponentially to zero. Furthermore, the solution (u,b,Θ) approaches the horizontal average (u‾,b‾,Θ‾) asymptotically.},

By employing energy methods in the Fourier space and the WKB analysis, we derive decay estimates for solutions under a large class of μ ( | D | ) μ(|D|) . In particularly, a threshold lim | ξ | → ∞ ⁡ μ ( | ξ | ) = ∞ lim|ξ|→∞⁡μ(|ξ|)=∞ is discovered for the regularity-loss phenomenon, where μ ( | ξ | ) μ(|ξ|) denotes the symbol of μ ( | D | ) μ(|D|) . Furthermore, we investigate different asymptotic profiles of the solution with additionally L 1 L1 initial datum , where some refined estimates in the sense of the enhanced decay rate and the reduced regularity are found. The derived results in this manuscript almost cover the known results with a sufficiently small loss.},

Applying these conditions to the case when each σ n σn is the n -fold composition σ n ( z ) = σ ∘ ⋯ ∘ σ ( z ) σn(z)=σ∘⋯∘σ(z) of a non-identity automorphism σ ( z ) = ( a z + b ) / ( c z + d ) σ(z)=(az+b)/(cz+d) , where a , b , c , d ∈ R a,b,c,d∈R with the normalization a d − b c = 1 ad−bc=1 , we show that C σ Cσ is hypercyclic if and only if | a + d | ≥ 2 |a+d|≥2 . Furthermore we obtain an explicit formula, in terms of a , b , c , d a,b,c,d , of the point ζ for which σ n ( z ) → ζ σn(z)→ζ uniformly on compact subsets of P P . Motivated by our results for the region P P , we obtain analogous results when the region is the open unit disk .

Motivated by this research, we also give a characterization for a normed space to be finite dimensional: a normed space is finite dimensional iff every continuous real–valued function defined on each bounded closed subset of this space can attain its minimum, namely the converse of the classical Weierstrass theorem also holds true.},

We first show a uniform a priori estimate and the global existence of the approximation equations, as well as a convergence property of the approximate solutions. These results are used to prove the local well-posedness of the original equations. Then an optimal regularity criterion for strong solutions of the equations is established. Under the assumption that the initial magnetic field is small in some critical Besov spaces , this criterion leads to the global-in-time existence of strong solutions. The proof of which relies on a commutator estimate established in the paper.},

The result can be written in terms of analytic Cauchy wavelets. As in the case of the STFT considered by Knutsen, our result consists of a two-sided bound for the norm of a localization operator involving the fractal dimension log⁡2/log⁡3 in the exponent. As in the STFT case and in Dyatlov&#39;s fractal uncertainty principle, the (hyperbolic) measure of the dilated iterates of the Cantor set in the disk tends to infinity, while the corresponding norm of the localization operator tends to zero.},

  abstract     = {We study signal processing tasks in which the signal is mapped via some generalized time-frequency transform to a higher dimensional time-frequency space, processed there, and synthesized to an output signal. We show how to approximate such methods using a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approach. We consider cases where the time-frequency representation is redundant, having feature axes in addition to the time and frequency axes. The proposed QMC method allows sampling both efficiently and evenly such redundant time-frequency representations. Indeed, 1) the number of samples required for a certain accuracy is log-linear in the resolution of the signal space, and depends only weakly on the dimension of the redundant time-frequency space, and 2) the quasi-random samples have low discrepancy, so they are spread evenly in the redundant time-frequency space. One example of such redundant representation is the localizing time-frequency transform (LTFT), where the time-frequency plane is enhanced by a third axis. This higher dimensional time-frequency space improves the quality of some time-frequency signal processing tasks, like the phase vocoder (an audio signal processing effect). Since the computational complexity of the QMC is log-linear in the resolution of the signal space, this higher dimensional time-frequency space does not degrade the computation complexity of the proposed QMC method . The proposed QMC method is more efficient than standard Monte Carlo methods, since the deterministic QMC sample points are optimally spread in the time-frequency space, while random samples are not.},

Then, exploiting this tool, some optimal regularity results, recently established by López-Gómez and Omari in [15] , [16] , [17] for the bounded variation solutions of non-autonomous quasilinear equations driven by the one-dimensional curvature operator, are substantially improved by admitting general prescribed curvatures and by incorporating general boundary conditions. The novel approach developed here yields a new, deeper, interpretation of the assumptions introduced in our previous papers, simultaneously clarifying their meaning and making fully transparent their connection with the strong maximum principle.},

This infinite representation is known to converge uniformly to the kernel K . We estimate the speed of this convergence in terms of the decay rate of eigenvalues and demonstrate that for 2 m times differentiable kernels the first N terms of the series approximate K as O((∑i=N+1∞λi)mm+n) or O((∑i=N+1∞λi2)m2m+n) . Finally, we demonstrate some applications of our results to a spectral characterization of integral operators with continuous roots and other powers.},

One of main ingredients is to discover and analyze an explicit form of the Fourier transform of the surface measure on the flat disk.

The dynamics compensations are described by stabilizing or observing cascade systems which can be decoupled by the upper-block-triangle transform. A full state feedback is designed to stabilize the cascade system exponentially and a state observer is proposed to estimate the system state in the abstract framework. It is shown that the error based observer design for output regulation can be converted into a sensor dynamics compensation problem by the well-known regulator equations. As applications, an unstable heat equation with ODE actuator dynamics and an ODE with an unstable heat equation sensor dynamics are investigated to validate the theoretical results. The numerical simulations for both of them are carried out to validate the proposed approach visually.},

Huang and Ji proved that this locus is non-empty. Ebenfelt and Zaitsev proved that, for ellipsoids that are sufficiently “closed” to the sphere, the locus actually contains a “stable” curve of umbilical points. Foo, Merker and Ta later provided an explicit curve that is contained in it. The main result in this paper exhibits that the umbilical locus is the union of the curves mentioned above and a non-trivial real variety which is defined by two homogeneous real sextic equations of four real variables. When there are suitable pairs of equal semi-axes, one of them factors allowing us to determine the locus explicitly.},

In particular, this allows to define the falling factorial polynomials in the Dunkl context.

In this paper, we define these numbers and polynomials in the Dunkl context, and prove some of their properties.},

In this article, we present a mathematical model that depicts foodborne disease transmission to humans by cockroaches to incorporate control interventions such as insecticides use and regular environmental sanitation. The mathematical and numerical analyses are conducted to investigate the impact of these control interventions when considered as a single or combined strategies. The results reveal the efficacy level of the insecticides beyond which a total eradication is possible. Use of baits and trapping devices intervention is also explored and revealed to be the best.},

Under the assumption that the initial vorticity ω 0 ∈ W k , p ( R + 2 ) ω0∈Wk,p(R+2) with k ≥ 3 k≥3 an integer and 1 1&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;2 , it is shown that the two-dimensional incompressible vorticity equation admits a unique solution ω ∈ C ( [ 0 , T ] ; W k , p ( R + 2 ) ) ω∈C([0,T];Wk,p(R+2)) for any T &gt; 0 T&amp;gt;0 . An elementary and self-contained proof is presented and delicate estimates of the velocity and its derivatives are obtained in this paper. It should be emphasized that the uniform estimate on ∫ 0 t ‖ ∇ u ( τ ) ‖ L ∞ ( R + 2 ) d τ ∫0t‖∇u(τ)‖L∞(R+2)dτ is required to complete the global regularity of the solution. To do that, the double exponential growth in time of the gradient of the vorticity in the half plane is established and applied. This is different from the proof of global well-posedness of the Euler velocity equations in the Sobolev spaces , in which a Kato-type or logarithmic-type estimate of the gradient of the velocity is enough to close the energy estimates.},

Furthermore, under a natural (weak) assumption on the position of the point-wise target relatively to the obstacle, we show that there exists a point in the boundary of the obstacle so that no better regularity result holds near such a point.

The analysis first decouples Maxwell&#39;s equations on the basis of a potential theory and then uses an operator-variation-of-constants formula (the Duhamel Principle) to achieve the expression of exact solutions of Maxwell&#39;s equations. We further illustrate the simplicity and multi-purpose applicability of the new approach in linear, homogeneous, isotropic and lossless (bounded or unbounded and source-free or source) medium (in rectangular, cylindrical or spherical coordinates). Moreover, we make a study on impulse electromagnetics. With this new approach, this paper bridges the gap between the time domain electromagnetics and the frequency domain electromagnetics.},

This type of inverse and ill-posed problems arises in a variety of real-world applications concerning heat conduction and tumour source localization. In accordance with the weak solvability result for the forward problem , we focus on the inverse problem with the high-order Sobolev-Gevrey smoothness and with Sobolev measurements. As expected from the well-known results for the linear case, we prove that this nonlinear spectral regularization possesses a logarithmic rate of convergence in the high-order Sobolev norm. The proof can be done by the verification of variational source condition; this way interestingly validates such a fine strategy in the framework of inverse problems for nonlinear partial differential equations . Ultimately, we design an iteration-based version of the proposed method for a class of reaction-diffusion problems with non-degenerate nonlinearity, taking into account the conventional time discretization . The convergence of this iterative scheme is also investigated.},

This equation represents the abstract generalization of the Ball integro-differential equation. The general nonlinear case with respect to terms of the equation which include a square of a norm of a gradient is considered. A three-layer semi-discrete scheme is proposed in order to find an approximate solution. In this scheme, the approximation of nonlinear terms that are dependent on the gradient is carried out by using an integral mean. We show that the solution of the nonlinear discrete problem and its corresponding difference analogue of a first-order derivative is uniformly bounded. For the solution of the corresponding linear discrete problem, it is obtained high-order a priori estimates by using two-variable Chebyshev polynomials . Based on these estimates we prove the stability of the nonlinear discrete problem. For smooth solutions, we provide error estimates for the approximate solution. An iteration method is applied in order to find an approximate solution for each temporal step. The convergence of the iteration process is proved.},

We then prove that the tight spectrum T T is homeomorphic to the boundary path space ∂ E obtained from the topological correspondence. Using this result, we prove that the groupoid Γ ( B , L , θ , I α ) Γ(B,L,θ,Iα) equipped with the topology induced from the topology on G t i g h t Gtight is isomorphic to Γ ( ∂ E , σ E ) Γ(∂E,σE) as a topological groupoid. Finally, we show that their ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebras are isomorphic to the ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebra of the generalized Boolean dynamical system.},

We first describe a “naturally appearing” functor , based on paving L with contractively complemented finite dimensional subspaces . This finite dimensionality is essential; it permits us to describe a free L -space for this functor . As a corollary, we obtain a wide variety of projective L -spaces. For “nice” spaces L (such as the space of simple p -integrable functions on a measure space), we obtain a full characterization of projective L -spaces; as a particular case, we recover a description of projective p -multinormed spaces.},

This includes the examination of certain dependence properties such as lower tail decreasingness (LTD), stochastic increasingness (SI) or total positivity of order 2, the latter usually considered for a copula (TP2) or (if existent) its density (d-TP2). In the present paper we investigate total positivity of order 2 for a copula&#39;s Markov kernel (MK-TP2 for short), a positive dependence property that is stronger than TP2 and SI, weaker than d-TP2 but, unlike d-TP2, is not restricted to absolutely continuous copulas, making it presumably the strongest dependence property defined for any copula (including those with a singular part such as Marshall-Olkin copulas). We examine the MK-TP2 property for different copula families, among them the class of Archimedean copulas and the class of extreme value copulas. In particular we show that, within the class of Archimedean copulas, the dependence properties SI and MK-TP2 are equivalent.},

Using the Cauchy formula of slice monogenic functions it is possible to write the Fueter-Sce-Qian extension theorem in integral form and to define the F F -functional calculus for n -tuples of commuting operators. This functional calculus is defined on the S -spectrum and generates a monogenic functional calculus in the spirit of McIntosh and collaborators. One of the main goals of this paper is to show that the F F -functional calculus generates the Riesz projectors. The existence of such projectors is obtained via the F F -resolvent equation which was previously known only in the quaternionic setting and also its existence was under question. In this paper we prove the F F -resolvent equation in the Clifford algebra setting. It is much more complicated than the one in the quaternionic case since it contains various pieces, however it still allows to nicely define the Riesz projectors.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns the topological derivatives and its applications for solving shape and topology optimization problems in fluid mechanics. The fluid flow is governed by the unsteady incompressible Stokes equations in the two dimensional case. We derive a topological sensitivity analysis for this parabolic-type operator. The proposed approach is based on a preliminary estimate describing the variation of the velocity field caused by the presence of a small obstacle inside the fluid flow. We obtain a topological asymptotic expansion for the unsteady Stokes operator valid for a large class of shape functions and an arbitrarily shaped geometric perturbation. Then, the topological gradient is exploited for building an efficient and accurate topology optimization algorithm. Finally, we present some numerical investigations showing the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

This process can be identified with a discrete-time quasi-birth-death process on the state space N 0 × { 1 , 2 , … , N } N0×{1,2,…,N} , represented by a block tridiagonal transition probability matrix . We prove that we can analyze this process by using spectral methods and obtain the n -step transition probabilities in terms of a weight matrix and the corresponding matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials (the so-called Karlin-McGregor formula). We also study under what conditions we can get a reflecting-absorbing factorization of the birth-death chain on a spider which can be seen as a stochastic UL block factorization of the transition probability matrix of the quasi-birth-death process. With this factorization we can perform a discrete Darboux transformation and get new families of “almost” birth-death chains on a spider. The spectral matrix associated with the Darboux transformation will be a Geronimus transformation of the original spectral matrix. Finally, we apply our results to the random walk on a spider, i.e. with constant transition probabilities .},

First, we prove the weak well-posedness of these wave equations and some regularity results. Second, by using some important information about the structure of the three measures above, we set up a framework for one-dimensional measures to discretize the wave equations. Then we use the finite element and central difference methods to obtain numerical approximations of the weak solutions for such equations. Finally, we show that the numerical solutions converge to the actual weak solution and obtain the rate of convergence.},

In particular, in this article we prove in the case where the distribution of the input data is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure that the risk of every bounded GF trajectory converges to the risk of a critical point. In addition, we show in the case of a 1-dimensional affine target function and a uniform input distribution that the risk of every bounded GF trajectory converges to zero if the initial risk is sufficiently small. Finally, we show that the boundedness assumption can be removed if the hidden layer consists of only one neuron.},

First we show that if such map preserves products equal to a finite-rank operator, then it must also preserve the zero product. In several instances, this is enough to show that a product preserving map must be a scalar multiple of an algebra homomorphism . Second, we explore a more general problem concerning the existence of product preserving maps and the relationship between the fixed elements. Lastly, motivated by Kaplansky&#39;s problem on invertibility preservers, we show that maps preserving products equal to fixed invertible elements are either homomorphisms or antihomomorphisms multiplied on the left by a fixed element.},

This condition is automatic if H ≤ G H≤G is central, and in general implies the unimodularity of H H . We also describe a bijection between strictly positive group-like elements δ affiliated with C 0 ( G ) C0(G) and quantum-group morphisms G → ( R , + ) G→(R,+) , with the closed image of the morphism easily described in terms of the spectrum of δ .

We will analyze a model with a highly nonlinear and mutually coupled PDE system of plaque growth dynamics, including LDL and HDL cholesterol, M 1 M1 inflammatory and M 2 M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages, and foam cells. This free boundary problem is associated with two different types of surfaces: a vascular surface with the boundary set to r = 1 r=1 and the interface Γ ( t ) Γ(t) between the plaque and blood flow. For this model, the explicit stationary solutions are nonexistent due to the highly nonlinear nature of the problem. We shall first prove the existence and uniqueness of the radially symmetric stationary solution. Then, we shall combine parameters into a single bifurcation parameter μ , and establish the existence of a sequence μ n μn , such that for each μ n ( n ≥ 2 ) μn(n≥2) , the symmetry-breaking stationary solutions bifurcate from the radially symmetric stationary solutions for sufficiently small plaques.},

As in the case of complex Banach algebras , we introduce the notions of the hull-kernel topology on M ( A ) M(A) and the regularity of a commutative unital Banach ring. We show that the Banach algebra of all bounded continuous k -valued functions defined on a zero-dimensional topological space is regular, where k is a complete valuation field. Hence, we see that the Berkovich spectrum of this algebra is a Hausdorff space in the hull-kernel topology. Next, we use the tool of Gelfand transform to characterize a Banach ring of finite Berkovich spectrum. From this, we see that if A is uniform, i.e., ‖ f 2 ‖ = ‖ f ‖ 2 ‖f2‖=‖f‖2 for all f in A , and has finite Berkovich spectrum, then it is regular.},

In this paper, we find a basis for the space of vector-valued period polynomials consisting of Hecke eigenpolynomials, and relate the basis to a Miller-like basis of the space of weakly holomorphic cusp forms by calculation of the matrix representation of the Hecke operator T ˜ l T˜l . Furthermore, we find the relation between our Hecke eigenpolynomials and the even and odd parts of the period polynomials induced from holomorphic Hecke eigenforms, and examine algebracity of the Hecke eigenpolynomials.},

Let ⁎ N ⁎ ( a , b ; n ) N⁎(a,b;n) be the number of representations of n as a sum of odd squares with coefficients 1 or 3 ( a of ones and b of threes). We have that ⁎ N ⁎ ( a , b ; 8 n + a + 3 b ) N⁎(a,b;8n+a+3b) is the number of representations of n as a sum of triangular numbers with coefficients 1 or 3 ( a of ones and b of threes). It is known that for a and b satisfying 1 ≤ a + 3 b ≤ 7 1≤a+3b≤7 , we have ⁎ N ⁎ ( a , b ; 8 n + a + 3 b ) = 2 2 + ( a 4 ) + a b N ( a , b ; 8 n + a + 3 b ) N⁎(a,b;8n+a+3b)=22+(a4)+abN(a,b;8n+a+3b) and for a and b satisfying a + 3 b = 8 a+3b=8 , we have ⁎ N ⁎ ( a , b ; 8 n + a + 3 b ) = 2 2 + ( a 4 ) + a b ( N ( a , b ; 8 n + a + 3 b ) − N ( a , b ; ( 8 n + a + 3 b ) / 4 ) ) .

In this paper, for general a and b with a + b a+b even, we prove asymptotic equivalence of formulas similar to the above, as n → ∞ n→∞ . One of our main results extends a theorem of Bateman, Datskovsky, and Knopp where the case b = 0 b=0 and general a was considered. Our approach is different from Bateman-Datskovsky-Knopp&#39;s proof where the circle method and singular series were used. We achieve our results by explicitly computing the Eisenstein components of the generating functions of ⁎ N ⁎ ( a , b ; 8 n + a + 3 b ) N⁎(a,b;8n+a+3b) and N ( a , b ; 8 n + a + 3 b ) N(a,b;8n+a+3b) . The method we use is robust and can be adapted in studying the asymptotics of other representation numbers with general coefficients.},

Our analysis is based on a specific treatment of the internal energy contributions. We also propose a geometric variant of Grad&#39;s proof of the same compactness property in the monatomic case.},

Our method is based on certain dispersive and smoothing estimates of the semigroup associated with the linearized vectorial heat equation and the fixed point argument. First, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the asymptotically almost periodic mild solution for the linear equation . Next, using the fixed point argument we can pass from the linear equation to the semi-linear equation to prove the existence and uniqueness of such solution. We prove also the exponential stability of solution by using the cone inequality. Finally, abstract results will be applied to Navier-Stokes equations and the semi-linear vectorial heat equation.},

In three dimensions , the conjectured bound is C n 4 3 Cn43 (see e.g. [6] and [11] ). In dimensions four and higher, this problem, in its general formulation, loses meaning because the Lens example shows that one can construct a set of n points in dimension 4 and higher where the unit distance arises ≈ n 2 ≈n2 times (see e.g. [1] ). However, the Lens example is one-dimension in nature, which raises the possibility that the unit distance conjecture is still quite interesting in higher dimensions under additional structural assumptions on the point set. This point of view was explored in [4] , [5] , [7] and has led to some interesting connections between the unit distance problem and its continuous counterparts, especially the Falconer distance conjecture ( [3] ). In this paper, we study the unit distance problem and its variants under the assumption that the underlying family of point sets is uniformly distributed. We prove several incidence bounds in this setting and clarify some key properties of uniformly distributed sequences in the context of incidence problems in combinatorial geometry.},

We characterize the subspace of H + ( S ) H+(S) that allows such a continuation and show that it is dense but not closed within H + ( S ) H+(S) . Furthermore, we derive the linear mapping that maps a vector field from this subspace of H + ( S ) H+(S) to the corresponding unique vector field in H − ( S ) H−(S) . The explicit construction uses layer potentials but involves unbounded operators. We indicate some bounded extremal problems supporting a possible numerical evaluation of this mapping between the Hardy components.

We study both the essential and the discrete spectra of this operator. It is shown that the essential spectrum of the sum is the union of the essential spectrum of the convolution operator and the image of the potential. We then provide a number of sufficient conditions for the existence of discrete spectrum and obtain lower and upper bounds for the number of discrete eigenvalues. Special attention is paid to the case of operators possessing countably many points of the discrete spectrum. We also compare the spectral properties of the operators considered in this work with those of classical Schrödinger operators .},

In particular, we show that for any scalar-valued non-constant inner function θ , the numerical radius and the Crawford number of a Toeplitz operator T θ Tθ on a Hardy space is 1 and 0, respectively. It is also shown that numerical radius is multiplicative for a class of isometries and sub-multiplicative for a class of commutants of a shift. We have illustrated these results with some concrete examples. Finally, some Hardy-type inequalities for Berezin number of certain class of operators are established with the help of the classical Hardy&#39;s inequality .},

This diffusion process , widely studied by Yor in a series of papers, finds direct application in the study of a class of path-dependent financial derivatives known as Asian options . We obtain the Varadhan formula − 2 log ⁡ p ( t , x ; T , y ) Ψ ( t , x ; T , y ) → 1 , as T − t → 0 + , where p denotes the transition density and Ψ denotes the optimal cost function of a deterministic control problem associated to the diffusion. We provide a partial proof of this formula, and present numerical evidence to support the validity of an intermediate inequality that is required to complete the proof. We also derive an asymptotic expansion of the cost function Ψ, expressed in terms of elementary functions, which is useful in order to design efficient approximation formulas for the transition density.},

This condition leaves out a large and biologically meaningful parameter range that will have to be addressed by a different method.
