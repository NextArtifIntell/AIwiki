  abstract     = {A geodesic packing of a graph G is a set of vertex-disjoint maximal geodesics. The maximum cardinality of a geodesic packing is the geodesic packing number gpack ( G ) gpack(G) . It is proved that the decision version of the geodesic packing number is NP-complete. We also consider the geodesic transversal number, gt ( G ) gt(G) , which is the minimum cardinality of a set of vertices that hit all maximal geodesics in G . While gt ( G ) ≥ gpack ( G ) gt(G)≥gpack(G) in every graph G , the quotient gt ( G ) / gpack ( G ) gt(G)/gpack(G) is investigated. By using the rook&#39;s graph, it is proved that there does not exist a constant C &lt; 3 C&amp;lt;3 such that gt ( G ) gpack ( G ) ≤ C gt(G)gpack(G)≤C would hold for all graphs G . If T is a tree, then it is proved that gpack ( T ) = gt ( T ) gpack(T)=gt(T) , and a linear algorithm for determining gpack ( T ) gpack(T) is derived. The geodesic packing number is also determined for the strong product of paths.},

  abstract     = {As a measure of vertex importance according to the graph structure, PageRank has been widely applied in various fields. While many PageRank algorithms have been proposed in the past decades , few of them take into account whether the graph under investigation is directed or not. Thus, some important properties of undirected graph—symmetry on edges, for example—is ignored. In this paper, we propose a parallel PageRank algorithm specifically designed for undirected graphs that can fully leverage their symmetry. Formally, our algorithm extends the Chebyshev Polynomial approximation from the field of real function to the field of matrix function. Essentially, it reflects the symmetry on edges of undirected graph and the density of diagonalizable matrix. Theoretical analysis indicates that our algorithm has a higher convergence rate and requires less computation than the Power method, with a 50% higher convergence rate when the damping factor c = 0.85 c=0.85 . Experiments on six datasets illustrate that our algorithm with 38 parallelism can be up to 43 times faster than the single-thread Power method.},

A more general scenario of semi-Markov jump systems under communication constraints is explored, where the output signal occurs with saturation nonlinearity, packet loss, and quantization. The saturation nonlinearity and packet dropout are described by two random variables subject to Bernoulli distribution. The mode-dependent adaptive event-triggered mechanism is designed by combining the system mode information. Based on the output error, the trigger threshold adaptive law is designed to make the threshold change dynamically. The mode-dependent time-varying filter is constructed and sufficient conditions for the desired filter with H ∞ H∞ performance are obtained. Finally, a single-link robot arm system verifies the effectiveness of the proposed filter design method, and the adaptive event-triggered protocol can effectively reduce the number of data transmissions.},

To address this issue, an event-triggered distributed resilient control method is proposed in this paper to mitigate the impacts of disturbances, FDI and DoS attacks on MGs. The proposed approach employs a piecewise control strategy and utilizes adaptive method to achieve the secondary control objective of MGs. In order to conserve computing and communication resources, an event-triggered mechanism is adopted and its parameter selection is associated with attacks. This design ensures system stability while also eliminating Zeno behavior. By applying Lyapunov stability theory , it can be proven that the algorithm proposed in this paper is capable of achieving the desired control objective.

The main advantage is that serendipity elements can maintain a proper order of convergence of the interpolation error under the condition of regularity, while reducing the number of inner freedoms. In practice, it is necessary to analyze their interpolation error on anisotropic meshes. Based on quasi-orthogonal polynomials, the explicit forms of interpolating polynomials for 2D and 3D serendipity elements with arbitrary degrees are first presented. Then, the interpolation error estimates of the serendipity elements on anisotropic meshes are given. Furthermore, the fine estimation of constants appearing in the interpolation estimates is derived.

Their payoffs are affected by the investment decision of themselves and their neighbors, which will cause conflicting interests between individual and social investment. Such problems can be modeled as a networked public goods game (NPGG). In this paper, we study the Best-shot NPGG model by introducing three mechanisms: k -hop, payoff information use strategy, and access cost. We use evolutionary game theory and present the k -hop evolutionary Best-shot networked public goods game ( k -EBNPG) to explore the impact of these three mechanisms on social welfare. The results show that social welfare will increase with a diminishing margin as k increases while introducing the payoff information use strategy can significantly improve social welfare when k &gt; 1 k&amp;gt;1 . Finally, we study the impact of access cost on social welfare and surprisingly find that social welfare will achieve the highest when the access cost is half the investment cost.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present an efficient and stable fractional-step 2D immersed boundary (IB) method for solving the interaction problems between bulk fluid and elastic interface, in particular, when the fluid inertia and the interfacial elasticity are the significant factors affecting its dynamics. In myriads of real-world applications, the effects of high inertia and elasticity are dominant. So the complex fluid dynamics under such harsh conditions is an important topic in computational physics and is inherently challenging due to high computational complexity. In turn, it requires to solve the governing equations of elastic interfacial motion in an implicit manner so that more stable simulations can be performed by relaxing the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. The contributions of the proposed approach are three folds. First, an iteration-free semi-Lagrangian method is employed in Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. Second, the elastic force acting along the interface is treated semi-implicitly in IB formulations. Both approaches improve the numerical stability associated with the high fluidic inertia and interfacial elasticity. Finally, to solve the resulting linear system, our novel idea is to transform the original 3-by-3 block matrix system into a reduced 2-by-2 block matrix system using a discrete projection operator in a staggered grid, and then explicitly represent the exact solution via the Schur complement of the Helmholtz operator. Owing to this feature, we refer to this proposed approach as reduced immersed boundary method (rIBM). We show that the two systems are equivalent in theory, whereas the conventional immersed boundary projection method (IBPM) modifies the discrete momentum equation in the original system. A series of numerical tests is conducted to confirm the stability of the rIBM using relatively larger time-step sizes, specifically with Reynolds number and inverse capillary number equal to or larger than approximately 1000. By estimating the computational time, the numerical efficiency of the proposed method is further verified in comparison with the conventional IBPM and the Crank-Nicolson scheme-based IB method. In conclusion, the proposed approach not only improves the numerical stability, but also increases the computational speed, suitable for solving more realistic problems.},

Convergence analysis for the computed derivatives is also presented to show that the order of the convergence is the same as that of the solution. The new HOC schemes for computing partial derivatives at both interior and boundary grid points take into account of the partial differential equations including the source term and/or the boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin). Fourth order accurate compact finite difference formulas with pre-computed coefficients and weights are developed for Poisson/Helmholtz PDEs, and code generated coefficients for diffusion-advection equations with constant coefficients .

  abstract     = {The n -dimensional HSDC with the logic graph H n Hn is one of the most attractive server-centric data center networks for high incremental scalability. The routing design in network topology is very important for information transmission. In particular, the application of disjoint path covers can solve various problems such as program code optimization and mapping parallel programs to parallel structures. H n Hn consists of 2 n 2n cliques and each two vertices in a clique are adjacent. For any vertex sets { x , u } {x,u} and { y , v } {y,v} in W and B , respectively, and any two disjoint vertex sets A 1 , A 2 A1,A2 in some clique, where ( W , B ) (W,B) is a bipartition of H n Hn , in this paper, we prove that, when | A i | ≠ 1 |Ai|≠1 and A i ∩ { x , y , u , v } = ∅ Ai∩{x,y,u,v}=∅ for i = 1 , 2 i=1,2 , if | A 1 ∪ A 2 | ≤ n − 3 |A1∪A2|≤n−3 , then there exists an ( x , y ) (x,y) -path P 1 P1 and a ( u , v ) (u,v) -path P 2 P2 in H n Hn passing through A 1 A1 and A 2 A2 , respectively, such that P 1 P1 and P 2 P2 have no common vertices and P 1 ∪ P 2 P1∪P2 contains all vertices of H n Hn .

  abstract     = {In multiple applications, from Statistics to Particle Physics and notably in Cryptography and Computer Security, it is necessary to obtain long sequences of random numbers . In order to verify the properties of these sequences, different statistical tests are commonly applied, which are usually included in the so-called test batteries or test suites. The batteries need to be both effective and efficient. Their effectiveness relates to how well they can spot non-randomness behaviour, the efficiency is related to the computational time they require. It is therefore essential for tests included in batteries to measure their independence features: Test independence is important for good effectiveness, as high correlations between tests could lead to a decreased efficiency (testing for the same features multiple times) and effectiveness (missing an opportunity to test for an orthogonal randomness property when we essentially measure the same twice). Moreover, the related study of test coverage is often based on the assumption that tests are independent. This paper describes a series of experiments aimed at scrutinizing dependencies among the statistical tests in the NIST SP 800-22 suite. In order to do so, sequences of varying lengths from sources of varying entropy have been generated and tested. Afterwards, an inferential study was carried out to find whether significant correlations exist and to present our findings in a statistically sound way.},

In addition, we obtain necessary conditions on A A analogous to the semiseparability conditions in the nonsingular case, though in the singular case they are not sufficient, as illustrated with examples.

The first equation is of hyperbolic type and the second of elliptic type . Variational frames for obtaining weak solutions to the initial value Hasegawa–Mima problem with periodic boundary conditions were also derived. In a more recent work Karakazian et al. (2022), a numerical approach consisting of a finite element space-domain combined with an Euler-implicit time scheme was used to discretize the coupled variational Hasegawa–Mima model. A semi-linear version of this implicit nonlinear scheme was tested for several types of initial conditions. This semi-linear scheme proved to lack efficiency for long time, which necessitates imposing a cap on the magnitude of the solution. To circumvent this difficulty, in this paper, we use Newton-type methods (Newton, Chord and an introduced Modified Newton method) to solve numerically the fully-implicit non-linear scheme. Testing these methods in FreeFEM++ indicates significant improvements as no cap needs to be imposed for long time. In the sequel, we demonstrate the validity of these methods by proving several results, in particular the convergence of the implemented methods.},

In this paper, solution space organisation of minimum vertex-cover problem is deeply investigated using the famous König-Egérvary (KE) graph and theorem, in which a hierarchical decomposition mechanism named KE-layer structure of general graphs is proposed to reveal the complexity of vertex-cover. To achieve the graphical representation and hierarchical decomposition, an algorithm to verify the KE graph is given by the solution space expression of vertex-cover, and the relation between multi-layer KE graphs and maximal matching is illustrated and proved. Furthermore, a framework to calculate the KE-layer number and approximate the minimal vertex-cover is provided, with different strategies of switching nodes and counting energy. The phase transition phenomenon between different KE-layers is studied with the transition points located, and searching of vertex-cover got by this strategy presents comparable advantage against several other methods. Its efficiency outperforms the existing ones just before the transition point. The graphical representation and hierarchical decomposition provide a new perspective to illustrate the structural organisations of graphs better, and its formation mechanism can help reveal the intrinsic complexity and establish heuristic strategy for large-scale graphs/systems recognition.},

Our model enables that individuals gradually increase the tendency to loneliness or defection in the face of unfriendly people, and increase the tendency to cooperation in the face of friendly people. By simulations, we further show that both direct emotional interaction and memory have the effect of enhancing the competitive advantage of cooperators and individuals with friendly emotions. Besides, the proportion of friendly groups increases if the degree of direct emotional interaction increases. Also, the impact of memory on cooperation has a non-monotonic characteristic. As a result, direct emotional interaction with memory effect leads to the improvement of social average favorability, increases the number of friendly populations, improves the overall level of social cooperation, and enables friendly people to gain advantages in evolution. Therefore, our work contributes to understanding the role of emotional factors in the evolution of social cooperation.},

We analyze the learning performance by studying the phase diagram in terms of the training set size, the dataset noise and the inference temperature (i.e. the weight regularization). With a small but informative dataset the machine can learn by memorization. With a noisy dataset, an extensive number of examples above a critical threshold is needed. In this regime the memory storage limits become an opportunity for the occurrence of a learning regime in which the system can generalize.},

Our goal is to study the influence of the resource-limited environment on performance measures related to hospital operations, such as the time until the ward reaches its maximum capacity, the number of critical events —occurring when the hospital ward reaches its maximum capacity—, the time that limited healthcare facilities should be continuously active, or the economic impact of administering therapeutic treatments, which could be evaluated in terms of the number of admissions and the number of treatments provided in the case of reinfection.},

Previous works mainly focused on the task allocation problem in a population of individuals, where there are no constraints for affording task amounts. The latter condition, however, cannot always be hold. In this paper, we study the task allocation problem with constraints of task allocation in a game-theoretical framework. We assume that each individual can afford different amounts of task and the cost function is convex. To investigate the problem in the framework of population games, we construct a potential game and calculate the fitness function for each individual. We prove that when the Nash equilibrium point in the potential game is in the feasible solutions for the limited task allocation problem, the Nash equilibrium point is the unique globally optimal solution. Otherwise, we also derive analytically the unique globally optimal solution. In addition, in order to confirm our theoretical results, we consider the exponential and quadratic forms of cost function for each agent. Two algorithms with the mentioned representative cost functions are proposed to numerically seek the optimal solution to the limited task problems. We further perform Monte Carlo simulations which provide agreeing results with our analytical calculations.},

Based on the round-robin protocol and multiple description encoding-decoding scheme, a distributed recursive filtering is derived to estimate the states of complex networks.

  abstract     = {Closed combustion devices like gas turbines and rockets are prone to thermoacoustic instabilities. Design engineers in the industry need tools to accurately identify and remove instabilities early in the design cycle. Many different approaches have been developed by the researchers over the years. In this work we focus on the Helmholtz wave equation based solver which is found to be relatively fast and accurate for most applications. This solver has been a subject of study in many previous works. The Helmholtz wave equation in frequency space reduces to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem which needs to be solved to compute the acoustic modes. Most previous implementations of this solver have relied on linearized solvers and iterative methods which as shown in this work are not very efficient and sometimes inaccurate. In this work we make use of specialized algorithms implemented in SLEPc that are accurate and efficient for computing eigenvalues of nonlinear eigenvalue problems. We make use of the n-tau model to compute the reacting source terms in the Helmholtz equation and describe the steps involved in deriving the Helmholtz eigenvalue equation and obtaining its solution using the SLEPc library.},

A specific focus is placed on the investigation of how individuals can obtain labor subsidies through the implementation of reward and punishment strategies based on taxation. The findings reveal that a moderate labor subsidy value fosters stable alliances between cooperators and executors, effectively excluding defectors, and this system remains robust under high tax levels. Additionally, it is noted that only the incentive provided by the reward mechanism can facilitate the invasion of defectors. Intuitively, the presence of a corruption mechanism exerts minimal influence on the average level of individual behavior when executors receive increased labor subsidies.},

HP-splines are hyperpolic-polynomial penalized splines where polynomials are replaced by the richer class of exponential-polynomials and a tailored discrete penalty term is used. HP-splines reduce to P-splines when setting the frequency parameter to zero but are more suitable to data with an exponential trend, which are frequently encountered in applications. Yet, they require an effective strategy to select the frequency parameter in addition to the one needed for selecting the smoothing parameter. Here, we propose a strategy that involves a linear algebra approach for Tikhonov regularization problems adapted to HP-splines. As shown in the numerical experiments, our strategy provides an efficient criterion yielding to HP-splines that better capture the trend suggested by the fitted data.},

The phase-field model is used to describe the characteristics of both the surface and interior of an object, allowing us to represent the 3D mesh model with noise using a phase-field function. By using the phase separation property of the AC equation and the fidelity term, the model can effectively preserve the original structures and features during the smoothing process, even in the presence of noise in various regions. The modified AC equation is numerically discretized using the explicit finite difference method , where the values at neighboring grid points are used as Dirichlet boundary conditions . Because the algorithm is local and explicit, it guarantees both effective denoising of 3D mesh models and rapid implementation speed. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we conduct various computational experiments. Furthermore, we propose an implicit-explicit numerical scheme using the Crank–Nicolson method to address the denoising problem of 3D mesh models and perform related experiments.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between phytoplankton and zooplankton has a significant impact on the marine ecology. The interplay between these two species is the building blocks for most of the food webs operating in an aquatic ecosphere. The environmental toxins released by different external sources also affect the phytoplankton-zooplankton dynamics. In the present study, we propose a model to explore the kinetics of a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-environmental toxins (NPZT) system. The defence mechanism of phytoplankton against zooplankton is reflected through modified Holling type IV response, whereas the consumption of nutrients by phytoplankton is outlined by Holling type II response. The external toxins are assumed to have the capability of reducing the birth rate of phytoplankton species after coming into contact with their cells. To make our model more pragmatic, seasonal variation in the parameters is also taken into account. Firstly, we do the analysis related to the autonomous model (non-seasonal) like; its boundedness , existence of equilibrium points , their stability analysis, and occurrence of Hopf-bifurcation. Further, for the non-autonomous model (seasonal), we analyze the existence of positive periodic solution and its global stability. Through numerical simulations, we observe that for the non-seasonal model, increasing the rate of suppressing phytoplankton’s growth by environmental toxin, and rate at which environmental toxin is added to system make it unstable through Hopf-bifurcation. These oscillations can be removed by raising phytoplankton’s inhibitory effect against zooplankton, and this increment also leads to the extinction of the zooplankton population, making zooplankton free equilibrium a stable one. Both models, non-seasonal as well as seasonal manifest different types of multistability, and this is an exciting character associated with non-linear models. We also note that the inclusion of seasonality in our system promotes the coexistence of all populations. Further, through numerical simulations, we show that making some of the parameters seasonal can cause the emergence of chaos in the system. To verify chaos, we sketch the Poincaré map and evaluate the maximum Lyapunov exponent . The seasonal model also shows the switching of stability through different periodic and chaotic windows on varying the maximum intrinsic growth rate for phytoplankton, and contact rate between environmental toxin and phytoplankton. To substantiate our results, we picture several time-series graphs, basins of attraction , one and two-parametric bifurcation diagrams. Thus we expect that the present work can assist biologists and mathematicians in studying nutrient-plankton systems in a more detailed and realistic manner. This study can also help researchers in the estimation of non-seasonal as well as seasonal parameters while studying these types of complex non-linear models. Therefore, the present work seems to be enriched from a mathematical and biological point of view.},

At the first, using convex hull properties, an observer-based controller is designed and then a generalized event-triggering mechanism is regarded. In order to extend more time interval between any two successive events, an adaptive event-triggered control method is also proposed. The proposed control methodology is based on finite-gain L 2 stability. It is noteworthy that the proposed methods are designed in a co-design framework where the observer-based controller design with the event-triggering mechanisms are performed at the same time. Moreover, the presented adaptive approach offers more degrees of freedom as well as preserves the performance criteria high. Besides, Zeno avoidance analysis is studied by introducing a lower bound on inter-event times. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed methods is shown through a case-study numerical example .},

  abstract     = {In evolutionary game theory , the emergence and maintenance of group cooperative behavior is usually challenged by the lure of high-payoff defection behavior.Recently, besides imitation rules, the adaptive ability of individuals under limited information is also the key to adjust strategies, for example, individuals based on reinforcement learning rules by judging whether previous performance is satisfactory. In realistic scenarios, individuals with rich experience usually lead those who are inexperienced and play a guiding role in the group. Here we propose a multi-guider game model. Players on each layer of the network play different roles and follow different strategy update rules. Specifically, guiders use reinforcement learning rules to update their strategies in the upper network, and guided players use payoff-based imitation rules to update their strategies in the lower network. As the evolution progresses, guided players in the lower layer begin to reference the experienced guiders in the upper layer to update their strategies. A large number of Monte Carlo simulation results show that inexperienced individuals in the group are able to learn from the experience of others with the experienced guidance of multiple guiders. In addition to the improvement of group decision-making, the cooperative behavior can also be maintained at a higher level in the simulation of social dilemma.},

  abstract     = {The increasing number of online ties created on social platforms has made our social relations and influences more complex and diverse. This paper proposes a multilayer-like network model for rumor spreading that incorporates both strong and weak relations. Two types of fixed topologies are used to describe strong relations, while the activity-driven model is employed for weak relations. The model also takes into consideration the differential propagation abilities of individuals. The rumor spreading thresholds are theoretically derived using mean-field theory and an approximation method, which are consistent with simulation results. Results indicate that differences in individuals’ strong relations significantly influence rumor spreading. Specifically, when the strong relation structure is a heterogeneous network, the density of rumor spreaders reaches equilibrium in a shorter time, and the final density of rumor spreaders is higher. However, when the strong relation structure is a homogeneous network and individuals’ activity rates are negatively correlated with their propagation abilities, rumor spreading is easier. Interestingly, the opposite result is obtained when the strong relation structure is a heterogeneous network. Additionally, individuals’ propagation abilities and weak relations can affect the final density of rumor spreaders, but the effects are not identical.},

To tackle the issue posed by the switched event-triggered communication mechanism and network attacks, a distributed filter with switching signal is introduced. Additionally, considering the mismatched behavior between switched systems and distributed filters caused by the event-triggered communication mechanism and network attacks, a piecewise vector modal function which considers all switching conditions is proposed for handling the problem of the sensor network’s filtering error system containing multiple switching signals. By utilizing the multiple Lyapunov functional method and the average dwell time switching mechanism, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the filtering error system with synchronous and asynchronous modes is both finite-time bounded and satisfies the H ∞ H∞ performance index. Finally, an example is presented to demonstrate the validity of the results.},

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an interconnected group of nodes -where activation functions act- organized in numbered layers. From a mathematical point of view, an ANN represents a combination of activation functions that is linear if only one hidden layer is admitted. In the present paper, the ELMs setting is considered, and this gives that a single hidden layer is admitted and that the ANN can be trained at a modest computational cost as compared to Deep Learning Neural Networks. Our approach addresses the time evolution by applying classical ODEs techniques and uses ELM-based collocation for solving the resulting stationary elliptic problems. In this framework, the θ θ -method and Backward Differentiation Formulae (BDF) techniques are investigated on some linear parabolic PDEs that are challenging problems for the stability and accuracy properties of the methods. The results of numerical experiments confirm that ELM-based solution techniques combined with BDF methods can provide high-accuracy solutions of parabolic PDEs.},

Meanwhile, a choice scheme based on the Pareto front is introduced to obtain an optimum power distribution that the DoS attackers expect to be consistent. A Stackelberg game frame is developed to simulate the interactions among DoS attackers and agents. Sufficient conditions that can achieve stability and consistency for NMAS are proposed.

  abstract     = {The replicator dynamics of two-player evolutionary games with delays are examined. In contrast to situations with a common delay, we examine the resulting stability for the situation where the delays on the cost contributions to the payoff may be different from the delays on the benefit contributions to the payoff. In such scenarios we show that increasing one delay, while holding the other constant, can lead to conditions where the increasing delay causes instability, yet further increases in the delay can bring back stability, while still further increases in the delay can lead to instability again, and so on. This is in contrast to the case where costs and benefits share a common delay, in which case we show that only a simple destabilization can occur with an increasing delay. We develop a Hopf bifurcation analysis of this phenomenon for a general version of evolutionary games that have a stable mixed strategy equilibrium in the nominal (no delay) case. From the Hopf bifurcation analysis we show conditions under which the stabilizing and destabilizing phenomena occur. We then illustrate the results by applying them to specific examples of both a snowdrift game and a division of labor game. Numerical examples are presented to validate the analysis claims.},

As an intermediate approach, quasi-cooperators were recently suggested to address the original problem. In this study, we test its vitality in structured populations where players have fixed partners. Naively, the latter condition should support cooperation unambiguously via enhanced network reciprocity. However, the opposite is true because the spatial structure may provide a humbler cooperation level than a well-mixed population. This unexpected behavior can be understood if we consider that at a certain parameter interval the original prisoner’s dilemma game is transformed into a snow-drift game. If we replace the original imitating strategy protocol by assuming myopic players, the spatial population becomes a friendly environment for cooperation. This observation is valid in a huge region of parameter space. This study highlights that spatial structure can reveal a new aspect of social dilemmas when strategy complexity is introduced.},

In order to investigate the effects of various factors such as random noise and air pollution control on respiratory diseases, we developed deterministic and stochastic two-dimensional coupled SIS models with multiple control measures. The proposed models and parameter estimation methods, including determinations of unknown parameter values, were used to fit the Air Quality Index (AQI) data for Xi’an city in recent 10 years. The existence of the optimal solutions for the deterministic and stochastic models were analyzed theoretically and provided to compare the parameter fitting solutions with the optimal solutions, and give theoretical support for seeking a more reasonable air pollution optimization prevention and control scheme. To show this, we conducted numerical simulations of the optimal control solution and state evolution trajectories under different weight coefficient ratios and control objectives . The results show that the stochastic optimal control problem is more consistent with the practical scenario. We also formulate the optimal control problem assuming that the control variable depends on the concentration of air pollutants. The optimal control solution reflected the periodic variation of the air pollution control strategy well. A comparison of cost values for different combinations of the three control measures illustrated that air pollution reduction is the most effective control measure.},

  abstract     = {Using a residuum approach, we provide a complete description of the space of the rational spatial curves of given tangent directions . The rational Pythagorean hodograph curves are obtained as a special case when the norm of the direction field is a perfect square. The basis for the curve space is given explicitly. Consequently a number of interpolation problems ( G 1 G1 , C 1 C1 , C 2 C2 , C 1 / G 2 C1/G2 ) in this space become linear, cusp avoidance can be encoded by linear inequalities , and optimization problems like minimal energy or optimal length are quadratic and can be solved efficiently via quadratic programming . We outline the interpolation/optimization strategy and demonstrate it on several examples.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical models are increasingly being adapted to model criminal behaviour and may be used to support traditional crime prevention methods. This review focuses on recent efforts to model criminal behaviour associated with gangs, delinquency, terrorism and corruption via modified infectious disease compartmental models. Similar to their disease counterparts, models are based on the premise that these behaviours are contagious, spread through association/contact with delinquent peers. Models are classified by the functions used to describe contact rates, by their use of optimal control techniques and by their country of origin. An examination of the functions used to describe contact rates showed that the majority of these models used either a mass action or a standard incidence contact rate, with mass action being more prevalent. Models that incorporated optimal control techniques, specifically utilized Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle with a quadratic control on the objective function to determine mitigation strategies. The most effective strategy was generally found to be an early prevention approach through education and awareness. When models were distinguished by their country of origin, it was observed that most of the models were formulated for, or in, developing nations. In addition to reviewing models, challenges involved in the modelling process are highlighted.},

Then, to avoid the effect of function perturbation on the strong reconstructibility of BCNs, the problem of adding a minimal sensor set is considered, thereby making the BCNs robust minimal strong reconstructible after function perturbation.

These analogs are not only balls in the monoid of strings but also regular languages. Since the Levenshtein distance, a reasonable metric between strings, was introduced in 1965, researchers have aimed to determine a formula for computing the volumes of balls of strings under this distance and their growth rate. However, this problem remains open. In this paper, we first derive a formula for the volumes of balls of strings under a metric obtained by extending the Hamming distance as a metric on the whole monoid and subsequently reveal the growth rate of balls of strings under the Levenshtein distance using this formula. Furthermore, we describe a conjecture on the formula for the volumes of spheres of strings under the Levenshtein distance. Next, we construct an efficient randomized algorithm that computes estimates of the volumes of the balls whose estimation errors are less than a given value with a probability greater than a specified value. Finally, we examine the validity of the proposed conjecture, using the (true) volumes obtained by exhaustive searches for small spheres and estimates of the volumes obtained by this algorithm for large ones.},

However, measuring the morality of various IPD strategies is still largely lacking. Here, we partially address this issue by proposing a suit of plausible morality metrics to quantify four aspects of justice. We focus our closed-form calculation on the class of reactive strategies because of their mathematical tractability and expressive power. We define reactive means as a tool for studying how actors in the IPD and Iterated Snowdrift Game (ISG) behave under typical circumstances. We compute reactive means for four functions intended to capture human intuitions about “goodness” and “fair play”. Two of these functions are strongly anticorrelated with success in the IPD and ISG, and the other two are weakly anticorrelated with success. Our results will aid in evaluating and comparing powerful IPD strategies based on machine learning algorithms, using simple and intuitive morality metrics.},

However, although there exist a significant amount of results on fast finite time stability, there is no article involves p-norm stochastic nonlinear systems case available so far. There are random disturbance terms that made the traditional fast finite-time control methods inapplicable. To overcome this problem, we establish a fast finite-time control criterion for stochastic systems by revamping the fast finite time method of deterministic systems. Then, with the aid of sign function and adding a power integrator technology, a non-Lipschitz continuous state feedback controller is established successfully. Next, the control strategy can effectively improve the control speed compared to the existing results in this paper. Finally, numerical and dynamic suspension simulations are offered to augment our theoretical analysis results, and comparison plots with conventional control strategies are shown.},

Based on a parameter extraction mapping, several feasible criteria are presented for original and weak disturbance decoupling of BNs and BCNs.

We use a parametric representation of the space curves and subdivide the profile into smaller portions that can be fitted with regular curves. We provide theoretical guarantees to the existence of such an approximation and an algorithm for the profile approximation. We take advantage of the implicit function theorem to locally project a space curve on at most two planes and to locally recognise it with a low-degree polynomial curve obtained by applying the Hough transform. Finally, we recombine the curve expressions on the two planes backwards in the space R 3 R3 . The outcome of the algorithm is thus a piecewise polynomial curve approximating the profile.

In the existing methods using reinforcement learning, a design method of structured controllers has not been studied. In this paper, we propose reward design methods to derive reduced-order controllers and pinning controllers. The key idea is to adjust the structure of controllers by the reward for the structure of the Q Q -table. The advantage of the proposed method is that implementation is easy, because the proposed method can be embedded in the existing Q -learning-based stabilization algorithm. In design of pinning controllers, we can calculate not only controllers but also pinning nodes in which the control input is assigned. We demonstrate through numerical examples that the controller obtained from our proposed method is simpler than that from the existing method.},

The method is applicable to both steady state and transient problems. However, we have considered here only steady state heat conduction in complex domains. The polyharmonic spline (PHS) function with appended polynomial of prescribed degree is used for discretization. Flux balance condition must be satisfied at the interface points and the clouds of interpolation points are restricted to be within respective domains. Compared with previously proposed meshless algorithms with domain decomposition, the cloud-based interpolations are numerically better conditioned, and achieve high accuracy through the appended polynomial. The accuracy of the algorithm is demonstrated in several two and three dimensional problems using manufactured solutions with sharp discontinuity in thermal conductivity. Subsequently, we demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm to solve heat conduction in complex domains with practical boundary conditions and internal heat generation. Systematic computations with varying conductivity ratios, interpoint spacing and polynomial degree are performed to investigate the accuracy of the algorithm.},

The method involves its derivatives approximations at the grid points and the construction of structural equations deriving from the kernels of a matrix that gathers the variables belonging to a small stencil. Numerical schemes involve combinations of physical equations and the structural relations. We have analysed the spectral resolution of the most common structural equations and performed numerical tests to address both the stability and accuracy issues for popular linear and non-linear problems. Several benchmarks are presented that ensure that the developed technology can cope with several problems that may involve non-linearity.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider a high-order discretization of compressible viscous flows allowing parallelization both in space and time. The discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method, which is well-suited for massively parallel simulations, is used for spatial discretization. The main novelty in this work is the additional demonstration of time-parallel capabilities within an implicit two-derivative timestepping procedure to further increase the parallel speedup. Temporal parallelism is made possible by a predictor-corrector-type time discretization that allows to split the associated workload onto multiple processors. We identify a homogeneous load balance with respect to the linear (GMRES) iterations on each processor as a key for parallel efficiency. To homogenize the load and to enable practical simulations, an adaptive strategy for Newton’s method is introduced. It is shown that the time-parallel method provides a parallel efficiency of approx. 60 − 70 % 60−70% on 4 − 7 4−7 computational partitions. Moreover, the capabilities of the novel method for the simulation of large-scale problems are illustrated with a mixed temporal and spatial parallelization on more than 1000 processors.},

We construct the stochastic solution; first, in the pathwise sense by using the Laplace-transform method, and second, in the mean-square sense by applying Banach fixed-point theorem. The probability density function, that is associated to the solution of a chain of length three, is computed in the present work by a transformation method. Continuity of this density with respect to the fractional order, in the pointwise and in the total variation sense, is investigated.

With the help of the property of Gaussian function , the barriers produced by the non-strict feedback terms and partial sensor faults are handled. Moreover, the prescribed performance on measured synchronization error is considered by designing a finite-time performance function. By introducing normalization signals and adjusting parameters, the problems caused by input unmodeled dynamics are resolved. The compensation signals and normalization signals are integrated into the whole Lyapunov function in the stability analysis. All the variables in the controlled system are turned out to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Meanwhile, the synchronization errors never exceed to predefined boundary.

Most of existing approximate methods for solving such kind PIDEs are unbalanced, since most work have used a low order scheme for integrating the temporal variable and a high order numerical framework for discretization of space variables. The current paper contributes to a space-time spectral-order Sinc-collocation method which is balanced in both time and space variables. In order to deal with the initial singularity of solution in the time direction, the Sinc-collocation method with single exponential (SE) transformation is used for the first time, which is an effective method to deal with the singularity of the equation. Also, we fully analyse the error bounds of the method which show the exponential convergence rate in space and time. Meanwhile, we consider several test problems for examining the suggested scheme. The experiment results highlight a good precision of the new Sinc-colloction method and the correctness of the theoretical prediction for this kind nonlocal heat problems.},

  abstract     = {In this work we propose tailored model order reduction for varying boundary optimal control problems governed by parametric partial differential equations . With varying boundary control, we mean that a specific parameter changes where the boundary control acts on the system. This peculiar formulation might benefit from model order reduction. Indeed, fast and reliable simulations of this model can be of utmost usefulness in many applied fields , such as geophysics and energy engineering. However, varying boundary control features very complicated and diversified parametric behaviour for the state and adjoint variables. The state solution , for example, changing the boundary control parameter , might feature transport phenomena. Moreover, the problem loses its affine structure. It is well known that classical model order reduction techniques fail in this setting, both in accuracy and in efficiency. Thus, we propose reduced approaches inspired by the ones used when dealing with wave-like phenomena. Indeed, we compare standard proper orthogonal decomposition with two tailored strategies: geometric recasting and local proper orthogonal decomposition. Geometric recasting solves the optimization system in a reference domain simplifying the problem at hand avoiding hyper-reduction, while local proper orthogonal decomposition builds local bases to increase the accuracy of the reduced solution in very general settings (where geometric recasting is unfeasible). We compare the various approaches on two different numerical experiments based on geometries of increasing complexity.},

The purpose of this study is to build a set-membership estimator for the considered system with redundant channels in the insecure network environment that limits the state estimate error to a predetermined ellipsoidal area. By employing the set-membership method with the mathematical induction technique, sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee the expected estimated performance. In addition, an optimization algorithm is further provided to ensure locally optimal estimation performance. Finally, a numerical simulation of the suggested set-membership estimation technique is presented to demonstrate its usefulness.},

A time-varying prescribed-time super-twisting extended state observer is constructed for each robot to estimate the total disturbance of its dynamics. Different from the traditional active disturbance rejection control, the total disturbance is allowed to contain some nonsmooth component. Based on it, a formation control method with prescribed-time convergence is developed for the follower to realize the formation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through two experiments.},

  abstract     = {A stochastic method is described for estimating Green’s functions (GF’s), appropriate to linear advection-diffusion-reaction transport problems, evolving in arbitrary geometries. By allowing straightforward construction of approximate, though high-accuracy GF’s, within any geometry, the technique solves the central challenge in obtaining Green’s function solutions. In contrast to Monte Carlo solutions of individual transport problems, subject to specific sets of conditions and forcing, the proposed technique produces approximate GF’s that can be used: a) to obtain (infinite) sets of solutions, subject to any combination of (random and deterministic) boundary, initial, and internal forcing, b) as high fidelity direct models in inverse problems, and c) as high quality process models in thermal and mass transport design, optimization, and process control problems. The technique exploits an equivalence between the adjoint problem governing the transport problem Green’s function, G ( x , t | x ′ , t ′ ) G(x,t|x′,t′) , and the backward Kolmogorov problem governing the transition density, p ( x , t | x ′ , t ′ ) p(x,t|x′,t′) , of the stochastic process used in Green’s function construction. We address nonspecialists and report four contributions. First, a recipe is outlined for diagnosing when stochastic Green’s function estimation can be used, and for subsequently estimating the transition density and associated Green’s function. Second, a naive estimator for the transition density is proposed and tested. Third, Green’s function estimation error produced by random walker absorption at Dirichlet boundaries is suppressed using a simple random walker splitting technique. Last, spatial discontinuity in estimated GF’s, produced by the naive estimator, is suppressed using a simple area averaging method. The paper provides guidance on choosing key numerical parameters, and the technique is tested against two simple unsteady, linear heat conduction problems, and an unsteady groundwater dispersion problem, each having known, exact GF’s.},

Recently, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has attracted a growing interest as a learning algorithm. This technique captures the latent information embedded in large datasets while preserving feature properties. NMF can be formalized as a penalized optimization task in which tuning the penalty hyperparameters is an open issue. The current literature does not provide any general framework addressing this task. This study proposes to express the penalty hyperparameters problem in NMF in terms of a bi-level optimization. We design a novel algorithm, named Alternating Bi-level (AltBi), which incorporates the hyperparameters tuning procedure into the updates of NMF factors. Results of the existence and convergence of numerical solutions, under appropriate assumptions, are studied, and numerical experiments are provided.},

In these areas, there is an urgent need to apply mechanisms to stimulate sustainable practices. This paper studies the most efficient strategy to incentivize sustainable tourism by using an asymmetric evolutionary game. We analyze the application of rewarding policies to the asymmetric game where tourists and stakeholders interact in a spatial lattice, and where tourists can also migrate. The incentives of the rewarding policies have an economic budget which can be allocated to tourists, to stakeholders, or to both sub-populations. The results show that an adaptive rewarding strategy, where the incentive budget changes over time to one or the other sub-population, is more effective than simple rewarding strategies that are exclusively focused on one sub-population. However, when the population density in the game decreases, rewarding just tourists becomes the most effective strategy.},

The main goal is to define specific and distinctive features for this noise source that enable the identification of the acquisition sensor by simply analysing a few images. These features are required to be independent of image size, modifications, storage mode, etc. The discrimination power of the decreasing rearrangement of a function, combined with the Radon transform, has been investigated in this paper. Preliminary tests show that a proper rearrangement of PRNU image provides specific and device-dependent geometric structures that can be properly coded through the Radon transform. In particular, the empirical distribution of the Radon Transform of rearranged Flat Field images alone is capable to correctly characterize each device with high accuracy, showing robusteness to some standard image modifications, such as quantization and blurring; in addition, it guarantees independence of image size.},

  abstract     = {External supervision services play an important role in combating corruption by detecting potential collusive bribery. This work aims at studying the dynamics of collusive bribery when participants have the option of engaging the external supervision services. To do so, we construct a basic model where collusive bribery can happen between the defecting participants who aim to escape from a punishment by offering a bribe to rule enforcers who monitor interactions among all participants. Among rule enforcers, only the corrupt ones accept the bribe and ignore the violations. The cooperative participants can engage the external supervision service at a certain cost to avoid the risk of potential collusive bribery. Under the framework of evolutionary game theory , we find that a higher initial fraction of honest enforcers is more likely to lead to a trusting cooperating equilibrium. We also find that, when allowing random exploration of available strategies, increasing the exploration rate of rule enforcers is effective in combating corruption for both infinite and finite populations. Lastly, we find that minimizing the cost of external supervision services is not always good. When the system evolves into a cooperating equilibrium, a low cost of external supervision service induces unnecessary costs of seeking external supervision. When the strategy profiles exhibit stable oscillations, there exists an optimal cost of external supervision, considering the trade-off between minimizing the chance of exposing cooperative participants to collusive bribery and strengthening the punishment on the corrupt enforcers. Premised on the results, we discuss practical management suggestions.},

  abstract     = {The network connectivities play an important role in displaying the vastly different collective dynamics in many complex systems. To demonstrate the presence of different dynamical states and their transition, we consider Hindmarsh-Rose neurons, which are linked up by electromagnetic interactions. The dynamical behaviors of the proposed system are specifically explored under three distinct network connectivities: Regular(RG), small-world (SW), and random (RAND) interactions. We discover that increasing coupling intensity illustrates the dynamical transition from the desynchronization state to the traveling wave state for all the considered network interactions. Particularly, the regular network shows the emergence of spatial symmetric patterns that transit to a homogeneous steady state while increasing the strength of magnetic field interaction. In addition, the transition from an asymmetric pattern to an in-homogeneous steady state is noticed for small-world and random networks. The investigation is then extended to a three-layer multiplex network in which nodes interact electromagnetically within (intra-) layers and magnetically between (inter-) layers, since many complex networks in the real world have large numbers of nodes organized (or located) in different subnetworks. We show that increasing the coupling intensity leads to synchronization in all layers and, eventually, a rest state at high coupling strength.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the singular value decomposition (SVD) of Σ + x y H Σ+xyH , where Σ Σ is an m × n m×n real diagonal matrix , x ∈ C m x∈Cm , and y ∈ C n y∈Cn . We start by briefly revisiting an existing approach for determining the desired SVD by sequentially computing the eigendecomposition of two separate hermitian rank-one modifications of a real diagonal matrix. Then we introduce the notion of the rank-two secular function whose roots are the singular values of Σ + x y H Σ+xyH and exploit its properties to bound each root/singular value in disjoint intervals . Once the singular values are computed, we demonstrate how to directly compute the full set of associated left/right singular vectors ultimately giving us a new method for computing the SVD of Σ + x y H Σ+xyH in O ( min ( m , n ) 2 ) O(min(m,n)2) time.},

  abstract     = {In the paper, we describe the transfer of patients in the healthcare system by SIS-type equations coupled by impulses at fixed times. The first aim for these considerations is to provide a rigorous mathematical analysis of a general theoretical model, which incorporates the structure of patients’ transfers. Based on theoretical results, we disprove the intuitions taken from decoupled systems, showing a damping of infection in the case when the transmission rate is locally higher than the recovery rate. Observations on network suppression of pathogen spread allow us to indicate units prone to the high prevalence and propose, possibly low-cost, interventions reducing the infection spread in a whole system. Core results combine the dynamical and structural properties of a system. Finally, we consider a model of the transmission of hospital-acquired multidrug-resistant bacteriae infections, based on real patient hospital records provided by the German insurance company – AOK Lower Saxony, to ilustrate the theoretical considerations.},

  abstract     = {The networked evolutionary game theory makes investigations on how the emergence of cooperative behaviors in the real world possible. Many researches based on costly punishment have found profound achievements. However, the order of punishment and timely update of payoff in the process of punishment do not get much attention. Therefore, based on the above deficiencies, we study a revenge-based prisoner’s dilemma game on square-lattice and small-world networks to explore how it affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperation behaviors on complex networks. In simulations, we exhibit the evolution of the cooperation frequency as the population processes and probe the effects of the loss function, the number of players updating strategies, the cost-to-benefit ratio, and network size on the cooperation frequency, and further demonstrate the evolution of the number of revengers and sufferers over time, which may help to understand the role of them played in networks. By varying corresponding revenge parameters, our proposed mechanism helps to overcome social dilemmas. Moreover, we find the phenomenon that the cooperation frequency declines and then rises in small-world networks under certain conditions, which we validate from the variance of the numbers of revengers and sufferers over time. Our work may help to illuminate the study of evolutionary games with revengers and sufferers.},

The model involves a nonconservative term, which often makes standard schemes difficult to approximate solutions in certain regions. The scheme to be presented is a development of the preliminary works that will be cited below. Our foremost purpose is to extend those results to two-dimensional formalism while preserving the physical and mathematical properties, including the well-balancedness. The proposed scheme is applied to some specific families of solutions, especially lake at rest and partially well-balanced solution. The numerical results show that this approach can give a good accuracy, except for resonant cases . Furthermore, it is proved that our finite volume scheme can preserve the C C -property in the sense that it can capture exactly the lake at rest solution.},

Bearing this dilemma in view, in this paper, the Janbu method is optimized and reformulated by introducing adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). The fractional average safety factor is no longer used; instead, a sequence of safety factors is used. The critical slip state is chosen as the equilibrium point, the nonlinearity of safety coefficients of adjacent blocks is approximated by the neural network, and the remaining variables and constraints of the system are added to assist in transforming the original redundant safety coefficient evaluation-finding optimal solution problem into a Janbu-qualified cost function. The action network and critic network of ADP accomplish the boundary trajectory solving and safety evaluation, respectively. The validity of the method is verified when the optimized and reorganized framework is applied to solve the critical slip surface of a clay slope.},

In this paper we introduce the dGLI Cloth Coordinates , a finite low-dimensional representation of cloth states that allows us to efficiently distinguish a large variety of different folded states, opening the door to efficient learning methods for cloth manipulation planning and control. Our representation is based on a directional derivative of the Gauss Linking Integral and allows us to represent spatial as well as planar folded configurations in a consistent and unified way. The proposed dGLI Cloth Coordinates are shown to be more accurate in the representation of cloth states and significantly more sensitive to changes in grasping affordances than other classic shape distance methods. Finally, we apply our representation to real images of a cloth, showing that with it we can identify the different states using a distance-based classifier.},

It is well know that the accuracy of multiquadric interpolation depends on the choice of the shape parameter. In addition, in [6], it was shown that the use of data-dependent strategies in the selection of the shape parameter leads to more accurate reconstructions. We shall show that our local adaptive estimates of the shape parameters lead to non-separable, fully 2D, reconstruction strategies that lead, in turn, to efficient compression algorithms.},

We study the properties that an L–system should have to be the suitable descriptor of a subdivision refinement process. We derive subdivision masks to construct the regular parts of the subdivision surface as cubic B-spline patches. Finally, we describe stencils for the extraordinary vertices, which after a few steps become stationary, so that the scheme can be studied through simple eigenanalysis.

Specifically, the method is that the investigation on any given robust property of any given PBCN with probability one can be equivalently transformed into the investigation on the given robust property of the corresponding Boolean control network (BCN). Note that the PBCN has time-varying probability distribution and the property can be set according to the needs of specific problems. As an application of the method, we study the robust set stabilization with probability one of PBCNs with positive time-varying probability distribution. We derive the results through a discussion of the robust set stabilization of the corresponding BCNs. Also, we characterize all of the time-optimal robust set stabilizers of the PBCNs. A reduced disturbed PBCN model of the lac operon in the Escherichia coli is provided to show the effectiveness of the achieved results.},

  abstract     = {Low-order elements are widely used and preferred for finite element analysis , specifically the three-node triangular and four-node tetrahedral elements, both based on linear polynomials in barycentric coordinates . They are known, however, to under-perform when nearly incompressible materials are involved. The problem may be circumvented by the use of higher degree polynomial elements, but their application become both more complex an computationally expensive. For this reason, non-polynomial enriched finite element methods have been proposed for solving engineering problems. In line with previous researches, the main contribution of this paper is to present a general strategy for enriching the standard simplicial linear finite element by non-polynomial functions. A key role is played by a characterization result, given in terms of the non-vanishing of a certain determinant, which provides necessary and sufficient conditions , on the enrichment functions and functionals, that guarantee the existence of families of such enriched elements. We show that the enriched basis functions admit a closed form representation in terms of enrichment functions and functionals. Finally, we provide concrete examples of admissible enrichment functions and perform some numerical tests.},

Consider the state unavailability of MASs with unknown nonlinear terms, the unmeasurable state is estimated by designing the neural-networks(NNs)-based observer. Then, a fully distributed intrusion-tolerant adaptive protocol is developed to implement the consensus control task. The designed control strategy only involves the agent states that interact with the neighboring agent and does not relate to the whole communication topology information. The designed controller can ensure that the consensus error of the nonlinear MASs is eventually ultimately bounded under deception attacks. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to verify the feasibility of the designed scheme.},

Next, a controller depending on the observer is built to capture the OT performance and the multiple disturbance restrain performance. The designed controller not only combines the disturbance estimation and the output error, but also takes advantage of the available signal to be tracked.

  abstract     = {In ecosystems, species are willing to stay longer when they are in good environments and, in this regard, explaining biodiversity and understanding the relative effect of species’ behavior is a fundamental issue in ecological sciences. Staying or moving stands for the movement of the population, and mobility has been accepted as one of the important mechanisms in systems of cyclic competition. In this paper, we investigate the biodiversity in the system of cyclic competition when an individual’s mobility is affected by environmental fitness. We found that fitness-based mobility, which is defined by the ratio of the difference between predator and prey among species, can lead to the slow behavior of species when local fitness is higher than the average fitness and enhance the biodiversity of species. The fitness-based mobility behavior is successful in reducing the extinction probability on the lattice network. However, when the average degree of the network increases, the extinction probability increases significantly. In addition, when we consider the same model on heterogeneous networks, the extinction probability is always 1 regardless of the sensitivity to the fitness. The finding indicates that the heterogeneous network destroys species coexistence. Through extensive numerical investigations, we provided solid evidence supporting the great importance of fitness-based mobility in maintaining biodiversity. We further highlighted the significant relationship among fitness, the fraction of empty sites, and the tunable parameter by investigating the correlation that the relationship is not influenced by mobility.},

Previous studies have focused on a single strategy updating but ignored the impact of environmental stochasticity and individual preference. In this paper, we study the evolutionary cooperation dynamics combining imitation and super-rational aspiration induced strategy updating in well-mixed finite populations. That is, individuals can no longer use a single update, but can choose to use imitation updating or super-rational aspiration induced strategy updating (i.e. mixed strategy updating). The closed-form expression of the fixation probability under arbitrary selection intensity is given, the approximate expression of the cooperation fixation probability is given, and the parameters favorable to cooperation fixation are given. The results show that cooperation is promoted when the cooperator is super-rational and inhibited when the defector is super-rational. This conclusion is verified by the approximate results of the mean-field theory and the simulation results in the structured population. In addition, the evolution of cooperation is given in two cases: the cooperator is completely super-rational but the defector is not super-rational, and the cooperator is not super-rational but the defector is completely super-rational. These results provide new perspectives on the evolution of cooperation.},

Then, based on the leading-following method, the system model consisting of nonlinear second-order dynamic agents and first-order linear dynamic agents is determined. In this network system, the first group of second-order dynamic individuals needs to track their leader with unknown input and realizes the bipartite time-invariant formation, while the other group tracks its leader to realize the bipartite time-varying formation. To solve this problem, a new control protocol based on neighbor information and leader dynamics is designed. In addition, for first-order dynamic individual, a velocity estimator is introduced to estimate its velocity state. Next, algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov stability theory are used to prove that the formation error can approach arbitrary neighborhood of zero. Finally, the simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed conclusions and the effectiveness of the designed velocity estimator.},

Due to the prevalence of DoS attacks in communication channels, a DoS attack model is constructed in this study, and the upper bounds on the duration and frequency of DoS attacks are given. Meanwhile, taking the chattering phenomena of control inputs into account, a hysteresis quantizer is introduced to overcome the issue of the undesirable input chattering. Hence, a new anti-attack distributed consensus protocol is developed such that MASs with input quantization can effectively resist the impact of DoS attacks. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory , the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system is verified and the consensus target can be achieved.

  abstract     = {We analyze families of primal high-order hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods for solving degenerate second-order elliptic problems. One major problem regarding this class of PDEs concerns its mathematical nature, which may be nonuniform over the whole domain. Due to the local degeneracy of the diffusion term, it can be purely hyperbolic in a subregion and elliptical in the rest. This problem is thus quite delicate to solve since the exact solution can be discontinuous at interfaces separating the elliptic and hyperbolic parts. The proposed hybridized interior penalty DG (H-IP) method is developed in a unified and compact fashion. It can handle pure-diffusive or -advective regimes as well as intermediate regimes that combine these two mechanisms for a wide range of Péclet numbers, including the tricky case of local evanescent diffusivity. To this end, an adaptive stabilization strategy based on the addition of jump-penalty terms is considered. An upwind-based scheme using a Lax–Friedrichs correction is favored for the hyperbolic region, and a Scharfetter–Gummel-based technique is preferred for the elliptic one. The well-posedness of the H-IP method is also briefly discussed by analyzing the strong consistency and the discrete coercivity condition in a self-adaptive energy-norm that is regime dependent. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to verify the model’s robustness for all the abovementioned regimes.},

  abstract     = {Several image processing approaches require blurring an image using the Gaussian filter. In the present study the filtering method based on a novel four-velocity lattice Boltzmann model with non-local collision kernel is proposed. By applying the Chapman–Enskog expansion up to super-Burnett terms it is shown that the present scheme is equivalent to the diffusion equation with relatively small hyper-viscous defects (truncation errors). Compared to the conventional lattice Boltzmann model the proposed scheme has a small computational overhead but significantly improves accuracy due to the reduced hyper-viscosity. To validate the model the following test problems are considered: diffusion in time of a Gaussian bell, sinusoidal wave, image filtering, feature detection with the application of the modified SIFT method. The numerical experiments indicate that the novel model gives more precise results than the standard lattice Boltzmann model for non-small values of diffusion coefficient and in several cases its computational cost is competitive with OpenCV blurring techniques. In addition, the model can be efficiently used in feature detection algorithms like SIFT.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this study is to propose a modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model that describes the time behaviour of symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalized patients in an epidemic, taking into account the effect of the demographic evolution. Unlike most of the recent studies where a constant ratio of new individuals is considered, we consider a more correct assumption that the growth ratio is proportional to the total population, following a Logistic law, as is usual in population growth studies for humans and animals. An exhaustive theoretical study is carried out and the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 is computed from the model equations. It is proved that if R 0 &lt; 1 R0&amp;lt;1 then the disease-free manifold is globally asymptotically stable , that is, the epidemics remits. Global and local stability of the equilibrium points is also studied. Numerical simulations are used to show the agreement between numerical results and theoretical properties. The model is fitted to experimental data corresponding to the pandemic evolution of COVID-19 in the Republic of Cuba, showing a proper behaviour of infected cases which let us think that can provide a correct estimation of asymptomatic cases. In conclusion, the model seems to be an adequate tool for the study and control of infectious diseases.},

Consequently, there is a maximum threshold q q at and below which a full contagion (i.e. acceptance of the story by all nodes in the network) can occur from S S , called the contagion threshold of S S . We study how it is influenced by the neighborhood of S S or by the global topology of the network. Firstly, we establish two algorithms to compute the contagion threshold of any given set of nodes in a network. Secondly, we show that the contagion threshold of a connected set in a tree is completely determined by the maximum degree of the nodes not in the set. Next, we derive bounds for the contagion threshold, while indicating when it preserves the neighborhood-inclusion pre-order and when the preservation may fail. Finally, we look at the structural characterization of the sets of nodes with high contagion thresholds.},

The energy function in an isolated memristive Josephson junction is obtained by using the generalized Hamiltonian formalism. The equivalent circuit can reproduce bursting activities similar with that of neuron by using numerical simulation. Further, the coupling memristive Josephson junctions can reach in-phase and antiphase synchronization under the interplay between resistive and magnetic couplings. The synchronous behaviors are analyzed by discerning the interspike interval of phase difference and average Hamilton energy.

Therefore, it is very important and meaningful to consider how to apply emotions in the game so as to promote cooperation. However, emotions are not affected unilaterally in the interaction. It includes both the individual’s own emotions and their acceptance of the external, as well as the shock brought to the individual by the external emotions. In this paper, we propose a new model based on the prisoner’s dilemma to fully consider the influence of both internal and external factors in the change of emotion and the proportion of both sides on cooperation. The simulation shows that emotional stability is more effective in fostering cooperation. In other words, when the proportion of their own emotional continuity is higher and individuals are less accepting of their neighbors’ emotions, the more cooperation is facilitated and the former has a greater degree of influence on cooperation. Taken together, this results maybe provide a perspective, to some extent, on how to apply the condition of emotional change to facilitate the evolution of cooperation in groups in real-life situations.},

The numerical approximations of the balanced split-step theta methods for the SNHNN with time delay and Poisson jumps are taken into consideration primarily because they maintain almost surely (a.s.) exponential stability property of numerical methods and produce negligible mean square error when compared to other approaches. Furthermore, in the recent development of numerical approximations for SNHNN with time delay, we note that balanced split-step theta-approximations are a more stable scheme. We showed that the numerical approximations of balanced split-step theta methods of SNHNN with time delay and Poisson jumps have strong convergence order 1/2 and are numerically almost exponentially stable by applying some theoretical significance criteria.Moreover, our main research tools are Lipschitz conditions , linear growth conditions , and the discrete semi martingale convergence theorem. Through numerical experiments, we try to demonstrate the theoretical results obtained in this paper.

In this article we provide a mathematically rigorous full error analysis of deep learning based empirical risk minimisation with quadratic loss function in the probabilistically strong sense, where the underlying deep neural networks are trained using stochastic gradient descent with random initialisation. The convergence speed we obtain suffers under the curse of dimensionality .

  abstract     = {Degree–degree correlation is an important topological characteristic of real-world networks and has been shown to have a significant effect on cooperation in a population. Meanwhile, the preferential selection of individuals could be exploited as an effective mechanism to improve cooperation in evolutionary games. Network structure and strategy evolution are two essential factors affecting the level of cooperation in spatial evolutionary games, and by considering both of them, proposed here is a spatial snowdrift game with preferential selection on scale-free networks with degree–degree correlation. How two main parameters—the Pearson correlation coefficient r r and the intensity of preferential selection δ δ —affect the cooperation is investigated, and simulation results show that when preferential selection is involved in evolutionary games, then larger δ δ can give a higher level of cooperation. Importantly, an optimal value of r r is found that gives maximum cooperation in the population, and how r r and δ δ affect the cooperation is found to depend on the cost parameter of the game. Furthermore, corresponding microcosmic explanations are provided based on the quantity χ χ , the time series of links, and the strategy distribution.},

  abstract     = {Fractional Order Memristor-Based Neural Networks (FOMBNNs) has the strong sensitivity to initial values and shows more complex paths, so its Projective Synchronization (PS) and applications have been widely used in the fields of security communication. Our main work intends to extend the scaling factor of PS to a function matrix depending on time t and proposes a new synchronization type for the first time, i.e., Function Matrix Projective Synchronization (FMPS) for FOMBNNs, whose scaling factor is highly variable over time and difficult to predict. However, the FOMBNNs is a state dependent discontinuous system and it is easy to produce complex nonlinearity, which makes the study of the FMPS becomes a challenge. Therefore, our work will commit to solving this problem and realizing the FMPS for multi-time delayed FOMBNNs with parameter uncertainty. Firstly, the error functions and FMPS are defined, which can be degenerated to matrix PS, modified PS, PS, anti-synchronization and complete synchronization. Then, for the multi-time delayed FOMBNNs with parameter uncertainty, the active controller is designed and the sufficient condition for realizing the FMPS is proved by using a Lyapunov functional and some Lemmas of fractional calculus. Finally, the FMPS of four numerical examples are given and trajectories of their synchronization errors approach to 0, which illustrate the efficiency of the proposed synchronization analysis. This research will provide a general method for studying the FMPS of other dynamical systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an adaptive control strategy to the Vicsek model and investigates the collective behavior of self-propelled agents from the perspective of control theory. In the model, each agent adopts the classic proportional-integral (PI) control strategy to adjust its direction based on the deviation from the average direction of local neighbors. It is found that the integral term of the controller can eliminate the steady-state error, but strong integral effect will cause fluctuation of the system and prolong the convergence time. Therefore, the moderate integral control can adjust the headings of all agents to be synchronized after a short transient time. However, the proportional term incurs over-regulation of the directions, thus impeding the global convergence to be achieved. The robustness of the synchronizability with respect to different noise intensities is also investigated. Even in the strong noise environments, the control model can still maintain a high degree of directional consistency by adopting the conservative adjustment strategy. Furthermore, the diversity of control parameter is analyzed by considering the integral parameter following the normal distribution. It reveals that inconsistent adjustment magnitude is unfavorable to the synchronization of the system.},

This key design criterion obviates the need to generate different Birkhoff matrices for different boundary conditions while maintaining the O ( 1 ) O(1) condition number with respect to N N , where, N 2 N2 is the size of the Birkhoff matrix. In addressing the resulting theoretical and numerical problems, we generate computationally efficient and stable formulas for producing the new Birkhoff matrices. Furthermore, by transforming a generic m m th order differential equation to its canonical form , we show that the same first-order Birkhoff matrix can be repeatedly used to solve a wide variety of boundary value problems.

This leads to a characterisation of the stability region of the considered equilibrium in the corresponding parameter plane. A Hopf bifurcation analysis is also completed in the general setting, and the criticality is analyzed by employing the method of multiple times scales.

Secondly, by using the pull-based event-triggered mechanism, a distributed event-based control law with time delay is further given to accomplish containment control for fractional order multi-agent systems with nonlinearity. In this way, the controller of each agent is merely updated at its own trigger moments. Hence, it can decrease network correspondence congestion and lower computational cost. Thanks to the stability theory of fractional order calculus, matrix theory, and properties of Mittag-Leffler function, the feasibility of the designed control protocols is confirmed. Furthermore, the Zeno behavior is precluded by the strict proof. Ultimately, two simulation examples are used to illustrate the availability of above theoretical analysis respectively.},

A dynamic event-triggered extended state observer (DET-ESO) is proposed to achieve real-time estimation for unmeasurable velocities and lumped disturbances with lower communication cost of measurement channels, and an explicit relationship between the upper bounds of estimation errors and design parameters is provided. Based on the observation results, the control design is conducted using the backstepping approach. Initially, a nonlinear feedback method is employed to empower the control scheme to be self-tuning for tracking errors, thereby improving the dynamic performance of the control system . Subsequently, an error-shifting function and a novel barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) suitable for compound features of nonlinear feedback are used to handle deferred output constraints with unknown initial tracking conditions. On this basis, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism, including dynamic variables and decreasing functions of tracking errors, is presented to evaluate control input signals to dramatically reduce the transmission load and actuator execution rate, and the development of the control scheme is accomplished. Theoretical analysis shows that with the proposed control scheme, all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded, and the output constraints violated initially are fulfilled within a preset finite time . Additionally, Zeno behavior is excluded strictly. Finally, the comparative simulation results verify the effectiveness of the scheme.},

There are two different ways for group members disseminating a certain knowledge: just sharing it in WeChat group (many-to-many dissemination mode), or using @username function to disseminate it (point-to-point dissemination mode). We regard all group members connected by relationships of two different dissemination modes in a WeChat group as duplex networks. We build a susceptible-infected-recovered-immune (sirm) dynamics model of knowledge dissemination in the duplex networks to obtain the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 of a certain knowledge transmission. We use the actual data to estimate the parameters of this model, and verify that our model fits well with the actual data. The numerical simulations show that: 1) The total number of times that members communicate a certain knowledge via two modes per unit time should not be excessive, to avoid fatigue to it which resulting low efficiency of dissemination in the WeChat group. 2) If the benefit obtained by group members from learning a certain knowledge is higher than the required variable cost, the kind of knowledge is likely to be spread in the WeChat group. If a certain knowledge becomes obsolete or is updated for some group members, they will not disseminate it even after they have learned it and it may gradually disappear in the WeChat group. 3) When members only use either point-to-point @mention function discussion or many-to-many random communication to transmit a certain knowledge, or there is big difference in the number of times that group members use each of the above two discussion modes per unit time, the efficiency of the knowledge dissemination is reduced in a WeChat group.},

In this paper, the effects of adding arcs to the followers on the algebraic connectivity are investigated, when the followers’ interaction topology is a strongly connected directed graph. Our results include: (1) If arcs are added to the followers, then the algebraic connectivity increases if and only if the sum of entries of the Fiedler vector, corresponding to all the tails, is smaller than that of the heads; (2) For the case when a fixed number of arcs with a common head are added, the smaller the sum of entries of the Fiedler vector is, corresponding to all the tails, the larger the algebraic connectivity will be; (3) Each entry of the Fiedler vector, corresponding to the informed agents, is greater than that of the other types of followers; (4) If the Laplacian matrix of a leader-follower interaction topology can be divided into equal row sum blocks by layers, then the entries of the Fiedler vector in each layer are the same and the entries increase by layers. Thus the effects of adding arcs on algebraic connectivity can be determined by the layers of heads and tails of the arcs. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated by numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the global exponential consensus almost surely (GEC a.s.) of nonlinear multi-agent system (MAS) with switching topology via double nonidentical mode-dependent event-triggering mechanisms (ETMs). Considering the activated probability of switching modes, the transition probability (TP) and mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) are combined to propose a more practical switching rule. To save communication resources as much as possible, a set of nonidentical mode-dependent ETMs are designed, where the ETMs of each node are nonidentical and the ETM for controller-actuator (C-A) channel is designed on the basis of ETM for sensor-controller (S-C) channel. By designing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the GEC a.s. of nonlinear MAS and the control gains are obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Usually, the increment coefficient of LKF at switching instant must be larger than one, which will lead to conservatism. Our results remove this constraint condition and do not require each mode of the consensus error system to be stable. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the theoretical analysis.},

We theoretically investigate the complex dynamic behaviors with the appearance of ( k + m ) T (k+m)T -periodic solutions. Firstly, we investigate the existence and stability of the order-1 ( k + 1 ) T (k+1)T -disease-free periodic solution with nonnegative integer k k and the order- m m ( 1 + m ) T (1+m)T -disease-free periodic solution with m m being any positive integer. Furthermore, we study the existence and stability of ( 3 + 2 ) T (3+2)T -disease-free periodic solution. These theoretical results indicate that new kinds of disease-free periodic solutions can be studied in depth. We also show other kinds of the high-order disease-free periodic solutions through the numerical simulations. In addition, through studying the bifurcation near the disease-free periodic solution, we discuss the existence and stability of the endemic periodic solutions. Numerical simulations show the complex dynamics, such as the bistability of the endemic equilibrium and an endemic periodic solution or a disease-free periodic solution, bistability of two endemic periodic solutions, and tri-stability of three endemic periodic solutions. Our main results indicate that there exists a critical monitoring period or vaccination rate such that the proposed intervention strategy can successfully control and eliminate infectious diseases. Furthermore, the selection of threshold value is highly maneuverable.},

Low-permeablity rock matrix is characterized by the line elements as well as the high-permeablity fracture networks. Unlike the conventional equivalent continuum model, water flow in a rock mass is restricted to the line elements, and the equivalent hydraulic conductivity is determined according to Darcy&#39;s law and flux equivalence principle. As a result, uniform expressions of governing equations and boundary conditions are formulated, and the corresponding numerical procedure is developed by introducing the local coordinate and continuous Heaviside function. Satisfactory agreements with the existing test and numerical data verify this proposed line element method. The numerical solutions on the fractured slope indicate that the geological features of fractures have a substantial effect on locating the free surface. In addition, the proposed line element method can efficiently achieve accurate results with less computing time, iteration, and storage.},

In detail, the matched disturbances that are ensuing from the exogenous systems can be tackled by modeling a periodic piecewise disturbance observer (PPDO), which effectively estimates the disturbance with high precision. The mismatched part can be sorted out by implementing H ∞ H∞ control protocol and meanwhile the state feedback is quantized in accordance with the logarithmic quantizer. On the whole, by combining the quantized state-feedback control law with the output of the PPDO, the anti-disturbance control protocol is developed. Moreover, by constructing a Lyapunov function with periodic piecewise positive definite matrices , a collection of adequate criteria affirming the system’s input-output finite-time stability are procured in the context of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Subsequently, the time-varying periodic piecewise gain values of the crafted disturbance observer and developed controller are acquired by working on the LMIs. Conclusively, the simulation results are provided, including the 2-degree of freedom vibration system, to verify the potential of the developed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with Monte-Carlo (MC) methods for evaluating expectations of functionals of solutions to McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (MV-SDE) including those with super-linearly growing drifts. Underpinned by an interacting particle system approximation, we propose two importance sampling (IS) algorithms to reduce the variance of an associated MC estimator. The “complete measure change” algorithm sees the IS measure change applied to the target expectation to be calculated and to the MV-SDE coefficients simultaneously. The “decoupling algorithm” consists of estimating the law of the MV-SDE’s solution via standard simulation under the initial measure, then fixing the law component of the MV-SDE via that simulation, and finally simulating the new equation under the IS measure. Methodologically, large deviations and Pontryagin principle are employed to determine and solve the variance minimisation problem that yields the required measure change. The optimisation problem associated to the complete measure change is more complex than that for the decoupling algorithm, nonetheless, symmetry arguments allow for non-trivial complexity reduction. As an example, both algorithms are tested using the Kuramoto model from statistical physics. For the functionals tested, we see a reduction of up to 3 orders of magnitude on the variance of both IS schemes in comparison to the standard Monte Carlo approximation. In terms of computational cost, the complete measure change is akin to standard Monte Carlo whilst the decoupled approach increases the cost by a factor of around 2 if one uses the same number of particles for both steps. The statistical error of the method dominates the propagation of chaos error by 1 order of magnitude.},

However we get more complete results for a simpler version of this model, the Mild Crime Model, with no serious offenders. For the full Serious Crime Model there are two key parameters R 0 1 R01 and R 0 2 R02 corresponding to the basic reproduction number in the mathematics of infectious diseases, which determine the behaviour of the system. For the Simpler Mild Crime Model there is just one such parameter R 0 1 R01 . Both forward and backward bifurcation can occur for this second model with two subcritical non-trivial equilibria possible for R 0 1 &lt; 1 R01&amp;lt;1 in the backwards case. For backwards bifurcation there is another threshold value R 0 * R0* such that the upper non-trivial equilibrium is unstable for R 0 1 R 0 * R01&amp;gt;R0* . For forwards bifurcation there is a second additional threshold value R 0 * * R0** such that the stability of the unique non-trivial equilibrium switches from unstable to stable as R 0 1 R01 passes through R 0 * * R0** . At the end we return to the full Serious Crime Model and discuss the behaviour of this model. The results are meaningful and interesting because in all of the other epidemiological and sociological models of which we are aware, analogous thresholds to R 0 * R0* and R 0 * * R0** do not exist. For forwards bifurcation the unique non-trivial equilibrium, and for backwards bifurcation with two subcritical endemic equilibria the higher non-trivial equilibrium, are also usually always locally asymptotically stable.

The dynamics of proposed interconnected systems (ISs) is modeled by the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy (TSF) IF-THEN rules. The relevant practical model is used to describe the network connectivity between the plant and the filter. In addition, to develop the filter for nonlinear systems in more practical sense, the sensor delays and the influence of cyber attacks are taken into account during the signal transmission. In order to verify that the developed closed-loop system is asymptotically stable with extended dissipative, sufficient conditions are derived by constructing the delay-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and employing the summation inequalities through the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) approach. The outcomes of theoretical results can be used to analyze the various performances like H ∞ H∞ performance, ( Υ 1 , Υ 2 , R ) − α − (Υ1,Υ2,R)−α− dissipativity, passivity, mixed H ∞ / H∞/ passivity, and l 2 − l ∞ l2−l∞ performance in a single framework.

With this framework, agents upload and download information from the cloud repository, in which they exchange information with neighbors indirectly. We first propose a triggered condition with a deviation of control signals for reduction of the frequency of communication with the cloud repository. Due to the fact that the neighbors’ information in the condition can’t be obtained in the cloud framework, cloud access scheduling rules, with an adaptive threshold for control signal updating, are then introduced via available information at current instants, and agents access the cloud repository in an asynchronous manner to avoid congestion. Available information from the cloud is employed, as well as their own, into the triggered condition for prediction of next access instants, and the triggered consequence is generated. Stability analysis presents that the control scheme in this paper steers the MAS to achieve DAC with an ultimately bounded tracking error and rules out Zeno behaviors. The effectiveness of the control scheme is verified via an example.},

  abstract     = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a well-established approach to solve infinite horizon optimal control problems. Since optimization over an infinite time horizon is generally infeasible, MPC determines a suboptimal feedback control by repeatedly solving finite time optimal control problems. Although MPC has been successfully used in many applications, applying MPC to large-scale systems – arising, e.g., through discretization of partial differential equations – requires the solution of high-dimensional optimization problems and thus poses immense computational effort. We consider systems governed by parametrized parabolic partial differential equations and employ the reduced basis method as a low-dimensional surrogate model for the finite time optimal control problem. The reduced order optimal control serves as feedback control for the original large-scale system. We analyze the proposed RB-MPC approach by first developing a posteriori error bounds for the errors in the optimal control and associated cost functional. These bounds can be evaluated efficiently in an offline-online computational procedure and allow us to guarantee asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system using the RB-MPC approach in several practical scenarios. We also propose an adaptive strategy to choose the prediction horizon of the finite time optimal control problem. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the theoretical properties of our approach.},

For this purpose, an explicit mixed modal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme based on multi-dimensional structured meshes is employed. This numerical scheme deals with high-order derivatives in diffusion, and highly nonlinear functions in reaction terms. Spatial discretization is accomplished using hierarchical basis functions based on scaled Legendre polynomials. A new reaction term treatment is also detailed, showing an intrinsic property of the DG scheme and preventing incorrect solutions due to excessively nonlinear reaction terms. The system is reduced to a set of time-dependent ordinary differential equations, which are solved with an explicit third-order Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) Runge–Kutta method. The Saddle-Node, Hopf, and Turing bifurcations’ boundary conditions are also examined for the system, and subsequently, Turing space is identified. The developed numerical scheme is applied to various multidimensional Gray–Scott systems to assess its ability to capture Turing pattern formation. Several test problems, such as stationary and non-stationary waves, pulse-splitting waves, self-replicating waves, and different types of spots, are chosen from the literature to demonstrate the different Turing patterns.},

Under these assumptions, we study the finite-time expected present value of operating costs until ruin. The continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) approximation technique is used to approximate the intensity process in the Cox model, and the Fourier cosine series expansion (COS) method is applied to approximate the function of interest.

In order to solve the TV-LTE more effectively, this paper proposes two improved zeroing neural network (ZNN) models based on a novel activation function and variable parameter, which have shorter convergence time and computation time. The novel activation function is composed of an exponential function and a sign-bi-power (SBP) function, which is mentioned as the exponential SBP (ESBP) function. Then, based on the ESBP activation function and the standard ZNN design method, an ESBP zeroing neural network (ES-ZNN) model is first provided. In addition, considering the relationship among the error matrix , design parameter and computational efficiency, this paper further designs an exponential parameter that varies dynamically with time and the error matrix. Replacing the fixed parameter with the proposed exponential variable parameter, an exponentially variable parameter ES-ZNN (EVPES-ZNN) model is provided to enhance the computational efficiency and convergence performance of the ES-ZNN model. Furthermore, the upper bounds on convergence time of such two ZNN models are theoretically calculated. Simulation experiments demonstrate the theoretical conclusion that the ES-ZNN and EVPES-ZNN models are able to solve the TV-LTE in finite-time.},

  abstract     = {The mutual feedback between the environment and the strategy is a significant mechanism in the evolution of cooperation. A feedback-evolving repeated public goods game model with nonlinear effects is explored. The players&#39; behaviors in the current round may influence the environment, leading the environment feedback on the behavior by the modulation of payoffs in the form of positive or negative. Under the former case, the groups realize the synergy effect of payoffs in the next round. Vice versa, the discount effect will be instead. The introduction of nonlinear effects enables heterogeneous feedback of the environment on different groups without introducing too many environmental states. The results show the enhancing role of the nonlinear effects on the evolution of cooperation compared to linear switching of enforcement factors. Compared to static game environments, the dynamic feedback scenario can realize better performance in the evolution of cooperation. The effect is more pronounced as the synergy factor increases or the discount factor decreases. The results are verified when the game environment changes between two or three states and under different environment transition structures. In addition, under the scenarios of probabilistic transition, the results are explored by taking into account the cases of state-independent and state-dependent, where both the homogeneity and heterogeneity transition probability are considered in the state-independent case, respectively. The probabilistic transition results further emphasized the transition probability&#39;s significant role in the evolution of cooperation when cooperation behaviors are more likely incentivized to interact in the valuable environment.},

How to effectively segment an intensity inhomogeneous image into several meaningful regions in terms of human visual perception and ensure that the segmented regions are consistent at different resolutions is still a very challenging task. In order to describe the structure information of the intensity inhomogeneous efficiently, this paper proposes a novel hybrid bias field correction model by decoupling the multiplicative bias field and the additive bias field. These kinds of bias fields are assumed to be smooth, so can employ the Sobolev space W 1 , 2 W1,2 to feature them and use a constraint to the multiplicative bias field. Since the proposed model is a constrained optimization problem, we use the Lagrangian multiplier method to transform it into an unconstrained optimization problem, and then the alternating direction method can be used to solve it. In addition, we also discuss some mathematical properties of our proposed model and algorithm. Numerical experiments on the natural images and the medical images demonstrate performance improvement over several state-of-the-art models.},

Nuclear norm minimization (NNM) is a widely used convex relaxation for relevant rank minimization problems . However, NNM regularizes each singular value equally and ignores the significance of bigger singular values. In this paper, we propose a non-convex low-rank decomposition (NC-LRD) model that is based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) with a weighted L 1 L1 norm. Utilizing NSS prior for image inpainting we search similar patches by using a newly designed multidirectional search (MS) method, and apply the NC-LRD model to complete each corrupted patch matrix (low-rank decomposition with multidirectional search, MS-LRD). We focus on the spatial distribution of similar patches by restricting matched N N patches to locate at N N different directions relative to a target patch, while previous state-of-the-art methods do not consider the spatial distribution in similarity criterion. The MS method solves the problem that many patch-based inpainting algorithms fail to complete missing lines. Experimental results on line missing demonstrate that the proposed NC-LRD method has lower reconstruction error in matrix completion, and it converges faster than several state-of-the-art matrix completion algorithms. At the same time, the effectiveness and superiority of MS-LRD over other competitive inpainting algorithms are also verified.},

A tan-type barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) and a finite-time adaptive law are proposed such that all states of the system are constrained in the defined bounded compact sets . Based on stochastic Lyapunov theorem, an adaptive state-feedback tracking controller is designed to ensure that the considered stochastic system is semiglobally finite-time stable in probability (SGFSP) and the tracking error signal is bounded. Different from the existing control strategies for stochastic systems, the form of BLF can be used for asymmetric constraints without changing the controller, so the analysis of symmetric or asymmetric full-state constraints is unified. Finally, illustrative simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {In network theory , distance parameters are crucial in analyzing structural aspects of the networks under investigation, including their symmetry, connectedness, and tendency to form clusters. To this end, the metric dimension and the fault-tolerant metric dimension are important distance invariants of networks. In this article, we consider fractal cubic networks, a variant of hypercubes . We first correct their definition from the seminal paper [Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal 18 (2015) 32–41]. After that, we determine their metric dimension and fault-tolerant metric dimension, which is in striking contrast to the situation with hypercubes, where these invariants are intrinsically difficult.},

Gutman introduced a new vertex-degree-based topological index , defined as S O ( G ) = ∑ u v ∈ E ( G ) ( d u ) 2 + ( d v ) 2 , SO(G)=∑uv∈E(G)(du)2+(dv)2, and named Sombor index. It is a molecular descriptor with an impressive research activity in recent years. In this paper we propose and initiate the study of a family of topological indices, also conceived from a geometrical point of view, called integral Sombor indices, that generalize the Sombor index. Also, we study the application of these indices in QSPR/QSAR research.},

Firstly, the obstacle caused by unknown time-varying input delay has been tackled by introducing a compensation signal. The unknown nonlinear functions are identified by neural networks and the algebraic loop problem for nonstrict feedback systems has been overcome by using the properties of neural networks. Further, a bound estimation mechanism is employed to estimate the identify error and unknown time-varying external disturbance without using the priori knowledge of the boundary. Regarding the obstacle caused by high-order terms and the singularity problem have been tackled by using adding a power integrator mechanism and the inequality transformation technique, respectively. The boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop systems has been proved by using the Lyapunov stability theorem, and the convergence time is independent of the initial value of the system state . Finally, the simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The Radon transform and its various types have been studied since its introduction by Johann Radon in 1917. Since the Radon transform is an integral transform that maps a given function to its line integral, it has been studied in the field of computerized tomography, which deals with electromagnetic waves that primarily travel along straight lines, such as X-rays. However, in many laser optics applications, it is assumed that the laser beam is shaped like a Gaussian bell rather than a straight line. Therefore, in tomographic modalities using optical beams, such as optical projection tomography, images reconstructed with the inversion algorithms for the standard Radon transform are subject to a loss of quality. To address this issue, one needs to consider theoretical inversion methods for Radon transforms with Gaussian beam kernels and associated numerical reconstruction methods. In this study, we consider a Radon transform with a Gaussian beam kernel (also known as the point spread function) and show the uniqueness of the inversion of this transform. Furthermore, we provide an accurate and stable numerical reconstruction algorithm using the point spread function-sequential quadratic Hamiltonian scheme. Numerical experiments with disk and Shepp–Logan phantoms demonstrate that the proposed framework provides superior reconstructions compared to the traditional filtered back-projection algorithm.},

In some cases, we cannot obtain an explicit expression for the oblique duals and in others there exists only one oblique dual frame which has not the properties we need. Also, in practice the computations are not exact. To give a solution to these problems, in this work we introduce and investigate the notion of approximate oblique dual frames first in the setting of separable Hilbert spaces . We present several properties and provide different characterizations of approximate oblique dual frames. We focus then on approximate oblique dual frames in shift-invariant subspaces of L 2 ( R ) L2(R) and give different conditions on the generators that assure their existence. The importance of approximate oblique dual frames from a numerical and computational point of view is illustrated with an example of frame sequences generated by B B -splines, where the previous results are used to construct approximate oblique dual frames which have better attributes than the exact ones. We provide an expression for the approximation error and study its behaviour.},

In addition, KVLNs with virtual vertices are transformed into the corresponding algebraic form by the semi-tensor product (STP) method. Based on the system vertices classification technique and the concept of feedback arc set (FAS), the pinning nodes set (PNS) is determined. The mode-independent and mode-dependent DPCs are designed to realize ASS of KVDLNs based on the determined PNS.

  abstract     = {Considering denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in the communication network, this work develops the adaptive memory-based event triggering resilient LFC approach for multi-area power systems with wind power. First of all, the impact of each DoS attack is evaluated by the amount of continual information loss it causes. Meanwhile, an adaptive memory event triggering mechanism (AMETM) is proposed, where the dynamic event triggering parameter and the triggering mechanism are all related to the historical transmitted states. Then, based on the proposed AMETM and DoS attacks, a sampling-data LFC model is established. In order to construct the LFC scheme with the desired faster state response, the exponential decay index is introduced as a performance index. Next the exponential stability problem of LFC sampling model is transformed into the asymptotic stability problem of polynomial uncertain system. Secondly, the exponential stability criterion and the memory controllers design method are obtained by bilateral closed-loop Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) and LMI technology, which ensure the proposed memory control scheme can quickly stabilize the LFC system under a longer DoS attack. Lastly, a one-area typical LFC system is presented to verify the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed AMETM. The resilient control with fast state response and DoS attack is studied by two-areas LFC systems with wind power.},

To be specific, the spatial discretization is carried out by a novel eighth-order accurate compact difference scheme in which the fast discrete sine transform can be utilized for efficient implementation. The second-order conservative Crank–Nicolson scheme is considered in the temporal direction. Then the conservative property and convergence of the first scheme in two-dimensional space are discussed. A linearized iteration based on the fast discrete sine transform technique is devised to solve the nonlinear system effectively. Since the resultant algorithm does not use matrix inversion , it is computationally efficient in long-time calculations. Furthermore, the two other schemes are constructed based on improved scalar auxiliary variable approaches by converting the sine-Gordon equation into an equivalent new system which involves solving linear systems with constant coefficients at each time step. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to validate the correctness of the theoretical findings and demonstrate the excellent performance in long-time conservation of the schemes.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new mixed model unifying local volatility, pure stochastic volatility , and L e ´ vy Le´vy type of jumps in this paper. Our model framework allows the pure stochastic volatility and the jump intensity to be functions of fast (and slowly) varying stochastic processes and the local volatility to be given in a constant elasticity of variance type of parametric form . We use asymptotic analysis to derive a system of partial integro-differential equations for the prices of European derivatives and use Fourier analysis to obtain an explicit formula for the prices. Our result is an extension of a stochastic-local volatility model from no jumps to L e ´ vy Le´vy jumps and an extension of a multiscale stochastic volatility model with L e ´ vy Le´vy jumps from the zero elasticity of variance to the non-zero elasticity of variance. We find that our model outperforms two benchmark models in view of fitting performance when the time-to-maturities of European options are relatively short and outperforms one benchmark model in terms of pricing time cost.},

  abstract     = {This paper analyzes the synchronization of Caputo fractional-order BAM neural networks with multiple time-varying delays (FOBAMNNs-MTDs). The time-delay phenomenon is inevitable in the synchronization process. Thereby, it is crucial to fully consider the time-delay information on behalf of better studying the synchronization problem. In previously published studies of Caputo FOBAMNNs-MTDs, the time-delay information of bounded MTDs is implied in the delayed state term. Then, the boundary information of MTDs is not considered by applying the method mentioned above, which will be detrimental to the accuracy of the system dynamic characteristics analysis. This paper aims to propose a new time-delay information processing method to enhance the utilization of MTD information, thereby improving the synchronization analysis of FOBAMNNs-MTDs. Firstly, an inequality called multi-delay-boundary inequality (MDBI) containing all boundary information of time-varying delays and fractional-order information is proposed. That is, a new time-delay information processing method of MTDs with different boundary information is proposed, which makes full use of MTD information. Secondly, a less-conservatism synchronization criterion with the information of all delay boundary and fractional-order of Caputo FOBAMNNs-MTDs is established, which is more flexible than the delay-independent criterion. Finally, two numerical simulations are provided to verify the validity of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Geometric Texture Transfer, aimed to add fine grained details to surfaces, can be seen as a realistic advanced geometry modelling technique. At this aim, we investigate and advocate the use of local geometric descriptors as alternative descriptors to the vertex coordinates for surface representation. In particular, we consider the Laplacian coordinates, the normal-controlled coordinates and the mean value encoding, which are well prone to facilitate the transfer of source geometric texture details onto a target surface while preserving the underlying global shape of the target surface. These representations, in general, encode the underlying geometry by describing relative position of a vertex with respect to its local neighborhood, with different levels of invariance to rigid transformations and uniform scaling. We formulate the geometric texture transfer task as a constrained variational nonlinear optimization model that combines an energy term on the shape-from-operator inverse model with constraints aimed to preserve the original underlying surface shape. In contrast to other existing methods, which rely on the strong assumptions of bijectivity, equivalency in local connectivity, and require massive tesselations, we simply map the geometric texture on the base surface, under the only assumption of boundary matching. The proposed geometric texture transfer optimization model is then efficiently solved by nonlinear least squares numerical methods . Experimental results show how the nonlinear texture transfer variational approach based on mean value coordinates overcomes the performance of other alternative descriptors.},

The meaning of uniform exponential stability in this paper is two-fold: The first one is in the classical sense and also is concisely called exponential stability by many authors; The second one is that the semi-discretization systems, which are derived from an exponentially stable continuous beam by some semi-discretization schemes, are uniformly exponentially stable with respect to the discretized parameter. To investigate uniform exponential stability of continuous and discrete systems, five completely different methods, which are stability theory of port-Hamiltonian system, direct method of Lyapunov functional, perturbation theory of C 0 C0 -semigroup, spectral analysis of unbounded operator and frequency standard of exponential stability for contractive semigroup, are involved. Especially, a new method, which is based on the frequency domain characteristics of uniform exponential stability of C 0 C0 -semigroup of contractions, is established to verify the uniform exponential stability of semi-discretization systems derived from coupled system. The effectiveness of the numerical approximating algorithms is verified by numerical simulations.},

Then, by utilizing a mode-dependent Lyapunov function with the looped functions, a sufficient condition concerning the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop FSMJSs is established in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Meanwhile, to solve parameterized LMI (PLMI), a novel convex relaxation technique is proposed, based on which less conservatism stabilization criteria of FSMJSs, and a maximum sampling interval with respect to sampled-data control are further derived. Finally, two examples are carried out to manifest numerically the validity of the raised method.},

For developing less conservative stability criteria obtained with the Lyapunov-Krsoavkii approach, numerous Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) have been constructed by utilizing various summation quadratic functions . Thus, summation inequalities have been essential methods to develop convex stability criteria which guarantee the negative forward difference of LKFs. To further reduce the conservatism of stability criteria, this paper proposes extended affine Bessel summation inequalities. The proposed summation inequalities provide affine upper bounds of an extended summation quadratic function that contains a systems state variable, its forward difference, and their correlated terms. Further, this paper provides notes on the correlation among several summation inequalities including the proposed ones. These notes also prove that an increase in the degree of the developed affine Bessel summation inequalities only reduces conservatism. Two numerical examples effectively demonstrate the reduction of the conservatism due to the proposed summation inequalities in terms of stability regions which are expressed as delay bounds.},

  abstract     = {Last decade, numerous giant data center networks are built to provide increasingly fashionable web applications. For two integers m ≥ 0 m≥0 and n ≥ 2 n≥2 , the m m -dimensional DCell network with n n -port switches D m , n Dm,n and n n -dimensional BCDC network B n Bn have been proposed. As a generalization of connectivity, structure (substructure) connectivity was recently proposed. Let G G and H H be two connected graphs . Let F F be a set whose elements are subgraphs of G G , and every member of F F is isomorphic to H H (resp. a connected subgraph of H H ). Then H H -structure connectivity κ ( G ; H ) κ(G;H) (resp. H H -substructure connectivity κ s ( G ; H ) κs(G;H) ) of G G is the size of a smallest set of F F such that G − F G−F is disconnected or the singleton. Then it is meaningful to calculate the structure connectivity of data center networks on some common structures, such as star K 1 , t K1,t , path P k Pk , cycle C k Ck , complete graph K s Ks and so on. In this paper, we obtain that κ ( D m , n ; K 1 , t ) = κ s ( D m , n ; K 1 , t ) = ⌈ n − 1 1 + t ⌉ + m κ(Dm,n;K1,t)=κs(Dm,n;K1,t)=⌈n−11+t⌉+m for 1 ≤ t ≤ m + n − 2 1≤t≤m+n−2 and κ ( D m , n ; K s ) = ⌈ n − 1 s ⌉ + m κ(Dm,n;Ks)=⌈n−1s⌉+m for 3 ≤ s ≤ n − 1 3≤s≤n−1 by analyzing the structural properties of D m , n Dm,n . We also compute κ ( B n ; H ) κ(Bn;H) and κ s ( B n ; H ) κs(Bn;H) for H ∈ { K 1 , t , P k , C k | 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 n − 3 , 6 ≤ k ≤ 2 n − 1 } H∈{K1,t,Pk,Ck|1≤t≤2n−3,6≤k≤2n−1} and n ≥ 5 n≥5 by using g g -extra connectivity of B n Bn .},

Then, we consider the SIR model in annealed networks with arbitrary degree distribution and analyze the initial growth behavior of it. Interestingly, if we assume that initial densities of infected individuals in each degree class are proportional to the right eigenvector of a specified non-negative and irreducible matrix, then the initial growth behavior of infected individuals in each degree class is completely determined by the basic reproduction number. However, this is not the case for any initial condition, and the initial growth behavior may be very complex. Numerical simulations are performed to verify our analytical results and further investigate the effect of contact heterogeneity on disease behavior.},

In this work we propose a novel enriched quadrilateral overlapping elements for Helmholtz problems. In this scheme, the original overlapping elements are strengthened by the harmonic trigonometric functions stemming from the spectral techniques. Since all additional degrees of freedom are aligned on the vertex node of every overlapping element, the proposed method can be directly applied to the original finite element model without changing the mesh topology . Because of the enriched approximation space, the proposed method can significantly suppress the numerical dispersions with practically negligible numerical anisotropy, and can be more computationally efficient in providing comparable solution accuracy compared to the original scheme and the classic finite element method. Besides, the linear dependence issue is completely avoided and these enriched overlapping elements are distortion-insensitive. In this work, the original variational formulation is perturbed using the penalty method to impose the essential boundary conditions. Numerical experiments show that the developed method can reduce user interventions in mesh creation and adjustment, and is promising in practical engineering applications for time-harmonic acoustics.},

  abstract     = {Robust stability is investigated for continuous-time, affine, Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) models, with bounded variation rates of uncertainty. Towards this end, affine Parameter Dependent Lyapunov Functions (PDLF) are considered to certificate stability in the Lyapunov sense. In the literature, the search for PDLFs amounts to a non conservative Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem, at expense of a factorial growth in its complexity. Remedies to overcome this complexity have been proposed recently, exploiting geometrical aspects of the problem, however, they can be conservative. This paper presents new stability tests that are a trade-off between the exact and the fastest solutions. We offer an analytical procedure to indicate when the proposed tests are prone to reduce conservativeness. Also, a simple procedure is introduced to possibly improve existing and new tests, without impacts on the computation effort. Numerical simulations illustrate the improvements of the proposed strategies.},

  abstract     = {In some computed tomography (CT) practical applications, the projection data is incomplete, which makes some limited-angle artifacts presented in the reconstructed image. Total variation (TV) regularization method is used to suppress the artifacts, but the edge of reconstructed image is distorted or some tiny details are missed. To preserve the edge of reconstructed image, a cascading ℓ 0 ℓ0 regularization-based reconstruction model in nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain is proposed, which considers both the directional peculiarity of artifacts and the smooth of low frequency of the reconstructed image. In the proposed reconstruction model, a ℓ 0 ℓ0 regularization term in the high frequency is used to suppress the artifacts and noise, and a ℓ 0 ℓ0 regularization of gradient image in low frequency is used to suppress the limited-angle artifacts, to preserve the edge of object and to smooth the reconstructed image. To solve the proposed model, a proximal alternating linearized Peaceman–Rachford splitting method (PAL-PRSM) is proposed, which uses the Peaceman–Rachford splitting method that updates the Lagrange multiplier twice, one after each minimization of the subproblem , to deal with the optimization problem firstly, and then the proximal linearization is used to avoid computing the inverse of a huge system matrix. In addition, to compensate the proximal linearization, we add an additional term into Lagrange multiplier updating. Real data experiments are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of PAL-PRSM method, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms two other CT reconstruction methods on preserving the edge of reconstructed image. On the whole, the proposed method is a compromise between denoising and preserving the edge of reconstructed image.},

Based on ETM, a sliding mode surface based on measurable premise variables is proposed for the first time. Since the delay between the sensor and the controller in ETM, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii function is used to acquire the sufficient conditions for the closed-loop system to be admissible with dissipative performance.

Training a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) with only one output neuron by minimizing the sum of the squared errors (SSE) is an SNLLS problem, so that the classical VP method has been applied to RBFNN. However, the one-output-RBFNN (ORBFNN) is just one type of RBFNN, so that the paper proposes a new VP method for the general radial basis function neural network (GRBFNN) which has no limit of the number of the output neurons. The new VP method translates the problem corresponding to minimizing the SSE of GRBFNN into a lower-dimensional optimization problem. We prove theoretically that the set of stationary points of the objective function of the lower-dimensional problem is equivalent to that of the original objective function. In addition, the lower dimension leads to less guesses about the initial point for the new problem. The numerical experiments indicate that, with the same algorithm, minimizing the new objective function converges in fewer iterations and makes both a smaller training error and a testing error than minimizing the original objective function.},

We identify the weight functions of this barycentric combination and define the GL polynomials , which form a basis of the polynomial space like the Bernstein polynomial basis. We investigate various properties of the GL polynomials such as the partition of unity property, symmetry, endpoint interpolation, and the critical values in comparison with the Bernstein polynomials. We also present the definite integral and higher derivatives of the GL polynomials. We then discuss the shape control of polynomial curves using the GL polygon. We claim that the design process of high degree polynomial curves using the GL polygon is much easier and more predictable than if the curve is given in the Bernstein–Bézier form. This is supported by some neat illustrative examples.},

In particular, i) the Jacobian is computed in a highly accurate and automated way, and ii) the derivative of the solution to the nonlinear equations is computed with respect to any parameter contained within the system of equations. These advances provide two significant enhancements in that it is straightforward to provide an accurate Jacobian and to construct a reduced order model (ROM) of arbitrary order with respect to any parameter of the system. The ROM can then be used to approximate the solution for other parameter values without requiring additional solutions of the nonlinear equations. Several case studies are presented including 1D and 2D academic examples with fully functioning Python code provided. Additionally, a case of study of the catenary of an elastic cable subject to its own weight and a vertical point load. Derivatives up to 10th order were computed with respect to material, loading, and geometrical parameters. The derivatives were used to generate reduced order models of the cable deformation and reaction forces at its ends with respect to multiple input parameters. Results show that from a single hypercomplex evaluation of the cable under a single vertical point load, it is possible to generate an accurate reduced order model capable of predicting the cable deformation with 1.5 times the load in the opposite direction and with 3.5 times the load in the same direction without resolving the system of equations.},

First, we prove some general properties about degrees of vertices of χ χ -iso-unique graphs G G , and then focus on non-bipartite outerplanar χ χ -iso-unique graphs. As proved by Chartrand and Geller back in 1969, uniquely 3-colorable outerplanar graphs are precisely the 2-connected outerplanar graphs in which all induced cycles are triangles. We prove that a χ χ -iso-unique outerplanar graph G G with χ ( G ) = 3 χ(G)=3 contains at most one inner face, which is not a triangle, and it is isomorphic to C 5 C5 if it exists. Besides maximal outerplanar graphs, there is just one additional family of 2-connected outerplanar graphs that are χ χ -iso-unique, and they contain one facial 5-cycle. In contrast to the situation in uniquely colorable graphs, we find two families of outerplanar χ χ -iso-unique graphs having cut-vertices, and finally, we characterize all outerplanar χ χ -iso-unique graphs. We also show that χ χ -iso-unique outerplanar graphs can be recognized efficiently.},

Then, by utilizing the matrix Moore-Penrose generalized inverse and the matrix decomposition of descriptor switched systems, the preconditions for the existence of solutions and the solving procedure are derived. Based on that and by means of the matrix decoupling methods, linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions to make the considered problem solvable and the controller design approaches are obtained.

Meanwhile, the time-varying fading channel is described by a Markov process within finite space, whose mode can be detected via a hidden Markov mode detector.

The utilization of the dynamic surface technique avoids the issue of repeated differentiation of virtual control law and eliminates the drawback of the explosion of complexity with the backstepping technique. By utilizing the universal approximation property of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs), the unknown function is approximated successfully. By combining the DSC and event-triggered control (ETC) scheme, communication and computation strain are alleviated contemporaneously. An adaptive controller and an auxiliary system are cooperatively constructed to offset the effect of dead-zone nonlinear function. By employing the barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs), all the states can remain within a prescribed interval. The tracking error can be restricted at the origin and all signals of closed-loop systems can be kept within the boundaries by the designed parameter adaptive laws and event-triggered controller. Finally, a numerical simulation result and a practical simulation result of the pendulum are proposed to guarantee the effectiveness of the presented control theory .},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with Linear Canonical Transforms (LCTs) associated with two-dimensional quaternion-valued signals defined in an open rectangle of the Euclidean plane endowed with a hyperbolic measure, which we call Quaternion Hyperbolic Linear Canonical Transforms (QHLCTs). These transforms are defined by replacing the Euclidean plane wave with a corresponding hyperbolic relativistic plane wave in one dimension multiplied by quadratic modulations in both the hyperbolic spatial and frequency domains, giving the hyperbolic counterpart of the Euclidean LCTs. We prove the fundamental properties of the partial QHLCTs and the right-sided QHLCT by employing hyperbolic geometry tools and establish main results such as the Riemann–Lebesgue Lemma, the Plancherel and Parseval Theorems, and inversion formulas . The analysis is carried out in terms of novel hyperbolic derivative and hyperbolic primitive concepts, which lead to the differentiation and integration properties of the QHLCTs. The results are applied to establish two quaternionic versions of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the right-sided QHLCT. These uncertainty principles prescribe a lower bound on the product of the effective widths of quaternion-valued signals in the hyperbolic spatial and frequency domains. It is shown that only hyperbolic Gaussian quaternion functions minimize the uncertainty relations.},

  abstract     = {Corruption is a serious problem faced by human society, which significantly affects the efficiency of the third party punishment mechanism. Without intervention, fair umpires will gradually evolve into bribed umpires to maximize its own profits, resulting in a double dilemma of corruption-defection. Therefore, it is worth studying how to suppress corruption through effective intervention mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional supervision mechanism in which players could also supervise umpires and give up the games if they find their corresponding umpires are unfavourable for themselves. Five parameters control the whole model. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal the effects of these parameters on the results. More importantly, the bidirectional supervision mechanism has a significant effect on suppressing corruption and defection. Our results provide a new perspective for exploring how corruption and defection could be suppressed under the third-party punishment mechanism.},

When p = 2 p=2 , the approximate eigenfunctions converge but with only suboptimal convergence rate. When p ≥ 2 p≥2 and the eigenfunction u ∈ H s ( Ω ) ( s ≥ p + 1 u∈Hs(Ω)(s≥p+1 ), we prove that the convergence rate of approximate eigenvalues reaches 2 p − 2 2p−2 in h h and p − ( 2 s − 7 ) p−(2s−7) in p p . We also discuss the a posterior error estimates of the approximate eigenvalues and implement the adaptive calculation.

This paper aims at bridging together the scale functions and the IDEs by presenting a unified scale function based approach for solving IDEs that arise in risk theory. In particular, to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, a dividend and capital injection problem is considered under a jump-diffusion risk model. We first derive the IDEs satisfied by the expected accumulated discounted difference between the net dividends and the costs of capital injections, and then solve the IDEs with its solution being expressed in compact and transparent forms.},

It is noteworthy that the interactive neighbors are randomly selected corresponding to the practical phenomenon that our friends will change over time, thereby resulting in un-fixed friends. As shown by numerous simulations, adaptively adjusting the number of interactive neighbors based on random neighbors can significantly enhance cooperation, and it performs better in strengthening cooperation than traditional deterministic interactions. Apart from that, cooperation can be promoted by an appropriate interactive neighborhood. Overall, this study is expected to help inspire more research on addressing social dilemmas.},

The basic reproduction number of the model is derived and shown to be a non-increasing function of the quarantine control parameters . Due to the limited medical resources, a multi-period model of resource allocation coupled with quarantine control is developed. Numerical results demonstrate that quarantine strategies reduce the speed and size of pandemic spreading. In the context of limited medical resources, intra-regional control is less effective at reducing infected individuals than inter-regional control, and most of the resources are allocated to high-risk regions.},

  abstract     = {Fairness preference is common in real society and natural communities. We consider this preference and explore the effect of individual sympathy and retaliation caused by payoff inequality on the evolution of cooperation in multi-player dilemma games with a structured population. Specifically, by setting payoff-dependent heterogeneously sympathy threshold and reputation-based intensity of sympathy, we make high-payoff players more likely to perceive payoff lead, and the payoff redistribution proportion is determined by the reputation of low-payoff players. While all players have the same perception of payoff lag and retaliate against high-payoff players by damaging their payoff with a cost. We find that even if only a few players have this preference, cooperation can be effectively promoted regardless of whether sympathy and retaliation are considered separately or together. Although retaliation is indeed a Pareto loss behavior that damages social welfare, the reduction of the payoff gap can increase the frequency of cooperators. Moreover, a relatively small upper limit of reputation enables high-payoff players to more accurately identify defectors in the process of payoff redistribution. Moreover, high positive correlations between strategy, payoff, and reputation convince us that sympathy groups and retaliation groups are mainly composed of cooperators and defectors, respectively. By analyzing the underlying micro process of the redistribution of players’ payoffs, we observe that the reduction of payoff gaps increases the probability that defectors imitate the cooperative strategy, which further expands the areas of cooperative groups. These findings enrich our knowledge of the positive effect of sympathizing with the poor and retaliating with the rich caused by payoff inequality on cooperation.},

With the proposed control scheme, the trajectory tracking control of the quadrotor system can be achieved and Zeno behavior can be excluded. Moreover, a parameter adaptive adjustment mechanism is introduced to ensure the trajectory tracking performance of the system.

By utilizing the associated information among subsystems, a novel unknown input method-based distributed observer synthesis scheme is presented to reconstruct system states and faults simultaneously. It is worth pointing out that our method has much broader applications, since the faults studied in each subsystem do not have to satisfy some constraints made in previous results such as having a known bound or the first derivative being equal to zero. By resorting to the Lyapunov theory and matrix transformation technique, some brand-new conditions are proposed to guarantee the stability of local error systems, by which observer gains can be solved in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Particularly, all the conditions are expressed in the original system matrices rather than augmented matrices framework. Thus, computational complexity is reduced compared to previous related researches. At last, simulation experiments are shown to verify the validity of our distributed state and fault estimation scheme.},

However, the determination of geodetic convexity parameters in Kneser graphs still remained open. In this work, we investigate both the geodetic number and the geodetic hull number of Kneser graphs. We give upper bounds and determine the exact value of these parameters for Kneser graphs of diameter two (which form a nontrivial subfamily).

By employing the Lyapunov functional method and kinds of inequalities, we derive a sufficient criterion that ensures the Mittag–Leffler stability for SMFRDSs. Robust Mittag–Leffler stability is also considered when there are uncertainties in SMFRDSs. Besides, we analyze how the control gains and diffusion coefficient matrix affect the stability. Finally, we carry out the numerical simulation based on the above results.},

Such behavior inertia has already been studied, but its consequences remained unexplored in the weak selection limit. To fill this gap, we consider a spatial public goods game model where inertia is considered during the imitation process. By using the identity-by-descent method, we present analytical forms of the critical synergy factor r ★ r★ , which determines when cooperation is favored. We find that inertia hinders cooperation, which can be explained by the decelerated coarsening process under weak selection. Interestingly, the critical synergy conditions for different updating protocols, including death-birth and birth-death rules, can be formally linked by the extreme limits of the inertia factor. To explore the robustness of our observations, calculations are made for different lattices and group sizes. Monte Carlo simulations also confirm the results.},

A fixed-time command filter is embedded into the standard backstepping recursive design to overcome the “explosion of complexity” (EOC) problem. The nonsmooth error compensation signals are constructed to eliminate the influence of filtered error. Furthermore, the singularity problem is completely addressed via the well-designed piecewise function. By introducing the hysteresis quantizer, not only the data transmission burden but also the chattering phenomenon is attenuated. It is strictly proved that the closed-loop system is practically fixed-time stable and all the signals of closed-loop system are fixed-time bounded, as well as the synchronization tracking errors converge to a sufficiently small residual set in a fixed time. Finally, simulation examples are implemented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the developed fixed-time distributed attitude control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Epidemic threshold estimation plays a critical role in prevention strategies. Besides theoretical methods, some numerical methods estimate the threshold through the scale divergence of outbreak size near critical state. But the bimodal distribution of outbreak size may make the estimated threshold higher. In this paper, we extend the Eigen Microstate (EM) method to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model and devise the eigen measure to estimate the threshold using the scale divergence of singular values. Compared with the susceptibility and variability measure, the estimated threshold of eigen measure is closer to the theoretical results of the heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) and the quenched mean-field (QMF). In addition, better than the assortativity coefficient, network mean degree or dimension has a more significant effect on estimation accuracy. Under complex epidemic mechanisms, such as periodic time-varying networks and migration between networked populations, the threshold estimation of QMF models indicates that the eigen measure is more stable and accurate than the other two measures. Combined with renormalization group theory, our method may have practical significance in megalopolis epidemic warning.},

This method can achieve a higher degree of scalability and speed-up rates through a mechanism in which the communication phase for the computation of the inner product can be overlapped with the computation of the matrix-vector product. Meanwhile, several generalized iteration methods with better convergence behavior than BiCGStab exist, such as ssBiCGSafe, BiCGSafe, and GPBi-CG. Among these methods, ssBiCGSafe, which requires a single phase of computing inner products per iteration, is best suited for high-performance computing systems. As described herein, inspired by the success of the pipelined BiCGStab method, we propose pipelined variations of the ssBiCGSafe method in which only one phase of inner product computation per iteration is required and this phase of inner product computation can be overlapped with the matrix-vector computation. Through numerical experimentation, we demonstrate that the proposed methods engender improvements in convergence behavior and execution time compared to the pipelined BiCGStab and ssBiCGSafe methods.},

  abstract     = {Effective and accurate state estimation is a staple of modern modeling. On the other hand, nonlinear fractional-order singular (FOS) systems are an attractive modeling tool as well since they can provide accurate descriptions of systems with complex dynamics. Consequently, developing accurate state estimation methods for such systems is highly relevant since it provides vital information about the system including related memory effects and long interconnection properties with constraint elements. However, missing features in transforming structures such as violation of constraints in non-singular versions of such systems may affect the performance of the estimation result. This paper proposes the state estimation algorithm design for the original and non-transformed stochastic nonlinear FOS system. We introduce a deterministic data-fitting based framework which helps us to take steps directly towards Kalman filter (KF) derivation, called extended fractional singular KF (EFSKF). Using stochastic reasoning, we demonstrate how to construct recursive form of the filter. Analysis of the filter shows how the proposed algorithm reduces to the nominal nonlinear filters when the system is in its usual state-space form making said algorithm highly flexible. Finally, simulation results verify that the estimation of nonlinear states can be accomplished with the proposed EFSKF algorithm with a reasonable performance.},

  abstract     = {The signal encoding capacity of the nervous system is significantly related to the spiking regime of neurons, and the firing behaviors of neurons are vibrant due to their complex structure. Chaotic fluctuations emerge at both micro and macro levels in the neuronal medium. It is thought that chaotic oscillations are the beneficial component, rather than disruptive, for cognitive functions of the nervous system. It is found that external chaotic activity at a suitable level enhances the weak signal encoding performance of neurons, particularly when the weak signal frequency is chosen close to that of the chaotic fluctuations-induced sub-threshold oscillations frequencies. This manipulation of the signal encoding performance of neurons by chaotic fluctuations is explained by the “chaotic resonance” phenomenon. In the current work, we systematically examine the impacts of the extrinsic chaotic stimulus from the Lorenz system on the subthreshold periodic signal encoding performance of Type-I and Type-II Morris-Lecar neurons. Our results show that weak signal encoding performance of both Type-I and Type-II Morris-Lecar neurons exhibits resonance behavior and its resonance mainly depends on external chaotic current intensity. Also, we reveal that suitable chaotic current level for the best encoding in Morris-Lecar neurons of the sub-threshold signal changes with signal frequency. In addition, we indicate that there is a frequency range in which Morris-Lecar neurons are sensitive to signals. We also demonstrate the existence of a chaotic current intensity range at these frequencies, enabling neurons to improve weak signal encoding performance. Finally, it is observed that the frequency ranges in which Type-I and Type-II neurons are sensitive to weak signals are quite different. In this regard, our research provides important insights into the possible roles of chaotic resonance in the weak signal encoding of different types of neurons.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy model-based H ∞ H∞ control problem for networked singularly perturbed systems (SPSs) under fading channel. To prevent data collision, a weighted try-once-discard (WTOD) communication scheme is adopted to adjust the communication sequence of sensor nodes. Based on this transmission strategy, only one sensor with more considerable difference is allowed to be transmitted at each time instant. On the other hand, a time-varying stochastic process model is introduced to describe the behavior of the fading channels in unreliable networks. Based on fading state signal and known bounds, the imperfectly matched membership functions (MFs) are reconstructed in the controller. Accordingly, under the effect of fading channels and WTOD protocol, a new IT2 fuzzy controller is constructed for the networked IT2 fuzzy SPSs. Meanwhile, by constructing a singular perturbation parameter (SPP) dependent Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the mean square stability of networked IT2 fuzzy SPSs, and the numerical stiffness issue is avoided. Finally, the practicability of the proposed methods is proved through a tunnel diode circuit simulation.},

Its background belongs to the framework of local kernel-based interpolation methods. Indeed, even if the latter needs to be accurately tailored for gaussian process regression, the KEPU scheme provides a global estimator which is constructed by gluing together the local Kriging predictors via compactly supported weights. The added value of this investigation is twofold. On the one hand, our theoretical studies about the propagation of the uncertainties from the local predictors to the global one offer the opportunity to define the PU method in a stochastic framework and hence to provide confidence intervals for the PU approximant. On the other hand, as confirmed by extensive numerical experiments, when the number of instances grows, such a method enables us to significantly reduce the usually high complexity cost of fitting via gaussian processes.},

  abstract     = {Inferring microbial community structure based on temporal metagenomics data is an important goal in microbiome studies. The deterministic generalized Lotka–Volterra (GLV) differential equations have been commonly used to model the dynamics of microbial taxa. However, these approaches fail to take random environmental fluctuations into account and usually ignore the compositional nature of relative abundance data, which may deteriorate the estimates. In this article, we consider the microbial dynamics in terms of relative abundances by introducing a reference taxon, and propose a new proportional stochastic GLV (pSGLV) differential equation model, where the random perturbations of Brownian motion in this model can naturally account for the external environmental effects on the microbial community. We establish conditions and show some mathematical properties of the solutions including general existence and uniqueness, stochastic ultimate boundedness, stochastic permanence, the existence of stationary distribution, and ergodicity property. We further develop approximate maximum likelihood estimators (AMLEs) based on discrete observations and systematically investigate the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. At last, numerical simulations support our theoretical findings and our method is demonstrated through an application to the well-known “moving picture” temporal microbial dataset.},

The first strategy consists in the addition of closure/correction terms to the governing equations, which are built from the available data. The second strategy includes turbulence modeling by adding eddy viscosity terms , which are determined by using machine learning techniques. The two strategies are combined for the first time in this paper to investigate a two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at R e = 50 , 000 Re=50,000 .

  abstract     = {Discriminatory behavior can occur suddenly in association with an external shock that amplifies discrimination and prejudice, such as the election of politicians who tolerate or encourage discrimination. Consequently, discrimination can become more normalized in society. Using population dynamics, we modeled discriminatory behavior and the dynamics of prejudicial attitudes to explain such social shifts. In this model, we consider the propagation of discrimination behaviors via two types of social contagion, including direct or immediate, which is rapidly evoked by observing others’ discriminatory actions (behavior-to-behavior), and indirect or slow, via social learning of prejudice from others’ actions and speech (behavior-to-attitude). The latter mediates people’s behavior, which reflects their prejudice. An analysis of the equilibrium status of this model illustrates how social conditions mediate whether an external shock normalizes discrimination and prejudice beyond what was already established in the society. We show that transitions between stable points caused by external shocks in a bistable system can describe drastic social changes. This bistability emerges when discrimination evokes discriminatory behavior from observers. Then, discrimination inhibitors, such as anti-discriminatory education, determine whether prejudice spreads through discriminatory behavior. This result can contribute to explanations of how societies such as countries or social media spaces exhibit fragility to external shocks, and suggests implications for estimating social parameters linked to discrimination and prejudice in future research.},

When a component fails during the repairman’s unavailability, it will be waiting until the repairmen becomes available. The failure of a component may be caused by its intrinsic characteristics such as ageing and deterioration or extrinsic factors such as shocks. It is assumed that a component will fail once the magnitude of a shock is greater than a threshold. At any time, a component is at one of the three states: working, waiting for repair, and under repair. For some systems, we need to obtain reliability indices for practical use.

New criteria to guarantee the H ∞ H∞ admissibility for the fuzzy time-varying delayed singular impulsive jump systems are obtained by establishing the improved timer-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional. The singular value decomposition technique is utilized to eliminate internal impulses, and the memory fuzzy state-feedback controller is successfully designed by using parallel distribution compensation technique to inhibit the effects of external unstable impulses and time-varying delays. The gains of the desired memory fuzzy state-feedback controller are obtained through solving linear matrix inequalities . Finally, the rightness and validity of the obtained results are demonstrated by two simulation examples containing the bio-economic system.},

For this purpose, a barotropic three-component model assuming instantaneous kinematic and mechanical equilibria is discussed. The mathematical properties of the system, the structure of the waves, the expression of the Riemann invariants and the existence of a mathematical entropy are thus examined. The link between the present model and the extension to three components of the Kapila model is discussed. An HLLC-type solver for the present three-component model based on the mathematical structure of the system is then described. The multi-fluid solver used is coupled with an updated Lagrangian approach used for the structural domain. Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach and Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) are here considered and compared for their capability to account for fluid-structure interactions (FSI). A series of Riemann problems with available analytical solutions are regarded to assess the used numerical approaches : Eulerian on fixed grids, ALE on moving grids and IBM with independent fluid and structure meshes. Finally, ALE and IBM methods are used to simulate an experimental configuration involving complex FSI problems with a multi-material flow and structural plastic deformations. The numerical results presented show a good agreement with the experimental data .},

The retailer would like to make promotional investments to boost the market and the manufacturer determines whether to encroach the market directly. In the face of the channel competition and cannibalization, coupled with demand uncertainty, the retailer is considered to be risk averse and this attitude is measured by the CVaR method. In particular, the impacts of manufacturer encroachment and cooperative advertising on supply chain participants’ performance are explored. The results show that without cost-sharing contract, the manufacturer and the entire supply chain can benefit from the manufacturer&#39;s encroachment whereas the retailer always suffers. However, the retailer&#39;s risk-averse behavior can alleviate the profit loss. Furthermore, we find that under the cost-sharing contract, both of the chain members can achieve pareto improvement when the manufacturer encroaches the market.},

For each control scheme, with the aid of the dynamic linearization technique, the nonlinear system is transformed into an equivalent linear data model. In such a transformation, the nonlinear characteristic of systems is compressed into a time-varying parameter. Then, with the help of the introduction of the observer method, the tracking control problem can be converted into an optimization problem and the controller parameters can be obtained by using the LMI technique. This conversion cannot only reduce the complexity of the stability analysis but also find the appropriate controller parameters, especially for the MIMO case . Finally, three examples with comparisons are provided to illustrate the validity of the devised MFAC schemes.},

By introducing the hierarchical control scheme, a distributed adaptive event-triggered fault-tolerant control method is proposed. The upper layer and the lower layer comprise the hierarchical control structure. The upper layer is made up of a virtual reference system and a distributed cooperative controller with event-triggered mechanism, while the lower layer is composed of an actual system and a fault-tolerant tracking controller. The main contribution of this work is that the phenomena of fault propagation could be prevented employing presented control method when compared to the most commonly used distributed fault-tolerant control methods. And continuous transmission between agents can be eliminated due to the event-triggered mechanism. It is shown that the consensus error converges to zero asymptotically. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical result is illustrated by a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {A complex dynamic interplay exists between epidemic transmission and vaccination, which is significantly influenced by human behavioral responses. We construct a research framework combining both the function modeling of the cumulative global COVID-19 information and limited individuals’ information processing capacity employing the Gompertz model for growing processes. Meanwhile, we built a function representing the decision to get vaccinated following benefit-cost analysis considered the choices made by people in each scenario have an influence from altruism, free-riding and immunity escaping capacity. Through the mean-field calculation analysis and using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with constant step size, we obtain plots from numerical simulations. We found that only when the total number of infectious individuals proves sufficient to reach and exceed a certain level will the individuals face a better trade-off in determining whether to get vaccinated against the diseases based on that information. Besides, authoritative media have a higher decisive influence and efforts should be focused on extending the duration of vaccine protection, which is beneficial to inhibit the outbreaks of epidemics. Our work elucidates that reducing the negative payoff brought about by the free-riding behavior for individuals or improving the positive payoff from the altruistic motivation helps to control the disease in cultures that value social benefits, vaccination willingness is generally stronger. We also note that at a high risk of infection, the decision of vaccination is highly correlated with global epidemic information concerning COVID-19 infection, while at times of lower risk, it depends on the game theoretic vaccine strategy. The findings demonstrate that improving health literacy, ensuring open and transparent information on vaccine safety and efficacy as a public health priority can be an effective strategy for mitigating inequalities in health education, as well as alleviating the phenomenon that immunity escaping abilities is more likely to panic by populations with high levels of education. In addition, prosocial nudges are great ways to bridge these immunity gaps that can contribute to implementing government public health control measures , creating a positive feedback loop.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a new approach to detect clusters in undirected graphs with attributed vertices. We incorporate structural and attribute similarities between the vertices in an augmented graph by creating additional vertices and edges as proposed in [1, 2]. The augmented graph is then embedded in a Euclidean space associated to its Laplacian and we cluster vertices via a modified K-means algorithm, using a new vector-valued distance in the embedding space. Main novelty of our method, which can be classified as an early fusion method , i.e., a method in which additional information on vertices are fused to the structure information before applying clustering, is the interpretation of attributes as new realizations of graph vertices, which can be dealt with as coordinate vectors in a related Euclidean space. This allows us to extend a scalable generalized spectral clustering procedure which substitutes graph Laplacian eigenvectors with some vectors, named algebraically smooth vectors , obtained by a linear-time complexity Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) method. We discuss the performance of our proposed clustering method by comparison with recent literature approaches and public available results. Extensive experiments on different types of synthetic datasets and real-world attributed graphs show that our new algorithm, embedding attributes information in the clustering, outperforms structure-only-based methods, when the attributed network has an ambiguous structure. Furthermore, our new method largely outperforms the method which originally proposed the graph augmentation, showing that our embedding strategy and vector-valued distance are very effective in taking advantages from the augmented-graph representation.},

  abstract     = {Flows in rivers can be strongly affected by obstacles to flow or artificial structures such as bridges, weirs and dams. This is especially true during floods, where significant backwater effects or diversion of flow out of bank can result. However, within contemporary industry practice, linear features such as bridges are often modelled using coarse approximations, empirically based methods or are omitted entirely. Presented within this paper is a novel Riemann solver which is capable of modelling the influence of such features within hydrodynamic flood models using finite volume schemes to solve the shallow water equations. The solution procedure represents structures at the interface between neighbouring cells and uses a combination of internal boundary conditions and a different form of the conservation laws in the adjacent cells to resolve numerical fluxes across the interface. Since the procedure only applies to the cells adjacent to the interface at which a structure is being modelled, the method is therefore potentially compatible with existing hydrodynamic models. Comparisons with validation data collected from a state of the art research flume demonstrate that the solver is suitable for modelling a range of flow conditions and structure configurations such as bridges and gates.},

The degrees of freedom are point values at cell interfaces and moments of the solution inside the cell. To lowest ( 3 rd 3rd ) order this method reduces to the Active Flux method. The update of the moments is achieved immediately by integrating the conservation law over the cell, integrating by parts and employing the continuity across cell interfaces. We propose two ways how the point values can be updated in time: either by first deriving a semi-discrete method that uses a finite-difference-type formula to approximate the spatial derivative , and integrating this method e.g. with a Runge-Kutta scheme, or by using a characteristics-based update, which is inspired by the original (fully discrete) Active Flux method.

Under the assumption that the rope length is fixed with small swing angles, a linearized model is derived. The system has four states; two actuated states: position x x and y y , and two un-actuated states, which are the rope angles θ x θx and θ y θy . The adaptive reinforcement learning controller is designed to handle the effects of measurement noises and outliers. We propose a model-free; hence it does not require precise knowledge of the system dynamics. When the state information is not available, a Kalman filter estimator is equipped with a dynamical saturation function to attenuate the effects of measurement noises and to remove outliers. A simulation study is established to illustrate the influence and robustness of the developed controller, and it can enhance the tracking trajectory under different scenarios to test the scheme.},

We conduct a simulation study with various trajectory degradation models reflecting typical limitations found in a single particle tracking experiment.

By virtue of stochastic maximum principle and optimal filter technique, we obtain a Hamiltonian system first, which is a fully-coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE). Decoupling the Hamiltonian system, we obtain three ordinary differential equations (ODEs), a forward and a backward optimal filtering equations, which enable us to derive an optimal control of an auxiliary limiting control problem. Next, we verify that a decentralized control strategy is an ϵ ϵ -Nash equilibrium of the LQ game. Finally, we solve a product pricing problem and a network security control problem in applications. We give a near-optimal price strategy and a near-optimal control strategy with numerical simulations, respectively.},

For this problem, we first propose a simple and effective splitting (SP) method according to its own structure, and prove that it converges for any initial value. Further, to avoid implementing some matrix multiplications and calculating the inverse of large matrix, and considering the acceleration and efficiency of the randomized strategy, we develop two randomized iterative methods on the basis of the SP method as well as the randomized Kaczmarz, Gauss-Seidel and coordinate descent methods, and describe their convergence properties. Numerical results show that our three methods all have quite decent performance in both computing time and iteration numbers compared with the latest iterative method of the ILS problem, and also demonstrate that the two randomized methods indeed yield significant acceleration in terms of computing time.},

  abstract     = {The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme is a famous shock-capturing scheme, but for high-precision numerical simulation, the classical WENO scheme is always considered to have excessive dissipation and insufficient resolution near discontinuities. Improving the accuracy order or reducing the dissipation of the WENO by optimizing the linear weights can effectively improve the resolution of this scheme in the smooth regions. However, under the same method, the improvement of shock-capturing abilities is generally limited and may lead to numerical oscillations. In order to simultaneously improve the resolution in discontinuous regions and ensure the performance of the smooth regions, this study uses the shock detector to combine the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing (THINC) scheme, which is a better discontinuity-capturing scheme, with a given WENO discretization , such as the improved fast WENO (IFWENO) scheme that equips with high economy and does not loss accuracy at any critical point . The hybrid method in this study is an apriori algorithm, which is more efficient and universal than the method in (Takagi et al. J. Comput. Phys. 452(2022)110899). Additionally, the performance of the THINC scheme in different regions near the discontinuity is analyzed in detail through numerical experiments, and a shock detector that can fully exploit the advantages of the THINC scheme is provided. By using this shock detector, several one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical cases are employed to verify that the hybrid scheme can greatly improve the performance in discontinuities without affecting the flow structure in the smooth regions, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed shock detector and the excellence of the hybrid IFWENO-THINC scheme.},

  abstract     = {In the urban street network domain, there is growing interest in extending conventional centrality measures to incorporate node-specific information (such as georeferenced socioeconomic data) in order to help identify important locations in an urban environment. One such centrality measure that is gaining attention is the Adapted PageRank Algorithm (APA) model. However, a fundamental concern with the APA model is the notion of teleportation because it means the random walker is equally likely to jump or ‘teleport’ to any intersection (node) in the street network, regardless of how far away it is. In this paper, we propose a centrality model that overcomes this counterintuitive idea. More specifically, we extend the APA model by modifying the jumping probabilities so that the random walker is more inclined to jump to a nearby intersection than a distant intersection. We accomplish this using non-local random walks which allow a random walker to jump to any node in the network with probabilities that depend on the distance separating the nodes. To demonstrate the differences between the two models, we present and discuss experimental results for a small ten node graph and a real-world urban street network.},

  abstract     = {Under given social dilemma, different individuals perhaps have different perceptions for the dilemma intensity. Generally speaking, the degree of individual’s perception should be closely related to its ability, the stronger the ability of individual, the weaker the perception for the dilemma intensity will be. On the other hand, the competent individuals may be more likely to carry out altruistic cooperation behavior than those who are relatively lacking in ability. Considering these facts, we introduce an evolutionary game model in which individual can adaptively switch between two payoff matrices with different temptations based on aspiration to explore the cooperation dynamics in spatial prisoner’s dilemma. In this model, two different payoff matrices are denoted by M w Mw and M s Ms respectively, the temptation value of the former is small, and the one of the latter is large. For the individual who has adopted M w Mw to interact, the higher the individual is satisfied with the current payoff, the lower the probability of switching to M s Ms in the next round, while for the individual who has adopted M s Ms to interact, the higher the individual is satisfied with the current payoff, the higher the probability of switching to M w Mw in the next round. Experimental results show that this mechanism of adaptive switching between payoff matrices with different temptations can effectively promote the cooperation of spatial prisoner’s dilemma, and the appropriate aspiration level of individual can provide the most favorable environment for the diffusion of cooperation. The difference in the perception for dilemma intensity will be a new perspective in the study of networked evolution game.},

  abstract     = {The study of behavioral propagation is taken more into account intimate heterogeneity on social networks. Meanwhile, with the development of information technology, people present a multiplicity of social ways, i.e., individuals normally receive or spread information on different social networks. More importantly, the behavioral preference of heterogenous population lacks in-depth research on the information propagation. Firstly, a multi-layer network with edge weighted distribution is considered. Then, we build a trapezoid-like and a triangle-like probability functions to represent individual continuous fashion trend (ICFT) and individual fashion passion trend (IFPT) behaviors separately, defining the adoption behavior preference of different population. Furthermore, a generalized edge-based compartmental theory including edge weight, ICFT and IFPT thresholds is proposed to reveal the behavioral preference. Through simulated experiments, decreasing the proportion of sensitive individuals can raise a hybrid phase transition, in which the final adoption size first increases continuously at the first critical value, and then increases discontinuously at the second critical value. Moreover, when the proportion of sensitive individuals is fixed, the strong adoption capacity of individuals can induce a discontinuous phase transition. Contrarily, the weak adoption capacity of individuals can induce a continuous phase transition. Finally, the edge weight and degree heterogeneity can alter the behavioral propagation on social networks.},

In addition, a novel integral sliding surface is proposed to guarantee that the consensus error is asymptotically stable when agents move on the sliding surface. Based on such a sliding manifold combined with the proposed DTDO, a distributed sliding mode controller is constructed.

Firstly, the interval fixation probability of the Moran process is derived under weak selection. Secondly, the conditions and the degrees of possibility for the dominant strategy in the population are calculated and the interval evolutionary equilibrium strategy is obtained. Then, the evolutionary game model under the prisoner’s dilemma is studied with the interval Moran process. Finally, the evolutionary process of the enterprise epidemic prevention strategy is studied with an evolutionary game model based on the interval Moran process. In addition, the influence of the uncertainty of local government regulation and public supervision on the choice of enterprise epidemic prevention strategies is analyzed by comparing numerical examples, and the superiority of the method in practical application is verified.},

In this paper, aim to obtain the reliability of various graphs (e.g. interconnection networks and data center networks), we propose two kinds of graphs (resp. networks)—matching recursive graphs (MRGs) and recursive networks based on connected graphs (RNCGs). We prove that these two kinds of graphs have smaller diameters. Furthermore, we study their reliabilities, including connectivities and diagnosabilities.

The model introduces a phase-field variable to distinguish the crystalline and amorphous phases of polymers. The phase-field evolution equation is coupled with the heat conduction equation that considers the latent heat of crystallization. The evolution equations introduce both the dimensionless diffusivity and latent heat that are dependent on the crystallization temperature. A high-order finite difference-based numerical framework is applied to the phase-field model. Both the qualitative simulation results of the phase-field model such as the crystal morphologies and the quantitative results including the radial crystal growth rate, degree of crystallinity, and lamellar thickness are validated against experiments. The simulation for single-crystal growth shows that a high crystallization temperature results in a large crystal with a slow radial growth rate. The simulation for multi-crystal growth shows that the crystals impinge on each other and finally fill the whole domain during crystallization, which further demonstrates the capability of the model in simulating the spherulite growth during isothermal crystallization of polymer melts.},

  abstract     = {The Compact Accurately Boundary-Adjusting high-REsolution Technique (CABARET) method for 3D gas dynamics equations is generalised to rotating hexahedral mesh zones using the sliding interface approach, which extends applications of the original algorithm to a wide range of unsteady rotor flow problems. Important properties of the suggested extension of the CABARET scheme include the preservation of good linear dispersion and dissipation properties of the original CABARET method on fixed grids. To strictly preserve flux conservation at the sliding interface, the so-called supermesh approach is implemented that uses the projection of the contact faces on both sides of the sliding interface onto an intermediate virtual surface. The implementation is based on applying the sub-cell and sub-face solution reconstruction on the sliding interface of hexahedral meshes rather than deforming unstructured meshes. The sub-faces are defined by constructing projection overlap polygons using the Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm. A local characteristic flux splitting is applied at each overlap polygon face, while updating the local stencil connectivity table at each time step. To further improve the dispersion properties of the CABARET grid at small Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy numbers, the dispersion-improved version of the CABARET method previously developed on rectangular Cartesian meshes is extended to non-uniform curvilinear meshes typical of open-rotor applications. Numerical examples are provided for the analytical problem of normal acoustic wave propagation through a rotating cylindrical grid zone embedded in an outer stationary grid. The error decay rates are calculated and compared with the theoretical order of CABARET convergence. In addition, the same algorithm accelerated on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) is applied for simulations the flow around a generic two-bladed rotor in hover in the Wall Model Large Eddy Simulation framework. For the latter case, flow solutions are analysed, and their numerical grid sensitivity is discussed.},

The activity-driven model, a type of temporal network, offers an excellent framework to study epidemic processes in dynamical interaction. In this work, we study how social attitudes affect the transmission of infectious diseases in activity-driven networks. Here, we divide a population into “risk-ignorant” and “risk-averse”, in which risk-averse individuals will reduce their social intensity (Social intensity refers to the number of social contacts in the social process) and risk-ignorant individuals will not. A parameter p p controls the proportion of risk-averse individuals, and therefore risk-ignorant individuals by 1- p p . With the aid of mean-field theory, we calculate epidemic thresholds, as well as validate theoretical predictions with extensive Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown numerically and theoretically that reducing the social intensity and increasing the number of risk-averse individuals are effective ways of controlling epidemic outbreaks. An appropriate proportion of the risk-averse individual will lead to an epidemic die-out, which is based on a small spreading rate. Our research provides a new perspective for understanding the effect of the population with different social attitudes in the epidemic process.},

  abstract     = {We generalize and provide a linear algebra-based perspective on a finite element (FE) homogenization scheme, pioneered by Schneider et al. (2017)[1] and Leuschner and Fritzen (2018)[2]. The efficiency of the scheme is based on a preconditioned, well-scaled reformulation allowing for the use of the conjugate gradient or similar iterative solvers. The geometrically-optimal preconditioner—a discretized Green’s function of a periodic homogeneous reference problem—has a block-diagonal structure in the Fourier space which permits its efficient inversion using fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques for generic regular meshes. This implies that the scheme scales as O ( n log ( n ) ) O(nlog(n)) , like FFT, rendering it equivalent to spectral solvers in terms of computational efficiency. However, in contrast to classical spectral solvers, the proposed scheme works with FE shape functions with local supports and does not exhibit the Fourier ringing phenomenon. We show that the scheme achieves a number of iterations that are almost independent of spatial discretization . The scheme also scales mildly with phase contrast. We also discuss the equivalence between our displacement-based scheme and the recently proposed strain-based homogenization technique with finite-element projection.},

This model is built on the microscopic Arrhenius dynamics along with the exclusion rule in which stochastic processes govern the individual movements depending on the relative distance to the room exit. Even though individual decision-making procedures can be complicated during the evacuation in an emergency, our model can quantitatively estimate the time for them to evacuate and predict the emerging patterns of the crowds during the process. The results exhibit the phenomena such that pedestrians spontaneously gather at the exit and form an arched shape close to the door. The DMC simulations and observations agree with the corresponding study in the literature. The DMC algorithm is computationally efficient due to its major property —“rejection-free”, which makes it a suitable tool to simulate evacuation dynamics for a large group of pedestrians.},

Compared to the traditional tracking control strategies, the proposed control scheme guarantees that the output tracking error of the high-order nonlinear system asymptotically converges to zero and is no longer limited to a time-varying compact domain. While ensuring that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, the controller also has sufficient ability to compensate for the unknown quantity, virtual control coefficient and parameter uncertainty of the system.

To cope with the limited network bandwidth, an event-triggered communication scheme is introduced in information exchange. Then, based on the delayed (i.e., single-point and two-point) bandit feedback, two event-triggered distributed online convex optimization algorithms are developed by utilizing the Bregman divergence in the projection step. Meanwhile, the convergence of the two developed algorithms is analyzed according to the provided static regret bounds achieved by the algorithm. The obtained results show that a sublinear static regret with respect to the time horizon T can be ensured if the triggering threshold gradually approaches zero. In this case, the corresponding order of the regret bounds is also determined by choosing suitable triggering thresholds. Finally, a distributed online regularized linear regression problem is provided as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed two algorithms.},

This motivates many scholars to design algorithms for finding the unique convex hull containing nodes of interest in a graph. In this paper, we propose two algorithms called, respectively, the node absorption algorithm (NA) and the inducing path absorption algorithm (IPA), to find the minimal convex subgraph containing variables of interest in an undirected graph. These algorithms can be used as potential tools to find the minimal sub-model including variables of interest onto which a graphical model of large-scale can be collapsible. Experiments show that the proposed IPA significantly outperforms the NA and other existing algorithms. Furthermore, we apply the IPA to a gene network so as to collapse a large network onto a smaller network including the interested variables, and thus to achieve the aim of structural dimension reduction.},

  abstract     = {Exploring the conditions under which cooperation can emerge in populations has long been a subject for humans. Fair preference psychology has been incorporated into the analytical framework of the public goods game. Based on considering the dynamic update of trust-driven investment willingness, we introduce a dynamic payoff allocation mechanism and loners to traditional PGG, explaining how the mechanism related to fairness preferences promotes cooperation. We assume that payoffs are equally allocated among players when the payoffs do not exceed the threshold. Otherwise, the excess portion is proportionally allocated according to the investment willingness of cooperators. The effects of parameter changes on the evolution of cooperation are investigated by conducting Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that introducing dynamic payoff allocation and loners can effectively promote cooperation in a specific range of parameters. Specifically, the existence of loners is a double-edged sword. Loners can prevent players from adopting defection behaviors on a large scale when the payoff of cooperation is unsatisfied and inhibit the emergence and diffusion of cooperative strategies as the payoff of cooperators increases. When the payoff of cooperation is dissatisfactory, the dynamic payoff allocation mechanism can promote the average investment willingness of cooperators to accelerate the spread of cooperation. However, the payoff reallocation coefficient should not be set too high, and a high-level threshold of payoff reallocation may lead to the failure of the dynamic payoff allocation mechanism. There is an optimal payoff reallocation coefficient to maximize the efficiency of the proposed mechanism. Moreover, the optimal payoff reallocation coefficient that can maximize the cooperation level is distinct for the diverse combination of enhancement factor and loss aversion coefficient. However, its value should be set at a low level in general.

This model is derived from variational principles complying with the second law of thermodynamics in isothermal situations, starting from biological constitutive assumptions on the tumor cells adhesion properties and on the infiltrative mechanics of tumor-induced vasculature in the tumor tissues, and takes the form of a coupled degenerate Cahn–Hilliard Keller–Segel system for the mixture components with reaction diffusion equations for the chemicals. The model is informed by neuroimaging data, which give informations about the patient-specific brain geometry and tissues microstructure, the distribution of the different tumor components, the white matter fiber orientations and the vasculature density. We describe specific and robust preprocessing steps to extract quantitative informations from the neuroimaging data and to construct a computational platform to solve the model on a patient-specific basis. We further introduce a finite element approximation of the model equations which preserve the qualitative properties of the continuous solutions. Finally, we show simulation results for the patient-specific tumor evolution of a patient affected by GlioBlastoma Multiforme, considering two different test cases before surgery, corresponding to situations with high or low nutrient supply inside the tumor, and a test case after surgery. We further perform a sensitivity based patient-specific parameters estimation based on longitudinal neuroimaging data for a test case with acquired data at two time points before surgery. We show that our model correctly predicts the overall extension of the tumor distribution and the intensity of the angiogenetic process, paving the way for assisting the clinicians in properly assessing the therapy outcomes and in designing optimal patient-specific therapeutic schedules.},

In this work, we strategically split the univariate Birkhoff rational interpolation into multiple subproblems, such that these subproblems can be linearized. Due to the interpolating function may not be unique, we innovatively introduce a special condition such that a recurrence solution formula can be constructed if the condition is satisfied. If we omit the special condition, we also propose a method to obtain the rational interpolating function through solving a linear system. The later method tends to give a lower degree interpolating function with better approximation accuracy and while the former tends to provide less computing cost. Experiments show the efficacies of these rational interpolating methods and indicate potential benefits of these methods over the polynomial interpolation method.},

Theoretically, we respectively prove that the condition numbers of preconditioned matrices have uniform upper bounds, which is independent of discretization step-sizes and fractional order.

Since the term “ stationary ” is used for such an AR vector process, its correlation matrices should “ somehow approach ” the correlation matrices of a stationary vector process, but the meaning of “ somehow approach ” has not been mathematically established in the literature. In the present paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions for AR vector processes to be “ stationary ”. These conditions show in which sense the correlation matrices of an AR “ stationary ” vector process asymptotically behave like block Toeplitz matrices .

  abstract     = {Linear and weakly nonlinear stability analyses of Darcy–Bénard convection of a Newtonian fluid undergoing combustion are investigated in the paper using a zeroth-order chemical reaction model. The Frank-Kamenetskii-Vadasz-Lorenz model that has in it the influence of combustion is derived and transformed into a Ginzburg–Landau equation using a method of multiscales. An analytical expression for the Frank-Kamenetskii-Darcy-Rayleigh number and the Hopf-Frank-Kamenetskii-Darcy-Rayleigh number is reported. In the limiting case, these expressions are validated with the results of previous investigations. Using an analytical solution of the Ginzburg–Landau equation, heat transport in the combusting fluid is studied. The clear blow-up of the Nusselt number in the post-ignition regime is shown. The overall effect of combustion is to advance the onset of regular convective and chaotic motions and to enhance the heat transport. The symmetry in the Frank-Kamenetskii-Vadasz-Lorenz model and its Hamiltonian nature are shown. The appearance of chaotic/periodic motion in the system for large values of the eigenvalue (with the butterfly diagram being trapped in an ellipsoidal region) are highlighted in the paper. One new feature in the problem is the favouring of prolonged periodic convection in a larger range of values of the scaled Darcy-Frank-Kamenetskii-Rayleigh number compared with no combustion. The exact nature of the influence of combustion on Darcy–Bénard convection is visualized with the help of a bivariate, least-squares surface fit of the data and some important conclusions are drawn.},

Based on the information from the considered system and reduced-order filter, an augmented filtering system is constructed. Then, a convex optimization problem is formulated by using Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory and stochastic analysis. The filter gain matrices are efficiently derived as a result, ensuring that the augmented filtering system is stochastically stable and strictly ( Q , S , R ) − γ (Q,S,R)−γ -dissipative.

For this purpose, a new interpolation is designed, which consists of a Gauß Lobatto interpolation in the layer, and a locally weighted L 2 L2 projection outside the layer. On that basis, by properly defining the penalty parameters at different nodes on a Shishkin mesh, we obtain the supercloseness of almost k + 1 2 k+12 order, and prove the convergence of optimal order in a balanced norm.

This work proposes a novel approach of formation control for a multi-agent system with target geometric configuration by combining dynamic model with graph realization. First, the global rigid graph is designed for the target formation pattern, then the interactive relationship and the expected distance between different intelligent agents are identified by the realization of graph. Secondly, the double-integrator dynamic model based on Newtonian mechanics is formulated for inherent driving force caused upon attenuation of potential energy, consistent of movement direction and speed. Thirdly, the stability of swarming motility is proved by Lyapunov’s second method, i.e., the movement of all agents will gradually stabilize to consistency of the movement direction and speed, and realize the target geometric configuration. Finally, numerical simulations of different geometric configurations are performed to verify the theoretical findings.},

Moreover, the stochastic system model suffers from unmeasured periodic disturbances in a nonlinear manner. By associating Fourier series expansion with fuzzy logic system, a novel function approximator is constructed to describe the packaged disturbance-dependent nonlinear functions . Meanwhile, a nonlinear filter is designed to avert the ”explosion of complexity” problem in conventional backstepping recursive design procedure. In addition, the proposed continuous controller is developed to event-triggered one. Then, it is proved that the consensus is achieved and the initial connectivity of communication graph is preserved in the sense of probability . In simulations, two examples are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocols.},

  abstract     = {As we all know, the reputation has important influence on individual’s decision-making. How to effectively and objectively measure reputation is very important in based-reputation evolutionary game theory . In this paper, a novel evolutionary mechanism for based on reputation consistent strategy times is proposed, in which the reputation income of each player is positive or negative related to its consistent strategy times for cooperation or defection at the initial moment of the current time step. The reward or punishment scheme of the proposed evolutionary mechanism is relatively consistent with the real world understanding of reputation. It’s especially worth pointing out that, when the player’s strategy state changes, the player can get reasonable and timely reward or punishment, which can better promote cooperation compared to existing reputation-based evolutionary mechanisms. Specifically, the proposed evolutionary mechanism has the following two advantages in the evolutionary systems. First, the player who has insisted on cooperation for a long time is not inclined to adopt defection, mainly because the cost of reputation is too high. In addition, the player who has long insisted on defection tends to adopt cooperation. This is mainly because the reputation of the player is easily restored from notoriety to general. Obviously, the above two points can effectively promote cooperation. Based on prisoner’s dilemma game (PDG) model, simulation and analysis also show that the proposed evolutionary mechanism can better promote cooperation compared to the traditional evolutionary mechanism, and can also speed up the evolutionary process, especially when the reputation factor is large. Furthermore, we also find that the cooperation level enhances when consistent strategy times upper bound becomes larger.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an interval observer has been presented for a type of multirate time-delayed systems subject to measurement outliers under the adaptive event-triggered protocol (AETP). First of all, the multirate sampling system is studied to meet the practical requirements. Meanwhile, for relieving the communication burden, an AETP is considered to schedule the measurement information received by the observer. The augmented system is built at a consistent sampling/update rate by using the lifting technique. Moreover, the occurrence of measurement outliers would pose some serious threats to the reliability of the systems. For the addressed issue, an outlier-resistant interval observer is developed by means of saturation function to weaken the impact of the measurement outliers. A sufficient condition is proposed by using the positive system theory and Lyapunov stability theory to ensure that the interval observer is effective and the error system is input-to-state stable. Besides, the gain matrices of the interval observer are obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed interval observer is verified by a numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {Fast Field-Cycling Nuclear Magnetic Resonance relaxometry is a non-destructive technique to investigate molecular dynamics and structure of systems having a wide range of applications such as environment, biology, and food. Besides a considerable amount of literature about modeling and application of such technique in specific areas, an algorithmic approach to the related parameter identification problem is still lacking. We believe that a robust algorithmic approach will allow a unified treatment of different samples in several application areas . In this paper, we model the parameters identification problem as a constrained L 1 L1 -regularized non-linear least squares problem. Following the approach proposed in [ Analytical Chemistry 2021 93 (24)], the non-linear least squares term imposes data consistency by decomposing the acquired relaxation profiles into relaxation contributions associated with 1 H − 1 H 1H−1H and 1 H − 14 N 1H−14N dipole-dipole interactions. The data fitting and the L 1 L1 -based regularization terms are balanced by the so-called regularization parameter. For the parameters identification, we propose an algorithm that computes, at each iteration, both the regularization parameter and the model parameters. In particular, the regularization parameter value is updated according to a Balancing Principle and the model parameters values are obtained by solving the corresponding L 1 L1 -regularized non-linear least squares problem by means of the non-linear Gauss-Seidel method. We analyse the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and run extensive testing on synthetic and real data .

Meanwhile, the delay-dependent impulse and switching behavior are permitted to arise asynchronously. In other words, the impulses can arise many times or not once within a period of switching interval. For impulsive signals, A fresh idea called admissible edge-dependent average impulsive interval (AED-AII) is addressed according to properties of edges. By developing the multiple Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (MLKFs), merged with the AED-ADT switching scheme and AED-AII method, some ameliorated criteria in accordance with the ISS of hybrid delayed systems are established with regard to stabilizing and destabilizing impulses. Compared with previous work, our setup enjoys the important features: the candidate functions fully taps the effect of the delay existing in the system dynamics and impulse on the function part of the MLKFs; the AED-AII method combined with the AED-ADT switching scheme in our paper contains a larger group of the impulsive and switching signals; and for the case in which all the subsystems are unstable, the stability criterion is suitable for the arbitrary time delay. Finally, an example shows that the results of this paper are effective.},

The key difficulty is that the initial behaviour of the moving boundary is parabolic-logarithmic, rather than algebraic, which has more often than not been the case in similar problems. A small-time analysis of the problem hints at how the usual boundary immobilization formalism can be recovered, and this is subsequently verified through numerical experiments. The relevance of these results to other moving boundary problems from the literature is also discussed.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the dynamic event-triggered adaptive tracking control problem is investigated via backstepping technology for uncertain stochastic nonlinear systems. First, the stochastic nonlinear system with unknown parameter is considered. By introducing an additional dynamic variable, a dynamic event-triggered adaptive controller is designed such that the closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded in the sense of the fourth moment. Then, a more general partially unknown stochastic nonlinear system is further considered, and the designed adaptive neural network control scheme ensures that the closed-loop signals are fourth moment semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The proposed dynamic event-triggering mechanism (DETM) guarantees that the lengths of time intervals between each two consecutive events are lower-bounded by a positive constant. It is necessary to point out that the DETM is better at saving resources than the static event-triggering mechanism (SETM). Finally, two simulations are conducted to show the validity of the control strategies for these two systems, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The literature on game-theoretic models of opinion dynamics in social networks mainly focuses on the Nash equilibrium , which reflects a competitive situation between influencing agents called players. In some real-world situations, however, players negotiate over a game; thus, a different type of solution needs to be considered to account for possible outcomes. In this paper, we examine an opinion dynamics game based on the Friedkin–Johnsen model for which we characterize the Pareto frontier, including the Nash bargaining solution. Next, we analyze this solution when there are changes in the susceptibility of noninfluencing agents with respect to their initial opinions. We also quantify how the Nash equilibrium outcome differs from the outcome prescribed by the Nash bargaining solution.},

  abstract     = {The Poisson process is one of the simplest stochastic processes defined in continuous time, having interesting mathematical properties, leading, in many situations, to applications mathematically treatable. One of the limitations of the Poisson process is the rare events hypothesis; which is the hypothesis of unitary jumps within an infinitesimal window of time. Although that restriction may be avoided by the compound Poisson process, in most situations, we don’t have a closed expression for the probability distribution of the increments of such processes, leaving us options such as working with probability generating functions , numerical analysis and simulations. It is with this motivation in mind, inspired by the recent developments of discrete distributions, that we propose a new counting process based on the Bell–Touchard probability distribution, naming it the Bell–Touchard process. We verify that the process is a compound Poisson process, a multiple Poisson process and that it is closed for convolution plus decomposition operations. Besides, we show that the Bell–Touchard process arises naturally from the composition of two Poisson processes. Moreover, we propose two generalizations; namely, the compound Bell–Touchard process and the non-homogeneous Bell–Touchard process, showing that the last one arises from the composition of a non-homogeneous Poisson process along with a homogeneous Poisson process . We emphasize that since previous works have been shown that the Bell–Touchard probability distribution can be used quite effectively for modelling count data , the Bell–Touchard process and its generalizations may contribute to the formulation of mathematical treatable models where the rare events hypothesis is not suitable.},

Second, based on the smooth switch function (SSF), a novel fuzzy adaptive finite-time control algorithm is recursively fabricated, which availably surmounted the singularity hindrance derived from the differentiating virtual control law. Furthermore, the proposed output feedback control approach can steer the tracking error into an arbitrarily small residual set in a finite time. In addition, different switched filters and controllers are introduced to reduce the conservatism and restriction caused by employing the common filter and controller for different subsystems. Ultimately, the theoretical findings are validated through two simulation examples.},

In order to solve this difficulty, a hierarchical framework is introduced. The basic idea is to design distributed resilient observers under directed topologies and DoS attacks. By virtue of switching systems theory, the upper bounds of attack frequency and attack duration are obtained. Based on neural networks approximation technique and model reference tracking method, a novel output-feedback FTC scheme is proposed.

Subsequently, the synchronization results with state-flipped control of the above system is further extended to more general BNs by analyzing the synchronous flip sequence. Meanwhile, some algorithms are developed to find and determine the corresponding sequence of synchronous flips and the set of minimum synchronous flips.

First, considering the characteristics of aperiodic DoS attacks, an appropriate feedback controller is designed according to that whether it is attacked or not. Furthermore, the finite-time stability criteria of closed-loop system are derived by means of iterative technique and multiple Lyapunov functions.

Based on the Lyapunov methods, several sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the FTS and FTCS . In the framework of finite-time, two relationships between impulsive disturbance, aperiodic control periods, and aperiodic control widths are established to guarantee the FTS and FTCS for the system, respectively. Moreover, such two relationships can potentially increase the freedom of the designed control periods and control widths. Finally, two numerical simulations and a practical application are given to show the validity of the aperiodic intermittent controller.},

The reconstruction applies a modification locally on a preliminary reconstructed surface gradient in every cell to yield a convexity property of the sampled point value in the forward and backward projections. The water mass conservation is proved by rewriting the scheme in a conservation form. The modification does not change the preliminary reconstructed slope of water surface for the lake-at-rest steady state and then keeps the well-balancing property of the surface gradient method. The convexity property ensures the nonnegativity of the updated water depth under a large CFL number which yields a considerable speed-up. The numerical experiments are shown to demonstrate the robustness of the scheme.},

As long as the agent is working, the agent can choose one of two jobs at any time, and this choice is reversible . However, once the decision to retire is made, the agent is no longer able to work, so this decision is irreversible . We use the martingale method and study the dual problem expressed as an optimal stopping problem. By characterizing two wealth boundaries arising from the labor flexible features, we show that there is job switching during the working time and that the retirement option is exercised under the job with a higher leisure rate. We also show that the presence of the job switching opportunity makes the agent work longer with an increased retirement boundary. Based on a closed-form solution, we discuss some properties of the optimal consumption and risky investment under the proposed labor flexible model.},

This work was dictated by the fact that geometrically Intrinsic Shallow Water Equations (ISWE) are characterized by non-autonomous fluxes. Handling of non-autonomous fluxes is an open question for schemes based on Riemann solvers (exact or approximate). Using a local curvilinear reference system anchored on the bottom surface, we develop an effective first-order and high-resolution space-time discretization of the no-flow surfaces and solve a Lagrangian initial value problem that describes the evolution of the balance laws governing the geometrically intrinsic shallow water equations. The evolved solution set is then projected back to the original surface grid to complete the proposed Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation. The resulting scheme maintains monotonicity and captures shocks without providing excessive numerical dissipation also in the presence of non-autonomous fluxes such as those arising from the geometrically intrinsic shallow water equation on variable topographies. We provide a representative set of numerical examples to illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation for two-dimensional surfaces with general curvatures and discontinuous initial conditions.},

If they are amplified, then traffic jams will occur. In this paper, we propose a suitable notion of string stability for continuum models of traffic flows, and study what kinds of driving behaviors lead to string stability or instability. We find that the well-known Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model and Aw-Rascle-Zhang model are string stable for wide classes of perturbations. As a consequence, the driving behaviors described by these models suppress speed oscillations and hence do not cause traffic jams. Once the hysteresis behavior is added to the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model, an example is given to show that string instability can occur for large perturbations, leading to phantom jams. Under small perturbations, however, examples as well as approximate solution analysis suggest that the hysteretic traffic flow is string stable. The approximation solution analysis is developed to replace linear stability analysis, as hysteretic flow model cannot be linearized.},

Previous approaches rely on Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta schemes; in general, compared to explicit schemes , IMEX methods need to apply the recovery (which can be very expensive computationally) of the primitive variables from the conserved ones in numerous additional times. Moreover, the use of an iterative process for the recovery could have potential convergence problems , increased by the additional number of required loops. In addition, the computational cost of the previous IMEX approach in comparison with the standard explicit methods is much higher. The MIRK methods are able to deal with stiff terms producing stable numerical evolutions, minimize the number of recoveries needed in comparison with IMEX methods, their computational cost is similar to the standard explicit methods and can actually be easily implemented in numerical codes which previously used explicit schemes. Two standard numerical tests are shown in the manuscript.},

In this paper, we show that strong traces for certain 2-connected plane graphs (allowed to have multiple edges) can be obtained using thickened graphs (sometimes called ribbon graphs) constructed with only two types of junctions : 0-crossing junction and special d ( v ) d(v) -crossing junction (called π π -junction ), where d ( v ) d(v) is the degree of the vertex v v at which the d ( v ) d(v) -crossing junction is to be placed. The π π -junctions are only applicable to vertices with odd degrees ( ≥ 3 ≥3 ). We characterize the 2-connected plane graphs to which our approach can be applied and provide a brief guideline for the implementation of our method. This approach provides the theory, as well as a set of candidates, for designing and constructing stable DNA and polypeptide molecules needing only a method capable of creating the 0-crossing and π π -junctions in a 2-connected plane graph.},

Secondly, under the extensive in-degree balance condition for cooperative-competitive network, an appropriate distributed control protocol is designed to guarantee that MASs can achieve group/group-bipartite scaled consensus by introducing cooperative-competitive matrix and scaling parameter matrix. Furthermore, to guarantee the faster convergence of MASs, we further improve and optimize the acyclic partition strategy by rich algebra and graph theories in three aspects: the selection of sub-root nodes, the division of multi-reachable nodes and the selection of directed spanning tree in each subnetwork.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of state feedback control for a class of polytopic uncertain continuous-time singular systems with input quantization and actuator faults. The aim of this paper is to design the reliable controller and dynamic quantizer that ensure the considered closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and satisfies the prescribed induced L ∞ L∞ performance constraint. The introduced proportional plus derivative state feedback controller can eliminate the structural restrictions of the system matrices, thus a more general sufficient condition is obtained for the problem. Finally, the four-mesh circuit is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed induced L ∞ L∞ control approach.},

The FDI attacks on the actuator channel and sensor channel are considered simultaneously, and the attack signals acting on the system side are regarded as time-varying signals. Firstly, a novel adjustable proportional-integral multivariable observer (APIMO) scheme is designed to synchronously reconstitute the system states , actuator FDI attacks, and sensor FDI attacks. In particular, the impacts of instantaneous increment of attack signals are attenuated, which enables the proposed APIMO scheme more advantageous in reconstituting time-varying attack signals. Secondly, incorporating a robust attenuation technique, an APIMO-based security controller with corrective capability is designed, such that the discrete-time CPSs achieve asymptotic stability with H ∞ H∞ performance index. Finally, the simulation example and experiment compared with existing results are realized to examine the feasibility and advantages of the developed strategy.},

Considering the problem of multiple actuator failures, the bound for sum of the failure parameters are estimated rather than the parameters themselves, an infinite number of actuator failures can be handled. To improve the performance of the system, based on actor-critic neural networks (NNs) and optimized backstepping control (OBC), RL is introduced to optimize the tracking errors and inputs. By introducing an intermediate controller, the controllers derived from RL algorithm and the fault-tolerant controller are isolated, the difficulties of using RL in fault-tolerant control (FTC) are reduced. In addition, an initial unbounded boundary function is used so that the initial value of the error does not need to be within a prescribed range, not only the tracking error can be reduced to the prescribed accuracy, but also all closed-loop signals are bounded. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm are verified by two examples.},

However, they lack computational efficiency, and the accurate prediction of materials’ properties still remains a great challenge. To enhance performance of the LPMF PBM, we explore the feasibility of reducing its complexity through disregard of the aggregation terms of the model. The introduced nondimensionalization approach, which we call Optimal Scaling with Constraints, suggests a quantitative criterion for locating regions of slow and fast aggregation and helps to derive a family of dimensionless LPMF PBM of reduced complexity. The mathematical analysis of this new family is also provided. When compared with the original LPMF PBM, the resulting models demonstrate several orders of magnitude better computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {We consider cyclic ecological systems consisting of N N species u i ui , i = 1 , … , N i=1,…,N , where N = 3 N=3 and N = 4 N=4 . We employ a model in which species u i ui competes only with members of its own species (intraspecies competition), with a strength normalized to unity, and with species u i + 1 ui+1 , where i + 1 i+1 is taken to mean ( i mod N ) + 1 (imodN)+1 (interspecies competition). The strength of the competition is quantified by an interaction coefficient α i &gt; 0 αi&amp;gt;0 . When the interspecies competition is weak for all species ( α i 1 αi&amp;gt;1 for all i i ), coexistence can still be stable under certain circumstances, but the predominant feature is complex dynamics for N = 3 N=3 , involving heteroclinic cycles, spatiotemporal chaos, traveling waves, and modulated traveling waves, and interactions among stable alliances of noncompeting species for N = 4 N=4 . All states other than the coexistence state involving alliances of competing species will be unphysical. We consider the case where one species (say, species j j ) is either a weak competitor in a community of strong competitors ( α j &gt; 1 αj&amp;gt;1 , α i &lt; 1 αi&amp;lt;1 for i ≠ j ) i≠j) , or a strong competitor in a community of weak competitors ( α j 1 αi&amp;gt;1 for i ≠ j ) i≠j) . We show that in these cases, physical partial alliances of competing states are stable and there is a parameter regime where they represent the only stable states of the system. In all cases, we find that the behavior is dominated by transcritical bifurcations between two states: (i) the coexistence state and (ii) partial alliance states involving competing species. These transcritical bifurcations unify the behavior of three- and four-species systems for weak and strong exceptional species. We consider both homogeneous mixtures (i.e., O D E ODE models) and the displacement of one state by another in both one and two dimensions (spatial dependence - systems of partial differential equations - P D E PDE s). In the latter case, we develop and compare displacement speeds with approximate analytical results and show good agreement between computed and analytic speeds.},

As an auxiliary control of sliding mode control, the ADHDP controller observes the difference between the actual sailing position/angle and the expected sailing position/angle, and adaptively provides corresponding supplementary control actions using a data-driven fashion. At the same time, we design a weight-related priority experience replay (PER) technology to update the online weight network by using the relevant historical data stored in the database to improve the learning rate. The proposed algorithm can adjust parameters online under various conditions. Furthermore, it is very suitable for underwater vehicle systems with parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Based on Lyapunov stability method, the stability of closed-loop system state and network weight error is analyzed. Finally, the validity of our control strategy is verified by simulation.},

In this paper, we consider the global estimation error of the covariance function obtained by fragment data. Our theorem is built on the connection between functional data and RKHS, by using the covariance function as the reproducing kernel. We take the mean square integrability of functional data into consideration, and ease the previous restrictions of covariance function and observation area. Simulation results show the veracity of our theoretical finding by comparing the error of two kinds of functional data in covariance estimation. The existing N resolution patched (N-rp) method to estimate covariance in a local observation area has been improved, resulting in a considerable reduction in computing costs.},

  abstract     = {In the earlier paper, it is known that the solution accuracy usually can not be monotonically increased as the temporal discretization interval decreases when the standard finite element method (FEM) with the conventional temporal discretization approach is exploited for elastodynamics, hence the time integration step should be carefully determined for sufficiently fine solutions. The present work aims to investigate the behaviors of the classical element-free Galerkin method (EFGM), which is a typical meshless approach, with the Bathe temporal discretization scheme for elastodynamics. The main insights are that we explicitly show the total numerical dispersion errors in the computed numerical results actually consists of two different parts corresponding to the spatial and temporal discretization, respectively; both of them are responsible for solution accuracy. By performing the dispersion analysis, how the solution accuracy is affected by temporal and spatial discretization is shown, it is seen that we can improve the solution accuracy monotonically as the temporal step size decreases as long as the spatial dispersion error is sufficiently small and the related mathematical proofs are also given. From several supporting numerical examples, we can clearly see that the EFGM with the Bathe time integration scheme can basically provide monotonically convergent solutions as long as the reasonable node arrangement pattern and sufficiently large shape function supports are employed, namely the monotonic convergence property with respect to the temporal discretization interval can be achieved. This attractive and important feature makes the EFGM more competitive than the FE approach for elastodynamics.},

This allows to design step-size control strategies based on error estimates of the orbit and of the jets.

  abstract     = {High-order numerical methods for hyperbolic balance laws must circumvent Godunov’s theorem, for which non-linear spatial reconstruction is a successful procedure; this allows the design of non-linear semi-discrete and fully discrete high-order finite volume methods . The Essentially-Non-Oscillatory (ENO) method pioneered by Harten and collaborators in 1987 was a fundamental breakthrough in providing the bases for constructing schemes of both high-order of accuracy in smooth regions and essentially non-oscillatory at discontinuities. Several variations of ENO have since appeared in the literature, notably the Weighted Essentially-Non-Oscillatory (WENO) method of Jiang and Shu. In the present article, after revisiting the main elements of reconstruction methods, including their analysis, we propose a new, conservative ENO-type reconstruction procedure, called ENO-ET, that preserves the main advantages of the classical ENO and successfully overcomes its well-known weaknesses. The newly proposed reconstruction scheme is systematically assessed and compared with the best existing reconstruction schemes. We do so in two ways: (i) the methods are purely regarded as local, non-linear interpolation objects and (ii) the reconstruction methods are implemented in the context of high-order fully-discrete ADER numerical schemes for solving hyperbolic balance laws. The resulting schemes are of arbitrary order of accuracy in both space and time. In this paper the methods are implemented up to seventh order of accuracy and tested on carefully chosen numerical examples . Tests solved include the linear advection equation , the Euler equations of gas dynamics and the blood flow equations. Particular features of interest here are: (a) attaining theoretically expected convergence rates for smooth solutions arising from demanding initial conditions, (b) compute essentially non-oscillatory profiles for discontinuous solutions and (c) attain successfully steady-steady state solutions by time marching. As compared to existing methods, the newly proposed ENO-ET scheme performs very well for all these problems.},

In contrast to the existing methods of FNTBC and FXTBC, the impulsive control has a better performance in convergence speed and less state information transmission, which is more practical and flexible in real applications. To realize FNTBC and FXTBC for leaderless and leader-following MASs, a class of distributed impulsive control protocols is proposed. Then by utilizing impulsive control theory and finite-/fixed-time stability theory , some sufficient criteria and the settling time which are based on the proposed impulsive control protocols for FNTBC and FXTBC for leaderless and leader-following MASs are derived. It has been shown that the settling time for FNTBC depends on initial conditions of systems, while this limitation is removed for FXTBC. Finally, the proposed impulsive protocols are validated by some simulations, separately.},

Based on 2D-LGHM, a new medical image encryption scheme with permutation and multi-directional pixels substitution processes are established. The chaotic sequence is efficiently used to break the correlation between adjacent pixels and change the global pixel value absolutely.

The selection, construction and adjustment of models that reproduce the dynamic behavior of the cardiac muscle, brings us closer to the solution of the usual classification problem in medicine, i.e. decide whether or not a patient belongs to the healthy class of patients. An usual model for this dynamic is often given by a modified Van der Pol model (vdPM), whose parameters are currently optimized with machine learning techniques or evolutionary algorithms . In any of these cases, the proper selection of the initial condition of the parameters drastically reduces the computational cost of the optimization method used. In this work, a strategy to estimate a positively invariant region that contains the periodic orbit, associated with a set of particular parameters of the vdPM considered, is presented. An algorithm is proposed to build the positively invariant region, the numerical results confirm that the vdPM solutions starting within the positively invariant region converge to the periodic orbit. This kind of result allows to reduce the cost of searching for the optimal parameters that represent a real electrocardiographic signal, which in turn, let us reduce the dimensionality of the system allowing the design of more efficient classifiers for these signals.},

Previous studies show that prosocial and antisocial punishment behaviors coexist in societies as the two sides of peer punishment. Surprisingly, people show saliently different antisocial punishment behaviors across regions, while prosocial punishment behaviors remain consistent. This raises a crucial question: why do prosocial and antisocial punishments exhibit completely different characteristics across regions? We answer this question by presenting a two-stage evolutionary model of people’s peer punishment preference. We show that different central powers lead to discrepancies between people’s antisocial and prosocial punishment behaviors. Moreover, we find that central power determines evolutionary outcomes by influencing the proportion between three basic individual types of a population. Our model provides a possible explanation for cross-regional variations in antisocial punishment behavior and a new interpretation of social norms. More generally, it sheds light on a potential theory to unify the evolution of people’s coexisting prosocial and antisocial interactions.},

  abstract     = {We consider the approximation of some optimal control problems for the Navier-Stokes equation via a Dynamic Programming approach. These control problems arise in many industrial applications and are very challenging from the numerical point of view since the semi-discretization of the dynamics corresponds to an evolutive system of ordinary differential equations in very high-dimension. The typical approach is based on the Pontryagin maximum principle and leads to a two point boundary value problem . Here we present a different approach based on the value function and the solution of a Bellman equation , a challenging problem in high-dimension. We mitigate the curse of dimensionality via a recent multilinear approximation of the dynamics coupled with a dynamic programming scheme on a tree structure . We discuss several aspects related to the implementation of this new approach and we present some numerical examples to illustrate the results on classical control problems studied in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Influence maximization (IM) is a widely investigated issue in the study of social networks because of its potential commercial and social value. The purpose of IM is to identify a group of influential nodes that will spread information to other nodes in a network while simultaneously maximizing the number of nodes that are ultimately influenced. Traditional IM methods have different limitations, such as limited scalability to address large-scale networks and the neglect of community structural information. Here, we propose a novel influence maximization approach, i.e., the layered gravity bridge algorithm (LGB), to address the IM problem, which emphasizes the local structural information of networks and combines community detection algorithms with an improved gravity model. With the proposed LGB, a community detection method is used to derive the communities, and then the bridge nodes are found, which can be regarded as possible candidate seeds. Later, communities are merged into larger communities according to our proposed algorithm, and new bridge nodes are determined. Finally, all candidate seed nodes are sorted through an improved gravity model to determine the final seed nodes. The algorithm fully explores the network structural information provided by the communities, thereby making it superior to the current algorithms in terms of the number of ultimately infected nodes. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm possesses the potential to alleviate the influence overlap effect of seed nodes. To verify the effect of our approach, the classical SIR model is adopted to propagate information with the selected seed nodes, while experiments are performed on several practical datasets. As indicated by the obtained results, the performance of our proposed algorithm outperforms existing ones.},

The core idea of the presented method is to exploit and approximate the mixed spatial-temporal derivative of the solution that occurs naturally when deriving some second order accurate schemes in time. Such an approach is introduced in the context of the Lax-Wendroff (or Cauchy-Kowalevski) procedure when the second time derivative is not completely replaced by space derivatives using the PDE , but the mixed derivative is kept. If approximated in a suitable way, the resulting compact implicit scheme produces algebraic systems that have a more convenient structure than the systems derived by fully implicit schemes. We derive a high resolution TVD form of the implicit scheme for some representative hyperbolic equations in the one-dimensional case, including illustrative numerical experiments.},

In this paper, it is observed that the effective condition number ( κ eff ) (κeff) is more informative than the standard condition number ( κ ) (κ) in investigating the numerical stability of the interpolation problem. While the κ eff κeff considers the function to be interpolated, the standard condition number only depends on the interpolation matrix. We propose using the shape parameter corresponding to the maximum κ eff κeff to obtain a small error in RBF interpolation. It is also observed that the κ eff κeff helps to predict the error behavior with respect to the type of the RBF, where the basis function with a higher effective condition number yields a smaller error. In the end, we conclude that the effective condition number links to the error with respect to the selection of a radial basis function, choosing its shape parameter, number of collocation points, and test function. To this end, ten test functions are interpolated using the multiquadric, Matern family, and Gaussian basis functions to show the advantage of the proposed method.},

Central to this hybrid approach is the computation of the Walsh-Hadamard transform of arbitrary vectors, which is enabled in our framework using quantum Hadamard gates along with state preparation, shifting, scaling, and measurement operations. It is estimated that the proposed hybrid classical-quantum approach for the Walsh-Hadamard transform of an input vector of size N N results in a considerably lower computational complexity ( O ( N ) O(N) operations) compared to the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform ( O ( N log 2 ( N ) ) O(Nlog2(N)) operations). This benefit will also be relevant in the context of the proposed hybrid classical-quantum approach for the solution of nonlinear differential equations. Comparisons of results corresponding to the proposed hybrid classical-quantum approach and a purely classical approach for the solution of nonlinear differential equations (for cases involving one and two dependent variables) were found to be satisfactory. Some new perspectives relevant to the natural ordering of Walsh functions (in the context of both classical and hybrid approaches for the solution of nonlinear differential equations) and the representation theory of finite groups are also presented here.},

In some instances, the higher order of Boris-SDC even allows a much larger time step, leading to modest computational gains. Second, we propose a modification of Boris-SDC for the relativistic regime. Based on an implementation of Boris-SDC in the RUNKO PIC code, we demonstrate for a relativistic Penning trap that Boris-SDC retains its high order of convergence for velocities ranging from 0.5 c 0.5c to &gt; 0.99 c &amp;gt;0.99c .},

The high Reynolds numbers drive the nonlinearity to play an essential role and the equations to become more convection-dominated, which causes the solutions obtained with the standard numerical methods to involve spurious oscillations. To overcome this challenge, the Galerkin finite element formulation is stabilized by using the streamline-upwind/Petrov–Galerkin method. The stabilized formulation is further supplemented with YZ β β shock-capturing to achieve better solution profiles around strong gradients. The nonlinear equation systems arising from the space and time discretizations are solved by using the Newton–Raphson (N–R) method at each time step. The resulting linearized equation systems are solved with the BiCGStab technique combined with ILU preconditioning at each N–R iteration. A comprehensive set of test examples is provided to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed formulation and the techniques used.},

In order to reduce the effect of unknown parameters, the multiple model set is constructed and it can improve the transient response of systems. The specific features of the established multiple model method are that it not only can enhance the cooperativity of each identification model, but also reduce the computational burden since it does not require to a large number of models. The neural networks are utilized to approximated unknown dynamics. At the same time, the prescribed performance function, slide variable and second adaptive level technology in a unified framework are employed to design the controller.

It is found that, as diffusion increases, the CTL response delay increases, and also as the CTL response delay is increased, the Hopf points for both generation rate and activate rate are decreased, whereas the Hopf points for the infection and death rates increased. Moreover, an increase diffusion results in an increase in the Hopf points for growth rate and activation rate, while the Hopf bifurcations are decreased for the death rate of infected cells. Bifurcation diagrams are plotted to show selected examples of limit cycle behavior (periodic oscillation), and 3-D solutions for the three concentrations in the model have been plotted to corroborate all analytical results from the theoretical section.},

  abstract     = {A finite volume method is developed for the ferrohydrodynamics (FHD) dealing with the mechanics of fluid motion influenced by strong forces of magnetic polarization. The Shliomis model consisting of the continuity equation, the momentum equation, the angular momentum equation, the magnetization equations, and the Poisson&#39;s equation of magnetostatics is adopted to describe the FHD problems, where the hydrodynamics are strongly coupled with the magnetization dynamics. Unlike most of the previous FHD simulations, where the Debye-like magnetization equation was frequently used, we employ the microscopically derived magnetization equation to describe the evolution of ferrofluid magnetization in order to be valid in a wide range of flow rates, magnetic field strengths and oscillating frequencies. In the proposed method, each governing equation is discretized by employing the finite-volume scheme, and the variables in FHD, including the magnetic field, velocity, pressure, and magnetization are uncoupled by using an iteratively uncoupled strategy. The magnetization field is obtained by iteratively solving a Langevin equation using Newton method and the microscopical magnetization equation employing finite volume method in an inner iterative loop. Comparisons of the results obtained by the proposed method with the corresponding analytic or asymptotic solutions for the Couette–Poiseuille flows of ferrofluids in the absence or subjected to magnetic fields validate its feasibility in solving the pure hydrodynamics, pure magnetization dynamics, and the general FHD problems with hydrodynamic-magnetic coupling effects.},

  abstract     = {Low-reputation defectors are more likely to be punished than defectors with high reputations. Motivated by this reality, this paper proposes a new mechanism, the reputation-based probabilistic punishment, into the spatial public goods game model. In this mechanism, players with time-dependent reputations are divided into two types, good players with reputations higher than the reputation threshold and bad players with reputations lower than the threshold. A defector considered a good player is less likely to be punished than a defector considered a bad player. Based on these assumptions, we systematically explore how this mechanism influences the evolution of cooperation. Through extensive simulations, we verify that a higher value of the reputation threshold is more conducive to promoting and maintaining cooperation. Moreover, increasing the cost of being punished could effectively encourage players to take cooperative behaviors. Simulation results show that both increasing the punishment intensity and increasing the punishment fine could increase the cost of being punished and are beneficial to the promotion of cooperation. Additionally, in the structured population, the distributions of strategies, reputation, and payoff in the evolutionary stable state are mainly present in the form of clusters.},

Using the Hamiltonian formulation, we study the SIS system coupled to a Nosé thermal bath. We reinterpret classical parameters like temperature in an epidemiological context. In contrast to classical epidemiological models, the thermal bath modifies the dynamical behavior of the system by introducing fluctuations, such as those seen in some infectious waves.

By doing so, we overcome the drawbacks of the static approach and propose an online solution. In order to improve the performance of the standard LVI-PDNN model, an adaptive fuzzy-power LVI-PDNN (F-LVI-PDNN) model is also introduced and studied. This model combines the fuzzy control technique with LVI-PDNN. Numerical experiments and computer simulations confirm the F-LVI-PDNN model’s superiority over the LVI-PDNN model and show that our approach is a splendid option to accustomed MATLAB procedures.},

The method proposed is a simplified reformulation of the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM) and relies on a correction based on the extrapolated value of the in cell polynomial to the true geometry , thus not requiring the explicit evaluation of high order Taylor series . Moreover, this strategy could be easily implemented into any already existing finite element and finite volume code.

However, for problems with curved boundaries, grid points are often away from the boundaries, leading to the issue of imposing boundary conditions. Recently, it was shown that the inverse Lax-Wendroff (ILW) boundary treatment is very useful for addressing this issue. While most of the investigations focus on the WENO schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws, we present in this paper a new third-order weighted nonlinear scheme, which is based on the framework of weighted compact nonlinear schemes. We show that the scheme is applicable directly on Cartesian grids by using the ILW boundary treatment. To demonstrate the linear stability of the scheme, both the method of eigenvalue analysis and the Gustafsson-Kreiss-Sundström (GKS) theory are employed and analyzed in details. Some numerical tests are also performed to show the accuracy and validity of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Reachability analysis is a powerful tool for studying the safety of nonlinear systems , in which one of the key points is the computation of reachable tubes. As a common method in engineering, the Hamiltonian Jacobi technique often faces the “curse of dimensionality”. Its computational complexity grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the system state space. This paper proposes a dimensionality reduction method for the computation of reachable tubes that can be used for problems with dynamical systems of a particular form and a columnar target set. In the proposed method, one state variable is considered a pseudo-time variable, and the remaining state variables are contained within a low-dimensional dynamical system. Multiple slices of the original reachable tube are obtained by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi equation constructed based on this low-dimensional dynamical system and then stacking these slices to reconstruct the original reachable tube. Since the solved Hamilton–Jacobi equation is one dimension lower than the Hamilton–Jacobi equation in the original problem, the complexity of the computation is significantly reduced. Furthermore, the proposed method can be combined with existing methods to further reduce the dimensionality of the reachability problem. The computational accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by some examples.},

  abstract     = {We consider a 1D periodic system containing a large number of layers. Each layer is composed of two sub-layers of compressible fluids having different densities and equations of state. We present a comparison between a detailed numerical solution of the Euler equations that govern the multi-layer system, and two isentropic homogeneous (average) models effectively describing such a complex two-fluid mixture. The first homogeneous model is a 2 × 2 2×2 isentropic one–pressure two-fluid model. The second one is described by a 3 × 3 3×3 system, which additionally takes into account some turbulent effects in terms of the corresponding energy. An effective entropy can be introduced in the second model, which is constant along material lines for smooth solutions. The 2 × 2 2×2 model is recovered from the 3 × 3 3×3 model, in the limit of vanishing turbulent energy. The detailed numerical solution of the multi-layer system is carried out by a suitably designed second order finite-volume shock-capturing scheme in Lagrangian coordinates , which makes use of a new Roe-type numerical flux function . For smooth solutions the two models are both in very good agreement with the detailed numerical solution of multi-layer Euler equations. When a shock develops, the multi-layer solution becomes highly oscillatory and transforms into a dispersive shock for large amplitude shocks. It is found that, in the case of moderate density ratio, the first model shows a better agreement with the corresponding shock velocity. However, for large density ratio, the second model provides a better description of the multi-layer system. The case of moderate (large) density ratio is associated to a monotone (non-monotone) behaviour of the corresponding sound speed in the 2 × 2 2×2 model as a function of the mass fraction of the phases.},

  abstract     = {Document image binarization plays a vital role in the document image analysis system; however, it remains challenging due to various degradations. In this paper, we propose an anisotropic diffusion model involving fuzzy-based source for binarizing degraded document images, in which the diffusion term is response for edge-preserving smoothing and the source term is used to group intensity values of foreground and background pixels into two dominant modes separated by zero. Specifically, a fuzzy classification function (FCF) is first introduced for vaguely separating foreground from background, which is defined in a local neighborhood of each point rather than in the entire image domain. Then, the fuzzy-based source is constructed by FCF and a speed restrictor, involving no threshold. In numerical aspects, we develop a parallel-serial algorithm by combining finite differencing and parallel/serial splitting methods in the literature. This algorithm is tested on seven publicly available datasets (DIBCO 2009 to 2014 and 2016) and compared with six PDE-based models and two variational models in terms of degraded document binarization. Experimental results illustrate that our model is very effective for binarization of degrade document images, and is superior to the compared models subjectively and objectively.},

Firstly, based on the generalized Kalman–Yakubovich-Popov lemma, we formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the finite-frequency disturbance-attenuation performance as bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs), which are known to be NP-hard. In light of the homogeneous polynomially parameter-dependent technique, we construct relaxed synthesis conditions by employing higher-order decision variables dependent on the uncertainty parameter. To address the BMI problem, we develop an iterative procedure, under which feasible solutions to the original non-convex programming are achieved by vicariously solving a sequence of tractable convex approximations. Finally, we verify the efficacy of the theoretical results by an active suspension system.},

  abstract     = {Decision-making is often based on the analysis of complex and evolving data. Thus, having systems which allow to incorporate human knowledge and provide valuable support to the decider becomes crucial. In this work, statistical modelling and mathematical optimization paradigms merge to address the problem of estimating smooth curves which verify structural properties, both in the observed domain in which data have been gathered and outwards. We assume that the curve to be estimated is defined through a reduced-rank basis ( B B -splines) and fitted via a penalized splines approach ( P P -splines). To incorporate requirements about the sign, monotonicity and curvature in the fitting procedure, a conic programming approach is developed which, for the first time, successfully conveys out-of-range constrained prediction. In summary, the contributions of this paper are fourfold: first, a mathematical optimization formulation for the estimation of non-negative P-splines is proposed; second, previous results are generalized to the out-of-range prediction framework; third, these approaches are extended to other shape constraints and to multiple curves fitting; and fourth, an open source Python library is developed: cpsplines . We use simulated instances, data of the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and of mortality rates for different age groups to test our approaches.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a novel second-order accurate well balanced scheme for shallow water equations in general covariant coordinates over manifolds. In our approach, once the gravitational field is defined for the specific case, one equipotential surface is detected and parametrized by a frame of general covariant coordinates. This surface is the manifold whose covariant parametrization induces a metric tensor. The model is then re-written in a hyperbolic form with a tuple of conserved variables composed both of the evolving physical quantities and the metric coefficients. This formulation allows the numerical scheme to automatically compute the curvature of the manifold as long as the physical variables are evolved. In a classical well balanced formulation, the knowledge of a given equilibrium is exploited for evolving the specific state seen as the sum of the equilibrium and the fluctuations of the state around the equilibrium itself. On the contrary, the numerical approach proposed here is automatically well balanced for the water at rest solution (defined by zero velocity and constant free surface) for general manifolds without having to exploit the exact equilibrium profile during the computation. In particular, this numerical strategy allows to preserve the accuracy of the water at rest equilibrium at machine precision and on large timescales, even for non-smooth bottom topographies. As a matter of fact, the proposed local polynomial reconstruction, needed at each time step by the scheme for evolving the state, is built in order to automatically cancel any numerical error committed for describing jumps in the bathymetry . As a further effect, also out of the equilibrium, the typical spurious non-physical oscillations of the recovered numerical solution in a neighborhood of the discontinuities are healed. Thus, once the information on both the bathymetry and the metric of the manifold are properly collected in the flux terms and in the nonconservative products, the resulting numerical strategy turns out to be more accurate in finding also non-equilibrium solutions. Numerical results close the work. After having proved that the scheme is second-order accurate, we test the recovery of the water at rest equilibrium at machine precision for different bottom topographies (eventually discontinuous) with various metric on very long simulation times. In particular, after having considered smooth bathymetries with compact support, we relax the assumption on the continuity of water at rest equilibrium with discontinuous bathymetries disturbed by a white noise.},

The particular application performed concerns a biomedical problem dealing with the first stages of atherosclerosis disease, where the artery is considered as a porous medium, although the methodology described can be applied to other situations. The mathematical model on which this research is based is given by a system of two-dimensional nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with a nonlinear source term in one of the equations, which is a variant of the model proposed originally in N. El Khatib, S. Genieys &amp; V. Volpert (2007) Math. Model. Nat. Phenom., vol 2(2), pp. 126–141 [1]. The 2D model considered in this work has two main features: (i) the artery is taken as a porous medium and (ii) a nonlinear non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is incorporated, aimed to account for the recruitment of immune cells through the upper boundary, as a response to the production of cytokines. Certain theoretical properties of the stationary solutions and the evolution solution are stated and proved. Some of them are also verified with the numerical simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the fixed/predefined-time synchronization control of drive-response fuzzy inertial discontinuous neural networks(FIDNNs) with distributed delays. By using non-smooth analysis, fixed/predefined-time stability lemmas and designing two new fixed/predefined-time feedback controllers, several novel results are given to get fixed-time synchronization(FTS) and predefined-time synchronization(PTS) for the proposed FIDNNs. The fixed/predefined-time results of this paper are derived directly from FIDNNs themselves without variables substitution method. Up until now, very few results are reported on non-reduced order approach to achieve FTS and PTS of FIDNNs with distributed delays. Finally, some simulations and applications are, respectively, carried out to expound the efficacy of the obtained new FTS and PTS criteria.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the stability control of nonlinear switched semi-Markovian jump systems (S-MJSs) with false data injection attack and general uncertain transition rate (TR) is studied. General uncertain TR includes two cases: one is completely unknown, the other is not completely known. For unknown network attacks and nonlinearity, adaptive parameters are used to estimate these unknown terms. Then, a reduced-order adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) law is generated via the reduced-order theory, and non-fragile control is introduced to improve the effectiveness of the controller. On this basis, the finite time accessibility of the sliding mode surface and the stability of the closed-loop system are ensured by designing suitable Lyapunov functionals. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We focus on constructing a distributed yet recursive filter under the corruption of dynamic bias plus packet disorders. By means of the inductive method, upper bounds (on attained error covariances of the distributed filter) are first given and later minimized by properly parameterizing filter gains. Subsequently, a sufficient condition is presented to rigorously ensure the mean-square boundedness with respect to attained filtering errors.

A relationship between the finite settling time and the impulsive frequency is presented to show the stabilizing effect of impulses. It is shown that systems subject to nonvanishing disturbance can enter a disturbance-dependent ultimate bound in a finite-time sense, and a relatively smaller bound of settling time is obtained by utilizing stabilizing impulses. Meanwhile, systems subject to vanishing disturbance can achieve finite-time stabilization at the origin. Moreover, compared with the situation without impulses, the corresponding bound of settling time is also smaller.

We also explain how to adjust the numerical viscosity in order to obtain stable and accurate results in smooth or discontinuous parts of the flow and reduced divergence errors. The method can handle shock waves and can be made second order in smooth regions. It is also very well adapted to computing with Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Our GPU implementation in 2D achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, with near-optimal performance.

The mass matrix obtained from the bilinear finite element method is directly used to approximate the inverse of scalar Laplacian operator in the relaxation schemes. Using local Fourier analysis , we theoretically derive optimal smoothing factors for the resulting three relaxation schemes. Specifically, mass-based distributive relaxation, mass-based Braess–Sarazin relaxation, and mass-based σ σ -Uzawa relaxation have optimal smoothing factor 1 3 13 , 1 3 13 and 1 3 13 , respectively. These smoothing factors are smaller than those in our earlier work [1] , where weighted Jacobi iteration is used for inventing Laplacian involved in the Stokes equations. The mass-based relaxation schemes do not cost more than the original ones using the Jacobi iteration. Another superiority of mass-based relaxation is that there is no need to compute the inverse of a matrix. These new relaxation schemes are appealing.},

This paper focuses on the issue of event-triggered ILC for switched systems with asynchronous switching. An event-triggered ILC method is designed to reduce unnecessary controller updates during iterations. The main technical contribution is that the analysis and synthesis are performed in both time and iteration domains. First, in order to solve the asynchronous switching problem in the time direction and the update problem in the iteration direction, a Lyapunov function involving both directions is adopted. Second, to prove the convergence of tracking error and the system stability in both domains, a new prove method is proposed, in which the tracking error is summed over the entire time domain and the average dwell condition is summed over the entire iteration domain. Finally, the feasibility of theoretical result is verified by simulation.},

Based on the precise integration method, an iterative process is used to obtain the transfer matrix of SCDS, which improves the accuracy of SCDS without significantly increasing the computational effort . In addition, the flexibility of SCDS for the quasi-linear autonomous Birkhoffian equation is discussed: the first is the applicability to odd-dimensional generalized Birkhoffian systems which appear widely in engineering problems; the second is the feasibility in structural dynamic response problems, for which the analytical procedure for applying SCDS based on the framework of the perturbation method is given.

In fact, we present a detailed and comprehensive study of symmetry analysis for the governing system and compute classical symmetries, nonclassical symmetries, nonlocal symmetries and nonclassical potential symmetries. Nonclassical potential symmetries appear to be very much useful in terms of obtaining several new hidden solutions of the system that can not be established by using classical symmetry reductions, nonclassical symmetry method, or potential symmetry analysis. By using the direct multipliers we demonstrate several conserved quantities of the governing system those yield associated nonlocally related potential systems to the given system. Further, we prove that the given system admits a nonlocal symmetry that arises from the symmetry-based method and consequently we obtain a family of exact solutions. We analyze the physical interpretation of some of the obtained solutions which include various soliton type solutions such as kink type solitons, breather type solitons, multiple solitons, singular kink type solitons and etc. Lastly, as an application, we analyze the evolutionary property of characteristic shock, weak discontinuity and collision between them by using one of the obtained solutions.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a detailed and developed method for finding soil nonlinear thermophysical characteristics. Two-layer container complexes are constructed. The side faces of which are thermally insulated, so that one can use the one dimensional heat equation. In order not to solve the boundary value problem with a contact discontinuity and not to lose the accuracy of the solution method, a temperature sensor was placed at the junction of the two media, and a mixed boundary value problem is solved in each region of the container. In order to provide the initial data for the inverse coefficient problem, two temperature sensors are used: one sensor was placed on the open border of the container and recorded the temperature of the soil at this border, and the second sensor was placed at a short distance from the border, which recorded the air temperature. The measurements were carried out in the time interval ( 0 , 4 t max ) (0,4tmax) . At first, the initial-boundary value problem of nonlinear thermal conductivity equation with temperature dependent coefficients of thermal conductivity, heat capacity, heat transfer and material density is investigated numerically. The nonlinear initial-boundary value problem is solved by the finite difference method . Two types of difference schemes are constructed: linearized and nonlinear. The linearized difference scheme is implemented numerically by the scalar Thomas’ method, and the nonlinear difference problem is solved by the Newton’s method. Assuming the constancy of all thermophysical parameters, except for the thermal conductivity of the material, on the segment ( 0 , t max ) (0,tmax) , the quadratic convergence of Newton’s method is proved and the thermal conductivity is calculated, while the solution of the linearized difference problem was taken as the initial approximation for the Newton’s method. By freezing all other thermophysical parameters, and using the measured temperatures in the segment ( t max , 2 t max ) (tmax,2tmax) , the coefficient of specific heat of the material is found. Proceeding in a similar way, using the initial data on the segment ( 2 t max , 3 t max ) (2tmax,3tmax) , the density of the soil is determined. Also, based on the measured initial data on the segment ( 3 t max , 4 t max ) (3tmax,4tmax) , the heat transfer coefficient is determined. Based on the experimentally measured data, at each time interval, the corresponding functional is minimized using the gradient descent method. The differentiation of a nonlinear difference problem with respect to the desired parameter method is used to find the gradient of the functional. This method allows you to find the functional gradient and the damping coefficient of the gradient descent in an explicit form . In this case, the compilation and solution of the conjugate problem, which is a frequently used method for solving the inverse problems, is not needed. The performed numerical calculations show that for small time intervals the solutions of the linearized difference problem differ little from the solution of the nonlinear difference problem (1 - 3%). And for long periods of time , tens of days or months, the solutions of the two methods differ significantly, sometimes exceeding 20%. In addition, all thermophysical characteristics (8 coefficients) were found for a two-layer container with sand and black soil. Also the dependence of the temperature difference at the boundary between the environment and the soil for the heat transfer coefficient was shown.},

  abstract     = {This paper adopts an accurate and robust algorithm for the nonlocal heat equation having a weakly singular kernel in three dimensions . The proposed method approximates the unknown solution in two steps. First, the temporal discretization is achieved through a Crank-Nicolson finite difference with the nonuniform temporal meshes, which are applied to tackle the singularity behavior for the exact solution when t = 0 t=0 . Second, the spatial discretization is derived by means of the Galerkin finite element. Additionally, the alternating direction implicit (ADI) approach is adopted to decrease computational burden. The proposed method in terms of the convergence and stability analysis is studied by using the discrete energy method in detail with optimal rates of convergence O ( k 2 + h r + 1 ) O(k2+hr+1) , r ≥ 1 r≥1 based on some appropriate assumptions, where k k and h h represent step sizes in the temporal and spatial directions, respectively. Numerical results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method and the correctness of the theoretical prediction.},

  abstract     = {During the development of the S3Unica project (Smart Specialisation University Campus) and its application in the ASSET project (Advanced Systems Studies for Energy Transition), both within the European Commission, the resolution of the distributed energy generation model was proposed through the creation of an algorithm that would allow the shared market between producers and consumers. From this premise arose the need to create a replicable system to resolve this situation in the new shared generation environment, using low-cost technologies. This work develops the scalable method for resource management technologies (SMART), based on stochastic procedures, which generates microgrids with an integrated energy market. The interest of this work is based on the incorporation of real-time analysis, applying stochastic methods, and its fusion with probabilistic predictive methods that evolve and harmonise the results. The fact that the process is self-learning also enables the use of metadomotic as a tool for both comfort improvement and energy sharing. The most important results developed were the design of the internal scheme of the low-cost SMART control device together with the developments of both individual and collective resolution algorithms. By achieving the incorporation of internal and external producers in the same numerical procedure, the distributed and hybrid generation models are solved simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Radial basis function (RBF) is a basis function suitable for scattered data interpolation and high dimensional function interpolation , wherein the independent shape parameters have a direct impact on the accuracy of calculation results. Research in this field is mostly concerned with the shape parameter selection strategy based on the premise of global distribution or block regional distribution. In this paper, a shape parameter selection strategy is proposed, which is used for the local RBF collocation method (LRBF) for solving partial differential equations . It overcomes many limitations of the traditional methods applied to LRBF. In this strategy, a set of twin matrices similar to the interpolation matrix are constructed to evaluate the error of the model. In addition, the penalty term contained in the twin matrix is used to relax the influence of the far end region on the target node. Since the objective problem is nonlinear, a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is employed to minimize the training objective and adjust the shape parameters of the basis function at each iteration. Extensive numerical results showed the effectiveness of the error estimation strategy, by providing a good shape parameter and better solution accuracy. At the end of the paper, the generality of the shape parameter optimization framework based on this strategy is discussed through three examples.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this work is, first of all, to extend a finite volume numerical scheme, previously designed for hydrostatic Shallow Water (SWE) formulation, to Non Hydrostatic Pressure (NHP) depth averaged model. The second objective is focused on exploring two available options in the context of previous work in this field: Hyperbolic-Elliptic (HE-NHP) formulations solved with a Pressure-Correction technique (PCM) and Hyperbolic Relaxation formulations (HR-NHP). Thus, besides providing an extension of a robust and well-proved Roe-type scheme developed for hydrostatic SWE to solve NHP systems, the work assesses the use of first order numerical schemes in the kind of phenomena typically solved with higher order methods. In particular, the relative performance and differences of both NHP numerical models are explored and analysed in detail. The performance of the models is compared using a steady flow test case with quasi -analytical solution and another unsteady case with experimental data, in which frequencies are analysed in experimental and computational results. The results highlight the need to understand the behaviour of a parameter-dependent model when using it as a prediction tool, and the importance of a proper discretization of non-hydrostatic source terms to ensure stability. On the other hand, it is proved that the incorporation of a non-hydrostatic model to a shallow water Roe solver provides good results.},

We describe a general algorithm and discuss special cases of positive-definite and singular matrices . In the first case, the algorithm solves the decision problem and unequivocally determines if such an integer matrix exists. Since the problem of isomorphism of various finite structures can be viewed as a special case of matrix congruence problem, our results are applicable in this setting. We discuss this topic and show that the presented algorithms solve this problem in the case of partially ordered sets , vertex and edge labeled directed and undirected graphs. Moreover, they allow computing the automorphism group Aut ( G ) Aut(G) of a given (di)graph G G . The results of this work are applicable in the general framework of Coxeter spectral analysis of signed graphs Δ Δ introduced in (SIAM J.

Then, to combine the macroscopic traffic flow characteristics, the traffic stream model is introduced, and the two models are fused in the context of high traffic flow. Next, the theoretical validity of the fusion model is verified by the existence and uniqueness of the solution. The coefficients of the hybrid model are extracted as the stop coefficient and go coefficient which reflect the micro driving behavior. The Maximum Likelihood Estimations of the two coefficients are also given, as well as the boundedness of traffic oscillation in stop-and-go. Finally, numerical simulations show that the model has good fitting and prediction ability for traffic flow in high flow period. Moreover, the greater the stop coefficient, the stronger the traffic flow oscillation intensity, the larger the upper boundedness of the oscillation, the more severe the stop-and-go.},

The output should reproduce the main features of the input to avoid a distortion when it becomes the input of other neurons, that is input and output should exhibit some sort of consistency. In this paper, we consider the question: how should we mathematically characterize the input in order to get a consistent output? Here we interpret the consistency by requiring the reproducibility of the input tail behaviour of the interspike intervals distributions in the output. Our answer refers to a system of interconnected neurons with stochastic perfect integrate and fire units. In particular, we show that the class of regularly-varying vectors is a possible choice to obtain such consistency. Some further necessary technical hypotheses are added.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a simple and general framework for the construction of thermodynamically compatible schemes for the numerical solution of overdetermined hyperbolic PDE systems that satisfy an extra conservation law . As a particular example in this paper, we consider the general Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski (GPR) model of continuum mechanics that describes the dynamics of nonlinear solids and viscous fluids in one single unified mathematical formalism. A main peculiarity of the new algorithms presented in this manuscript is that the entropy inequality is solved as a primary evolution equation instead of the usual total energy conservation law, unlike in most traditional schemes for hyperbolic PDE. Instead, total energy conservation is obtained as a mere consequence of the proposed thermodynamically compatible discretization . The approach is based on the general framework introduced in Abgrall (2018) [1]. In order to show the universality of the concept proposed in this paper, we apply our new formalism to the construction of three different numerical methods . First, we construct a thermodynamically compatible finite volume (FV) scheme on collocated Cartesian grids, where discrete thermodynamic compatibility is achieved via an edge/face-based correction that makes the numerical flux thermodynamically compatible. Second, we design a first type of high order accurate and thermodynamically compatible discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes that employs the same edge/face-based numerical fluxes that were already used inside the finite volume schemes. And third, we introduce a second type of thermodynamically compatible DG schemes, in which thermodynamic compatibility is achieved via an element-wise correction, instead of the edge/face-based corrections that were used within the compatible numerical fluxes of the former two methods. All methods proposed in this paper can be proven to be nonlinearly stable in the energy norm and they all satisfy a discrete entropy inequality by construction . We present numerical results obtained with the new thermodynamically compatible schemes in one and two space dimensions for a large set of benchmark problems, including inviscid and viscous fluids as well as solids. An interesting finding made in this paper is that, in numerical experiments, one can observe that for smooth isentropic flows the particular formulation of the new schemes in terms of entropy density , instead of total energy density , as primary state variable leads to approximately twice the convergence rate of high order DG schemes for the entropy density.},

The superiorization methodology is based on interlacing the iterative steps of two separate and independent iterative processes by perturbing the iterates of one process according to the steps dictated by the other process. We include in our developed method two novel elements. The first one is the permission to restart the perturbations in the superiorized algorithm which results in a significant acceleration and increases the computational efficiency. The second element is the ability to independently superiorize subvectors. This caters to the needs of real-world applications, as demonstrated here for a problem in intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.},

  abstract     = {Singular value decomposition (SVD) plays a significant role in matrix analysis, and the differential quotient difference with shifts (DQDS) algorithm is an important technique for solving singular values of upper bidiagonal matrices. However, ill-conditioned matrices and large-scale matrices may cause inaccurate results or long computation times when solving singular values. At the same time, it is difficult for users to effectively find the desired solution according to their needs. In this paper, we design a precision-adjustable computational framework for solving singular values, named PACF. In our framework, the same solution algorithm contains three options: original mode, high-precision mode, and mixed-precision mode. The first algorithm is the original version of the algorithm. The second algorithm is a reliable numerical algorithm we designed using Error-free transformation (EFT) technology. The last algorithm is an efficient numerical algorithm we developed using the mixed-precision idea. Our PACF can add different solving algorithms for different types of matrices, which are universal and extensible. Users can choose different algorithms to solve singular values according to different needs. This paper implements the high-precision DQDS and mixed-precision DQDS algorithms and conducts extensive experiments on a supercomputing platform to demonstrate that our algorithm is reliable and efficient. Besides, we introduce the error analysis of the inner loop of the DQDS and HDQDS algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The powerful non-classical continuum theory of strain gradient elasticity is capable of effectively capturing small-scale effects in micro-structures. Based on this theory, a formulation is developed to investigate the coupled torsional-flexural vibrations of micro-rotors in the presence of inertia nonlinearities arising from the eccentricity and gyroscopic motion of the rotors. With the aid of a weighted-residual technique, coupled nonlinear partial differential equations of motion are truncated into a discrete model. Then, the resonance of the fundamental mode of the torsional vibration excited by the flexural vibration is investigated by utilizing the perturbation method of multiple scales. Moreover, a numerical simulation approach is conducted to confirm the validity of the analytical solution proposed by the multiple scales perturbation method. Obtained results for the resonant frequency and amplitude of the fundamental torsional mode indicate that the strain gradient theory can predict far more reliable results than the classical continuum mechanics for micro-rotors with very thin shafts.},

  abstract     = {The recent article (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 494 (2021), Article number: 124448) presented an asymptotic Filon-type method for computing the oscillatory integral with a special oscillator and weak singularities, ∫ 0 b x α ( b − x ) β f ( x ) e i ω x r d x , − 1 &lt; α , β ≤ 0 , 0 &lt; b &lt; + ∞ , ω ∈ R , r ∈ N + ∫0bxα(b−x)βf(x)eiωxrdx,−1&amp;lt;α,β≤0,0&amp;lt;b&amp;lt;+∞,ω∈R,r∈N+ . In this article, we propose and analyze two different efficient and accurate quadrature methods for this singularly oscillatory integral. First, we give a two-point Taylor interpolation method by using a two-point Taylor polynomial instead of f ( x ) f(x) . In addition, we propose a more efficient contour integration method. By exploiting the Taylor polynomial of the function f f at x = 0 x=0 , and then based on the additivity of the integration interval, we change the considered integral into two integrals. One integral can be efficiently computed by the contour integration method based on Cauchy Residue Theorem and generalized Gaussian-Laguerre quadrature rule. The other integral can be explicitly calculated by special functions. Specifically, we perform the rigorous error analysis of the proposed methods and obtain asymptotic error estimates in inverse powers of the frequency parameter ω ω . Ultimately, the proposed methods are compared with the asymptotic Filon-type method given in this work (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 494 (2021), Article number: 124448) and the modified Filon-type method. At the same computational cost, the two-point Taylor interpolation method and the asymptotic Filon-type method have a very close accuracy level. Their accuracy is higher than that of the modified Filon-type method, and the precision of the contour integration method is much higher than that of the asymptotic Filon-type method, the modified Filon-type method, and the two-point Taylor interpolation method. We verify error analyses of the proposed methods by experimental results. Numerical experiments can also verify the efficiency and precision of the proposed methods.},

Geometric nonlinearity by uneven thickness and large deformation, material nonlinearity by heterogeneity and contact nonlinearity of orthotropic foundation are simultaneously considered with the highly coupled and strongly nonlinear variable-coefficient Von Kármán equations derived. The accuracy and convergence of the present formulation are validated in excellent agreement with published results, while the new results of extreme bending solutions are provided, which are few given by other methods and further verify the effectiveness and superiority of proposed wavelet procedures. Parametric investigations of influences of material orthotropy and inhomogeneity, unevenness of thickness, amplitude of initial imperfection along with orthotropy of nonlinear Winkler–Pasternak foundation have been studied, which are of great significance on the extremely large bending properties.},

The weight of local popularity and the scaling index of the popularity are introduced to the fitness calculation. Numerical experiments show that the information of local popularity and global popularity have different effects on cooperative behavior when the scaling index of the popularity changes from positive to negative. And when the scaling index of the popularity is negative, the greater the absolute value of the scaling index is, the more conducive it is to the cooperation; but there exists the optimal value of the scaling index for the cooperative behavior when the scaling index is positive.

An example is provided to illustrate validity of theoretical results obtained in the end.

For this aim, the discretized scheme of the extended model is split into two parts. First, we apply the step-size functions to approximate the time derivatives with the first-order consistency. Then we use a nonlocal discretization of the standard θ θ -method to the right side of the system to obtain a linear system. We find the conditions for the step-size functions under which specific intervals are positively invariant for the total populations and each component of the solution of the extended Ross model. We suggest a step-size function for the extended Ross model to preserve the dynamical consistency of the model for any step size Δ t Δt . The numerical simulations confirm the theoretical results for the examples and we compare the efficiency of the nonstandard Runge–Kutta methods with the different step-size functions for sufficiently large step sizes.},

  abstract     = {The present study focuses on the moving Kriging meshfree (MKM) technique combined with the three-dimensional strain gradient continuum mechanics to analyze three-dimensional nonlinear stability response of thermo-electro-mechanical loaded functionally graded (FG) piezoelectric cylindrical microshells. The derived three-dimensional MKM model has the capability to present the transition of buckling mode containing different microsize-dependent gradient tensors. The microshells are made of a mixture containing PZT-4 and PZT-5H piezoelectric phases, the material properties of which vary continuously along the shell thickness and captured based on the power law composition scheme. With the aid of MKM strain gradient-based shell model, it is possible to satisfy the function property associated with Kronecker delta by putting the required boundary conditions directly at the associated nodes without any predefined mesh. The microsize-dependent nonlinear stability plots are obtained in the presence of modal transition relevant to various environment temperatures, external electric voltages, microstructural size dependency tensors, and power-law indexes. It is found that the stiffening character related to all three microstructural strain gradient tensors is more significant for the second nonlinear stability mechanical/electrical load in comparison with the first one. However, for the three-dimensional mechanical/electrical bifurcation load, the stiffening character of these gradient tensors becomes even lower than the first postbuckling load. Moreover, by applying an actuation via a positive voltage, the first three-dimensional critical buckling load and the associated end shortening reduce, while an actuation via a negative voltage results in to increase them. It is observed that by shifting to the postbuckling territory, the role of the electric actuation gets negligible.},

The energy dissipation law of the phase-field molecular beam epitaxial growth model on evolving surfaces does not hold for the arbitrary surface velocity which can be considered as a result of external force of the system. However, the stiffness caused by the model’s small interfacial parameter makes conventional numerical approach unstable. Hence, a stabilized semi-implicit method combined with the evolving surface finite element method is proposed and analyzed for the space-time discretization. Moreover, to improve the computational efficiency, an adaptive time-stepping technique which takes account of the energy evolution and surface velocity is also provided. Numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Several numerical simulations are performed to explore the beam epitaxial growth on evolving surfaces.},

The model is formulated as a partial differential equation (PDE) that consists of spatio-temporal regularization of shock filtering and diffusion process, as well as local entropy. Shock filtering is employed to enhance the brightness contrast between texts and background according to image gradients adaptively. Diffusion process is not only responsible for removing selectively noise in the input image, but also suppressing the amplified noise by the shock filtering. Local entropy based source term serves as degradation-corrected term that is responsible for reducing the influence of degradation. A splitting-based algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model numerically, where two typical splitting methods and finite difference are combined. We test the proposed model and numerical scheme on DIBCO 2009–2014 and 2016 datasets. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method works well in restoring document images with degraded background, and achieves comparable performances compared to seven relevant methods for seven DIBCO datasets.},

  abstract     = {Controlling and planning the removal of invasive species are topics of outmost importance in management of natural resources because of the severe ecological damages and economic losses caused by non-native alien species. Optimal management strategies often rely on coupling population dynamics models with optimization procedures to achieve an effective allocation of limited resources for removing invasive species from hosting ecosystems. We analyse a parabolic optimal control model to simulate the best spatiotemporal strategy for the removal of the species when a budget constraint is applied. The model also predicts the species spread under the control action. We improve the capability of the model to reproduce realistic scenarios by introducing an advection term in the state equation . That allows to model the action of external forces, like currents or winds, which might bias dispersal in certain directions. The analytical properties of the model are discussed under suitable boundary conditions. As a further original contribution, we introduce a novel numerical procedure for approximating the solution reducing the computational costs in view of its implementation as a support decision tool. Then we test the approach by simulating the spread and the control of a hypothetical invasive plant in the territory of the Italian Sardinia island. To reproduce the anisotropy of the diffusion we include the effect of the altitude in the habitat suitability of the species.},

  abstract     = {In the situation of insufficient vaccines and rapid mutation of the virus, detection and contact tracing have been argued to be effective interventions in the containment of emergent epidemics. However, most of previous studies are devoted to data-driven, leading to insufficient understanding of quantifying their effectiveness, especially when individuals’ interactions evolve with time. Here, we aim at quantifying the effectiveness of detection and contact tracing interventions in suppressing the epidemic in time-varying networks. We propose the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed-Dead-Hospitalized (SEIRDH) model with detection and contact tracing. Under the framework of time-varying networks and with a mean-field approach, we analyze the epidemic thresholds under different situations. Experimental results show that detection can effectively suppress the epidemic spread with an increased epidemic threshold, while the role of tracing depends on the characteristics of the epidemic. When an epidemic is infectious in the incubation period , contact tracing has an obvious effect in suppressing the epidemic spread, but not when the epidemic is not infectious in the incubation. Thus, we apply this framework in real networks to explore possible contact tracing measures by taking use of individuals’ properties. We find that contact tracing based on activity and historical information is more efficient than random contact tracing. Moreover, individuals’ attractiveness and aging effects also affect the efficiency of detection and contact tracing. In conclusion, making full use of individuals’ properties can remarkably improve the effectiveness of detection and contact tracing. The proposed method is expected to provide theoretical guidance for coping with the COVID-19 or other emergent epidemics.},

The related weighting functions are determined by solving a system of linear equations, which is constructed as a linear combination of fundamental solutions in the related stencil support. Therefore, the proposed collocation solver produces sparse resultant matrix, which makes it possible to perform large-scale elastic wave propagation simulations on a desktop computer. Furthermore, it avoids highly ill-conditioned dense matrix encountered in most of collocation methods.

The use of regular rectangular grids that intersect with the irregular boundaries leads to the generation of arbitrarily small and highly distorted computational cells adjacent to the boundaries of the domain. The appearance of such cells may affect both the stability and efficiency of the numerical method and therefore require special attention. In order to overcome this difficulty, we introduce a structured quadrilateral mesh, which is designed for the irregular domain at hand, and solve the studied atmospheric flow equations using a second-order central-upwind scheme. In addition, the resulting numerical method is developed to provide a well-balanced discretization of the underlying system. The latter is achieved by rewriting the governing equations in terms of equilibrium variables representing perturbations of the known background equilibrium state. The proposed method is tested in a number of numerical experiments, including the buoyant bubble rising and interacting with an (zeppelin) obstacle and the Lee wave generation due to topography. The obtained numerical results demonstrate high resolution and robustness of the proposed computational approach.},

An event-triggered transmission scheme, whose threshold function can be adaptively adjusted, is established to decrease the frequency of data transmission. Simultaneously, the utilization of limited network bandwidth resources is also improved due to plenty of “unnecessary” packets being discarded before accessing networks. Furthermore, the jumping of stochastic parameters in networks can be described by a semi-Markov jump model, in which the sojourn-time is considered subject to the Weibull distribution instead of the exponential distribution. Based on the aforesaid discussions, a mode-dependent controller is designed under an adaptive event-triggered scheme. Whereafter, some criteria are constructed based on the Lyapunov stability theory to guarantee stochastic stability and a prescribed L 2 − L ∞ L2−L∞ performance of the system.

  abstract     = {The entropy splitting of the compressible Euler flux derivatives based on Harten’s entropy function Harten (1983), Gerritsen and Olsson (1996), Yee et al. (2000) in conjunction with classical spatial central and DRP (dispersion relation-preserving) finite discretizations with summation-by-parts (SBP) operators Strand (1994) for both periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions is proven to be entropy conservative and stable for a thermally-perfect gas by Sjögreen and Yee (2019), Sjögreen et al. (2020), Sjögreen and Yee (2021). The various high order methods resulting from applying classical spatial central, DRP and Padé (compact) methods to the split form of the Euler flux derivative are referred to as entropy split methods as a function of the splitting parameter β β . These entropy split methods are entropy conserving and stable but they are usually not conservative numerical methods without additional reformulation; e.g., those proposed in Sjögreen and Yee (2021). This is an expanded version of Sjögreen and Yee (2022) and is intended to present a more in depth study for both the compressible gas dynamics and ideal MHD equations. Here the same Harten entropy function is used for the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) governing equation set. This approach was not examined in great depth by Sjögreen &amp; Yee and Yee &amp; Sjögreen in two conference proceedings papers Sjögreen and Yee (2022), Yee and Sjögreen (2022), which also included the high order Padé (compact) spatial discretizations Hirsh(1975). For the extension of the entropy split method to the ideal MHD, the Godunov symmetrizable non-conservative form of the formulation is used. Due to the non-conservative portion (commonly referred to as a nonlinear source term vector) of the symmetrizable system Godunov (1972), there are variants in formulating the entropy split methods. Two different numerical treatments for these particular source terms of the symmetrizable MHD governing equation set are presented. Systematic 3D formulation in curvilinear grids with the corresponding numerical fluxes among method comparisons for the Euler and ideal MHD equations is included. The curvilinear formulation includes high order classical central, DRP and compact spatial discretizations. For readers interested in the implementation of these methods into their computer code, it is hope that these formulations and the corresponding numerical fluxes in 3D curvilinear grids will be helpful. The comparative studies concentrate on the Tadmor-type of discrete entropy conserving Tadmor (2003), momentum conserving Ducros et al. (2000), kinetic energy preserving Kennedy and Gruber (2008), Pirozzoli (2010), Coppola et al. (2019), Yee et al., Sjögreen &amp; Yee entropy split methods Yee et al.(2000), Sjögreen and Yee (2018), Sjögreen and Yee (2019), Sjögreen et al. (2020), Sjögreen and Yee (2021), as well as the combination of these physical-preserving methods Ranocha (2020), Yee and Sjögreen (2020). All of these methods are not only preserved certain physical properties of the chosen governing equations but are also known to either improve numerical stability , and/or minimize aliasing errors in long time integration of turbulent flow computations without the aid of added numerical dissipation for selected compressible flow types. Extensive error norm comparison with grid refinement were performed to show how well this methods conserve the entropy, momentum and mass, and preserve the kinetic energy for long time integration of the various flows. In general the Tadmor-type entropy conserving methods are at least twice the CPU per time step than the rest of the skew-symmetric splitting methods.},

  abstract     = {In response to an increase in blood glucose levels, insulin is released into the bloodstream by the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. As a result of this influx of glucose, the islets start what are called bursting oscillations of the membrane potential and the intracellular calcium concentration. Time delays of several seconds in the activity of distant cells in the islets have been observed, indicating the presence of traveling waves through the islets. By considering a robust model of a pancreatic islet in one dimension, we study the relationship between the wave speed and the model parameters for the existence of traveling wave fronts and traveling wave pulses. After a systematic reduction of the model equations, the wave fronts (or heteroclinic connection) are studied. Using the bi-stable equation, for which an exact expression of the heteroclinic connection can be computed, we use a homotopy parameter to move from this equation to an islet model. A relationship between the wave speed and the conductance of the ATP-modulated potassium channel is constructed. Upon the inclusion of the slow gating variable back into the model equations, we observe the presence of a traveling wave pulse (or homoclinic connection). Using a high period periodic orbit to approximate the homoclinic orbit, a similar relationship between these two parameters is constructed. We observe that the heteroclinic connection is a good approximation for a portion of the homoclinic connection. Comparisons of the speed of the wave traveling through the islet in the partial differential equation model and the model in traveling coordinates is carried out.},

  abstract     = {An isogeometric boundary element method (IGABEM) is extended in this work to study liquid sloshing characteristics in various 3D tanks with arbitrary internal bottom-mounted porous structures. Unlike the classical boundary element method (BEM), the present method uses the non-uniform rational B-splines(NURBS) instead of the piecewise Lagrange polynomials as the shape function to approximate both the domain boundary and field variables, it completely inherits the advantages of the traditional BEM and the isogeometric analysis (IGA), such as the properties of only boundary discretization needing, higher order continuity, self-adaptability and so on. All the information required in the IGABEM for the mesh generation can be obtained from the CAD software, which may evidently reduce the time and memory consumptions of preprocessing, meanwhile, since the same basis functions (NURBS) are used for both the IGABEM and CAD models, the proposed method can exactly reconstruct the geometry of the analysis domain without any error, and this substantively contributes to the high calculation accuracy of IGABEM. In this paper, by using a zoning method the entire domains of fluid are divided into several sub-domains with the consideration of compatibility boundary conditions besides the porous structures. Owning to the constant cross section of the container, impermeable boundary condition at the tank bottom and the linear boundary condition at the free surface, the 3D Laplace equation (which governs the 3D sloshing problem) is transformed into a couple of Helmholtz equation and modified Helmholtz equations (corresponding to the propagating and evanescent modes, respectively). Green&#39;s theorem and the divergence theorem of Gauss are used in this paper to derive the IGABEM system equations for the two types of equations. Moreover, by introducing a series of eigen-functions associated with the vertical coordinate, the potential and velocity boundary conditions are expanded into those associated with the propagating and evanescent modes, which can be applied upon the Helmholtz equation and modified Helmholtz equations. Finally, the present problem can be solved by solving these equations and combining the results linearly. Accuracy and convergence of the present IGABEM technique are verified through numerical tests by comparing the obtained results with analytical, experimental solutions or those calculated with other numerical method, thereafter, liquid sloshing problems in the cubic or circular cylindrical vessels with the coaxial or eccentric elliptical and circular cylindrical porous structures are analyzed. The main influences of the geometric parameter, porous-effect parameter, number and arrangement of the porous structures are investigated in detail, some conclusions are outlined in the end of this paper.},

In this work we continue to investigate about these concepts. We first focus on mutual-visibility in Cartesian products . For this purpose, too, we introduce and investigate independent mutual-visibility sets. In the very special case of the Cartesian product of two complete graphs the problem is shown to be equivalent to the well-known Zarenkiewicz’s problem. We also characterize the triangle-free graphs with the mutual-visibility number equal to 3.},

The right to exit gives individuals the opportunity to get rid of exploitation, and the aspiration is the self-evaluation of individuals. Stimulated by these, we study the effect of aspiration driven exit on cooperation in the spatial prisoner dilemma game. In the game, the aspiration level and payoff of interactive determine the individual’s state. When the individual gets more than aspiration level by interacting with other players, the individual will continue to participate in the game as an active player. On the contrary, when the payoff is lower than the aspiration level, individual exits the game as an inactive player. At the same time, inactive player who exits from the game will get random payoff and pay a certain cost. The promotion of cooperative behavior mainly depends on the aspiration level of players. An appropriate level of aspiration will lead to a high cooperation, which is based on the formation of cooperative clusters. These cooperators can get rid of the invasion of defectors, even if there is a great temptation of defection, this is because the inactive defectors who exit have cut off the interaction between the cooperative cluster and the defectors. Our research provides a feasible way to solve the social dilemma and will stimulate further application.},

Specifically, when the person who punishes evil and promotes good plays a game with the cooperator, his contributions will bring the same benefits to both parties, reflecting the promoting good. However, when the person who punishes evil and promotes good plays a game with the defector, making the benefit of the defector loss and become his own benefit, reflecting the punishing evil. The results show that when only the role of punishing evil is considered, increasing punishment strength can easily make those punishing evil and promoting good and ordinary cooperators appear. But only increasing the punishment is not enough to weed out the defectors. When only the effect of promoting good is considered, under a smaller temptation to defection, the increase of the reward strength can transform the system from a full defection state to a full cooperation state. Whereas when the temptation is greater, the increase in the reward is not enough for the cooperator to survive and only defectors exist in the system at this time. In addition, there exist combinations of minimum values of punishment and reward that bring the system to a defector-free state. In conclusion, our study finds effective intervals for promoting the development of those who punish evil and promote good and ordinary cooperators, respectively.},

Compared with well-mixed populations, networks model local rather than global interactions by restricting them to social neighborhoods. In this work, we propose an evolutionary game model that is able to capture the effect of long-range links mixing local neighborhood and global group interactions in a finite networked population. We derived dynamical equations for the evolution of cooperation under weak selection by employing the mean-field and pair approximation approach. Using properties of Markov processes, we can approach a theoretical analysis of the effect of the density of mixing link. We find a rule governing the emergence and stabilization of cooperation, which shows that the positive or negative effect of mixing-link density for fixed group size depends on the global benefit in the public goods game. With mutations, we study the average abundance of cooperators and find that increasing mixing links promotes cooperation in strong dilemmas and hinders cooperation in weak dilemmas. These results are independent of whether strategy transfer is allowed via mixing links or not.},

Kunreuther et al., Judgm. Decis. Mak. 4 (5) (2009) 363–384), the dynamical properties of the SPD game is investigated in this paper. For the non-repeated SPD game, we can see that the increase of noise intensity will not only lead to loss of the stochastic stability of the boundary state corresponding to defection but also the non-equilibrium phase transition of the quasi-stationary distribution of the system, and that the fixation probability of cooperation will increase with the increase of noise intensity. However, for the stochastic TFT-AllD game, the increase of noise intensity will lead to the loss of the stochastic stability of the two boundaries corresponding to cooperation and defection respectively, but will not lead to the non-equilibrium phase transition of the quasi-stationary distribution of the system. Moreover, as a special case of the stochastic TFT-AllD game (i.e., ( m − 1 ) ( b − c ) = 2 c (m−1)(b−c)=2c ), we show that the fixation probability of TFT will increase (decrease) with the increase of noise intensity if the initial frequency of TFT is less (or larger) than 1/2.},

  abstract     = {The problem of global exponential stability of neural networks with a time-varying delay is studied in this article. Firstly, to fully utilize the cross-term relationships among state variables, an improved augmented delay-product-type Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, including an extra double integral state, is established for the stability analysis. Accordingly, this augmented LKF derivative is a higher-order function of the time-varying delay. Then, three state vectors are considered to reduce the order of the function to cubic. So, to obtain the feasible negative-definiteness condition of this LKF derivative of non-convexity, a negative-determination lemma for cubic functions is employed to handle this problem. As a result, a novel stability criterion is obtained. Two well-known numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the criterion.},

  abstract     = {Based on a time-dependent auxiliary variable approach, we propose linear, totally decoupled, and energy dissipative methods for the three-phase conservative Allen–Cahn (CAC) fluid system. The three-phase CAC equation has been extensively applied in the simulation of multi-component fluid flows because of the following advantages: (i) Total mass is conserved, (ii) Topological change of the interface can be implicitly captured. Compared with the ternary Cahn–Hilliard (CH) model, the CAC-type model is simple to solve. When we solve the CAC model by using the classical scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, extra computational time is needed because we must decouple the local and non-local variables. The variant of SAV approach considered in the present study not only leads to linear and energy stable schemes, but also achieves highly efficient computation. Linear and decoupled equations need to be updated at each time step. We adopt the linear multigrid algorithm to speed up the convergence. Extensive numerical experiments with and without fluid flows are conducted to validate the temporal accuracy, mass conservation, and energy law.},

The paper extends the theory of characteristic quasi-polynomial to derive equivalent stability conditions. Based on the quasi-polynomial, a two-variate polynomial is defined and it is proved that system stability is equivalently guaranteed if all roots of the new polynomial are not allocated in a certain region of the right half plane (RHP). Moreover, the algorithm uses the proposed equivalent stability conditions to develop a set of implementable stability conditions based on the exposed edges theorem. The algorithm is applied to three simulation examples that admit some novel results for these systems. The first example shows the step-by-step procedure for the proposed algorithm. The second and the third ones compare various aspects of the proposed algorithm with some existing methods. Two hundred and fifty delay systems are randomly generated and the proposed algorithm is compared with them in terms of conservativeness and computational burden. The results reveal the superiority of the proposed method over the existing ones.},

  abstract     = {Component-wise WENO schemes are attractive to researchers for simulations of complex problems in practice especially for the cases whose full characteristic structures cannot be computed in closed form, as they avoid the expensive and complex characteristic-decomposition approach. However, these schemes suffer from spurious oscillations near discontinuities. In this work, we address this issue for the component-wise WENO-IM(2, 0.1) scheme whose characteristic-wise version has been well validated and proved to be very low dissipative in [H. Feng, C. Huang, R. Wang, An improved mapped weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme, Appl. Math. Comput. 232 (2014) 453–468]. We propose to use a very simple modified mapping technique that removes or greatly decreases spurious oscillations for the component-wise WENO-IM(2, 0.1) scheme without causing any extra computational cost. Several benchmark tests modeled via one-dimensional and two-dimensional Euler equations are conducted to validate and evaluate the proposed scheme. The results demonstrate that the new scheme obtains the formal order of accuracy in smooth regions regardless of extreme points. Moreover, its robustness is as good as the characteristic-wise WENO-IM(2, 0.1) scheme. And consequently, the proposed scheme is much more stable than the component-wise WENO-IM(2, 0.1) scheme as expected. Besides, compared to the characteristic-wise WENO-IM(2, 0.1) scheme, the new method is about 30% to 50% faster in simulating two-dimensional problems, which indicates its excellent efficiency.},

The partially penalized immersed finite element (PPIFE) methods are used for the spatial discretization to resolve discontinuity of the diffusion coefficient across the interface. The classical extrapolation method is adopted to treat the nonlinear term , which effectively avoids the complicated numerical calculation of the nonlinearity . Our error analysis is based on the corresponding time-discrete system, which neatly splits the error into two parts: the temporal discretization error and the spatial discretization error. Since the spatial discretization error is independent of time step size τ τ , we can unconditionally derive the optimal error estimates in both L 2 L2 norm and semi- H 1 H1 norm, while previous works always require the coupling condition of time step and space size. Numerical experiments are given to confirm the theoretical analysis.},

Individuals contribute to a public pool and act either fairly or unfairly to share the public resource. The participator can either accept the allocation scheme to get a payoff that is better than nothing, or reject it to punish inequality. In the case of discrete strategies, we find that both extreme inequality and fairness fail to optimize the spreading of cooperator, a moderate unfairness best favors the evolution of cooperation under the effects of cyclic dominance. In the case of continuous strategies, it is found that the population evolves into a less unfair state particularly for the coexistence of two strategies, and cooperators prevail by acting fairer than defectors in a spontaneous manner. Our work reveals that inequality impacts the evolution of cooperation significantly and highlights the importance of fairness and unfairness in enhancing the evolution of cooperation.},

This is known to hold for many classes of trees, including spiders - trees with exactly one vertex of degree greater than two. In fact, it has been verified that certain spiders of order slightly larger than m 2 m2 also have burning numbers at most m m , a result that has then been conjectured to be true for all trees. The first focus of this paper is to verify this slightly stronger conjecture for double spiders - trees with two vertices of degrees at least three and they are adjacent. Our other focus concerns the burning numbers of path forests, a class of graphs in which their burning numbers are naturally related to that of spiders and double spiders. Here, our main result shows that a path forest of order m 2 m2 with a sufficiently long shortest path has burning number exactly m m , the smallest possible for any path forest of the same order.},

Since it is modeled by nonlinear equations that are usually solved in complex domains, it is difficult to solve by means of finite element method and finite difference method and so on. In the paper, we will provide a kind of new fast meshfree methods based on radial basis functions. At first, the part of diffusion terms for 1D and 2D radiation diffusion equations are linearized directly on time to form the new implicit schemes, and Kansa’s non-symmetric collocation method with the compactly supported radial basis function is used to solve the radiation diffusion problem. Second, the successive permutation iterative algorithms for full-implicit discretization on time are constructed furtherly, which are more efficient than the former algorithm. In the end, the accuracy and efficiency of the presented algorithms are verified by 1D and 2D numerical experiments. The new meshfree methods not only avoid the complexity of mesh generation, but also solve the radiation diffusion problem with high accuracy.},

If the Michaelis-Menten flux is taken as a function of time, the analytical solution of series form can be derived by the generalized finite Hankel transform. In the calculation, the Michaelis-Menten flux is evaluated by the numerical concentration at the root surface and the number of terms of the partial sum is determined after adequately approximating the numerical solution. Therefore, we improve and develop the analytical method built by Garg et al., and exemplify and verify it by the nitrogen uptake model for roots. The investigated model has a representatively and completely mathematical structure among most nutrient uptake models, and then the analytical method and the solutions developed here can also be used to nutrient uptake problems in soil subject to homogeneous or inhomogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions .},

A class of singularities of focus type with two zero eigenvalues (nilpotent or more degenerate) has been studied. We find the box dimension of a polynomial degenerate focus of type ( n , n ) (n,n) by exploiting the well-known fractal results for α α -power spirals. In the general ( m , n ) (m,n) case, we formulate a conjecture about the box dimension of a degenerate focus using numerical experiments. Further, we reduce the fractal analysis of planar nilpotent contact points to the study of the box dimension of a slow-fast spiral generated by their “entry-exit” function. There exists a bijective correspondence between the box dimension of the slow-fast spirals and the codimension of contact points. We also construct a three-dimensional vector field that contains a degenerate spiral, called an elliptical power spiral, as a trajectory.},

But since these alliances, which can be formed by different numbers of competitors, can also compete against each other, it is important to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Here, we therefore compare the vitalities of two two-species alliances whose members either beat each other mutually via a bidirectional invasion or they exchange their positions during an inner dynamics. The resulting four-species model shows rich behavior in dependence on the model parameter p p , which characterizes the inner invasions, and β β , which determines the intensity of site exchanges. In the low p p and the large p p limit, when the inner invasion becomes biased, three-member rock-scissors-paper-type solutions emerge, where one of the members is oppressed by having the smallest average concentration due to heterogeneous inner invasion rates. Interestingly, however, if we allow a more intensive site exchange between the oppressed species, they can morph into a winning pair and dominate the full parameter plane. We show that their victory utilizes the vulnerability of the rival alliance based on cyclic dominance, where a species can easily fixate a limited-size domain.},

Preference reversal, a systematic disparity between people’s valuations and choices, implies that individuals’ preferences are inherently unstable and changing. To better understand how cooperation evolves, we develop a simple model with preference reversal in the context of the public goods game, in which the decision on whether and how to punish defectors is heavily influenced by the cooperators’ preference for punishment in two decision-making processes. We explore the effects of preference reversal on the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation in infinitely well-mixed populations. We also specify the scenarios where preference reversal favors cooperation. The chance of preference reversal as well as the predisposing conditions for preference reversal are critical in determining whether preference reversal facilitates the emergence of cooperation.},

In fact, individuals often need to face a dichotomous scenario: choosing to move together with others and pay the communication cost, or choosing to walk alone and have no communication cost. In this paper, a modified Vicsek model is proposed, in which agents have different kinds of moving patterns depending on the strategies taken by them. Each individual obtains a payoff based on the benefit of the collective motion and the cost of communication with neighbors. Individuals update their strategies according to the evolutionary game theory . It is found that not only cooperation can be maintained, but also the highest synchronization level can be achieved at an optimal value of communication radius. The influence of other pertinent quantities such as the random noise, the relative cost, and the density of agents have also been investigated in detail.},

  abstract     = {Each hereditary property can be characterized by its set of minimal obstructions; these sets are often unknown, or known but infinite. By allowing extra structure it is sometimes possible to describe such properties by a finite set of forbidden objects. This has been studied most intensely when the extra structure is a linear ordering of the vertex set. For instance, it is known that a graph G is k k -colourable if and only if V ( G ) V(G) admits a linear ordering ≤ ≤ with no vertices v 1 ≤ ⋯ ≤ v k + 1 v1≤⋯≤vk+1 such that v i v i + 1 ∈ E ( G ) vivi+1∈E(G) for every i ∈ { 1 , ⋯ , k } i∈{1,⋯,k} . In this paper, we study such characterizations when the extra structure is a circular ordering of the vertex set. We show that the classes that can be described by finitely many forbidden circularly ordered graphs include forests, circular-arc graphs, and graphs with circular chromatic number less than k k . In fact, every description by finitely many forbidden circularly ordered graphs can be translated to a description by finitely many forbidden linearly ordered graphs. Nevertheless, our observations underscore the fact that in many cases the circular order descriptions are nicer and more natural.},

The restrained double Roman domination number (RDRD number) γ r d R ( G ) γrdR(G) is the minimum weight ∑ v ∈ V ( G ) f ( v ) ∑v∈V(G)f(v) taken over all RDRD functions of G G .

Relationships between γ r d R γrdR and some well-known parameters such as restrained domination number γ r γr , domination number γ γ or restrained Roman domination number γ r R γrR are investigated in this paper by bounding γ r d R γrdR from below and above involving γ r γr , γ γ or γ r R γrR for general graphs, respectively.

We provide a notation for expressing nonzero-sum bimatrix games in terms of two matrix games using the idea of separation of a bimatrix game into two different matrix games. Next, we prove theorems regarding boundaries of the game value depending on only norms of the payoff matrix for each player of the nonzero-sum bimatrix game. In addition to these, we refine the boundaries of the game value for the zero/nonzero sum matrix games. Therefore, we succeed to find an improved interval for the game value, which is a crucial improvement for both nonzero and zero-sum matrix games. As a consequence, we can solve a nonzero-sum bimatrix game for each player approximately without solving any equations. Moreover, we modify the inequalities for the extrema of the strategy set for the nonzero-sum bimatrix games. Furthermore, we adapt the min-max theorem of the MN approach for the nonzero-sum bimatrix games. Finally, we consider various bimatrix game examples from the literature, including the famous battle of sexes, to demonstrate the consistency of our approaches. We also show that the repeated applications of Extended Matrix Norm (EMN) methods work well to obtain a better-estimated game value in view of the obtained convergence results.},

Some properties are given to ensure the FT consensus of the nonlinear MASs. Furthermore, we extend our results to the directed communication situation of agents. The FT leader-following consensus problem with directed topology via intermittent control is solved as well.

  abstract     = {A novel parameter estimation method based on the Laplace transform and the response sensitivity method has been presented to recognize the parameters of linear fractional-order systems (FOS) rapidly. The proposed method consumes two orders of magnitude computational resources lower than the traditional time-domain method. Fractional-order operators are increasingly widely used in control and synchronization, epidemiology, viscoelastic material modelling and other emerging disciplines. It is difficult to measure the fractional-order α α and system parameters directly in real engineering applications. This paper’s main work include: Firstly, a general linear fractional differential equation is transformed into an algebraic equation by the Laplace transform, and the parameter sensitivity analysis concerning the unknown parameters is also deduced. Then, the parameter estimation problem of the linear FOS is established as a nonlinear least-squares optimization in the Laplace domain, and the enhanced response sensitivity method is adopted to resolve this nonlinear minimum optimization equation iteratively. In addition, the Tikhonov regularization is employed to cope with the potential ill-posed situations, and the trust-region restriction is also introduced to improve the convergence. Finally, taking a differential system with two types of fractional-order operators, a multi-degree-of-freedom FOS with external excitation and an actual piezoelectric actuator model as examples, the specific implementation process is demonstrated in detail to test the robustness and validity of the proposed approach.},

Within this work, a bilevel optimization technique with a suitable mathematical background is proposed to detect automatically three crucial parameters: α 0 α0 , α 1 α1 and θ θ . The parameters α 0 α0 , α 1 α1 control the Total Generalized Variation (TGV) regularization while the parameter θ θ is related to the anisotropic diffusive tensor. A proper selection of these parameters represents a challenging task. Since these parameters are always related to a better approximation of the image gradient and texture, their computation plays a major role in preserving the image features. Analytically, we include results on the approximation of these parameters as well as the resolution of the encountered bilevel problem in a suitable framework. In addition, to resolve the PDE-constrained minimization problem, a modified primal-dual algorithm is proposed. Finally, numerical results are provided to remove noise and simultaneously keep safe fine details and important features with numerous comparisons to show the performance of the proposed approach.},

Firstly, based on the relationship between the system pole configuration and the system performance, a sufficient condition for the distribution of the system eigenvalues in a specific region is given, i.e., a new criterion for the interval stability/stabilization of LISSs. Meanwhile, a new algorithm is designed to precisely control the convergence speed of the target system by combining the interval stabilization method. In addition, an H ∞ H∞ control criterion constrained by the convergence rate of the system is also proposed. Finally, the effectiveness and applicability of the method are verified by numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of fuzzy adaptive secure tracking control for nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems with unknown false data injection (FDI) attacks and input quantization. In the nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems, the nonlinear functions contain all state variables so that the existing control methods will lead to the algebraic-loop problem. This difficulty is solved by combining the variable separation method and the properties of fuzzy basis functions. Furthermore, the tremor problem caused by the quantized input is solved by using the nonlinear function separation technique and the impact of FDI attacks is mitigated by constructing the attack compensators. On this basis, a secure tracking control strategy is proposed, which ensures the tracking error can converge to a small neighborhood of the origin and all signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded even in the presence of unknown FDI attacks. Different from the existing resilient control results for dealing with FDI attacks, this paper proposes a secure tracking control method of nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems and also quantifies the input signal to reduce the signal transmission burden. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the designed control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems have a wide range of applications in the age suffering information overload. A promising way to design better recommender systems in the presence of ubiquitous social media is to utilize social relationships in recommendation algorithms, named social recommendation. One critical challenge in social recommendation is how to mine valuable information intrinsic to social relationships and integrate such information into the algorithm design. In this paper, we argue that both social relationships and historical behaviors are affected by the same implicit factors. For example, due to the existence of implicit factors such as peer influence or common interests in social networks, users with similar implicit factors will have a high probability to become friends and collect similar objects. Accordingly, we propose a recommendation algorithm that jointly utilizes social relationships and historical behaviors, based on the extended linear optimization technique. We test the performance of our algorithm for four groups of users on real networks, including all users, active users, inactive users and cold-start users. Results show that, in all the above four scenarios, the proposed algorithm performs overall best subject to accuracy and diversity metrics compared with the benchmarks. In particular, the algorithm remarkably improves the recommendation performance for cold-start users. Further analysis shows that the contribution of social relationships depends on the coupling strength between social relationships and historical behaviors.},

The high-order CWENO spatial discretisation is selected due to its reduced computational footprint and improved non-oscillatory behaviour compared to the original WENO variant. Fortifying the CWENO method with the relaxed MOOD technique has been necessary to further improve the robustness of the CWENO method. A series of challenging 2-D and 3-D compressible multicomponent flow problems have been investigated, such as the interaction of a shock with a helium bubble, and a water droplet, and the shock-induced collapse of 2-D and 3-D bubbles arrays. Such problems are generally very stiff due to the strong gradients present, and it has been possible to tackle them using the extended MOOD-CWENO numerical framework.},

Then, a discontinuous multiple Lyapunov function is presented under the event-triggered state feedback control, and several sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the closed-loop systems are regular, impluse-free and globally uniformly exponentially stable (GUES). Then, a Luenberger-like observer is constructed to estimate continuous and jumping states, some new sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained by using matrix decoupling techniques under the observer-based ETC. Furthermore, a lower bound for the event-triggered time interval to exclude the Zeno phenomenon is given.

Iterating the existing Darboux transformation at the same spectral parameter once and twice, we respectively construct the solutions to describe the so-called fundamental nonlinear waves (FNWs) and the degenerate FNWs. A two-branch condition is found to divide the FNWs into three-branch case and two-branch case. For the three-branch case, FNW is the nonlinear superposition of a breather and two dark-bright solitons, while for the two-branch case, FNW is the nonlinear superposition of a breather (not the Kuznetsov-Ma breather) and a dark-bright soliton. Compared with the degenerate nonlinear waves reported before, the degenerate three-branch FNW is found to obey the similar rule but the degenerate two-branch FNW not. Indeed, degenerate two-branch FNW is the nonlinear superposition of a breather, a dark-bright soliton and a two-branch FNW, and the trajectories of such three branches possess the same linear part but are not symmetric with respect to the common linear part. Thus, our study may offer a different point to explain certain phenomena observed in the optical experiments. Besides, we infer that our study can be generalized to the certain coupled systems which admit the similar nonlinear waves with the FNWs.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel semi-implicit hybrid finite volume / finite element (FV/FE) scheme for the numerical solution of the incompressible and weakly compressible Navier-Stokes equations on moving unstructured meshes using a direct Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation. The scheme is based on a suitable splitting of the governing partial differential equations into subsystems and employs a staggered grid arrangement, where the pressure is defined on the primal simplex mesh, while the velocity and the remaining flow quantities are defined on an edge-based staggered dual mesh. The key idea of the scheme presented in this paper is to discretize the nonlinear convective and viscous terms at the aid of an explicit finite volume scheme that employs the space-time divergence form of the governing equations on moving space-time control volumes. For the convective terms , an ALE extension of the Ducros flux on moving meshes is introduced, which can be proven to be kinetic energy preserving and stable in the energy norm when adding suitable numerical dissipation terms. The use of closed space-time control volumes inside the finite volume scheme guarantees that the important geometric conservation law (GCL) of Lagrangian schemes is verified by construction . Finally, the pressure equation of the Navier-Stokes system is solved on the new mesh configuration at the aid of a classical continuous finite element method, using traditional P 1 P1 Lagrange elements. A numerical convergence study confirms that the scheme is second order accurate in space. Subsequently, the ALE hybrid FV/FE method is applied to several incompressible test problems ranging from non-hydrostatic free surface flows over a rising bubble to flows over an oscillating cylinder and an oscillating ellipse . Via the simulation of a circular explosion problem on a moving mesh, we show that the scheme applied to the weakly compressible Navier-Stokes equations is able to capture also weak shock waves, rarefactions and moving contact discontinuities. We also provide numerical evidence which shows that compared to a fully explicit ALE scheme, the semi-implicit ALE method proposed in this paper is particularly efficient for the simulation of weakly compressible flows in the low Mach number limit.},

Sensor saturations are first introduced into MNs to study the state estimation of MNs. The aim of this paper is to design a set of H ∞ H∞ state estimators to estimate the state of MNs through the available output measurements. The basic requirements of this kind of estimators are that the dynamics of estimation error is exponentially mean-square stable and meets the H ∞ H∞ performance requirement. The sufficient conditions are established to meet these two basic requirements. In this paper, the normal operation, sensor saturations and missing measurements of MNs are described in a unified way by means of Kronecker delta function, and a new measurement model is proposed to describe these random events. This model can clearly and intuitively explain any combination of the normal operation, sensor saturations and missing measurements only by changing the probability of their random occurrence. Next, the estimator gain of the designed estimators for MNs can be easily obtained by taking advantage of solving certain matrix inequalities. Through a series of analysis, it is found that there is an important relationship between the inter-layer couplings of MNs and the estimation time of MNs. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation approach is verified by numerical simulations.},

Previous studies indicated that multiple epidemics rarely evolve dependently, but constantly interact and coevolve. In this paper, a novel mathematical model is proposed to study the link cooperation effect of two epidemics cooperatively spreading on complex networks. The link cooperation effect means that the first epidemic is transmitted through this link, and the second epidemic will have a higher transmission probability when it is transmitted through the same link. We develop an edge-based compartmental method and can well predict the numerical simulations. We find the link cooperation effect promote the epidemic outbreak size. The phase transition is closely relates to the strength of the link cooperation effect and network topology. For the cooperate epidemics on ER networks, the phase transition is discontinuous for a stronger link cooperation effect, otherwise the phase transition is continuous. When cooperative epidemics spread on SF networks, the phase transition is always continuous because of the existence of a few hubs. Our developed theoretical method can reasonably predict the above phenomena that are obtained from the numerical simulations based on the proposed mathematical model.},

Based on multi-objective optimization, we provide a global cooperative decision model to allocate the inputs and outputs among countries based on their strengths and demands. Furthermore, we analyze the the trends of EEI of each country under the influence of the outbreak events by using the autoregressive integrated moving average model. Our results show that among all countries with foundations in aerospace, China has the highest EEI while Russia ranks the lowest.

In the authors’ preceding studies, the input/output relation of sampled-data systems was described in an operator-theoretic fashion, and the kernel and input functions of an input operator and the hold function of an output operator were approximated by piecewise l l th order polynomials with l = 0 , 1 l=0,1 . This leads to an approximate computation of this norm, where the computation errors were shown to converge to 0 in the order of 1 / M l + 1 1/Ml+1 as the approximation parameter M M becomes larger. Along this line, we aim at improving the computation performance compared to the preceding studies by considering the freedom in the point around which the corresponding functions are expanded to a Taylor series . This leads to a generalization of the piecewise l l th order approximations, and we show that taking the central point for the Taylor expansion leads to quantitatively improved accuracy than that of our preceding results that take an edge point . Finally, the effectiveness of the developed method is verified through a numerical example .},

We define a custom loss function to guarantee the physical properties of the numerical solution as well as the conservation of the energy. In particular, the present method is mesh-free since it only inputs random spatiotemporal points and can avoid the difficulties and complexities caused by the mesh-based method. Moreover, our method is parallel, it solves each variable simultaneously and independently. Furthermore, we obtain the convergence analysis to illustrate the capabilities of our method for solving the coupled problems. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

During each duty cycle, the amplitude of the pulse is fixed. Secondly, assuming that the networked heat equations are connected through undirected strongly connected topology, a boundary PWM controller for each subsystem is constructed based on boundary output state at each sampling instant and consensus protocols,which provides an alternative digital implementation strategy for the consensus control of networked heat equations.

A kind of linearly distributed ghost fluid states is defined via a local double-medium generalized Riemann problem (GRP) at the material interface. The advantages of the GRP-based GFM over the RP-based GFM (MGFM) are reflected in the following aspects: (i) The GRP-based GFM can maintain the continuity of the material derivatives of the pressure across material interfaces, so that the pressure mismatch in the RP-based GFM (MGFM) can be eliminated dramatically, even for long time computation. (ii) The initial data for the associated Riemann problem of the local double-medium GRP are second-order approximation for the fluid states at material interfaces, and the initial data for the local double-medium GRP are also second-order approximation for the fluid states near material interfaces, so that the numerical accuracy are increased greatly. (iii) The GRP-based GFM can reflect the thermodynamical properties of different mediums, which have fundamental importance for the study of compressible fluid flow, so that the overheating errors in the RP-based GFM (MGFM) can be suppressed. Several typical numerical examples display the excellent performance of our new method.},

However, the repeated reassemblage of finite element matrices for nonlinear PDEs is frequently pointed out as one of the bottlenecks in the computations. The second bottleneck being the large and numerous linear systems to be solved arising from the use of Newton’s method to solve nonlinear systems of equations . In this paper, we will address the first issue. We will see how under mild assumptions the assemblage procedure may be rewritten using a completely loop-free algorithm. Our approach leads to a small matrix-matrix multiplication for which we may count on highly optimized algorithms.},

Where we consider a type of nonnegative impulses, which do not need to be in step with the switching behaviors in the constructed systems. The main challenge of this study comes from the estimation of Lyapunov functions within any time interval under the coupling effect of asynchronous switches and state jumps. To solve this difficulty, based on the multiple max-separable Lyapunov functions (MSLFs) method involving mode-dependent average impulsive interval (MDAII) approach, we consider two special cases in which switching and impulses are completely asynchronous and synchronous respectively, and successfully establish the relation of impulse strength, system modes, ADT and MDAII. Subsequently, several stability criteria are presented for ISPNSs with unstable and/or stable modes. In particular, the impact of various sorts of impulses on stability are also analysed in depth. Then, the obtained results are applied to the ISPNSs with synchronous impulses and switching. Moreover, the stability conditions of the considered systems without switches are gained directly, which enshrouds the existing results.},

However, there is still an innate selfishness in us that greatly challenges our cooperative drive in the context of natural selection. Up to date, numerous mechanisms have been proposed to facilitate cooperation. And in recent years, under the proposed interactive diversity reflecting the differentiate behavior towards distinct co-players, all the interaction environment is consistent and static which is not totally matched with the variable and distinguished environment in realistic life. Besides, the environment for pairwise interactions is more reasonable than the one for one player. Thereout, we take the dynamic edge environment under interactive diversity into consideration and introduce parameter δ δ to denote the environment fluctuation scale. The numeral simulation results suggest that although a larger δ δ plays a more significant role, the dynamic edge environment is a double-edged sword, as the cooperation can be promoted significantly when the temptation to defect is relatively large, while one would be eroded when the temptation to defect is relatively small.},

The proposed method has the ability to simulate complex hedgehog and comb-like spike structures without using an additional magnetization equation. A single dipole permanent magnet is defined instead of multiple point dipoles which makes this method much simpler and more efficient compared to the numerical approaches available in the literature. A comparison between the simulation results and experimental findings is provided to verify the validity of our method. A criterion for the prediction of spikes is presented for uniform magnetic fields. This study also investigates the effects of different types of magnetic fields, their strengths, and the effect of surrounding non-magnetic fluid on the spike structures. Moreover, the description of magnetic field lines, distribution of magnetic flux density, and energy estimation are also provided in this work which gives a useful insight into the hydrodynamic as well as the magnetostatic behavior of ferrofluids.},

  abstract     = {Both the sharp interface and diffuse interface Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) models have been developed in the literature for studying electrostatic interaction between a solute molecule and its surrounding solvent environment. In the mathematical analysis and numerical computation for these PB models, a significant challenge is due to singular charge sources in terms of Dirac delta distributions. Recently, based on various regularization schemes for the sharp interface PB equation, the first regularization method for the diffuse interface PB model has been developed in [S. Wang, E. Alexov, and S. Zhao, Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering , 18 , 1370–1405, (2021)] for analytically treating the singular charges. This work concerns with the convergence of a diffuse interface PB model to the sharp interface PB model, as the diffused Gaussian-convolution surface (GCS) approaches to the sharp solvent accessible surface (SAS). Due to the limitation in numerical algorithm and mesh resolution, such a convergence is impossible to be verified numerically. Through analyzing the weak solution for the regularized PB equations, the convergences for both the reaction-field potential and electrostatic free energy are rigorously proved in this work. Moreover, this study provides a unified regularization for both sharp interface and diffuse interface PB models, and clarifies the connection between this unified formulation and the existing regularizations. This lays a theoretical foundation to develop regularization for more complicated PB models.},

Some of these methods are designed to operate in noise-free environments, such as those methods that directly quantify the separation rate of two initially close trajectories. As an alternative, this paper provides two nonlinear indirect regression methods for estimating the Lyapunov exponents on a noisy environment. We extend the global Jacobian method, by using local polynomial kernel regressions and local neural net kernel models. We apply such methods to several noise-contaminated time series coming from different data generating processes. The results show that in general, the Jacobian indirect methods provide better results than the traditional direct methods for both clean and noisy time series. Moreover, the local Jacobian indirect methods provide more robust and accurate fit than the global ones, with the methods using local networks obtaining more accurate results than those using local polynomials.},

  abstract     = {Renewal equations are frequently encountered in several applications when regenerative arguments are used in modelling. Since, these equations usually do not have analytical solutions, bounds have a great practical importance. The aim of this paper is to present some new bounds for the renewal function and the variance of the renewal process. A general lower bound for the renewal function is given, which is a refinement of all known lower bounds and attains the well-known asymptotic result of Asmussen (2003). Also, some new tighter upper and lower bounds for the renewal function, which are based on several reliability classifications of the distribution of the inter-arrival times, are given. Improved upper and lower bounds for the variance of the renewal process are also presented. Finally, several numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed new bounds.},

  abstract     = {We present the development of approximate numerical schemes to solve the non-linear fragmentation model. Two numerical weighted finite volume techniques are presented based on the particulate system’s mass and number preservation properties. In addition, we have extended the results for multi-dimensional formulation. A detailed discussion on mathematical convergence analysis and consistency is exhibited under some regulations on the collision kernels and initial data . It is shown that the developed schemes mathematically possess a second-order convergence rate irrespective of the mesh type. Several numerical examples are presented to validate the proficiency and accuracy of the developed schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we extend the GeDS methodology, recently developed by Kaishev et al. [18] for the Normal univariate spline regression case, to the more general GNM/GLM context. Our approach is to view the (non-)linear predictor as a spline with free knots which are estimated, along with the regression coefficients and the degree of the spline, using a two stage algorithm. In stage A, a linear (degree one) free-knot spline is fitted to the data applying iteratively re-weighted least squares. In stage B, a Schoenberg variation diminishing spline approximation to the fit from stage A is constructed, thus simultaneously producing spline fits of second, third and higher degrees. We demonstrate, based on a thorough numerical investigation that the nice properties of the Normal GeDS methodology carry over to its GNM extension and GeDS favourably compares with other existing spline methods. The proposed GeDS GNM/GLM methodology is extended to the multivariate case of more than one independent variable by utilizing tensor product splines and their related shape preserving variation diminishing property.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, to simulate some situations in the real world, a class issue of finite-time synchronization (FTS) about fractional-order quaternion-valued neural networks (FOQVNNs) with time delay is discussed. Firstly, there is no need to divide the QVNNs into several subsystems, some new lemmas related to the sign function of quaternion-valued are established in the quaternion domain. Secondly, based on the proposed sign function framework, a concise and effective controller is directly designed and FTS criteria are derived by constructing the Lyapunov function. Moreover, two settling times of synchronization are effectively estimated. Finally, some examples are shown to testify the correctness of the presented theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Many Hamiltonian systems can be recast in multi-symplectic form. We develop a reduced-order model (ROM) for multi-symplectic Hamiltonian partial differential equations (PDEs) that preserves the global energy. The full-order solutions are obtained by finite difference discretization in space and the global energy preserving average vector field (AVF) method. The ROM is constructed in the same way as the full-order model (FOM) applying proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with the Galerkin projection. The reduced-order system has the same structure as the FOM, and preserves the discrete reduced global energy. Applying the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), the reduced-order solutions are computed efficiently in the online stage. A priori error bound is derived for the DEIM approximation to the nonlinear Hamiltonian. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the ROMs are demonstrated for the Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation, Zakharov-Kuznetzov (ZK) equation, and nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation in multi-symplectic form. Preservation of the reduced energies shows that the reduced-order solutions ensure the long-term stability of the solutions.},

  abstract     = {We study the temporal stability of linear two-dimensional disturbances of plane Poiseuille flow of a Casson fluid in a rigid parallel channel under the influence of a uniform magnetic field. When the disturbance is taken in normal mode it transforms the perturbed equations to a fourth-order eigenvalue problem which is then solved by the spectral method . We first obtain sufficient conditions for the hydrodynamic stability in the channel by analyzing the nature of the growth rate and the Reynolds number . For the chosen set of parameters, the eigenspectra of the flow exhibit the familiar Y-shaped structure with three distinct modes depending on the phase speed approach. The eigenfunctions corresponding to the least stable and most unstable eigenmodes have the symmetric and antisymmetric modes. For a certain range of Casson parameter β β and the magnetic number M M , instability always appears on the wall mode for which the eigenfunction is antisymmetric about the channel center-line. The neutral stability curves that correspond to various values of β β and M M are found to be an extension of the continuation of the Tollmien-Schlichting instability that is noticed for a Newtonian channel flow. The regions of stability are enlarged for small β β and large M M .},
