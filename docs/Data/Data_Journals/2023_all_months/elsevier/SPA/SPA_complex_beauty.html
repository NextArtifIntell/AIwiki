  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to give explicit rates for the speed of convergence to equilibrium of the solution of the generalized Kac equation in two strong metrics: the total variation distance (TV) and the uniform metric between characteristic functions ( χ 0 χ0 ). A fundamental role in our study is played by the probabilistic representation of the solution of the generalized Kac equation as marginal law of a stochastic process which is a weighted random sum of i.i.d. random variables , where the weights are positive and dependent. Exponential bounds for the total variation distance between the solution and the gaussian stationary state of the Kac equation have been proved by Dolera, Gabetta and Regazzini (2009). In our more general setting the equilibrium states are scale mixtures of stable distributions and hence not necessarily gaussian. Therefore we develop new tools based on ideal metrics that are used in the literature for quantitative central limit theorems for i.i.d. random variables in the domain of attraction of a stable distribution. We obtain first exponential bounds in the so-called ” r r -smoothed total variation” and in the weighted χ r χr -metric for a suitable r r , then we deduce rates of convergence with respect to the “corresponding” uniform metrics TV and χ 0 χ0 .},

Our goal is to characterize the centered Fleming–Viot process with a martingale problem. To establish the existence of a solution to this martingale problem, we exploit the original Fleming–Viot martingale problem and asymptotic expansions . The proof of uniqueness is based on a weakened version of the duality method, allowing us to prove uniqueness for initial conditions admitting finite moments. We also provide counter examples showing that our approach based on the duality method cannot be expected to give uniqueness for more general initial conditions. Finally, we establish ergodicity properties with exponential convergence in total variation for the centered Fleming–Viot process and characterize the invariant measure .},

In a large box of side-length 2 ℓ 2ℓ centered at the origin, the lowest eigenvalue is known to be typically of order ( log ℓ ) − 2 / d (logℓ)−2/d . We show here that with probability arbitrarily close to 1 as ℓ ℓ goes to infinity, the spectral gap stays bigger than σ ( log ℓ ) − ( 1 + 2 / d ) σ(logℓ)−(1+2/d) , where the small positive number σ σ depends on how close to 1 one wishes the probability. Incidentally, the scale ( log ℓ ) − ( 1 + 2 / d ) (logℓ)−(1+2/d) is expected to capture the correct size of the gap. Our result involves the proof of new deconcentration estimates. Combining this lower bound on the spectral gap with the results of Kerner–Pechmann–Spitzer, we infer a type-I generalized Bose–Einstein condensation in probability for a Kac–Luttinger system of non-interacting bosons among Poissonian spherical impurities, with the sole macroscopic occupation of the one-particle ground state when the density exceeds the critical value.},

We focus on processes {R(k):k≥0} where the value of Ri(k+1) depends only on the values {Rj(k):j→i} of its inbound neighbors, and possibly on vertex attributes. We then show that, provided G(Vn,En;An) converges in the local weak sense to a marked Galton–Watson process, the dynamics of the process for a uniformly chosen vertex in Vn can be coupled, for any fixed k , to a process {R0̸(r):0≤r≤k} constructed on the limiting marked Galton–Watson tree. Moreover, we derive sufficient conditions under which R0̸(k) converges, as k→∞ , to a random variable R∗ that can be characterized in terms of the attracting endogenous solution to a branching distributional fixed-point equation. Our framework can also be applied to processes {R(k):k≥0} whose only source of randomness comes from the realization of the graph G(Vn,En;An) .},

We analyze the rate of convergence of a coordinate Gibbs sampler used to simulate from these measures. We show that for every non-zero fixed matrix C = ( c i j ) C=(cij) , and large enough A A , mixing happens in Θ ( A 2 ) Θ(A2) steps in a suitable Wasserstein distance.

  abstract     = {In this paper we focus on a general type of mean-field stochastic control problem with partial observation, in which the coefficients depend in a non-linear way not only on the state process X t Xt and its control u t ut but also on the conditional law E [ X t | F t Y ] E[Xt|FtY] of the state process conditioned with respect to the past of observation process Y Y . We first deduce the well-posedness of the controlled system by showing weak existence and uniqueness in law. Neither supposing convexity of the control state space nor differentiability of the coefficients with respect to the control variable, we study Peng’s stochastic maximum principle for our control problem. The novelty and the difficulty of our work stem from the fact that, given an admissible control u u , the solution of the associated control problem is only a weak one. This has as consequence that also the probability measure in the solution P u = L T u Q Pu=LTuQ depends on u u and has a density L T u LTu with respect to a reference measure Q Q . So characterizing an optimal control leads to the differentiation of non-linear functions f ( P u ∘ { E P u [ X t | F t Y ] } − 1 ) f(Pu∘{EPu[Xt|FtY]}−1) with respect to ( L T u , X t ) (LTu,Xt) . This has as consequence for the study of Peng’s maximum principle that we get a new type of first and second order variational equations and adjoint backward stochastic differential equations , all with new mean-field terms and with coefficients which are not Lipschitz. For their estimates and for those for the Taylor expansion new techniques have had to be introduced and rather technical results have had to be established. The necessary optimality condition we get extends Peng’s one with new, non-trivial terms.},

Our main result is a fluctuation-theoretic distributional equality: the vector ( Y ̄ ( T β ) , G ( T β ) Ȳ(Tβ),G(Tβ) ) can be written as a sum of two independent vectors, the first one being ( Y ̄ ( T β + ω ) , G ( T β + ω ) Ȳ(Tβ+ω),G(Tβ+ω) ) and the second one being the running maximum and corresponding time epoch under the restriction that the Lévy process is only observed at Poisson( ω ω ) inspection epochs (until T β Tβ ). We first provide an analytic proof for this remarkable decomposition, and then a more elementary proof that gives insight into the occurrence of the decomposition and into the fact that ω ω only appears in the right hand side of the decomposition. The proof technique underlying the more elementary derivation also leads to further generalizations of the decomposition, and to some fundamental insights into a generalization of the well known Lindley recursion.},

We consider the intersection processes of order m m together with their ( d − m ( d − k ) ) (d−m(d−k)) -dimensional Hausdorff measure within a geodesic ball of radius r r . Asymptotic normality for fixed r r is shown as the intensity of the underlying Poisson process tends to infinity for all m m satisfying d − m ( d − k ) ≥ 0 d−m(d−k)≥0 . For κ ∈ { − 1 , 0 } κ∈{−1,0} the problem is also approached in the set-up where the intensity is fixed and r r tends to infinity. Again, if 2 k ≤ d + 1 2k≤d+1 a central limit theorem is shown for all possible values of m m . However, while for κ = 0 κ=0 asymptotic normality still holds if 2 k &gt; d + 1 2k&amp;gt;d+1 , we prove for κ = − 1 κ=−1 convergence to a non-Gaussian infinitely divisible limit distribution in the special case m = 1 m=1 . The proof of asymptotic normality is based on the analysis of variances and general bounds available from the Malliavin–Stein method. We also show for general κ ∈ { − 1 , 0 , 1 } κ∈{−1,0,1} that, roughly speaking, the variances within a general observation window W W are maximal if and only if W W is a geodesic ball having the same volume as W W .

The existence part is based on Euler’s approximation as Hao et al. (2021), while, the uniqueness is based on the Schauder estimates in Besov spaces for nonlocal Fokker–Planck equations. For the existence, we only assume the drift being continuous in the density variable. For the weak uniqueness, the drift is assumed to be Lipschitz in the density variable, while for the strong uniqueness, we also need to assume the drift being β0 -order Hölder continuous in the spatial variable, where β0∈(1−α/2,1) .},

For a fixed p p , Penrose proved that there is a critical intensity λ c = λ c ( p ) λc=λc(p) for the existence of a giant component in G n ( λ , p ) Gn(λ,p) .

We propose a new class of probability metrics and show that under such metrics, the convergence is free of the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Such a feature is critical for high-dimensional analysis and stands in contrast to classical metrics ( e.g. , the Wasserstein metric). The proposed metrics fall into the category of integral probability metrics, for which we specify criteria of test function spaces to guarantee the property of being free of CoD. Examples of the selected test function spaces include the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces , Barron space, and flow-induced function spaces. Three applications of the proposed metrics are presented: 1. The convergence of empirical measure in the case of random variables; 2. The convergence of n n -particle system to the solution to McKean–Vlasov stochastic differential equation ; 3. The construction of an ɛ ɛ ɛ -Nash equilibrium for a homogeneous n n -player game by its mean-field limit. As a byproduct, we prove that, given a distribution close to the target distribution measured by our metric and a certain representation of the target distribution , we can generate a distribution close to the target one in terms of the Wasserstein metric and relative entropy . Overall, we show that the proposed class of metrics is a powerful tool to analyze the convergence of empirical measures in high dimensions without CoD.},

We provide a general result for the existence of weak mean field equilibria which, due to the absorption and the common noise, are given by random flow of sub-probabilities. We first use a fixed point argument to find solutions to the mean field problem in a reduced setting resulting from a discretization procedure and then we prove convergence of such equilibria to the desired solution. We exploit these ideas also to construct ɛ ɛ ɛ -Nash equilibria for the N N -player game. Since the approximation is two-fold, one given by the mean field limit and one given by the discretization, some suitable convergence results are needed. We also introduce and discuss a novel model of bank run that can be studied within this framework.},

We show that the empirical spectral distribution weakly converges to a measure with negative support below the AT line, and that the support includes zero on the AT line. In this “macroscopic” sense, we show that TAP free energy is concave in the order parameter of the theory, i.e. the random spin-magnetizations. This proves a spectral interpretation of the AT line. We also find different magnetizations than Bolthausen’s approximate solutions at which the Hessian of the TAP free energy has positive outlier eigenvalues. In particular, when the magnetizations are assumed to be independent of the disorder, we prove that Plefka’s second condition is equivalent to all eigenvalues being negative. On this occasion, we extend the convergence result of Capitaine et al. (Electron. J. Probab. 16 , no. 64, 2011) for the largest eigenvalue of perturbed complex Wigner matrices to the GOE.},

  abstract     = {We consider the test statistic devised by Christensen , Oomen and Renò in 2020 to obtain insight into the causes of flash crashes occurring at particular moments in time in the price of a financial asset. Under an Ito semimartingale model containing a drift component, a Brownian component and finite variation jumps, it is possible to identify when the cause is a drift burst (the statistic explodes) or otherwise (the statistic is asymptotically Gaussian). We complete the investigation showing how infinite variation jumps contribute asymptotically. The result is that the jumps never cause the explosion of the statistic. Specifically, when there are no bursts, the statistic diverges only if the Brownian component is absent, the jumps have finite variation and the drift is non-zero. In this case the triggering is precisely the drift. We also find that the statistic could be adopted for a variety of tests useful for investigating the nature of the data generating process, given discrete observations.},

This is done without assuming any P− integrability conditions and under weaker assumptions on the input data. In particular, we construct a maximal solution for such a RBSDE when the terminal condition ξ is only FT− measurable and the driver f is continuous with general growth with respect to the variable y and stochastic quadratic growth with respect to the variable z . Our result is based on a (generalized) penalization method. This method allows us find an equivalent form to our original RBSDE where its solution has to remain between two new rcll reflecting barriers Y¯ and Y̲ which are, roughly speaking, the limit of the penalizing equations driven by the dominating conditions assumed on the coefficients. A standard and equivalent form to our initial RBSDE as well as a characterization of the solution Y as a generalized Snell envelope of some given predictable process l are also given.},

Starting from discrete observations of the interacting particle system over a fixed interval [ 0 , T ] [0,T] , we propose a contrast function based on a pseudo likelihood approach.

These are useful in applications like A/B testing, multi-armed bandits, off-policy evaluation, election auditing, etc. We present three approaches to constructing a confidence sequence for the population mean, under the minimal assumption that only an upper bound σ 2 σ2 on the variance is known. While previous works rely on light-tail assumptions like boundedness or subGaussianity (under which all moments of a distribution exist), the confidence sequences in our work are able to handle data from a wide range of heavy-tailed distributions. The best among our three methods — the Catoni-style confidence sequence — performs remarkably well in practice, essentially matching the state-of-the-art methods for σ 2 σ2 -subGaussian data, and provably attains the log log t / t loglogt/t lower bound due to the law of the iterated logarithm. Our findings have important implications for sequential experimentation with unbounded observations, since the σ 2 σ2 -bounded-variance assumption is more realistic and easier to verify than σ 2 σ2 -subGaussianity (which implies the former). We also extend our methods to data with infinite variance, but having p p th central moment ( 1 1&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;2 ).},

We assume the data in X X stems from a correlated joint normal distribution. In particular, the correlation acts both across rows and across columns of X X , and we do not assume a specific correlation structure , such as separable dependencies. Instead, we assume that correlations converge uniformly to zero at a speed of a n / n an/n , where a n an may grow mildly to infinity. We employ the method of moments tightly: We identify the exact condition on the growth of a n an which will guarantee that the moments of the empirical spectral distributions (ESDs) converge to the MP moments. If the condition is not met, we can construct an ensemble for which all but finitely many moments of the ESDs diverge. We also investigate the operator norm of V n Vn under a uniform correlation bound of C / n δ C/nδ , where C , δ &gt; 0 C,δ&amp;gt;0 are fixed, and observe a phase transition at δ = 1 δ=1 . In particular, convergence of the operator norm to the maximum of the support of the MP distribution can only be guaranteed if δ &gt; 1 δ&amp;gt;1 . The analysis leads to an example for which the MP law holds almost surely, but the operator norm remains stochastic in the limit, and we provide its exact limiting distribution.},

The first part of the paper is concerned with an alternative method for the construction of Markov projections of semimartingales. In comparison to the construction in Bentata and Cont (2009) which is based on the solution of a well-posed martingale problem, we make essential use of pseudo-differential operators as investigated in Böttcher (2008) and of fundamental solutions of related evolution problems. This approach allows to dismiss with some boundedness assumptions on the differential characteristics in the martingale approach. As consequence of the construction of Markov projections, comparison results for path-independent functions (European options) of semimartingales can be reduced to the well investigated problem of comparison of Markovian semimartingales. The Markov projection approach to comparison results does not require one of the semimartingales to be Markovian, which is a common assumption in literature. An idea of Brunick and Shreve (2013) to mimick updated processes leads to a related reduction result to the Markovian case and thus to the comparison of related generators. As consequence, a general comparison result is also obtained for path-dependent functions of semimartingales.},

Regardless of uniqueness, we use the representation to rigorously find the limit behavior of the stopping boundary close to the terminal time. Interestingly, it turns out that the leading-order coefficient is universal for wide classes of problems. We also discuss how the representation can be used for numerical purposes.},

In addition to demographic events modifying the population size, swap events, i.e. moves between subgroups, occur in the population. Event intensities are random functionals of the population. In the first part, we show that the complexity of the problem is significantly reduced by modeling the jump measure of the population as a multivariate counting process. This process is defined as the solution of a stochastic differential system with random coefficients , driven by a multivariate Poisson random measure. The solution is obtained under weak assumptions , by the thinning of a strongly dominating point process generated by the same Poisson measure. This key construction relies on a general strong comparison result, of independent interest. The second part is dedicated to averaging results when swap events are significantly more frequent than demographic events. An important ingredient is the stable convergence, which is well-adapted to the general random environment. The pathwise construction by domination yields tightness results straightforwardly. At the limit, the demographic intensity functionals are averaged against random kernels resulting from swap events. Finally, under a natural assumption, we show the convergence of the aggregated population to a birth–death process in random environment, with non-linear intensity functionals.},

Firstly, we derive a nonparametric estimator for the reaction function of the underlying equation. The estimate is chosen from a finite-dimensional function space based on a least squares criterion. Oracle inequalities provide conditions for the estimator to achieve the usual nonparametric rate of convergence. Adaptivity is provided via model selection. Secondly, we show that the asymptotic properties of realized quadratic variation based estimators for the diffusivity and volatility carry over from linear SPDEs. In particular, we obtain a rate-optimal joint estimator of the two parameters. The result relies on our precise analysis of the Hölder regularity of the solution process and its nonlinear component, which may be of its own interest.

In particular, we assume some non-degeneracy with respect to the components which transmit the noise. Moreover, we characterize, for some specific dynamics, through suitable counter-examples, the almost sharp regularity exponents that ensure the weak well-posedness for the associated SDE. As a by-product of our approach, we also derive some Krylov-type estimates for the density of the weak solutions of the considered SDE.},

Recent work has established convergence under non-neutrality, but only for finite-dimensional distributions. We prove weak convergence of non-neutral genealogies on the space of càdlàg paths under standard assumptions, enabling analysis of the whole genealogical tree.},

This generalization of the Lévy–Khintchin formula fills an existing gap in the literature. It allows, for example, the computation of the Mellin transform of a signed stochastic exponential, which in turn has practical applications in mean–variance portfolio theory. Girsanov-type results based on multiplicatively compensated semimartingales simplify treatment of absolutely continuous measure changes.

However, when applying the general theory to a variation of a process related to a fractional Brownian motion , one repeatedly needs estimates of the order of L p Lp -norms and Sobolev norms of functionals that are complicated as a randomly weighted sum of products of multiple integrals of the fractional Brownian motion. To resolve the difficulties, in this paper, we construct a theory of exponents based on a graphical representation of the structure of the functionals, which enables us to tell an upper bound of the order of functionals by a simple rule. We also show how the exponents change by the actions of the Malliavin derivative and its projection. The exponents are useful in various studies of limit theorems as well as in applications to asymptotic expansion.},

Those joining existing blocks each choose a block with probability proportional to that block’s cardinality, independently. We prove results concerning the asymptotic cardinality of a given block and central limit theorems for associated fluctuations about this asymptotic cardinality: these are proved both for a fixed block and for the maximum among all blocks. We also prove that with probability one, a single block eventually takes and maintains the leadership in cardinality. Depending on the way one sees this partition process, one can translate our results to Balls and Bins processes, Generalized Chinese Restaurant Processes, Generalized Urn models and Preferential attachment random graphs.},

In addition, we obtain close to optimal rates in the usual CLT and a moderate deviations principle and some Rosenthal type inequalities. We will also discuss applications to some classes of local statistics (e.g. covariance estimators), as well as expanding non-stationary dynamical systems , which can be reduced to non-uniformly mixing triangular arrays by an approximation argument. The main novelty here is that our results are obtained without any assumptions about the growth rate of the variance of S n Sn .

The study of the random position at an arbitrary time t &gt; 0 t&amp;gt;0 on the surface of the support, forming an octahedron S c t Sct , is completely carried out on the edges and faces ( F c t Fct ). In particular, the motion on the faces F c t Fct is analyzed by means of a transformation which reduces it to a three-directions planar random motion. This permits us to obtain an integral representation on F c t Fct in terms of integral of products of first order Bessel functions . The investigation of the distribution of the position p = p ( t , x , y , z ) p=p(t,x,y,z) inside S c t Sct implied the derivation of a sixth-order partial differential equation governing p p (expressed in terms of the products of three D’Alembert operators). A number of results, also in explicit form, concern the time spent on each direction and the position reached by each coordinate as the motion develops. The analysis is carried out when the incoming direction is orthogonal to the ongoing one and also when all directions can be uniformly chosen at each Poisson event. If the switches are governed by a homogeneous Poisson process many explicit results are obtained.},

  abstract     = {We obtain well-posedness results for a class of ODE with a singular drift and additive fractional noise, whose right-hand-side involves some bounded variation terms depending on the solution. Examples of such equations are reflected equations, where the solution is constrained to remain in a rectangular domain, as well as so-called perturbed equations, where the dynamics depend on the running extrema of the solution. Our proof is based on combining the Catellier–Gubinelli approach based on Young nonlinear integration, with some Lipschitz estimates in p p -variation for maps of Skorokhod type, due to Falkowski and Słominski. An important step requires to prove that fractional Brownian motion , when perturbed by sufficiently regular paths (in the sense of p p -variation), retains its regularization properties. This is done by applying a variant of the stochastic sewing lemma.},

We significantly widen the family of distributions for the interarrival times for which the critical value can be shown to be strictly positive. The result now holds for any dimension d ≥ 1 d≥1 and requires only a moment condition slightly stronger than finite first moment. For heavy-tailed interarrival times , we prove a Complete Convergence Theorem and examine when the contact process, conditioned on survival, can be asymptotically predicted knowing the renewal processes .

We propose to study a generalization of this notion considering short periods, or blocks, with ℓp− norm above a high threshold. Our main result derives new large deviation principles of extremal ℓp− blocks, which guide us to define and characterize spectral cluster processes in ℓp . We then study cluster inference in ℓp to motivate our results. We design consistent disjoint blocks methods to infer features of cluster processes. Our inferential setting promotes the use of large empirical quantiles from the ℓp− norm of blocks as threshold levels which eases implementation and also facilitates comparison for different p&amp;gt;0 . Our approach highlights the advantages of cluster inference based on extremal ℓα− blocks, where α&amp;gt;0 is the index of regular variation of the series. We focus on inference of important indices in extreme value theory , e.g., the extremal index .},

  abstract     = {In this work, four problems for stochastic fractional pseudo-parabolic containing bounded and unbounded delays are investigated. The fractional derivative and the stochastic noise we consider here are the Caputo operator and the fractional Brownian motion . For the two problems involving bounded delays, we aim at establishing global existence, uniqueness, and regularity results under integral Lipschitz conditions for the non-linear source terms. Such behaviors of mild solutions are also analyzed in the unbounded delay cases but under globally and locally Lipschitz assumptions. We emphasize that our results are investigated in the novel spaces C ( [ − r , T ] ; L p ( Ω , W l , q ( D ) ) ) C([−r,T];Lp(Ω,Wl,q(D))) , C μ ( ( − ∞ , T ] ; L p ( Ω , W l , q ( D ) ) ) Cμ((−∞,T];Lp(Ω,Wl,q(D))) , and the weighted space ɛ F μ ɛ ( ( − ∞ , T ] ; L p ( Ω , W l , q ( D ) ) ) Fμɛ((−∞,T];Lp(Ω,Wl,q(D))) , instead of usual ones C ( [ − r , T ] ; L 2 ( Ω , H ) ) C([−r,T];L2(Ω,H)) , C μ ( ( − ∞ , T ] ; L 2 ( Ω , H ) ) Cμ((−∞,T];L2(Ω,H)) . The main technique allowing us to overcome the rising difficulties lies on some useful Sobolev embeddings between the Hilbert space H = L 2 ( D ) H=L2(D) and W l , q ( D ) Wl,q(D) , and some well-known fractional tools. In addition, we also study the Hölder continuity for the mild solutions, which can be considered as one of the main novelties of this paper. Finally, we consider an additional result connecting delay stochastic fractional pseudo-parabolic equations and delay stochastic fractional parabolic equations . We show that the mild solution of the first model converges to the mild solution of the second one, in some sense, as the diffusion parameter β → 0 + β→0+ .},

Our main contribution is to study how a mixing condition on the covariate process transfers to a mixing condition for the response. Using a coupling method, we first derive mixing conditions for some Markov chains in random environments, which gives a first result for some autoregressive categorical processes with strictly exogenous regressors . Our result is then extended to some infinite memory categorical processes. In the second part of the paper, we study autoregressive models for which the covariates are sequentially exogenous. Using a general random mapping approach on finite sets, we get explicit mixing conditions that can be checked for many categorical time series found in the literature, including multinomial autoregressive processes, ordinal time series and dynamic multiple choice models. We also study some autoregressive count time series using a somewhat different contraction argument. Our contribution fills an important gap for such models, presented here under a more general form, since such a strong mixing condition is often assumed in some recent works but no general approach is available to check it.},

  abstract     = {We study the extremes of branching random walks under the assumption that the underlying Galton–Watson tree has infinite progeny mean. It is assumed that the displacements are either regularly varying or they have lighter tails. In the regularly varying case, it is shown that the point process sequence of normalized extremes converges to a Poisson random measure. We study the asymptotics of the scaled position of the rightmost particle in the n th generation when the tail of the displacement behaves like exp ( − K ( x ) ) , where either K is a regularly varying function of index r &gt; 0 , or K has an exponential growth . We identify the exact scaling of the maxima in all cases and show the existence of a non-trivial limit when r &gt; 1 .},

  abstract     = {In this paper we provide an expansion formula for Hawkes processes which involves the addition of jumps at deterministic times to the Hawkes process in the spirit of the well-known integration by parts formula (or more precisely the Mecke formula) for Poisson functional. Our approach allows us to provide an expansion of the premium of a class of cyber insurance derivatives (such as reinsurance contracts including generalized Stop-Loss contracts) or risk management instruments (like Expected Shortfall) in terms of so-called shifted Hawkes processes. From the actuarial point of view, these processes can be seen as “stressed” scenarios. Our expansion formula for Hawkes processes enables us to provide lower and upper bounds on the premium (or the risk evaluation) of such cyber contracts and to quantify the surplus of premium compared to the standard modeling with a homogeneous Poisson process .},

  abstract     = {We consider two interacting random walks on Z Z such that the transition probability of one walk in one direction decreases exponentially with the number of transitions of the other walk in that direction. The joint process may thus be seen as two random walks reinforced to repel each other. The strength of the repulsion is further modulated in our model by a parameter β ≥ 0 β≥0 . When β = 0 β=0 both processes are independent symmetric random walks on Z Z , and hence recurrent. We show that both random walks are further recurrent if β ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] β∈(0,1] . We also show that these processes are transient and diverge in opposite directions if β &gt; 2 β&amp;gt;2 . The case β ∈ ( 1 , 2 ] β∈(1,2] remains widely open.

This general form of Itô’s formula enables the derivation of dynamic programming equations and verification theorems for McKean–Vlasov controls with jump diffusions and for McKean–Vlasov mixed regular–singular control problems. It also allows for generalizing the classical relationship between the maximum principle and the dynamic programming principle to the McKean–Vlasov singular control setting, where the adjoint process is expressed in terms of the derivative of the value function with respect to the probability measures.},

In this paper we provide sufficient conditions for convergence of a sequence of suitably scaled discrete Gibbsian line ensembles f N = ( f 1 N , … , f N N ) fN=(f1N,…,fNN) as the number of curves N N tends to infinity. Assuming log-concavity and a KMT-type coupling for the random walk jump distribution, we prove that under mild control of the one-point marginals of the top curves with a global parabolic shift, the full sequence ( f N ) (fN) is tight in the topology of uniform convergence over compact sets, and moreover any weak subsequential limit possesses the Brownian Gibbs property. If in addition the top curves converge in finite-dimensional distributions to the parabolic Airy 2 Airy2 process, then a result of Dimitrov (2021) implies that ( f N ) (fN) converges to the parabolically shifted Airy line ensemble. These results apply to a broad class of discrete jump distributions, including geometric as well as any log-concave distribution whose support forms a compact integer interval.},

In a radially symmetric environment, we are able to find an explicit solution to the control problem and find an optimal strategy . We show that it is optimal to switch between two strategies, depending only on the radius of the controlled process. The optimal strategies correspond to purely radial and purely tangential motion. It is notable that the value function exhibits smooth fit even when switching to tangential motion, where the radius of the optimal process is deterministic. Under sufficient regularity on the cost function, we prove optimality via viscosity solutions of a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. We extend the results to cost functions that may become infinite at the origin. Extra care is required to solve the control problem in this case, since it is not clear how to define the optimal strategy with deterministic radius at the origin. Our results generalise some problems recently considered in Stochastic Portfolio Theory and Martingale Optimal Transport.},

  abstract     = {The parabolic Anderson model is the heat equation with some extra spatial randomness. In this paper we consider the parabolic Anderson model with i.i.d. Pareto potential on a critical Galton–Watson tree conditioned to survive. We prove that the solution at time t t is concentrated at a single site with high probability and at two sites almost surely as t → ∞ t→∞ . Moreover, we identify asymptotics for the localisation sites and the total mass, and show that the solution u ( t , v ) u(t,v) at a vertex v v can be well-approximated by a certain functional of v v . The main difference with earlier results on Z d Zd is that we have to incorporate the effect of variable vertex degrees within the tree, and make the role of the degrees precise.},

  abstract     = {A weighted recursive tree is an evolving tree in which vertices are assigned random vertex-weights and new vertices connect to a predecessor with a probability proportional to its weight. Here, we study the maximum degree and near-maximum degrees in weighted recursive trees when the vertex-weights are almost surely bounded and their distribution function satisfies a mild regularity condition near zero. We are able to specify higher-order corrections to the first order growth of the maximum degree established in prior work. The accuracy of the results depends on the behaviour of the weight distribution near the largest possible value and in certain cases we manage to find the corrections up to random order. Additionally, we describe the tail distribution of the maximum degree, the distribution of the number of vertices attaining the maximum degree, and establish asymptotic normality of the number of vertices with near-maximum degree. Our analysis extends the results proved for random recursive trees (where the weights are constant) to the case of random weights. The main technical result shows that the degrees of several uniformly chosen vertices are asymptotically independent with explicit error corrections.},

  abstract     = {A block Markov chain is a Markov chain whose state space can be partitioned into a finite number of clusters such that the transition probabilities only depend on the clusters. Block Markov chains thus serve as a model for Markov chains with communities. This paper establishes limiting laws for the singular value distributions of the empirical transition matrix and empirical frequency matrix associated to a sample path of the block Markov chain whenever the length of the sample path is Θ ( n 2 ) Θ(n2) with n n the size of the state space. The proof approach is split into two parts. First, we introduce a class of symmetric random matrices with dependent entries called approximately uncorrelated random matrices with variance profile. We establish their limiting eigenvalue distributions by means of the moment method. Second, we develop a coupling argument to show that this general-purpose result applies to the singular value distributions associated with the block Markov chain.},

This study is motivated by its potential applications in various areas and its theoretical interestingness. We consider both stationary sequences and non-stationary sequences obtained by considering whether the trend functions are identical or not. We show that a sequence of suitably normalised k k th order statistics converges in distribution to a limiting random variable which can be a negative log transformed Erlang distributed random variable, a Normal random variable or a mixture of them, according to three conditions deduced through the model parameters. Remarkably, this phenomenon resembles that for the stationary Normal sequence. We also show that various moments of the normalised k k th order statistics converge to the moments of the corresponding limiting random variable. The obtained results enable us to analyse various properties of these random sequences, which reveals the interesting particularities of this class of random sequences in extreme value theory .},

As a consequence, we obtain a simple explicit formula for both rate functions on any such compact set of ∂ D ∂D at low enough disorder. In contrast to previous works, our results do not assume any ballistic behavior of the random walk and are not restricted to neighborhoods of any given point (on the boundary ∂ D ∂D ). In addition, our results complement those in Bazaes et al. (2022), where, using different methods, we investigate the equality of the rate functions in the interior of their domain. Finally, for a general parametrized family of environments, we show that the strength of disorder determines a phase transition in the equality of both rate functions, in the sense that for each x ∈ ∂ D x∈∂D there exists ɛ ɛ x ɛx such that the two rate functions agree at x x when the disorder is smaller than ɛ ɛ x ɛx and disagree when it is larger. This further reconfirms the idea, introduced in Bazaes et al. (2022), that the disorder of the environment is in general intimately related with the equality of the rate functions.},

  abstract     = {We study models for a directed polymer in a random environment (DPRE) in which the polymer traverses a hierarchical diamond graph and the random environment is defined through random variables attached to the vertices. For these models, we prove a distributional limit theorem for the partition function in a limiting regime wherein the system grows as the coupling of the polymer to the random environment is appropriately attenuated. The sequence of diamond graphs is determined by a choice of a branching number b ∈ { 2 , 3 , … } b∈{2,3,…} and segmenting number s ∈ { 2 , 3 , … } s∈{2,3,…} , and our focus is on the critical case of the model where b = s b=s . This extends recent work in the critical case of analogous models with disorder variables placed at the edges of the graphs rather than the vertices.},

The payoff function is nonnegative and possibly unbounded for countable state space case and for compact state space case it is a real-valued and bounded function . For countable state space case, under a certain Lyapunov type stability assumption on the dynamics we establish the existence of the value and a saddle point equilibrium. For compact state space case we establish these results without any Lyapunov type stability assumptions. Using the stochastic representation of the principal eigenfunction of the associated optimality equation, we completely characterize all possible saddle point strategies in the class of stationary Markov strategies.

Recently, inspired by numerous applications in finance, physics, and optimization, there has been an accrued interest in the analysis of the last passage time (below level 0). In this paper, we aim to bridge the first and the last passage times and unify their analyses. For this purpose, we consider negative excursions of an underlying process in two manners, cumulative and noncumulative, and introduce two random times , denoted by s r sr and l r lr , where r r can be interpreted as a measure of a decision maker’s tolerance to negative excursions. Our analysis focuses on spectrally negative Lévy processes , for which we derive the Laplace transform and some distributional quantities of these random times in terms of standard scale functions. An application to credit risk management is considered at the end.},

One applies the ‘soft’ EDF policy, where deadlines are used to determine priority but jobs do not renege, and the other implements ‘hard’ EDF, where jobs renege when deadlines expire, and deadlines are postponed with each migration to a new station. The arrival rates , deadline distribution and service capacity are allowed to fluctuate over time at the fluid scale. Earlier work on EDF network fluid limits, used as a tool to obtain stability of these networks, addressed only the soft version of the policy, and moreover did not contain a full fluid limit result. In this paper, tools that extend the notion of the measure-valued Skorokhod map are developed and used to establish for the first time fluid limits for both the soft and hard EDF network models.},

The expansion formula is expressed with the quasi-torsion, quasi-tangent and other random symbols. To specify these random symbols, it is necessary to classify the level of the effect of each term appearing in the stochastic expansion of the variable in question. To solve this problem, we consider a class L L of certain sequences ( I n ) n ∈ N (In)n∈N of Wiener functionals and give a systematic way of estimation of the order of ( I n ) n ∈ N (In)n∈N . Based on this method, we introduce a notion of exponent of the sequence ( I n ) n ∈ N (In)n∈N , and investigate the stability and contraction effect of the operators D u n Dun and D D on L L , where u n un is the integrand of a Skorohod integral. After constructed these machineries, we derive asymptotic expansion of the variation having anticipative weights. An application to robust volatility estimation is mentioned.},

First, we provide explicit density formulas, hinted by the method of images. These explicit expressions rely on infinite oscillating sums of Bessel functions and may demand computationally costly procedures. We propose suitable recursive algorithms for the simulation of the laws of reflected and stopped Brownian motion which are based on generalizations of the reflection principle in two dimensions. We study and give bounds for the complexity of the proposed algorithms.},

We first establish a general non-asymptotic optimal bound: if θ ˆ n is the position of the algorithm at step n , we prove that E | θ ˆ n − arg min ( f ) | 2 ⩽ Tr ( Σ ⋆ ) n + C d , f n − r β , where Σ ⋆ is the limiting covariance matrix of the CLT demonstrated in Polyak and Juditsky (1992) and C d , f n − r β is a new state-of-the-art second order term that translates the effect of the dimension. We also identify the optimal gain of the baseline SGD γ n = γ n − 3 / 4 , leading to a second-order term with r 3 / 4 = 5 / 4 . Second, we show that this result holds under some Kurdyka-Łojiasewicz-type condition (Kurdyka, 1988; Lojasiewicz, 1963) for function f , which is far more general than the standard uniformly strongly convex case. In particular, it makes it possible to handle some pathological examples such as on-line learning for logistic regression and recursive quantile estimation.},

  abstract     = {An additive process is a stochastic process with independent increments and that is continuous in probability . In this paper, we study the almost sure Hausdorff and Fourier dimension of the graph of continuous additive processes with zero mean. Such processes can be represented as X t = B V ( t ) Xt=BV(t) where B B is Brownian motion and V V is a continuous increasing function. We show that these dimensions depend on the local uniform Hölder indices. In particular, if V V is locally uniformly bi-Lipschitz, then the Hausdorff dimension of the graph will be 3/2. We also show that the Fourier dimension almost surely is positive if V V admits at least one point with positive lower Hölder regularity . It is also possible to estimate the Hausdorff dimension of the graph through the L q Lq spectrum of V V . We will show that if V V is generated by a self-similar measure on R 1 R1 with convex open set condition, the Hausdorff dimension of the graph can be precisely computed by its L q Lq spectrum. An illustrating example of the Cantor Devil Staircase function, the Hausdorff dimension of the graph is 1 + 1 2 ⋅ log 2 log 3 1+12⋅log2log3 . Moreover, we will show that the graph of the Brownian staircase surprisingly has Fourier dimension zero almost surely.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider function-indexed normalized weighted integrated periodograms for equidistantly sampled multivariate continuous-time state space models which are multivariate continuous-time ARMA processes. Thereby, the sampling distance is fixed and the driving Lévy process has at least a finite fourth moment. Under different assumptions on the function space and the moments of the driving Lévy process we derive a central limit theorem for the function-indexed normalized weighted integrated periodogram. Either the assumption on the function space or the assumption on the existence of moments of the Lévy process is weaker. Furthermore, we show the weak convergence in both the space of continuous functions and in the dual space to a Gaussian process and give an explicit representation of the covariance function . The results can be used to derive the asymptotic behavior of the Whittle estimator and to construct goodness-of-fit test statistics as the Grenander–Rosenblatt statistic and the Cramér–von Mises statistic . We present the exact limit distributions of both statistics and show their performance through a simulation study.},

Our main result is a Central Limit Theorem in the high energy setting, for the boundary lengths of their excursion sets. This result is based on Wiener chaos expansion and Stein–Malliavin techniques for nonlinear functionals of random fields. To this end, a careful analysis of the variances of each chaotic component of the boundary length is carried out, showing that they are asymptotically constant, after normalisation, for all terms of the expansion and no leading component arises.},

More precisely, weak convergence in the space of càdlàg functions endowed with the Skorohod topology for the realised semicovariance of a general Gaussian process with stationary increments is proved first. The proof is based on the Breuer–Major theorem and on a moment bound for sums of products of non-linearly transformed Gaussian vectors. Furthermore, we establish a corresponding stable convergence. Finally, a central limit theorem for the realised semicovariance of multivariate BSS processes is established. These results extend the limit theorems for the realised covariation to a result for non-linear functionals.},

By implementing the classical theory of Ibragimov and Hasminski, we obtain in particular sharp results for the maximum likelihood estimator that go beyond its simple asymptotic normality thanks to Hájek’s convolution theorem and strong controls of the likelihood process that yield asymptotic minimax optimality (up to constants). Our structural results shed some light to the accompanying nonlinear McKean–Vlasov experiment, and enable us to derive simple and explicit criteria to obtain identifiability and non-degeneracy of the Fisher information matrix . These conditions are also of interest for other recent studies on the topic of parametric inference for interacting diffusions.},
