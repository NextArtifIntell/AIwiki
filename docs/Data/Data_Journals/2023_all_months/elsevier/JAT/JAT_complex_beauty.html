So for functions from Triebel–Lizorkin spaces we obtain a quarkonial decomposition as well as a new equivalent quasi-norm. For that purpose we use quarklets that are constructed by means of biorthogonal compactly supported Cohen–Daubechies–Feauveau spline wavelets , where the primal generator is a cardinal B-spline. Moreover we introduce some sequence spaces apposite to our quarklet system and study their properties.

  abstract     = {Many classes of orthogonal polynomials satisfy a specific linearization property giving rise to a polynomial hypergroup structure, which offers an elegant and fruitful link to Fourier analysis , harmonic analysis and functional analysis . From the opposite point of view, this allows regarding certain Banach algebras as L 1 L1 -algebras, associated with underlying orthogonal polynomials . The individual behavior strongly depends on these underlying polynomials. We study the little q q -Legendre polynomials, which are orthogonal with respect to a discrete measure. We will show that their L 1 L1 -algebras have the property that every element can be approximated by linear combinations of idempotents . This particularly implies that these L 1 L1 -algebras are weakly amenable (i.e., every bounded derivation into the dual module is an inner derivation), which is known to be shared by any L 1 L1 -algebra of a locally compact group ; in the polynomial hypergroup context, weak amenability is rarely satisfied and of particular interest because it corresponds to a certain property of the derivatives of the underlying polynomials and their (Fourier) expansions w.r.t. the polynomial basis . To our knowledge, the little q q -Legendre polynomials yield the first example of a polynomial hypergroup whose L 1 L1 -algebra is weakly amenable and right character amenable but fails to be amenable. As a crucial tool, we establish certain uniform boundedness properties of the characters. Our strategy relies on the Fourier transformation on hypergroups, the Plancherel isomorphism, continued fractions, character estimations and asymptotic behavior .},

As a consequence of the above estimates, we can deduce an L p Lp convergence theorem for the above family of NN operators in case of functions which are bounded, measurable, and Riemann integrable on the above interval. In order to reach the above aims, we preliminarily establish a number of results; among them we can mention an estimate for the p p -norm of the operators, and an asymptotic type theorem for the NN operators in case of functions belonging to Sobolev spaces .},

However, in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces , H H -sets are shown here to have a rather simple and complete characterization. As a byproduct, the strong connection of H H -sets to Linear Programming is studied.

We illustrate this result by showing that the absolute minimum of the potential of the set of vertices of the icosahedron on the unit sphere S 2 S2 in R 3 R3 is attained at the vertices of the dual dodecahedron and the one for the set of vertices of the dodecahedron is attained at the vertices of the dual icosahedron . The absolute minimum of the potential of the configuration of 240 minimal vectors of E 8 E8 root lattice normalized to lie on the unit sphere S 7 S7 in R 8 R8 is attained at a set of 2160 points on S 7 S7 which we describe.},

Our main result is an upper bound for random sections, which we prove using techniques from asymptotic geometric analysis if 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ 1≤p≤∞ and compressed sensing if 0 0&amp;lt;p≤1 . This can be interpreted as a bound on the quality of random (Gaussian) information for the recovery of vectors from an ℓ p ℓp -ellipsoid for which the radius of optimal information is given by the Gelfand numbers of a diagonal operator. In the case where the semiaxes decay polynomially and 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ 1≤p≤∞ , we conjecture that, as the amount of information increases, the radius of random information either decays like the radius of optimal information or is bounded from below by a constant, depending on whether the exponent of decay is larger than the critical value 1 − 1 p 1−1p or not. If 1 ≤ p ≤ 2 1≤p≤2 , we prove this conjecture by providing a matching lower bound. This extends the recent work of Hinrichs et al.

Rates of approximation play a basic role. The solutions themselves are evaluated by means of Fourier expansions with respect to spherical harmonics . In case of the first two problems, the basis for the investigation of the approximation and ergodic behaviour is the theory of semigroups of linear operators mapping a Banach space X into itself. The connection between the semigroup property and the major premise of Huygens’ principle is emphasized. Another tool is a Drazin-like inverse operator A ad Aad for the infinitesimal generator A A of a semigroup that arises naturally in ergodic theory . This operator is a closed, not necessarily bounded, operator. It was introduced in a paper with U. Westphal (Butzer and Westphal, 1970/71) and extended to a generalized setting with J.J. Koliha (Butzer and Koliha, 2009). Unlike the latter two problems, the solution of Robin’s problem does not have the semigroup property and therefore the semigroup methods applied to Dirichlet’s and Neumann’s problem do not work. The authors give several hints how to overcome these difficulties.},

Our result explains the appearance of various ingredients of the integrable systems theory in application to multiple orthogonal polynomials , numerical algorithms, random matrices, and in other branches of mathematical physics and applied mathematics where the Hermite–Padé approximation problem is relevant. We present also the geometric algorithm, based on the notion of Desargues maps, of construction of solutions of the problem in the projective space over the field of rational functions. As a byproduct we obtain the corresponding generalization of the Wynn recurrence. We isolate the boundary data of the Hirota system which provide solutions to Hermite–Padé problem showing that the corresponding reduction lowers dimensionality of the system. In particular, we obtain certain equations which, in addition to the known ones given by Paszkowski, can be considered as direct analogs of the Frobenius identities. We study the place of the reduced system within the integrability theory, which results in finding multidimensional (in the sense of number of variables) extension of the discrete-time Toda chain equations.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes an approximation theoretic approach to the problem of completeness of a set of translates of a “Tauberian generator”, which is an integrable function whose Fourier transform does not vanish. This is achieved by the construction of finite rank operators , whose range is contained in the linear span of the translates of such a generator, and which allow uniform approximation of the identity operator over compact sets of certain Banach spaces ( B , ‖ ⋅ ‖ B ) (B,‖⋅‖B) . The key assumption is availability of a double module structure on ( B , ‖ ⋅ ‖ B ) (B,‖⋅‖B) , meaning the availability of sufficiently many smoothing operators (via convolution) and also pointwise multipliers, allowing localization of its elements. This structure is shared by a wide variety of function spaces and allows us to make explicit use of the Riesz–Kolmogorov Theorem characterizing compact subsets in such Banach spaces . The construction of these operators is universal with respect to large families of such Banach spaces, i.e. they do not depend on any further information concerning the particular Banach space. As a corollary we conclude that the linear span of the set of the translates of such a Tauberian generator is dense in any such space ( B , ‖ ⋅ ‖ B ) (B,‖⋅‖B) . Our work has been inspired by a completeness result of V. Katsnelson which was formulated in the context of specific Hilbert spaces within this family and Gaussian generators.},

We derive the upper and lower bounds of the approximation error in the L ∞ L∞ -norm that are valid uniformly for all n ≥ n 0 n≥n0 for some n 0 ≥ 1 . n0≥1. Such an optimal L ∞ L∞ -estimate requires a judicious summation rule that can recover the lost half order if one uses a naive summation . Consequently, we can obtain the explicit Bernstein-type constant ≔ B ∞ ( α ) ≔ lim n → ∞ n α ‖ f α − S n ( α ) ‖ L ∞ = 2 Γ ( α ) π | sin α π 2 | . B∞(α)≔limn→∞nα‖fα−Sn(α)‖L∞=2Γ(α)π|sinαπ2|.

The present paper constructs orthogonal polynomials on the torus of arbitrary finite dimension in order to prove theorems of Szegő-Verblunsky type in the multivariate and almost periodic settings. The results are applied to the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in impedance form to yield a new trace formula valid for piecewise constant impedance, a case where the classical trace formula breaks down. As a byproduct, the analysis gives an explicit formula for the Taylor coefficients of a bounded holomorphic function on the open disk in terms of its continued fraction expansion.},

Since then, not too many new results on extremal properties of typically real polynomials have been obtained. Fundamental work in this direction is due to M. Brandt, who found a novel way of solving extremal problems. In particular, he solved C. Michel’s problem of estimating the modulus of a typically real polynomial of odd degree. On the other hand, D. K. Dimitrov showed the efficiency of Fejér’s method for solving the Rogosinski–Szegő problems. In this article, we completely solve Michel’s problem by using Fejér’s method.},

For instance, we show that a Nevai class is invariant under the transformations in question, which is not true in general, and that the ratio asymptotic still holds outside the spectrum of the corresponding symmetric complex Jacobi matrix but the spectrum could include one extra point. In principal, these transformations can be iterated and, for example, we demonstrate how Geronimus transformations can lead to R I I RII -recurrence relations, which in turn are related to orthogonal rational functions and pencils of Jacobi matrices.},

In this article, the authors establish the wavelet characterization of the Triebel–Lizorkin space F ̇ ∞ , q s ( X ) Ḟ∞,qs(X) . Moreover, the authors introduce almost diagonal operators on the Triebel–Lizorkin sequence space f ̇ ∞ , q s ( X ) ḟ∞,qs(X) and obtain their boundedness . Using this wavelet characterization and this boundedness of almost diagonal operators, the authors establish the molecular characterization of F ̇ ∞ , q s ( X ) Ḟ∞,qs(X) . The authors also obtain both the Lusin area function and the Littlewood–Paley g λ ∗ gλ∗ -function characterizations of F ̇ ∞ , q s ( X ) Ḟ∞,qs(X) . Besides, the inhomogeneous counterparts are also given. The main novelty of this article is that all these results get rid of their dependence on the reverse doubling property of μ μ and also the triangle inequality of d d , by fully using the geometrical properties of X X expressed via its equipped quasi-metric d d , dyadic reference points, dyadic cubes, and wavelets.},

The asymptotic rate of growth of the grid sizes and of the comparability constants must grow in a controlled manner. In this paper, we recognize that the notion of a WAM can be generalized to a sequence of hierarchical subspaces not necessarily of polynomial functions , and we analyze particular strategies for random sampling as a technique for generating WAM’s. Our main results show that WAM’s and their stronger variant, admissible meshes (AM’s), can be generated by random sampling, and our analysis provides concrete estimates for growth and rates of growth of both the meshes and the discrete–continuum comparability constants.},

We also show that if there are alternation points for polynomials orthogonal with respect to a measure μ μ , then the inner product defined by μ μ is a multiple of the discrete inner product generated by the alternation points. Finally, we produce orthonormal polynomials having alternation points that are the roots of a given trigonometric equation.},
