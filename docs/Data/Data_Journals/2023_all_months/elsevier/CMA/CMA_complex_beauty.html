  abstract     = {In this paper, a three-dimensional Petrov-Galerkin finite element interface (3D PGFEI) method with non-body-fitted grids is proposed for solving the inhomogeneous anisotropic time-harmonic Maxwell&#39;s equations in irregular regions. We derive the weak variational form of the anisotropic Maxwell interface problem. The irregular region is discretized by uniform tetrahedral grids while the media interface is not aligned with the grids. The level-set functions are applied to capture the discontinuity on the anisotropic media interface. Meanwhile, we construct the special basis functions according to the jump conditions across the inhomogeneous interface, where the permittivity and permeability are discontinuous three-dimensional tensors. The resulting linear system is a banded sparse matrix and demands fewer memory resources than dense matrix. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed 3D PGFEI method and the solutions can achieve second-order accuracy in terms of the relative L ∞ ( Ω ) L∞(Ω) and relative L 2 ( Ω ) L2(Ω) error norms.},

Solving the new blending model is done using DeepXDE, which is a deep learning library for solving differential equations, by considering the image as input. Error analysis for neural network approximations of the new PDE model is shown. Applying PSNR criteria for some images, it can be seen that the proposed method can compete with solving denoising PDE models using finite difference method (FDM).},

In this method, the vorticity and the streamfunction equations are calculated by two separate LB equations, which are constructed by using the non-orthogonal transformation matrix . Most importantly, to eliminate the residual term that may appear in the recovered vorticity equation , the convection term is handled as a source term in the LB equation rather than being directly recovered by the evolution equation. In addition, due to the convection term in our method is computed with a local scheme, it retains the parallel feature of the standard LBM. We then test the accuracy and the stability of the present LBM by considering various benchmark examples. The results show that the present method has a second-order convergence rate in space. Our numerical results indicate that the present LBM is a good candidate for solving streamfunction-vorticity formulation.},

To numerically study the effects of the sound field intensity on the formation process of streaming structures, we propose to discretize the fully compressible form of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations using a high-order (formally greater or equal to fourth-order) accurate numerical scheme in both space and time. The proposed numerical solver utilizes high-order compact schemes along each spatial dimension combined with a filtering procedure when it is necessary. Acoustic standing waves are excited inside the enclosures and the resulting acoustic streaming patterns are investigated for low and high-intensity waves, in both linear and nonlinear regimes following closely the work of Daru et al. (2013). An extended investigation indicates that without the incorporation of an appropriate filter, the application of the high-order compact schemes in case of fast streaming results in spurious oscillations which inhibit their applicability. Following the recent relevant literature, the numerical simulations performed demonstrate the ability of the proposed numerical approach to reproduce efficiently and robustly the transitions from regular acoustic streaming to irregular streaming and the relevant phenomena confirming results that have been previously presented.},

  abstract     = {High-fidelity computer simulations of childbirth remain prohibitively expensive and time consuming, making them impractical for guiding decision-making during obstetric emergencies. Cheap computer simulations that preserve the accuracy of high-fidelity models can be developed using surrogate modeling . Two common approaches to surrogate modeling are physics-based reduced order modeling (ROM) and machine learning (ML), with the latter gaining popularity as the scientific computing community seeks to leverage advances from other, mostly non-physics-based, computational strategies. Although ROM and ML have been compared for various problems, to our knowledge, such a comparison for simulations of vaginal deformations is currently missing. This study provides a baseline numerical comparison between methods from these two fundamentally different approaches. Since there are many methods falling into each modeling approach, to provide a fair and natural comparison, we select a basic model from each category, with each allowing (i) a straightforward implementation in commercial software packages , and (ii) use by practitioners with limited experience in the field. As a benchmark for the numerical comparison of the ROM and ML approaches , we use the finite element (FE) modeling of the ex vivo deformations of rat vaginal tissue subjected to inflation testing to study the effect of a pre-imposed tear. From the ROM strategies, we consider a simplified Galerkin ROM (G-ROM) that is based on the linearization of the underlying nonlinear equations . From the ML strategies, we select a feed-forward neural network to create mappings from constitutive model parameters and luminal pressure values to either the FE displacement history (in which case we denote the resulting model ML) or the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) coefficients of the displacement history (in which case we denote the resulting model POD-ML). The numerical investigation of G-ROM, ML, and POD-ML takes place in the reconstructive regime. The numerical results show that the G-ROM outperforms the ML model in terms of offline central processing unit (CPU) time for model training, online CPU time required to generate approximations , and relative error with respect to the FE models. The G-ROM achieves superior error performance to the best ML model with 11 POD basis functions. With higher-dimensional POD bases, the G-ROM achieves a relative error 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the best ML model with an online CPU time still on the same order of magnitude as the best ML model. The POD-ML model improves on the speed performance of the ML, having online CPU times comparable to those of the G-ROM given the same size of POD bases. However, the POD-ML model does not improve on the error performance of the ML and is still outperformed by the G-ROM for POD bases of size greater than 11. This baseline numerical investigation serves as a starting point for future computer simulations that consider state-of-the-art G-ROM and ML strategies, and the in vivo geometry, boundary conditions, and material properties of the human vagina, as well as their changes during labor.},

  abstract     = {Flow in variably saturated porous media is typically modeled by the Richards equation , a nonlinear elliptic-parabolic equation which is notoriously challenging to solve numerically. In this paper, we propose a robust and fast iterative solver for Richards&#39; equation. The solver relies on an adaptive switching algorithm, based on rigorously derived a posteriori indicators, between two linearization methods : L-scheme and Newton. Although a combined L-scheme/Newton strategy was introduced previously in [1] , here, for the first time we propose a reliable and robust criteria for switching between these schemes. The performance of the solver, which can be in principle applied to any spatial discretization and linearization methods , is illustrated through several numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {In this work, a two-dimensional domain decomposition technique (DDT) is developed based on an overset method that couples a nonlinear Euler solver with a linearized Euler solver. The nonlinear domain accounts for complex physics in the near field , such as acoustic wave interaction with shock waves and acoustic wave scattering from solid bodies . The linear domain allows the small perturbation waves induced by the nonlinear effects to propagate with minimal numerical dissipation and dispersion while also significantly reducing computational resources . To this end, two scenarios have been considered: (i) wave amplification and modulation in a converging-diverging duct with a standing shock wave and (ii) wave scattering from an incident acoustic wave over a supercritical airfoil . With DDT, these cases show a reduction in computational time by more than 70% compared to their respective fully-nonlinear simulations. The accuracy of the simulations with DDT is found to depend on the extent of overlap between the linear and nonlinear zones. In general, an overlap ratio of at least two is necessary to maintain high order of convergence rate , though still limited by the nonlinear scheme. Furthermore, the implementation of DDT in the external flow case can eliminate numerical noise observed at the far field of the fully-nonlinear counterpart, which do not have any effective non-reflecting boundary treatment.},

Nonetheless we prove that optimal a priori error estimates with the standard discrete energy norm can be obtained by combining a priori and a posteriori error analysis techniques. We also show that the interior over-penalization is advantageous for constructing preconditioners robust to mesh refinement by analyzing spectral equivalence of bilinear forms.

According to the characteristics of the solution, the mesh and numerical scheme , a new composite interpolant is introduced. In fact, this interpolant is composed of a vertices-edges-element interpolant within the layer and a local L 2 L2 -projection outside the layer. On the basis of that, by selecting penalty parameters on different types of interelement edges, we further obtain supercloseness of almost k + 1 2 k+12 order in an energy norm.

At the discrete space-time level, we approximate the solution using higher-order continuous B-spline basis functions in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This problem is very difficult to solve numerically using the standard Galerkin finite element method due to artificial oscillations present when the advection term dominates the diffusion term . However, a first-order constraint least-square formulation allows us to obtain numerical solutions avoiding oscillations. The advantages of space-time formulations are the use of high-order methods and the feasibility of developing space-time mesh adaptive techniques on well-defined discrete problems. We develop a solver for a least-square formulation to obtain a stabilized and symmetric problem on finite element meshes . The computational cost of our solver is bounded by the cost of the inversion of the space-time mass and stiffness (with one value fixed at a point) matrices and the cost of the GMRES solver applied for the symmetric and positive definite problem. We illustrate our findings on an advection-dominated diffusion space-time model problem and present two numerical examples : one with isogeometric analysis discretizations and the second one with an adaptive space-time finite element method .},

We present a fully automated segmentation algorithm for whole and partial femurs with or without tumors, and clinical applications of the AFE [1] in clinical practice. The segmentation is based on an U-Net convolutional neural network, resulting a 3D mask representing the desired femur in a CT scan. It is robust, independent of the scanning parameters such as slice spacing, pixel size, scanner manufacturer or the femoral length available in the scan. The U-Net was trained on 178 manually segmented femurs (23,721 images) and tested on 43. The performance evaluation resulted in a Dice similarity score (DSC) of 0.9924, intersection over union (IoU) of 0.9849, Hausdorff distance of 4.3315 mm and symmetric average surface distance (ASD) of 0.1326 mm. The algorithm is competitive with the best state-of-the-art femoral segmentation methodologies available. Based on the segmentation an automatic p-FE mesh is generated and physiological boundary conditions representing sidewise falls or stance are being applied automatically to improve the performance of the AFE described in [1] . New examples of the usage of the AFE in endocrinology and orthopedic oncology demonstrate this disruptive technology in actual clinical practice.

However, nothing is known on the hydrodynamic study of a couple stress fluid flowing in a porous curved channel. The proposed work, concerns with the flow of couple stress fluid in a porous curved channel and analysing the generating centrifugal force. Here, the flow of fluid in the porous curved channel takes place due to the constant pressure gradient . In this work, the effect of the radius of curvature and permeability parameters are examined on the flow velocity and temperature profiles of the considered fluid. The aim of this study is to analyse the flow pattern of the couple stress fluid, measure the rate of heat transfer, and volumetric flow rate , when fluid flow through porous curved channel. The proposed model is useful in the biofluid mechanics , nuclear reactors, and in oil and chemical industries. The present model, i.e., the flow of couple stress fluid in a porous curved channel, governs by the highly non-linear coupled differential equations which are solved by using Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM). Through this work, it is concluded that couple stress fluid&#39;s velocity and temperature is smaller in magnitude than that of the Newtonian fluid . Further, it is noticed that the fluid&#39;s flow velocity and temperature in porous curved channel is reduced significantly on increasing the curvature parameter , permeability parameter, and on reducing the couple stress parameter.},

Here, we consider the scenario that the cell or the vesicle releases the diffusive compounds to the immediate environment, which is modelled by the diffusion equation. Typically, one separates the intracellular and extracellular environment and uses homogeneous Neumann boundary condition for the cell boundary (so-called spatial exclusion model), while the point source model neglects the intracellular environment. We show that extra conditions are needed such that the solutions to the two models are consistent. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency. Suggested by the numerical results, we conclude that an initial condition in the form of Gaussian kernel in the point source model compensates for a time-delay discrepancy between the solutions to the two models in the numerical solutions. Various approaches determining optimal amplitude and variance of the Gaussian kernel have been discussed.},

The fractional coupled model is solved numerically by the L 2 − 1 σ L2−1σ method in the temporal direction and the unstructured mesh finite element method in the spatial direction. Besides, we prove the stability and convergence of the numerical scheme . In order to reduce the computational time , a fast method is proposed.

For systems, a modification of the classic trigonometric basis function (TBF) is proposed that successfully obtains the solution on the available boundary data and improves accuracy. The method is based on a theory that removes instability and keeps the same accuracy. However, especially when using SAM schemes with acceptable stability properties, one is still faced with the considerable task of linearizing the systems, consequently, the linearization of the systems which approximate the nonlinear term with the first order derivative is introduced. The final approximation is given by the summation of the primary approximation, radial basis functions (RBFs), and the related TBFs which are determined by the homogeneous boundary conditions . Then the approximation is substituted back to the governing equations where the unknown coefficients can be determined. The efficiency of the algorithm is highlighted by numerical simulations relating to a model on test cases with analytical solutions and without an analytical solution.},

We study the numerical error in these models with continuous and discontinuous initial conditions and determine that the initial discontinuities lead to lower convergence rates, but this issue is present at early times only. Except for the early times, the convergence rates of models with continuous and discontinuous initial conditions are the same. In problems with moving interfaces, we show that the numerical solution captures the exact interface location well, in time.

  abstract     = {The aim of this work is to propose two efficient schemes to handle the accuracy near the singularity at t = 0 t=0 in solving two-dimensional time-fractional diffusion-wave equation (TFDWE). The considered time fractional derivative is in the Caputo sense of order α ( 1 &lt; α &lt; 2 ) (1&amp;lt;α&amp;lt;2) . For the approximation of the time-fractional Caputo derivative (TFCD), we use Nonuniform L 1 method (single-step) and Nonuniform Crank-Nicolson L 1 − 2 L1−2 method (multi-step). The L 1 method has order of convergence (OC) min ⁡ ( 3 − α , γ α ) min⁡(3−α,γα) , where γ is the mesh grading parameter used in construction of the nonuniform mesh, and L 1 − 2 L1−2 method has second OC. We consider nonuniform time mesh to compensate the lack of smoothness caused by the presence of singularity in TFCD at t = 0 t=0 . After that, we adopt these two methods to approximate TFCD and apply the central difference operator for the space direction derivative approximations to get the system of equations for considered model. Then, we use the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) approach to develop two kinds of fully discrete schemes under the regularity conditions to solve the TFDWE. Further, we prove the stability analysis of these two schemes. Two numerical examples are given for one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) TFDWE with smooth and non-smooth exact solutions to indicate the accuracy of ADI schemes. The illustrated examples show that both schemes have second-order accuracy in space direction, and in temporal direction the schemes achieve min ⁡ ( 3 − α , γ α ) min⁡(3−α,γα) and second order convergence, respectively for all 1 &lt; α &lt; 2 1&amp;lt;α&amp;lt;2 .

Considering the applicability to the practical scenarios, we assume that the porous medium is anisotropic in nature. More precisely, the model under steady-state assumption is described by the coupling of Brinkman-Forchheimer and Stokes equations . We develop the existence and uniqueness results corresponding to this two-dimensional Stokes-Brinkman-Forchheimer coupled system using the Browder-Minty theorem. For this we restrict the permeability to a diagonal matrix . The coupled system involves a non-linear term due to the Brinkman-Forchheimer equation. We propose an algorithm based on shooting and searching techniques to develop a numerical solution for this system, however, for an arbitrary anisotropic permeability matrix. The robustness of the presented numerical solution is established by comparing it with asymptotic solutions corresponding to small and large Darcy numbers . For the case of a large Darcy number, the problem of interest is a regular perturbation while the same is a singular perturbation problem for the case of a small Darcy number, which is dealt with using Prandtl&#39;s matching principle. With the velocity distribution determined, we have presented a comparative analysis of the shear stress distribution at the liquid-porous interface and at the bottom plate, which is of interest to analyze the stress distribution on the arterial wall. The asymptotic results are found to be in good agreement with those obtained numerically.},

However, in connection with isogeometric analysis, unstructured meshes suffer from sub-optimal convergence rates in extraordinary regions, especially for solving higher-order PDEs (partial differential equations). In this work, a rational reparameterization method is proposed to achieve optimal convergence rates for isogeometric analysis using Catmull-Clark surfaces. The scheme lifts the convergence of analysis solutions by tuning the weights of control vertices of the input geometry in extraordinary regions, which are often neglected in constructing analysis-suitable parameterizations. Preferred tuning parameters with optimal convergence rates in L 2 L2 -norm are determined statistically based on a test suite composed of typical testing solutions with a range of parameters. Numerical experiments confirm the validity of the proposed method for PDEs up to the fourth-order. Comparisons with the original Catmull-Clark scheme and a state-of-the-art tuned subdivision scheme also show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both optimal convergence and reduced absolute errors of resulting analysis solutions.},

  abstract     = {A preservative scheme is presented and analyzed for the solution of a quenching type convective-diffusion problem modeled through one-sided Riemann-Liouville space-fractional derivatives. Properly weighted Grünwald formulas are employed for the discretization of the fractional derivative. A forward difference approximation is considered in the approximation of the convective term of the nonlinear equation. Temporal steps are optimized via an asymptotic arc-length monitoring mechanism till the quenching point. Under suitable constraints on spatial-temporal discretization steps, the monotonicity, positivity preservations of the numerical solution and numerical stability of the scheme are proved. Three numerical experiments are designed to demonstrate and simulate key characteristics of the semi-adaptive scheme constructed, including critical length, quenching time and quenching location of the fractional quenching phenomena formulated through the one-sided space-fractional convective-diffusion initial-boundary value problem. Effects of the convective function to quenching are discussed. Numerical estimates of the order of convergence are obtained. Computational results obtained are carefully compared with those acquired from conventional integer order quenching convection-diffusion problems for validating anticipated accuracy. The experiments have demonstrated expected accuracy and feasibility of the new method.},

  abstract     = {The use of functionally graded magneto-electro-elastic (FG-MEE) shells in smart composite structures like sensors, transducers, vibration monitoring , aeronautics, shape tracking, medical and sonar applications has a lot of promise. The accurate modeling approach for situations with several physics linked is quite difficult. In this paper, an improved first-order shear deformation hypothesis is used to inspect the magneto-electro-elastic coupling performance of thin-walled smart structures with laminate design presenting FGM composite as inactive material and using the magneto-piezoelectric patches as combined sensor and actuator features. The govern equations of motion, electric and magnetic distributions through the thickness direction of shell element are derived from the virtual of Hamilton principle . The simulations are carried out using a self-coded FE software. A numerical analysis of the nonlinear deflection of FG-MEE shells is performed under multiphysics loading. To ensure that the current MEE formulation is accurate, the findings were compared to existing solutions from the literature, and remarkable agreement was identified. A parametric analysis is conducted to demonstrate how the material composition affects the deflection throughout the thickness. Further, new numerical results, physical insights and finding have been provided in the present manuscript taking into account influences of several important parameters such as material graduation index and various boundary conditions. The novel MEE FE model suggested in this study is highly useful for the accurate development and design of FG-MEE structures.},

A well posed mathematical model is worked out, based on the coupling between a three-dimensional and a one-dimensional equation (3D-1D coupled problem). The problems are then solved in a PDE-constrained optimization framework, under which no mesh conformity is required. This makes the method particularly suitable for this kind of application, since no remeshing is required as the capillary network grows. In order to handle both the evolution of the quantities of interest and the changes in the geometry, a discrete-hybrid strategy is adopted, combining a continuous modeling of the tissue and of the chemicals with a discrete tip-tracking model to account for the vascular network growth. The tip-tracking strategy, together with some proper rules for branching and anastomosis, is able to provide a realistic representation of the capillary network.},

  abstract     = {FE 2 -approaches are chosen to incorporate micro-mechanical information into macroscopical computations. Although the approach is applied for several years, there are some open theoretical aspects in the algorithmic description . In this contribution the entire concept is brought into the method of vertical lines to solve initial boundary-value problems based on the homogenization concept under consideration. This requires a clear description of known and unknown quantities in the space and time discretization procedure. Dependent on the constitutive model, systems of algebraic or differential-algebraic equations (DAE) arise. Here, we concentrate on models of evolutionary type. Frequently, the resulting DAE-systems are solved using the Backward-Euler method, which are embedded in the more general class of diagonally, implicit Runge-Kutta methods. After the time discretization the resulting systems of non-linear equations have to be solved. This can be done using various schemes to obtain more efficient computations. Here, the three-level Newton algorithm, the Newton-Raphson-Schur method, numerical differentiation and a Chord-version are derived in the context of FE 2 and discussed. Finally, step-size-controlled FE 2 -problems are solved, highlighting the importance of time-adaptive computations, particularly, in combination with the non-linear solution scheme, where the Multilevel-Newton-Chord method shows high efficiency. This contributes to an additional reduction of the overall computational times .},

As a bridge for the plate vibration model and the CD-POD algorithm, a compact difference scheme is also proposed and analyzed previously. Numerical experiments, one of which is for resonance case, indicate that the CPU time of the CD-POD algorithm is at least 20 times less than that of the compact difference scheme, for resonance case or for non-resonance case, and thus verifies again that the CD-POD algorithm is a reasonable computation candidate for long time simulation of the viscoelastic plate vibration model.},

In particular, we consider an optimisation–based domain–decomposition algorithm for the parameter–dependent stationary incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Firstly, the problem is described on the subdomains coupled at the interface and solved through an optimal control problem, which leads to the complete separation of the subdomain problems in the DD method. On top of that, a reduced model for the obtained optimal–control problem is built; the procedure is based on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition technique and a further Galerkin projection. The presented methodology is tested on two fluid dynamics benchmarks: the stationary backward–facing step and lid-driven cavity flow . The numerical tests show a significant reduction of the computational costs in terms of both the problem dimensions and the number of optimisation iterations in the domain–decomposition algorithm.},

Then the basis functions are obtained by solving local energy minimization problems over the oversampling domains using the auxiliary space. The basis functions have exponential decay outside the corresponding local oversampling regions. The convergence of the proposed method is provided, and we show that this convergence only depends on the coarse grid size and is independent of the heterogeneities. An online enrichment guided by a posteriori error estimator is developed to enhance computational efficiency.

  abstract     = {A diffuse interface-lattice Boltzmann model is proposed for modeling conjugate heat transfer problems with imperfect interfaces. According to the continuity condition of heat flux and jump condition of temperature across the imperfect interface, a unified sharp interface equation of the temperature field with a singular source term in the composite media domain is established. Then a diffuse interface equation is obtained by making a smoothed approximation of the unified sharp interface equation. The novel diffuse interface equation is restructured into a second-order heat diffusion equation with an anisotropic diffusion coefficient tensor. To numerically solve the second-order anisotropic diffusion equation, a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann (LB) scheme is employed. Several numerical simulations of benchmark test examples with analytical solutions are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of the present model, including the steady-state heat diffusion in a two-layer medium with a flat interface, steady heat diffusion in a square domain with a curved interface and unsteady-state temperature diffusion with two-layer media. The numerical results show that the phenomenon of temperature jump across the imperfect interface can be successfully and correctly captured. Moreover, as an example of practical application, the new proposed diffuse interface model is utilized to predict the effective thermal conductivity of porous media with thermal contact resistance at pore scale. The variation law of the effective thermal conductivity is obtained for each parameter by studying the effects of thermal conductivity ratios of the dual-component material, the shape and volume fraction of blocks in the material, the interfacial thermal conductance coefficient, and the number of blocks on the effective thermal conductivity. Both uniform and random pore structures are considered. The previous theoretical equations strongly support the validity of the present model.},

  abstract     = {The computation of flows of viscoelastic fluids is expensive compared to standard fluids. Besides degrees-of-freedom for velocity and pressure, the viscoelastic stresses introduce an additional unknown to the system. While adaptive meshing techniques are commonly used for simulations of standard fluids, their application is seldom explored in the context of viscoelastic fluids. In this work, we apply an anisotropic mesh adaptation algorithm to solve the viscoelastic flow problem. Our flow solver is based on a logarithmic reformulation of the viscoelastic constitutive laws, which greatly reduces the stringent stability requirements on the mesh size and allows adaptive meshing in this context. For discretization , we use a stabilized finite element method . We present numerical results for a flow past a cylinder. The adaptive method produces near mesh-independent results up to Weissenberg number Wi = 0.7 Wi=0.7 . Our results indicate that with an anisotropic refinement strategy, fewer mesh elements are needed to maintain the same error level as with an isotropic refinement strategy. In a stick-slip transition flow, we demonstrate the capability of the adaptive method to produce optimal meshes even in the presence of a singularity in the solution.},

This allows the implementation of splitting schemes, which show first-order convergence in numerical experiments.

As a result, the discretizations deliver stabilized conforming approximations and residual representatives in a DG space that can drive automatic adaptivity. In this work, we extend AS-FEM by considering continuous enriched test spaces. Thus, we propose a residual minimization method on a stable Continuous Interior Penalty (CIP) formulation, which considers a C 0 C0 -conforming trial FEM space and a test space based on the bubble enrichment of that trial space. In our numerical experiments, the test space choice significantly reduces the total degrees of freedom compared to the DG test spaces of [16] , while recovering the expected convergence rate for the error in the corresponding trial space norm.},

Furthermore, some integral inequalities also assume a crucial role in our analysis. Finally, supercloseness of almost 3/2th order can be obtained on Bakhvalov-type triangular meshes.

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) have proven their effectiveness in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Nevertheless, existing networks cannot model finely detailed signals and therefore fail to represent a signal&#39;s spatial and temporal derivatives. Traditional PINN are unable to approximate solutions of singularly perturbed boundary value problems that have solutions exhibiting sharp boundary layers and steep gradients with sufficient accuracy. A new asymptotic parameter PINN (PAPINN) is proposed to solve singular perturbation-dominated problems. This approach approximates the smooth solution by optimizing the neural network with large perturbation parameters, which are then used as initial values of the neural network with small perturbation parameters to approximate the singular solution. The method avoids the disadvantages of uncertainty of random parameters and manual setting of initial weights, and gives the network better initial weights. It offers a feasible deep learning approach for solving the singular perturbation problem without requiring a priori boundary layer information. By solving numerical examples of convection-diffusion equations originating from magnetic fluids, the accuracy and convergence efficiency of this method are compared with those of PINN and gPINN. The results show that the method can effectively approximate the large gradient solution of the convection-dominated diffusion equation with an accuracy of order 10 − 3 10−3 and has better convergence speed and stability than PINN and gPINN.},

Then a fourth-order exponential integrator method is used to solve the corresponding semi-linear ODEs system. In light of the results in theory, the proposed algorithm is fourth-order accuracy in both time and space. In the specific implementation of the proposed algorithm, due to the special structure of the coefficient matrix, the products of some φ -functions of matrices (related to the matrix exponential) and vectors are computed by the shift-invert Lanczos technique in the exponential integrator. In order to calculate the linear system of equations arising from the shift-invert Lanczos procedure, two classes of efficient preconditioners including Strang&#39;s circulant preconditioner/ τ matrix preconditioner are constructed and implemented by fast Fourier transform and fast sine transform, respectively.

The flux in the derivative equation is directly approximated by polynomial-based high-order finite difference method . In order to overcome the nonphysical oscillation, the derivative is modified by a high-order HWENO limiter , which is only used in the temporal discretization , while the flux reconstruction is completed with the original derivative. The present scheme has advantages: (1) compactness, using less neighbor cells in the reconstruction procedure; (2) flexibility, avoiding the appearance of negative linear weights by artificial setting; (3) accuracy, numerical errors of the present scheme are smaller than direct WENO (Liu et al.

The major improvement in this method is that it does not require the linearization of the working equations. The method is quite simple and requires only one set of data to obtain a good approximation of the unknown material property. Additional set of data can improve the quality of the recovered function.

The convergence rate of the algorithms is analyzed as the fractional order of the time derivative changes. The paper demonstrates that the algorithms exhibit slow superlinear convergence when the fractional order is close to zero, almost finite step convergence (exact finite step convergence for wave case) when the order approaches two, and faster superlinear convergence as the fractional order increases in between. The transitional nature of the algorithms&#39; behavior is effectively captured through estimates with changes in the fractional order, and the results are verified by numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {This work deals with a higher order numerical approximation for analyzing a class of multi-term time fractional partial integro-differential equations involving Volterra integral operators. The solutions to these problems have a mild singularity at the initial time , due to which an initial layer appears, which becomes more sharper as the highest order time fractional derivative decreases. This behaviour reduces the rate of convergence by standard approaches. We start the present work by considering the existence and uniqueness of a class of generalized partial integro-differential equations and then, present the L1 discretization on a graded mesh in time which is adapted towards the initial time level. This discretization leads to a higher order accuracy than the solutions obtained on a time uniform mesh. The convergence analysis corresponding to the Volterra integral operator is nontrivial as it uses a repeated quadrature rule. This analysis can also be extended for weakly singular kernels. The stability analysis of the present scheme with a sharp error estimation is also provided. The analysis with extensive experiments shows that a higher rate of accuracy can be attained for several suitable choices of the grading parameters for solving several classes of time fractional integro-differential equations.},

The a priori error estimates providing the convergence analysis for the finite element scheme are derived, in a simple way, in H 1 H1 norm. A detailed parametric analysis of the physics related to flow and heat transfer for different governing input parameters such as hybrid nanoparticles&#39; volume fraction ( ϕ ), Rayleigh Number ( R a ) (Ra) , Prandtl Number ( P r ) (Pr) , and the length of heat source has been reported. While a butterfly flow pattern with a multi-cellular structure is noticed in the H-shaped domain, the flow in the L-Shaped domain depicts a boundary layer feature with primary, secondary, and tertiary co-rotating and counter-rotating cells. Finally, we could conclude that the addition of hybrid nanoparticles ( A l 2 O 3 , C u ) (Al2O3,Cu) to the base fluid water really enhanced the heat transfer both in H and L shape domains.},

  abstract     = {The primary goal of this paper is to provide an efficient solution algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian framework for optimization problems with a stochastic objective function and deterministic constraints. Our main contribution is combining the augmented Lagrangian framework with adaptive sampling, resulting in an efficient optimization methodology validated with practical examples. To achieve the presented efficiency, we consider inexact solutions for the augmented Lagrangian subproblems, and through an adaptive sampling mechanism, we control the variance in the gradient estimates. Furthermore, we analyze the theoretical performance of the proposed scheme by showing equivalence to a gradient descent algorithm on a Moreau envelope function, and we prove sublinear convergence for convex objectives and linear convergence for strongly convex objectives with affine equality constraints. The worst-case sample complexity of the resulting algorithm, for an arbitrary choice of penalty parameter in the augmented Lagrangian function, is O ( ϵ − 3 − δ ) O(ϵ−3−δ) , where ϵ &gt; 0 ϵ&amp;gt;0 is the expected error of the solution and δ &gt; 0 δ&amp;gt;0 is a user-defined parameter. If the penalty parameter is chosen to be O ( ϵ − 1 ) O(ϵ−1) , we demonstrate that the result can be improved to O ( ϵ − 2 ) O(ϵ−2) , which is competitive with the other methods employed in the literature. Moreover, if the objective function is strongly convex with affine equality constraints, we obtain O ( ϵ − 1 log ⁡ ( 1 / ϵ ) ) O(ϵ−1log⁡(1/ϵ)) complexity. Finally, we empirically verify the performance of our adaptive sampling augmented Lagrangian framework in machine learning optimization and engineering design problems, including topology optimization of a heat sink with environmental uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we deal with a new numerical approach for solving some shape optimization eigenvalue problems governed by the bi-harmonic operator, under volume and convexity constraints. This is based on the new shape derivative formula, recently established in [10] , [11] , which allows to express the shape derivative of optimal shape design problems of minimizing volume cost functionals, in term of support functions. This avoids some computational disadvantages required for the classical shape derivative method involving the vector fields [16] , [18] , when one use the finite elements discretization for approximating the auxiliary boundary value problems in shape optimization processes. So, we first show the existence of the shape derivative of the eigenvalues for these fourth-order problems with respect to a family of convex domains and express its formula by means of support functions. Thereby we propose a new numerical shape optimization process based on the gradient method performed with the finite element method for approximating the auxiliary eigenvalue boundary value problems . The so obtained numerical results show the efficiency and the ability of the proposed approach in producing good quality solutions for the first ten optimal eigenvalues and their associated optimal shapes.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we construct three efficient and conservative high-order accurate finite difference schemes for solving the Klein-Gordon-Schrödinger equations with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions . The spatial discretization is carried out by a novel fourth-order accurate central difference scheme in which the fast discrete sine transform can be utilized for efficient implementation . The second-order conservative Crank-Nicolson scheme is considered in the temporal direction. Then a priori estimate, conservation laws , and convergence of the first scheme in two-dimensional space are discussed. A linearized iteration based on the fast discrete sine transform technique is derived to solve the nonlinear system effectively. Because the resultant algorithm does not use matrix inversion , it is computationally efficient in long-time calculations. For comparative purposes, two other schemes are constructed based on improved scalar auxiliary variable approaches by converting the Klein-Gordon-Schrödinger equations into an equivalent new system which involves solving linear systems with constant coefficients at each time step. Moreover, we need to point out that the proposed schemes are decoupled, which makes them appropriate for parallel computation to significantly reduce the computing time. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to validate the correctness of theoretical results and demonstrate the excellent performance in long-time conservation of the schemes.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation lithium-ion batteries with silicon anodes have positive characteristics due to higher energy densities compared to state-of-the-art graphite anodes. However, the large volume expansion of silicon anodes can cause high mechanical stresses, especially if the battery active particle cannot expand freely. In this article, a thermodynamically consistent continuum model for coupling chemical and mechanical effects of electrode particles is extended by a change in the boundary condition for the displacement via a variational inequality . This switch represents a limited enlargement of the particle swelling or shrinking due to lithium intercalation or deintercalation in the host material, respectively. For inequality constraints as boundary condition a smaller time step size is need as well as a locally finer mesh. The combination of a primal-dual active set algorithm, interpreted as semismooth Newton method , and a spatial and temporal adaptive algorithm allows the efficient numerical investigation based on a finite element method . Using the example of silicon, the chemical and mechanical behavior of one- and two-dimensional representative geometries for a charge-discharge cycle is investigated. Furthermore, the efficiency of the adaptive algorithm is demonstrated. It turns out that the size of the gap has a significant influence on the maximal stress value and the slope of the increase. Especially in two space dimensions , the obstacle can cause an additional region with a lithium-poor phase.},

Those solutions are typically difficult to generalize in a sufficiently wide parameter space while counting on limited computational resources available. As such, we present a general two-stage deep learning framework able to perform that generalization with low computational effort in time. It consists in a separated training of two pipe-lined predictive models. At first, a certain number of independent neural networks are trained with data-sets taken from different subsets of the parameter space. Successively, a second predictive model is specialized to properly combine the first-stage guesses and compute the right predictions. Promising results are obtained applying the framework to incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a cavity (Rayleigh-Bénard cavity), obtaining a 97% reduction in the computational time comparing with its numerical resolution for a new value of the Grashof number.},

A grad-div stabilization is an efficient remedy in conforming finite element methods. In this paper, an analogue of the grad-div stabilization that the penalization of the jumps of the normal velocities over facets of the triangulation in discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods is investigated for a coupled Stokes and Darcy problem, it can efficiently improve the accuracy of velocity and mass conservation. Firstly, we present the existence and uniqueness of a solution, unconditional stability and a priori estimates for the DG method. Then, by using the principle of superposition and orthogonal decomposition cleverly, we prove the limiting behavior that the DG method with an analogue of grad-div stabilization for a coupled Stokes and Darcy problem converge to the strongly conservative BDM DG method with a convergence rate of O ( λ f − 1 + λ s − 1 ) , it allows for arbitrarily large stabilization parameters.

Moreover, flexible element shapes allow for the construction of an arbitrary domain topology. Polygon meshes are a common representation of the domain that cover any choice of the finite element shape. Being an alternative tool for modeling and analysis, blending spline surfaces support representation on polygon grids. The blending splines have a hierarchical structure, which is obtained by generating local surfaces that cover each node support and then blended with a special type of basis functions. This type of splines in their tensor product form is suitable for application to isogeometric analysis problems. A more general representation constructed on polygonal elements can be used on a wider range of domain topology in comparison with tensor product surfaces . In this paper we introduce a novel approach to constructing curvilinear polygon meshes in the blending spline representation in application to the isogeometric analysis context. The focus is on generating a novel special type of basis functions on a connected collection of polygons, with triangles and quadrilaterals as particular cases. The purpose of the proposed paper is to show applications of this construction to various numerical problems, as well as to generalize the approach to evaluating these basis functions on arbitrary planar domains.},

The time coordinate is transformed into a multi-dimensional time through new separated coordinates, the micro and the macro times. From a physical viewpoint, the time evolution of all the quantities involved in the problem can be followed along two time scales, the fast one (micro-scale) and the slow one (macro-scale). In this paper, the method is applied to compute the quasi-static response of an elasto-plastic structure under cyclic loading. The study shows the existence of a physically consistent temporal decomposition in computational cyclic plasticity. Such micro-macro characterization may be particularly appealing in high-cycle loading analyses, such as aging and fatigue, addressed in a future work in progress.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks, such as sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation, entail a huge computational complexity when dealing with input-output maps involving the solution of nonlinear differential problems, because of the need to query expensive numerical solvers repeatedly. Projection-based reduced order models (ROMs), such as the Galerkin-reduced basis (RB) method, have been extensively developed in the last decades to overcome the computational complexity of high fidelity full order models (FOMs), providing remarkable speed-ups when addressing UQ tasks related with parameterized differential problems. Nonetheless, constructing a projection-based ROM that can be efficiently queried usually requires extensive modifications to the original code, a task which is non-trivial for nonlinear problems, or even not possible at all when proprietary software is used. Non-intrusive ROMs – which rely on the FOM as a black box – have been recently developed to overcome this issue. In this work, we consider ROMs exploiting proper orthogonal decomposition to construct a reduced basis from a set of FOM snapshots, and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to approximate the RB projection coefficients. Two different approaches, namely a global GPR and a tensor-decomposition-based GPR, are explored on a set of 3D time-dependent solid mechanics examples. Finally, the non-intrusive ROM is exploited to perform global sensitivity analysis (relying on both screening and variance-based methods) and parameter estimation (through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods), showing remarkable computational speed-ups and very good accuracy compared to high-fidelity FOMs.},

For the ( u , p ) (u,p) mixed formulation it is shown that pressure robustness, with optimal convergence characteristics, is restored by use of the superposition principle . The displacement and pressure solutions are computed separately, by providing the body force decomposed into its divergence- and rotation-free parts, respectively. The approach relies on Euler&#39;s observation (1757) concerning the equivalence of the pressure reaction and a conservative body force. Uniform convergence, independent of the shear modulus , with optimal convergence rate is observed for the mixed formulation , for separated divergence-free and rotation-free right hand sides . For the ℘- version displacement method pollution of the displacement can be avoided this way, but the pressure is of very poor quality , since it is computed from the displacement. Further, the observed convergence rates for displacement and pressure are not optimal . Thus, the mixed ( u , p ) (u,p) -formulation is experimentally shown to be superior compared with the ℘ -version displacement method .},

We write the Maxwell curl curl equation as a system of two first order equations and design a novel least-squares formulation whose minimum is attained at the solution of the system. The eigensolutions are then approximated by considering the eigenmodes of the underlying solution operator. We study the convergence of the finite element approximation and we show several numerical tests confirming that the method provides optimally convergent results when edge elements are used. It turns out that nodal elements can be successfully employed for the approximation of our problem also in the presence of singular solutions .},

One key step is to discretize the bed slope source term and the nonconservative product term due to the exchange of the momentum based on defining auxiliary variables. The second-order accuracy in space can be obtained by constructing non-oscillatory piecewise linear polynomials. In order to guarantee the strong-stability-preserving (SSP) property and second-order accuracy in time, we use a SSP Nonstaggered Runge-Kutta method. We prove that the designed nonstaggered central difference schemes can obtain a well-balanced property for the steady-state stationary solution . In particular, the positivity of layer heights is guaranteed by providing an appropriate CFL condition with the aid of a “draining” time-step technique. Finally, we conduct several classical problems of the two-layer open channel flows .

  abstract     = {We propose a single-step simplified lattice Boltzmann algorithm capable of performing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow simulations in pipes for very small values of magnetic Reynolds numbers R m Rm . In some previous works, most lattice Boltzmann simulations are performed with values of R m Rm close to the Reynolds numbers for flows in simplified rectangular geometries. One of the reasons is the limitation of some traditional lattice Boltzmann algorithms in dealing with situations involving very small magnetic diffusion time scales associated with most industrial applications in MHD, which require the use of the so-called quasi-static (QS) approximation. Another reason is related to the significant dependence that many boundary conditions methods for lattice Boltzmann have on the relaxation time parameter. In this work, to overcome the mentioned limitations, we introduce an improved simplified algorithm for velocity and magnetic fields which is able to directly solve the equations of the QS approximation, among other systems, without preconditioning procedures. In these algorithms, the effects of solid insulating boundaries are included by using an improved explicit immersed boundary algorithm, whose accuracy is not affected by the values of R m Rm . Some validations with classic benchmarks and the analysis of the energy balance in examples including uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields are shown in this work. Furthermore, a progressive transition between the scenario described by the QS approximation and the MHD canonical equations in pipe flows is visualized by studying the evolution of the magnetic energy balance in examples with unsteady flows.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an efficient parallel computing strategy to solve large-scale structural vibration problems. The proposed approach utilises a novel direct method that operates using simplex-shaped space-time finite elements and allows for the direct decoupling of variables during the assembly of global matrices. The method uses consistent stiffness, inertia and damping matrices and deals with non-symmetric matrices. One significant advantage of this approach is that the computational cost remains unaffected by the bandwidth of the matrix in the traditional sense because only non-zero coefficients are retained. The speed of computations demonstrates a noticeable increase as the number of nodes and the problem&#39;s dimensionality grow. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the parallel space-time approach, a comparison with a sequentially executed code was conducted. The results indicate that the proposed method enables calculations at least 20 times faster than those achieved using the classical finite element method. Furthermore, the parallelisation algorithm was successfully implemented to solve a dynamics problem involving a large-scale, three-dimensional railway structure subjected to a moving load. Remarkably, the problem was solved in a reasonable amount of time using a relatively low-cost personal computer.},

The latter two correspond to Maxwell-Cattaneo-Vernotte (MCV) and Fourier heat conduction problems. The method is called the tent-pitcher spacetime DG method (tpSDG) due to its resemblance to the causal spacetime DG method (cSDG) wherein the solution advances in time by pitching spacetime patches. The tpSDG method extends the applicability of such methods from hyperbolic to parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs. For problems with a spatially uniform mesh, a transfer matrix approach is derived wherein the inflow, boundary, and source term values are mapped to the solution coefficient and output values. This resembles a finite difference scheme, but with grid points at the Gauss points of the spatial elements and arbitrarily tunable order of accuracy in spacetime. The spectral stability analysis of the method provides stability correction factors for the parabolic case. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of the method to problems with heterogeneous material properties.},

  abstract     = {In the context of solving inverse problems for physics applications within a Bayesian framework, we present a new approach, the Markov Chain Generative Adversarial Neural Network (MCGAN), to alleviate the computational costs associated with solving the Bayesian inference problem. GANs pose a very suitable framework to aid in the solution of Bayesian inference problems, as they are designed to generate samples from complicated high-dimensional distributions. By training a GAN to sample from a low-dimensional latent space and then embedding it in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we can highly efficiently sample from the posterior, by replacing both the high-dimensional prior and the expensive forward map. This comes at the cost of a potentially expensive offline stage in which training data must be simulated or gathered and the GAN has to be trained. We prove that the proposed methodology converges to the true posterior in the Wasserstein-1 distance and that sampling from the latent space is equivalent to sampling in the high-dimensional space in a weak sense. The method is showcased in two test cases where we perform both state and parameter estimation simultaneously and it is compared with two conventional approaches, polynomial chaos expansion and ensemble Kalman filter, and a deep learning-based approach, deep Bayesian inversion. The method is shown to be more accurate than alternative approaches while also being computationally faster, in multiple test cases, including the important engineering setting of detecting leaks in pipelines.},

Because the equilibrium radiation diffusion equation is often built on complicated domains as well as interfaces and has a strong nonlinearity , it is challenging to solve by means of finite difference method and so on. By treating T 4 T4 with different linearization methods , three meshfree methods are utilized to approximate the two-dimensional equilibrium radiation diffusion equation with jump coefficient. Firstly, the time term is discretized by the fully implicit scheme. Then, three different linearization methods (direct linearization, Picard-Newton linearization and Richtmyer linearization) are utilized to linearize T 4 T4 . Finally, the linearized algebraic equations are solved numerically by a non-symmetric collocation method with a compactly supported radial basis function . Numerical experiments are performed on the three algorithms for different regular and irregular domains with highly curved interfaces.

  abstract     = {In this paper we present an immersed weak Galerkin method for solving second-order elliptic interface problems on polygonal meshes , where the meshes do not need to be aligned with the interface. The discrete space consists of constants on each edge and broken linear polynomials satisfying the interface conditions in each element. For triangular meshes, such broken linear polynomials coincide with the basis functions in immersed finite element methods [33] . We establish some approximation properties of the broken linear polynomials and the discrete weak gradient of a certain projection of the solution on polygonal meshes. We then prove an optimal error estimate of our scheme in the discrete H 1 H1 -seminorm under some assumptions on the exact solution. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {An Isogeometric Boundary Element Method (IgA-BEM) is considered for the numerical solution of Helmholtz problems on 3D bounded or unbounded domains , admitting a smooth multi-patch representation of their finite boundary surface. The discretization spaces are formed by C 0 C0 inter-patch continuous functional spaces whose restriction to a patch simplifies to the span of tensor product B-splines composed with the given patch NURBS parameterization. Both conforming and non-conforming spaces are allowed, so that local refinement is possible at the patch level. For regular and singular integration, the proposed model utilizes a numerical procedure defined on the support of each trial B-spline function, which makes possible a function-by-function implementation of the matrix assembly phase. Spline quasi-interpolation is the common ingredient of all the considered quadrature rules; in the singular case it is combined with a B-spline recursion over the spline degree and with a singularity extraction technique, extended to the multi-patch setting for the first time. A threshold selection strategy is proposed to automatically distinguish between nearly singular and regular integrals. The non-conforming C 0 C0 joints between spline spaces on different patches are implemented as linear constraints based on knot removal conditions, and do not require a hierarchical master-slave relation between neighbouring patches. Numerical examples on relevant benchmarks show that the expected convergence orders are achieved with uniform discretization and a small number of uniformly spaced quadrature nodes.},

We use the operator splitting method to control the equation for splitting, and use the explicit Euler&#39;s method to solve the discrete equation. Based on the source shape and the target shape, our phase-field model can perform rapid shape transformation when the appropriate parameters are selected. In order to verify the feasibility of our proposed phase-field model, numerical experiments on shape transformation are carried out in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space. The results show that the established mathematical model can not only perform shape transformation between simple shapes, but also have a good effect on shape transformation between complex shapes. We also propose a numerical solution using the Crank-Nicolson numerical scheme to handle the model we introduced. This numerical scheme utilizes the multigrid method and Gauss-Seidel iteration for solving. The results of the numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this numerical method in handling shape transformations in three-dimensional space.},

The crucial idea of the method is to utilize a locally refined multiscale mesh that is fine around its own subdomain and coarse elsewhere to calculate a local finite element solution . On the basis of an existing Smagorinsky solver, the introduced method is easily implemented and avoids massive recoding. Using the duality argument, errors of the standard finite element approximations for the velocity in L 2 L2 norm and pressure in H − 1 H−1 norm are derived. Error bounds of the solutions from the introduced method are estimated. Moreover, four parallel iterative algorithms are presented, and some results of numerical tests are given to verify the theory predicted and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms. It is numerically shown that the parallel algorithms decrease substantially the CPU time, keeping the accuracy of the solutions comparable to the serial algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Approximating differential operators defined on two-dimensional surfaces is an important problem that arises in many areas of science and engineering. Over the past ten years , localized meshfree methods based on generalized moving least squares (GMLS) and radial basis function finite differences (RBF-FD) have been shown to be effective for this task as they can give high orders of accuracy at low computational cost, and they can be applied to surfaces defined only by point clouds. However, there have yet to be any studies that perform a direct comparison of these methods for approximating surface differential operators (SDOs). The first purpose of this work is to fill that gap. For this comparison, we focus on an RBF-FD method based on polyharmonic spline kernels and polynomials (PHS+Poly) since they are most closely related to the GMLS method . Additionally, we use a relatively new technique for approximating SDOs with RBF-FD called the tangent plane method since it is simpler than previous techniques and natural to use with PHS+Poly RBF-FD. The second purpose of this work is to relate the tangent plane formulation of SDOs to the local coordinate formulation used in GMLS and to show that they are equivalent when the tangent space to the surface is known exactly. The final purpose is to use ideas from the GMLS SDO formulation to derive a new RBF-FD method for approximating the tangent space for a point cloud surface when it is unknown. For the numerical comparisons of the methods, we examine their convergence rates for approximating the surface gradient, divergence, and Laplacian as the point clouds are refined for various parameter choices. We also compare their efficiency in terms of accuracy per computational cost, both when including and excluding setup costs.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present high-order arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian discontinuous Galerkin (ALE-DG) methods for the Euler equations under gravitational fields on the moving mesh. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that, through careful design of the scheme, the ALE-DG methods can also achieve the structure-preserving properties of DG methods, such as high order accuracy, well-balanced property, positivity-preserving property, for the Euler equations with arbitrary moving meshes. We propose two well-balanced and positivity-preserving ALE-DG schemes which can preserve the explicitly given equilibrium state on arbitrary moving grids, and also carry out rigorous positivity-preserving analyses for both schemes. Our schemes are established both in one dimension and in two dimensions on unstructured triangular meshes. The most challenging component in designing such ALE-DG schemes on the moving mesh is to maintain the equilibrium state and the mass conservation at the same time, since temporal discretization of the ALE method may destroy the well-balanced property, and inappropriate adjustment of the numerical flux could lead to the loss of the mass conservation property on the moving meshes. A novel approximation of the desired equilibrium state based on ALE-DG methods on the moving mesh has been introduced to overcome such difficulty. Numerical experiments in different circumstances are provided to illustrate the well-balanced property, positivity-preserving property and high order accuracy. We also compare the schemes on the moving mesh and on the static mesh to demonstrate the advantage of ALE-DG methods for discontinuous solutions .},

Mathematically, the model comprises three coupled reaction-diffusion equations that characterize the cancer cell density evolution, the matrix-degrading enzymes and the extracellular matrix. The numerical realization demands fine resolutions both in spatial and temporal due to the incorporation of the nonlinear density-dependent diffusion and haptotaxis effect. We investigate this challenging problem by combining adaptive space-time discretization techniques with a dynamic load balancing to reduce the computational cost without sacrificing the accuracy of the numerical solutions. For the spatial discretization , the multilevel finite element method is used, and for temporal discretization , the implicit Euler method , and the linearly implicit Runge-Kutta method with adaptive time step are used. A non-overlapping domain decomposition method is considered for the dynamic decomposition of the computational mesh. Furthermore, the mathematical analysis for the existence of the fully discretized system is presented. The numerical results show density-dependent diffusion and haptotaxis effects on tumor growth and invasion. We illustrate the superiority of the dynamic space and time adaptivity in a parallel setting using several test cases.},

Here, we introduce PDDSparse, a different approach to scientific supercomputing which relies on a “Feynman-Kac formula for domain decomposition”. Concretely, the interfacial values (only) are determined by a stochastic, highly sparse linear system G ( ω ) u → = b → ( ω ) G(ω)u→=b→(ω) of size O ( M ) O(M) , whose coefficients are constructed with Monte Carlo simulations—hence embarrassingly in parallel. In addition to a wider scope for strong scalability in the deep supercomputing regime, PDDSparse has built-in fault tolerance and is ideally suited for GPUs.

  abstract     = {Adaptive Erlangization is a flexible observation/intervention strategy for system management based on randomized observation frequencies. The main contributions of this paper are the derivation and computation of some limit equation arising in the stochastic control under ambiguity along with its engineering application . In particular, with a focus on environmental management, we consider a novel long-term control problem under random and ambiguous observation frequencies where the Erlangization is modulated by the opponent of the decision-maker, i.e., nature, so that the objective to be minimized is overestimated subject to an entropy-like penalization. The optimality equation of the control problem is a nonlocal Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation of a regime-switching form. While the problem itself is new, we also consider a large-level and hence high-precision limit of the Erlangization, under which the HJB equation is expected to converge to a non-trivial limit equation where regime-switching terms are replaced with partial derivative terms. Interestingly, the limit equation is free from the ambiguity if the ambiguity-aversion of the decision-maker is fixed. In contrast, additionally if the ambiguity-aversion is consistently scaled so that its effect does not vanish, the limit equation may have a more complex form. Finally, we compute environmental management problems by using a finite difference scheme to numerically validate our theoretical analysis.},

The structure of the method is such that it naturally fits to a level set representation of the evolving surface. The higher order version of the method is based on a space-time variant of a mesh deformation that has been developed in the literature for stationary surfaces. The discretization method that we present is of (optimal) higher order accuracy for smoothly varying surfaces with sufficiently smooth solutions. Without any modifications the method can be used for the discretization of problems with topological singularities.

  abstract     = {Despite their well-established efficiency and accuracy, fractional-step schemes are not commonly used in finite volume methods . This article presents first-, second-, and third-order in-time fractional step schemes to solve incompressible convective time-dependent flows using collocated meshes. The fractional step methods are designed from a fully discrete problem and allow for optimal convergence rates. A detailed algebraic derivation of the method is included, incorporating implementation details to easily adapt existing finite volume codes . The schemes use extrapolations for pressure in the first calculation step and include Yosida&#39;s approximation in the last step to ensure third-order in-time accuracy. In addition, an incomplete Yosida scheme that considers a correction only in the diffusive term is evaluated. Time discretization is achieved using the backward differentiation formula, including first-, second-, and third-order in-time schemes, and an optimized second-order one. The linear momentum and continuity equations are decoupled using a pressure-correction strategy. The numerical results include a converged test using the solutions to evaluate the convergence in-time rates. Finally, the dominant convective flows related to the lid-driven cavity problem are solved for two- and three-dimensional flows. The use of Picard, Newton, and Picard–Newton linearization is analyzed. The optimal rates of the convergence errors of the fractional-step methods are verified. The results indicate that Yosida&#39;s methods are more accurate than the projection method for the same meshes and time-step sizes. The use of Newton and Picard–Newton linearization strategies considerably reduces the number of iterations compared with the Picard scheme. The optimized second-order method is more accurate than the classical one and is comparable to the third-order method in the solution of dominant convective flows . The benefits of using high-order time integration schemes are verified.},

The proposed gas kinetic scheme is derived from the characteristic solution rather than the formal integral solution of the BGK model equation, from which Xu&#39;s GKS origins. The new GKS has a very similar structure as Xu&#39;s GKS, but it doesn&#39;t have the gradients of the initial continuous equilibrium distribution function that appeared in Xu&#39;s GKS. Therefore, the present scheme can be much simpler, and, thus, has higher computational efficiency than Xu&#39;s GKS. Moreover, the numerical properties of the proposed GKS were investigated and it indicated the present GKS had the positivity-preserving property, good robustness, and satisfied the entropy condition . Furthermore, the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed GKS were evaluated by six cases in two dimensions , including (a) the compressible Kuette flow in two dimensions; (b) the Blasius laminar boundary layer flow over a flat plate at Re = 10 5 ; (c) the lid-driven cavity flow in two dimensions at Re = 1000 , 5000 ; (d) the 2D Sedov blast; (e) the shock boundary layer interaction with Ma ∞ = 2.0 , Re = 2.96 × 10 5 and an oblique shock angle θ = 32.6 o ; and (f) the Ma ∞ = 8.03 , Re = 1.835 × 10 5 hypersonic flow over a cylinder.

The original phase field based topology optimization method greatly simplifies griding, discretization , and handling of topological changes. However, the interface motion driven by curvature effects exists in the original phase field equation, which significantly affects the performance of structure. Furthermore, the existence of curvature effects also bring the ill-conditioned behavior of the normal vector. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a modified phase field method with a nonlinear preconditioning process to eliminate the curvature effects. The method performs interface corrections on topological shapes through an anti-diffusive phase-field equation and imposes an adaptive preconditioning process to alleviate the problems of erroneous normal vector. The adaptive preconditioning method can capture more shape details for traditional topology optimization methods and offset the over-smooth effect of the phase field framework. We couple the finite element method and the finite difference method to solve the compliance minimization problem . The linearly stabilized splitting scheme is adopted to maintain the simplicity and stability of the algorithm. A series of comparative numerical examples are performed to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. These examples demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the original phase field method for topology optimization.},

Furthermore, we derive optimal error estimates for the temperature in L ∞ ( L 2 ) L∞(L2) -norm, when h = O ( H 2 − δ ) h=O(H2−δ) and in L ∞ ( H 1 ) L∞(H1) -norm, when h = O ( H 4 − δ ) h=O(H4−δ) . We further establish that under the smallness condition on the data, the two-grid error estimates hold uniformly in time. Then, we employ a backward Euler method in the time direction to achieve complete discretization and derive fully discrete error estimates. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {The conservative Allen-Cahn equation has been widely used to capture complicated interfacial problems. As a typical convective-diffusion equation, it can be solved within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. In this work, we focus on three modified LB schemes with a temporal or spatial difference-based correction term. The first one is proposed by our present work, while the other two are presented for comparative studies. All of them are able to recover the Allen-Cahn equation accurately up to the second order. Through a high-order truncation analysis, the dominant error terms of these modified LB schemes are extracted at the third and fourth order for the first time. Comparative studies among different models are performed in terms of accuracy, convergence rate, boundedness , and efficiency. Our proposed model shows superiority in reducing numerical errors and maintaining boundedness over a wide range of relaxation time , which is consistent with our theoretical analysis. In addition, we improve the locality of our modified model by reorganizing the collision step and adding a correction step after the streaming process.},

In order to make them [5] , [10] , [11] , [12] theoretically more accurate and related to the physical realities, two modified new algorithms are presented in this paper. For the curved wall boundary treatment, the novelty resides in the method to construct the distribution functions. Compared with other popular algorithms, a pre-processing procedure is introduced in the improved algorithm involving both linear inner and outer interpolations which covers more neighbouring points to collect comprehensive information. Based on the constructed distribution functions, the velocity components and density on the target points are calculated. Finally, using the velocities and density determined to calculate the equilibrium distribution functions, the non-equilibrium distribution functions are obtained through a combination of both inner and outer interpolation of the neighbouring related points. The embedded depth Δ of each wall boundary point is treated individually, not by a rough classification like, Δ &lt; 0.5 | | Δ ≥ 0.5 Δ&amp;lt;0.5||Δ≥0.5 or Δ &lt; 0.75 | | Δ ≥ 0.75 Δ&amp;lt;0.75||Δ≥0.75 used in some other algorithms. For the tree grid virtual boundary treatment, compared with a previous algorithm [12] introduced by present authors, the modified new algorithm considers comprehensive information from more neighbouring related points to interpolate velocities and density. The distribution functions are calculated through a bidirectional extrapolation both from coarse to fine mesh and from fine to coarse one. It is proved that these two improved algorithms are trustable and have a good numerical performance.},

We apply our polynomial preconditioner to a suitable Schur complement related with this system, which can not be explicitly computed because of its size and density.

The time marching is combining the first-order semi-implicit Euler scheme , a first-order stabilized term and some subtle implicit-explicit treatments for the coupling terms. As a result, the fully discrete scheme only needs to solve some linear sub-problems at each time step and yields an exactly divergence-free magnetic field on the discrete level. In particular, we decouple the computations of the magnetic field and electric field equivalently by utilizing the structure-preserving property. Furthermore, the unique solvability and unconditional stability of the scheme are proved. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme.},

To achieve this, a phase-field-based multiple-relaxation-time LB model is developed on body-fitted grids for two-phase flow, which incorporates a wettability treatment scheme. The verification results indicate that the present mathematical method is promising for simulating the primary liquid film breakup near the prefilmer with non-orthogonal edge configurations. Subsequently, the detailed numerical predictions reveal that a prefilmer featuring convergent edge configurations has the potential to improve the primary liquid film breakup significantly. To be more specific, the convergent prefilmer edge restricts the liquid film accumulation, resulting in a reduction in the amount of liquid utilized for feeding ligament growth. Combined with the enhanced shearing effects of airflow in the near wake of convergent prefilmer edges, the ligament breakup length decreases while the ligament breakup frequency increases . It should be noted that the impact of the prefilmer edge configuration on the primary liquid film breakup decreases slightly with an increase in air velocity. Further, the liquid film accumulation and the ligament disintegration follow a similar periodic pattern with pretty consistent frequencies, indicating a coupling relationship between these two stages of the primary liquid film breakup.},

Nonlinear terms in the governing equations due to variable thermal conductivity are linearized by the Kirchhoff mapping. In the proposed method, after linearization, the time domain is discretized by using a finite-difference approach and subsequently space domain is approximated with the use of Legendre wavelets.

  abstract     = {A novel meshfree local method is developed in the context of Trefftz approaches to solve eigenvalue problems related to buckling and free vibration of arbitrarily shaped thin plates, potentially having complicated cutouts. The formulation is based on Kirchhoff&#39;s assumptions for thin plates with C 1 C1 continuity of the solution function. The mesh grid is replaced by a set of nodal points containing the degrees of freedom, located over the domain and its boundaries, thus removing the need for heavy mesh generation process. A sub-domain (cloud) centered at each node and containing several adjacent nodes is considered, in which the approximation functions are defined. The bases are made from Exponential Basis Functions (EBFs), so as to automatically satisfy part of the governing PDE and thus, removing the numerical integration procedure and increasing the solution accuracy. Due to the existence of indefinite values as the critical buckling load or the free vibration frequency , Trefftz approaches have difficulties to directly apply for eigenvalue problems. To resolve this, first the homogeneous eigenvalue problem converts into a non-homogeneous problem by moving the parts with indefinite eigenvalues to the right hand side of the equality and keeping the rest on the left. The solution to the whole eigenvalue problem is approximated using a series of EBFs. Then the solution to the homogeneous part is interpolated using another series of EBFs capable of exactly satisfying the homogeneous part of the newly defined PDE, while the particular solution is approximated using the eigenvalue solution series defined at the first step. Numerical results reveal that the proposed method can efficiently produce results with high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Model reduction by projection-based approaches is often associated with losing some of the important features that contribute towards the dynamics of the retained scales. As a result, a mismatch occurs between the predicted trajectories of the original system and the truncated one. We put forth a framework to apply a continuous time control signal in the latent space of the reduced order model (ROM) to account for the effect of truncation. We set the control input using parameterized models by following energy transfer principles. Our methodology relies on observing the system behavior in the physical space and using the projection operator to restrict the feedback signal into the latent space. Then, we leverage the forward sensitivity method (FSM) to derive relationships between the feedback and the desired mode-dependent control. We test the performance of the proposed approach using two test cases, corresponding to viscous Burgers and vortex merger problems at high Reynolds number. Results show that the ROM trajectory with the applied FSM control closely matches its target values in both the data-dense and data-sparse regimes.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we develop a single-phase free-surface flow model with the improved lattice kinetic scheme (LKS) and the volume of fluid (VOF) method. We implement the piecewise linear interface calculation (PLIC) algorithm to reconstruct the interface. The gas phase velocity is extrapolated from the liquid phase velocity using a velocity extension method and the signed distance function (SDF) to advect the VOF function. We calculate the SDF with the level-set reinitialisation method, and the VOF function is used as the initial profile. We discuss the advantages of the improved LKS in terms of the free-surface boundary condition by means of distribution functions, which conflict in interface cells in conventional streaming and collision processes in the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The proposed free-surface model is verified with well-known advection benchmark problems. We also simulate a static water problem and dam break flow. The proposed model accurately calculates the dam break surge front. Although the surge front position depends on the spatial resolution in the conventional LBM free-surface model, the improved LKS results are approximately the same regardless of the resolution. This is a critical difference between the proposed and conventional LBM models and represents a unique feature of the improved LKS.},

In the process of flocculating algae to harvest algae or remove harmful algae from polluted water bodies, it is necessary to simultaneously use methods other than flocculation to control algae . In view of this, an optimal control problem of a size-structured unicellular algae model is proposed. The ecological significance of the optimal control problem is to find a control strategy that minimizes the mean square error of the solution and the predetermined distribution at time T , as well as the total control cost. Using the fixed point theorem and the step method, the well-posedness of the solution is confirmed for the dimensionless model. The optimal feedback control law is derived, and its existence and uniqueness are demonstrated for the minimization problem . Ultimately, some numerical simulations are carried out.

However, data that are available in science and engineering are typically scarce, often polluted with noise and affected by measurement errors and other perturbations, which makes learning the dynamics of systems challenging. In this work, we propose to combine data-driven modeling via operator inference with the dynamic training via roll outs of neural ordinary differential equations. Operator inference with roll outs inherits interpretability, scalability, and structure preservation of traditional operator inference while leveraging the dynamic training via roll outs over multiple time steps to increase stability and robustness for learning from low-quality and noisy data. Numerical experiments with data describing shallow water waves and surface quasi-geostrophic dynamics demonstrate that operator inference with roll outs provides predictive models from training trajectories even if data are sampled sparsely in time and polluted with noise of up to 10%.},

To adapt the mesh to deformed or moving boundaries, the element connectivity is changed using coarsening, refinement, and reconnection methods. The geometric features of the complex boundaries are preserved by refining the boundary nodes and generating boundary-layered meshes. We have incorporated the proposed rezoning method into an ALE method . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a hexahedral topology modification method has been used as a rezoning method in ALE simulations. Examples show that the topology-modification mesh rezoning method can simultaneously improve the element quality and size distribution while preserving the geometric features of the boundaries.

  abstract     = {Highly accurate simulation of plasma transport is needed to drive the successful design and operation of magnetically confined fusion reactors. Unfortunately, the extreme anisotropy present in magnetized plasmas results in thin boundary layers that are expensive to resolve. This work investigates how various mesh refinement strategies might reduce that expense to allow for more efficient simulation by comparing standard variable refinement approaches that use a field quantity to an adaptive approach that uses an error estimator. It is first verified that higher order discretization only realizes the proper rate of convergence once the mesh resolves the thin boundary layer, therefore motivating the focusing of refinement on the boundary layer. For three two-dimensional test cases that contain characteristic features of tokamak magnetic fields, an exponential refinement strategy based on the magnetic flux function, which is the standard refinement approach in the field, is compared to an adaptive strategy utilizing the established Zienwiekicz and Zhu error estimator. The adaptive mesh refinement strategy consistently achieves the same accuracy using orders of magnitude less degrees of freedom than either exponential or uniform refinement. This result makes the adaptive refinement strategy more efficient than the exponential refinement strategy while also being more generalizable to problems with complex magnetic geometries. Scaling laws are derived that quantify the improvement in cost of the adaptive refinement strategy over other refinement approaches in 2D and 3D.},

The scheme is proven to be unconditionally stable and has a convergence rate of O ( Δ t 2 + Δ x 4 + Δ y 4 ) O(Δt2+Δx4+Δy4) in the discrete L 2 L2 -norm, where Δ t , Δ x and Δ y are the temporal and spatial step sizes, respectively. In addition, the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method with τ -preconditioner is applied to solve the discretized symmetric positive definite linear systems arising from 2D RSFDEs. Theoretically, we show that the τ -preconditioner is invertible by a new technique, and analyze the spectrum of the corresponding preconditioned matrix. Moreover, since the τ -preconditioner can be diagonalized by the discrete sine transform matrix, the total operation cost of the PCG method is O ( N x N y log ⁡ N x N y ) O(NxNylog⁡NxNy) , where N x Nx and N y Ny are the number of spatial unknowns in x - and y -directions.

Recently, PINNs have shown promising results in different application domains. In this paper, we approach the groundwater flow equations numerically by searching for the unknown hydraulic head. Since singular terms in differential equations are very challenging from a numerical point of view, we approximate the Dirac distribution by different regularization terms. Furthermore, from a computational point of view, this study investigate how a PINN can solve higher-dimensional flow equations. In particular, we analyze the approximation error for one and two-dimensional cases in a statistical learning framework. The numerical experiments discussed include one and two-dimensional cases of a single or multiple pumping well in an infinite aquifer, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in the hydrology application domain.

In particular, our aim is to control the time evolution of the temperature field on the boundary of the computational domain in order to achieve the prescribed shape of the crystal at the given time. To obtain efficient means of computing the gradient of the cost functional, we derive the adjoint problem formally. The gradient is then used to perform gradient descent. The viability of the proposed optimization method is supported by several numerical experiments performed in one and two spatial dimensions. Among other things, these experiments show that a reaction term with simple linear dependence on supercooling in the phase field equation proves to be insufficient in certain scenarios. An alternative reaction term is considered to improve the models behavior.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we introduce and analyze a Banach spaces-based approach yielding a fully-mixed finite element method for numerically solving the stationary chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes problem. This is a nonlinear coupled model representing the biological process given by the cell movement, driven by either an internal or an external chemical signal, within an incompressible fluid . In addition to the velocity and pressure of the fluid, the velocity gradient and the Bernouilli-type stress tensor are introduced as further unknowns, which allows to eliminate the pressure from the equations and compute it afterwards via a postprocessing formula. In turn, besides the cell density and the chemical signal concentration, the pseudostress associated with the former and the gradient of the latter are introduced as auxiliary unknowns as well. The resulting continuous formulation, posed in suitable Banach spaces , consists of a coupled system of three saddle point-type problems, each one of them perturbed with trilinear forms that depend on data and the unknowns of the other two. The well-posedness of it is analyzed by means of a fixed-point strategy, so that the classical Banach theorem , along with the Babuška-Brezzi theory in Banach spaces, allow to conclude, under a smallness assumption on the data, the existence of a unique solution . Adopting an analogue approach for the associated Galerkin scheme, and under suitable hypotheses on arbitrary finite element subspaces employed, we apply the Brouwer and Banach theorems to show existence and then uniqueness of the discrete solution. General a priori error estimates , including those for the postprocessed pressure, are also derived. Next, a specific set of finite element subspaces satisfying the required stability conditions, and yielding approximate local conservation of momentum, is introduced, which, given an integer k ≥ 0 k≥0 , is defined in terms of Raviart-Thomas spaces of order k and piecewise polynomials of degree ≤ k only. The respective rates of convergence of the resulting Galerkin method are then provided. Finally, several numerical experiments confirming the latter and illustrating the good performance of the method, are reported.},

This, in connection with the fact that the mesh should fit precisely the aforementioned structures, create substantially new problems in comparison with well worked-out engineering applications . In this paper the problem of refining the mesh of a presynaptic bouton is considered. The refinement was tested by performing simulations of nonlinear diffusion-reaction type of propagation of neurotransmitters. The results for the original and for the refined mesh were compared. The latter reflected the nature of the biological object more precisely. The benefits and the disadvantages of the proposed refinement algorithm are discussed in detail.},

  abstract     = {An enhanced moving particle semi-implicit method for simulation of incompressible fluid flow and FSI (Fluid-Structure Interaction) is developed in the present paper. Based on the recent studies on LSMPS (Least Square Moving Particle Semi-implicit) method [1] , [2] , the fluid models for FSI are improved, and the elastic structure models and fluid–structure coupling schemes are developed. Many strategies are developed to reduce the influence of mechanical vibration of elastomers on fluid calculation. The models are validated step by step. The improved fluid models with different Dirichlet and Neumann boundary are validated through hydrostatic pool problem, connecting tube problem and dam break problem. The elastic structure models under the velocity boundary and the loading boundary are validated through free oscillation cantilever problem and pressurized ring problem respectively. The fluid-structure coupling schemes are validated by the violent sloshing problem without considering the elastic deformation and the problem of dam break with an elastic gate. The results show a good performance of the developed method on the simulation of incompressible fluid flow and fluid-structure interaction.},

Then, the control equations can be converted into equivalent forms where the nonlinear terms are replaced by the scalar auxiliary variables. Finally, we only need to discretize the equivalence equation, where the second-order backward difference formula (BDF2) and the second-order central difference method are applied in the time and the spatial domain, respectively. The entire calculation process is linear and decoupled. In each time iteration , we apply a fast linear multigrid algorithm to the constant coefficient linear elliptic equation . For the incompressible flow part, we employ a pressure correction method to decouple velocity and pressure during time discretization . We rigorously prove that the numerical solution is unique and shows that the resulting numerical solution satisfies the dissipation of modified energy. The temporal second-order accuracy test, the energy dissipation test, the comparison test with the classical SAV in CPU time, and other various numerical tests show the good performance of our method.},

  abstract     = {Hydroacoustic analyses using direct methods are challenging in the field of computational physics. To date, hybrid methods are an alternative approach adopted for performing hydroacoustic analysis, although it demonstrates clear limitations in analyzing nonlinear turbulent noise. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) provides a solution to address the limitations of the hybrid method and is frequently applied in aeroacoustics. However, existing methods, such as the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) operator, suffer from instabilities that manifest in an oscillatory fashion in underwater conditions. Hydroacoustic situations are characterized by high Reynolds number ( Re ) to Mach number ( Ma ) ratios, and these conditions correspond to cases where stability problems occur. In this study, a direct-method-based two-step (DM-TS) LBM collision operator is introduced to solve the stability problem. The stability, accuracy, and consistency of the scheme are investigated and compared with the BGK-LBM. The DM-TS operator is developed to provide the same accuracy order as the BGK scheme while addressing the stability problem. Vortex shedding from a two-dimensional cylinder is simulated using the DM-TS operator to prove that the proposed method could be used to solve hydroacoustic problems. The results of the analysis indicate that dynamic and acoustic pressures can be obtained simultaneously using the DM–TS operator.},

The method relies on an aggregation algorithm, named coarsening based on compatible weighted matching , which exploits the interplay between the principle of compatible relaxation and the maximum product matching in undirected weighted graphs. The results are based on a general convergence analysis theory applied to the class of AMG methods employing unsmoothed aggregation and identifying a quality measure for the coarsening; similar quality measures were originally introduced and applied to other methods as tools to obtain good quality aggregates leading to optimal convergence for M-matrices. The analysis, as well as the coarsening procedure, is purely algebraic and, in our case, allows an a posteriori evaluation of the quality of the aggregation procedure which we apply to analyze the impact of approximate algorithms for matching computation and the definition of graph edge weights. We also explore the connection between the choice of the aggregates and the compatible relaxation convergence, confirming the consistency between theories for designing coarsening procedures in purely algebraic multigrid methods and the effectiveness of the coarsening based on compatible weighted matching. We discuss various completely automatic algorithmic approaches to obtain aggregates for which good convergence properties are achieved on various test cases.},

The present framework includes the classic MRT-LB model and central-moments-based LB model (CLBM, a particular version of the MRT-LB model). The governing equations of incompressible multiphase flows can be reproduced precisely through the direct Taylor expansion method at the second-order of expansion parameters. In this work, the pressure p is re-estimated, and we prove that the present pressure expression is suitable for classic MRT model, CLBM and various lattice structures with an accuracy of O ( Δ t 2 + Δ t M a 2 ) O(Δt2+ΔtMa2) . In addition, the model construction and analysis are all carried out in the velocity space. As a result, the present model has a similar structure to the traditional Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model. Therefore the process of their analysis and implementation is also similar. We then test the present model by five classic physical problems. The results show that the present model is found to be accurate and has better numerical stability over the BGK model, and has the ability to simulate multiphase flow problems with large density ratio (1000).},

A strategy for constructing an initial cubature rule for various polytopes in several space dimensions is described. High efficiency rules are presented for two, three and four dimensional polytopes.

  abstract     = {Traditional transform optical devices are designed from anisotropic magnetic materials which are difficult to fabricate. In this paper, we design and simulate a conformal carpet invisible cloak and bending waveguide device with isotropic material. According to the existing conformal coordinate transformation, we deduce the perfect parameters required by the conformal device. And the finite element method and error analysis of the model equation and the basic process of adaptive algorithm are given. We first simulated a carpet cloak and bending waveguide device with perfect parameters; then we used the idea of parameter segmentation to design a carpet cloak that requires 35 isotropic materials and use the idea of layering to design the conformal bending waveguide device, and relevant numerical results are presented; finally, we designed the adaptive finite element algorithm to realize the numerical simulation of Maxwell&#39;s equations in isotropic material.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a diamond scheme for heterogeneous and anisotropic diffusion problems is proposed on unstructured polyhedral meshes through a certain linearity-preserving approach. This scheme has both cell-centered primary unknowns and cell-vertex auxiliary unknowns. The main feature of our new scheme is that auxiliary unknowns are expressed as linear combinations with the surrounding cell-centered unknowns by the least square technique combined with the graph search algorithm to handle arbitrary discontinuities. The search algorithm is local, and for the problem with a continuous diffusion coefficient , the resulting vertex interpolation algorithm naturally degenerates to the classical least squares interpolation algorithm. Our second-order 3D interpolation formula is simple and allows for an arbitrary diffusion tensor and arbitrary grid topology . Numerical experiments confirm that our extended Least Square Weight (eLSW) is robust and linearity-preserving for the heterogeneous (possibly discontinuous) diffusion tensor on general unstructured grids , as expected. Moreover, our linearity-preserving diamond scheme achieves nearly optimal accuracy for all test cases.},

By introducing the residual-based stabilization technique to establish a stabilized Nitsche-type EFG weak form, the proposed stabilized EFG method not only allows equal-order approximation spaces for velocity and pressure, but also applies to the generalized Stokes problem with small viscosity and large reaction coefficient.

Compared with the traditional NMM using finite elements to form the MC, the cutting operations in generating the physical cover are unnecessary and the computation complexity is decreased significantly. Based on the Galerkin method, the discrete form of 3D heat conduction is derived.

  abstract     = {We propose a space and time adaptive framework for a partially explicit splitting scheme of flow problems in multiscale media. We consider the parabolic equation with high-contrast multiscale coefficients. It is known that sufficient number of multiscale basis are needed to capture non-local features and information across all scales. Moreover, the time step size in an explicit discretization of the problem is affected by the magnitude of the coefficient. To improve computational efficiency, in this work, we introduce an adaptive algorithm to refine temporal size and enrich multiscale spaces. We first utilize a stable temporal splitting scheme with an appropriate construction of multiscale spaces to ensure that the time step size is independent of the contrast. The multiscale subspaces are then constructed to handle the fast-flow and slow-flow parts separately, and implicit and explicit discretization is adopted for the degrees of freedom with respect to the two multiscale subspaces, respectively. A multirate time stepping is introduced for the two parts considering that the flow rates vary significantly in different regions due to the high-contrast features of the multiscale coefficients. We derive both temporal and spatial error estimators to identify local regions for two components of the solutions. Start with coarser time step sizes and a few important multiscale basis functions in each subspace, we can adaptively refine time stepping and add additional basis with constraint energy minimizing properties based on the derived error indicators. The stability and convergence of the method are studied, and several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

To date, the number of coordinate components of all VCSs equals the number of faces of polyhedral elements (e.g. 4-component tetrahedral VCS or 6-component hexahedral VCS). To break the current situation, a 3-component VCS is established systematically based on hexahedron. The definition of the new 3-component VCS is still suitable for these degenerated solids from hexahedron, including tetrahedron and several 5-surface solids. In the proposed VCS, the number of coordinate components is unrelated to the number of faces of polyhedron . It is the very first shape-independent VCS in the history of FEM. The new 3-component VCS has both the superiorities of the local natural coordinate system and the simplicities of the Cartesian coordinate system . Based on the presented 3-component VCS, we construct a new incompatible eight-node hexahedral element, which is characterized by the high accuracy and the insensitivity to mesh distortion . This adequately demonstrates that the proposed 3-component VCS is a powerful tool for developing high-performance elements.},

  abstract     = {This study analyses an approach to consistently recover the second-order convergence of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which is frequently degraded by an improper discretisation of the required source terms. The current work focuses on advection-diffusion models, in which the source terms are dependent on the intensity of transported fields. Such terms can be observed in reaction-type equations used in heat and mass transfer problems or multiphase flows. The investigated scheme is applicable to a wide range of formulations within the LBM framework. All considered source terms are interpreted as contributions to the zeroth-moment of the distribution function. These account for sources in a scalar field, such as density, concentration, temperature or a phase field. Further application of this work can be found in the method of manufactured solutions or in the immersed boundary method. This paper is dedicated to three aspects regarding proper inclusion of the source term in LBM schemes. Firstly, it identifies the differences observed between the ways in which source terms are included in the LBM schemes present in the literature. The algebraic manipulations are explicitly presented in this paper to clarify the observed differences, and to identify their origin. Secondly, it analyses in full detail, the implicit relation between the value of the transported macroscopic field, and the sum of the LBM densities. This relation is valid for any source term discretization scheme. It is a crucial ingredient for preserving the second-order convergence in the case of complex source terms. Moreover, three equivalent forms of the second-order accurate collision operator are presented. Finally, closed form solutions of this implicit relation are shown for a variety of common models, including general linear and second order terms; population growth models, such as the Logistic or Gompertz model and the Allen-Cahn equation. The second-order convergence of the proposed LBM schemes is verified on both linear and non-linear source terms. The pitfalls of the commonly used acoustic and diffusive scalings are identified and discussed. Furthermore, for a simplified case, the competing errors are shown visually with isolines of error in the space of spatial and temporal resolutions.},

Isotropic heat flow field and viscous dissipation effects are introduced in the modelling as well. The vertical walls of the domain are subjected to finite temperature gradient while the horizontal walls are thermally insulated. The control equations subject to the flow physics of an incompressible, viscous and electrically conducting fluid are the Navier-Stokes equations along with energy equation. These governing equations are solved numerically by proposing a fourth order compact scheme. The influences of diverse effective parameters including Hartmann number, viscous dissipation parameter (Eckert number) and heat generation or absorption parameter on characteristic features of heat transfer and fluid flow with different concentration distributions of nanoparticles are analyzed and addressed in detail. Results show that the presence of viscous dissipation retards the thermal diffusion process. The average Nusselt number values are decreased with the increasing values of Eckert number. In addition, with the increasing values of Hartmann number, the thermal transport is decreased in spite of incorporation of isotropic heat flow.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose and analyse an augmented mixed finite element method for solving the Navier–Stokes equations describing the motion of incompressible fluid . The model is written in terms of velocity, vorticity, and pressure, and takes into account non-constant viscosity and no-slip boundary conditions. The weak formulation of the method includes least-squares terms that arise from the constitutive equation and the incompressibility condition. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of using augmentation in detail. Additionally, we use fixed–point strategies to show the existence and uniqueness of continuous and discrete solutions under the assumption of sufficiently small data. The method is constructed using any compatible finite element pair for velocity and pressure, as dictated by Stokes inf-sup stability, while for vorticity, any generic discrete space of arbitrary order can be used. We establish optimal a priori error estimates and provide a set of numerical tests in 2D and 3D to illustrate the behaviour of the discretisations and verify their theoretical convergence rates. Overall, this method provides an efficient and accurate solution for simulating fluid flow in a wide range of scenarios.},

Indeed, even if the latter are indisputably useful in many research fields, they can be computationally expensive most of all in a real-time and many-query setting. Thus, our main goal is to provide a physics informed learning paradigm to simulate parametrized phenomena in a small amount of time. The physics information will be exploited in many ways, in the loss function (standard physics informed neural networks), as an augmented input (extra feature employment) and as a guideline to build an effective structure for the neural network (physics informed architecture). These three aspects, combined together, will lead to a faster training phase and to a more accurate parametric prediction. The methodology has been tested for several equations and also in an optimal control framework.},

In particular, the discrete problem is obtained by employing finite difference or finite element methods to approximate the fractional derivatives of order α with α ∈ ( 1 , 2 ] α∈(1,2] . The proposed preconditioner is then defined as a rational approximation of the Riesz operator expressed as the integral of the standard heat diffusion semigroup. We show that, being the sum of k inverses of shifted Laplacian matrices, the resulting preconditioner belongs to the generalized locally Toeplitz class. As a consequence, we are able to provide the asymptotic description of the spectrum of the preconditioned matrices and we show that, despite the lack of clustering just as for the Laplacian, our preconditioner for α close to 1 and k ≠ 1 k≠1 reasonably small, provides better results than the Laplacian itself, while sharing the same computational complexity.},

The spectral geometry method is utilized to represent the displacement variable for FGM shell and annular plate structures in the uniform form, which overcomes the discontinuity or jump phenomenon at the boundary. To simulate the boundary conditions and coupling connection relationship between the FGM plate and shell substructures, the artificial virtual spring technique is implemented by adjusting the stiffness values of linear or rotational springs. Based on the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure, the unified dynamic equations of the FGM double layered cylindrical/conical/spherical shell and annular plate coupled structures are derived. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the convergence of the proposed model, and the accuracy and correctness of the proposed analytical model are verified by comparing the results with the vibration results obtained by the finite element method . Furthermore, parametric analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of material parameters, geometric parameters , and position parameters on the inherent characteristics and steady-state response of the FGM double layered coupled structure under various boundary conditions.

The fluid dynamics is depicted by a one-velocity hyperbolic system with relaxation terms toward the thermodynamical equilibrium of the mixture. The core of the paper is the comparison and the analysis of two possible choices of relaxation terms, accounting for a detailed analysis of mixture entropy and the associated thermodynamical equilibrium. As numerics are concerned, a fractional step approach is proposed, based on a finite volume approximation of the convective part.

The governing equations for this boundary-layer flow problem are derived using Buongiorno&#39;s and a nonlinear thermal radiation model. Next, similarity transformations are introduced to reduce the governing equations into coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) subjected to asymptotic infinity boundary conditions. By incorporating physics constraints into the neural networks, we employ the proposed deep learning model to solve the coupled ODEs. The imposition of infinity boundary conditions is carried out by adding an inequality constraint to the loss function, with infinity added to the hyper-parameters of the neural network, which is updated dynamically in the optimization process. The effects of various dimensionless parameters on three profiles (velocity, temperature, concentration) are investigated. Finally, we demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the adaptive DCM with transfer learning through several numerical examples, which can be the promising surrogate model to solve boundary layer problems.},

That is, we aim at computing the velocity at which a forced heat source melts through a phase-change material. The driving application for this work consists in melting cryobots, namely research probes for ice drilling. Existing approaches found in the literature consider a thermo-mechanical equilibrium in the contact melt film, which results in a constant melting velocity of the heat source. This classical approach, however, cannot account for transient effects in which the melting velocity adjusts itself to equilibrium conditions . With our contribution, we derive a model for the transient melting process of a planar heat source. We iteratively cycle between solving for the heat equation in the solid material and updating the melting velocity. The latter is computed based on the heat flux in the vicinity of the heat source. The motion of the heated body is simulated via the moving mesh strategy referred to as the Virtual Region Shear-Slip Mesh Update Method, which avoids remeshing and is particularly efficient in representing unidirectional movement. We show numerical examples to validate our methodology and present two application scenarios, a 2D planar thermal melting probe and a 2D hot-wire cutting machine .},

The one-sided curved and two-sided straight triangle in the universal coordinate system ( x , y ) (x,y) is mapped onto an isosceles triangle ( ξ , η ) ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] (ξ,η)∈[0,1] and ξ + η ≤ 1 ξ+η≤1 in the ( ξ , η ξ,η )-coordinate system by using an isoparametric coordinate transformation. Using such a transformation, the curved edge of the triangular element is altered implicitly by a newly defined octic curve . Such an octic curve is obtained by using the topology of the curved edge. With an apparent condition of arc being a parabola, a new transformation is developed to find a unique curve for each edge that passes through the points on the original curved arc. Overall, the new sub-parametric transformations are developed, these include the transformation for the curved edge on the original boundary, in addition to the parameters from the curved triangle&#39;s interior. Several numerical experiments are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed method.

By introducing a novel map of finite volume method, we propose a family of cubic finite volume method schemes with four independent map coefficients. It is detailedly proved that the proposed finite volume method schemes is exactly equivalent to the existing traditional finite volume method schemes of the same boundary value problems . A geometric constraint requirement on the triangular meshes of primary partitions is imposed to guarantee the uniform ellipticity of discrete elliptic bilinear forms resulted from the proposed schemes. The geometric requirements of the primary partitions could be greatly attenuated when the map coefficients are appropriately designed. Once the uniform ellipticity of the discrete elliptic bilinear forms is established, the proposed schemes have the unique solvability , and the optimal H 1 H1 -norm error estimates without any restriction on dual elements of dual partitions of the finite volume methods , which is consistent with the results of literatures. With the help of the introduced map, the proposed schemes have the optimal L 2 L2 -norm error estimates with a mesh restriction for the dual elements of their dual partitions significantly weaker than the existing theoretical results, in which the Aubin-Nitsche duality argument and the orthogonal conditions based on the dual partitions are employed. Finally, we validate our theoretical results by numerical experiments.},

The PENN is constructed to solve a minimum problem which is obtained from the Prager and Syge equality. Then the output of the PENN can be used to estimate the posteriori error of the finite element approximate solution . There are two-fold differences compared to the classic methods. Firstly, the PENN provides a mesh-free recovery type error estimator . A flux is constructed by a neural network which does not need any given mesh. Secondly, once finishing the training procedure for an given approximate solution, the PENN can be used to estimate posteriori error for other approximate solution without training the PENN again. This feature is useful when we just use the posteriori error distribution as the indicator for adaptive refinement. The effectiveness of the PENN is demonstrated through a set of classical numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {The Cahn–Hilliard (CH) equation is a classical mathematical equation which models the spinodal decomposition in binary fluid mixtures. In the real world, the phase change in a two-phase system usually occurs in irregular domains. To efficiently and accurately simulate this dynamics, we herein develop linear temporally first- and second-order accurate methods for the CH equation in arbitrary domains. The implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge–Kutta method is adopted to construct discrete schemes in time. By introducing a simple boundary control function , we transform the original equations into equivalent forms in irregular domains and discretize the space by using the standard second-order finite difference stencil. In each temporal step, the proposed numerical schemes are highly efficient and easy to implement because we only need to solve several linear elliptic type equations. The mass conservation and unconditional energy stability of the proposed schemes are analytically proved. The multigrid algorithm is adopted for fast computation. The numerical results confirm the desired accuracy in time and space, mass conservation, and energy dissipation property. Moreover, the extensive calculations in two- and three-dimensional spaces indicate that the proposed method has good capability to simulate spinodal decomposition in arbitrarily irregular domains.},

A novel reduced-order modeling method is proposed for nonlinear buckling analysis of the stringer stiffened cylinder subjected to an axially compressive load and initial temperature field. The reduced-order model is constructed based on the improved Koiter perturbation theory and the smeared stiffener method. The axially compressive load, initial temperature field and perturbation loads are converted to be the degrees of freedom in the smeared stiffener based reduced-order model. The thermoelastic geometrically nonlinear response of the stringer stiffened cylinder can be obtained using the proposed method accurately and efficiently. Optimization problems are designed to achieve the optimal stiffening configuration for minimum weight and maximum buckling load, where the solutions of reduced-order models are selected as inputs. Stringer stiffened cylinders with various ratios of radius to thickness and length to radius are considered to illustrate the good performance of the proposed method. Compared to the fully nonlinear analysis based on the classical finite element method , the proposed method can achieve the nonlinear buckling load of the stringer stiffened cylinder much more efficiently and realize the optimization of the stiffening configuration at an affordable computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Neural closure models have recently been proposed as a method for efficiently approximating small scales in multiscale systems with neural networks. The choice of loss function and associated training procedure has a large effect on the accuracy and stability of the resulting neural closure model. In this work, we systematically compare three distinct procedures: “derivative fitting”, “trajectory fitting” with discretise-then-optimise, and “trajectory fitting” with optimise-then-discretise. Derivative fitting is conceptually the simplest and computationally the most efficient approach and is found to perform reasonably well on one of the test problems (Kuramoto-Sivashinsky) but poorly on the other (Burgers). Trajectory fitting is computationally more expensive but is more robust and is therefore the preferred approach. Of the two trajectory fitting procedures, the discretise-then-optimise approach produces more accurate models than the optimise-then-discretise approach. While the optimise-then-discretise approach can still produce accurate models, care must be taken in choosing the length of the trajectories used for training, in order to train the models on long-term behaviour while still producing reasonably accurate gradients during training. Two existing theorems are interpreted in a novel way that gives insight into the long-term accuracy of a neural closure model based on how accurate it is in the short term.},

Through a series of validation studies, the accuracy and reliability of the proposed coupled model are ensured. The ferrofluid droplet is subjected to the effects of non-uniform magnetic field and gravity. The influences of various magnetic Bond numbers ( Bo m Bom ) and gravitational Bond numbers ( Bo ) on the wetting dynamics of a ferrofluid droplet on a hydrophobic surface are discussed, and the mechanism behind the morphological evolution of the ferrofluid droplet is unveiled. The results show that the curvature of the phase interface is a key factor influencing both the magnetic field intensity distribution around the phase interface and the pressure distribution inside the ferrofluid droplet, thus changing the evolution of the droplet morphology. The variation of Bo m Bom has a monotonic impact on the morphological evolution of the ferrofluid droplet and its equilibrium state, while the effect of the Bo depends on the magnitude of Bo m Bom . At Bo m = 49.98 Bom=49.98 and Bo = 4.1 Bo=4.1 , the ferrofluid droplet splits from the central position and into three parts in the end. The amplitude and duration time of the oscillation of the ferrofluid droplet increase with Bo m Bom .

The numerical computations are carried out applying the dynamic subscales approach of the Algebraic Sub-Grid multi-Scale (ASGS) stabilized finite element method upto a sufficiently high Reynolds number , Re =10000. The flow patterns, which include the generation of the primary and secondary vortices, are highly impacted by the Re values, the structures of the domains and the directions in which the parallel walls are moving. We have observed the appearances of both the symmetric and stable as well as unstable asymmetric types of primary vortices in the domains of aspect ratios ≤ 1, with walls moving in the same direction. On the other hand, we notice the existence of multiple phases of the solutions for the Casson fluid flowing in the rectangular domains of aspect ratio &gt; 1, with walls moving in the opposite direction. Besides, the evolution of the solutions with time are also carried out here. In most of the cases, the solutions achieve the steady state after a certain point of time, except for a particular type of domain, where the fluid flow solutions show time dependent behavior after reaching a critical value of Re . This paper has reported the ranges, where the critical Reynolds number ( R e c Rec ) lies, indicating the appearance of the first Hopf bifurcation for the fluid flow problem .},

The Fredholm integral equation is then solved using the Nyström method, which involves the use of a particular quadrature rule, thus, converting the BIE problem to a linear system . We demonstrate this concept on the 2D Laplace problem over domains with smooth boundary as well as domains containing corners. We validate our approach on benchmark examples and the results indicate that, for a fixed number of quadrature points (i.e., the same computational effort), the spline Gauss quadratures return an approximation that is by one to two orders of magnitude more accurate compared to the solution obtained by traditional polynomial Gauss counterparts.},

We propose a Density-extrapolation Global Variance Reduction (DeGVR) method for the large-scale radiation field calculation. After reducing the density of all materials to avoid the deep penetration problem, two global flux distributions of the two different material densities are obtained with two fixed-source calculations, and then the global flux distribution of the original material density is obtained by extrapolating the two global flux distributions. The global flux distribution of the original material density is then used for global variance reduction. In a large-scale model with a flux attenuation of 10 80 , the DeGVR method only takes 40.3 minutes to build the radiation field, improves the Average Figure-of-Merit (AV.FOM) up to 85652 times and the counting rate per time (CRPT) up to 88107 times compared with the standard Monte Carlo method. In addition to the high efficiency, the DeGVR method has high universality and robustness because it constructs the global information in a clever way that does not rely on the complex mathematical derivation and geometric modeling. The DeGVR method shows excellent application potential in large-scale radiation analysis.},

  abstract     = {Based on the existing improved phase-field model for polymer crystallization, the spherulitic morphologies are numerically simulated. The model consists of a second-order phase field equation and a two-dimensional heat conduction equation for coupled flow field. Our strategy is to use the finite difference method (FDM) for discretization of the phase field equation, finite volume method (FVM) for solving the energy equation, and lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for simulation of melt flow, respectively. The shape level set function(LS) is adopted to represent the crystal interface at each moment with certain boundary conditions imposed on the solution region. In simple and complex cavities, the growth of single and multiple spherulites is simulated with different temperature boundary conditions and different flow fields, respectively. The numerical results illustrate that the growth morphologies of the crystals vary with the temperature boundaries. When the boundary temperature is greater than or near melting point Tm , the growth of crystals at the boundary is inhibited. When the boundary temperature is lower, the crystals at the boundary grow more tightly, and eventually forming a crystal wall. The lower the boundary temperature, the thicker the crystal wall is. In addition, the flow velocity has an important influence on the crystal morphologies, and the crystal grows fast towards the upstream direction. However, with the increase of crystallization time, the phenomenon of asymmetric growth becomes not obvious.},

  abstract     = {The main result of the work is the generalization of the concept of the variational splitting from [3] to the higher-order generalized- α schemes proposed in [5] in the context of hyperbolic and elastic wave propagation problems. It is possible to factorize the matrix of the linear system of equations (M+ηK) in the linear computational cost. Here M is the mass matrix , and K is the stiffness matrix . We discretize using the isogeometric finite element method . Following the idea proposed in [3] , factorizing the matrix (M+ηK) , we obtained an additional error of the order of η2 . This paper introduces a technique to couple the possibility of fast factorization of (M+ηK) with higher-order generalized- α schemes proposed in [5] for hyperbolic and elastic wave propagation problems. Thus, we introduce a variationally separable splitting technique for the high-order accuracy generalized- α method. We use tensor-product meshes to develop the splitting method, which results in the linear cost for multi-dimensional problems. We consider standard C0 finite elements as well as smoother isogeometric analysis for spatial discretization . The direction splitting method requires the mass and the stiffness matrices to have the Kronecker product structure. For other problems, the corresponding Kronecker product solver can be employed as a preconditioner as long as a Kronecker product can sufficiently well approximate the problem matrix. We also study the spectrum of the amplification matrix to establish the unconditional stability of the method. We use various examples to demonstrate the performance of the method and the optimal approximation accuracy. In numerical tests, we compute the L2 and H1 norms to show the optimal convergence of the discrete method in space and high-order accuracy in time.},

  abstract     = {Development of a numerical tool based upon the high-order, high-resolution Galerkin finite element method (FEM) often encounters two challenges: First, the Galerkin FEMs give central approximations to the differential operators and their use in the simulation of the convection-dominated flows may lead to the dispersion errors yielding entirely wrong numerical solutions. Secondly, high-order, high-resolution numerical methods are known to produce high wave-number oscillations in the vicinity of shocks/discontinuities in the numerical solution adversely affecting the stability of the method. We present the stabilized finite element method for plasma fluid models to address the two challenges. The numerical stabilization is based on two strategies: Variational Multiscale (VMS) and the shock-capturing approach. The former strategy takes into account (the approximation of) the effect of the unresolved scales onto resolved scales to introduce upwinding in the Galerkin FEM. The latter adaptively adds the artificial viscosity only in the vicinity of shocks. These numerical stabilization strategies are applied to stabilize the bi-cubic Hermite Bézier FEM in the computational framework of the nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code JOREK. The application of the stabilized FEM to the challenging simulation of Shattered Pellet Injection (SPI) in JET-like plasma is presented. It is shown that the developed numerical stabilization model improves the stability of the underlying numerical algorithm and the computational cost required to reveal the complex physics is reduced. The physical and numerical models presented can be used to perform expensive simulations of the plasma applications in large computational domains such as JET, and ITER.},

The problem domain is a priori partitioned into a set of disjoint subdomains, which are subsequently discretized using frameworks typical for the finite element method or the meshless finite difference method. The constraints problem, based on the least square approach, is established whose solution yields combinations of degrees of freedom in subdomains that determine the global approximation field, continuous in the entire domain. The constraints problem has the matrix-type form and requires solving the strongly singular system of equations. The appropriate technique is presented to find the complete solution in the form of a hyperplane in the space of degrees of freedom. The same method is applied to enforce the boundary conditions in the meshless subdomains. The proposed approach is illustrated with several 2D examples, including the standard Poisson&#39;s problem and selected elasticity and thermo-elasticity problems. In each case, it is shown that the novel method of coupling FEM and MFDM is effective since it provides an accurate and continuous solution in the entire domain.},

The mechanical model of the rotor-blade system and the theoretical and numerical PGHW are introduced. The trigonometric functions contained in M ( t ) , C ( t ) , K ( t ) M(t),C(t),K(t) can be transformed into exponential functions according to the Euler formula, and then these time-varying elements can result in a frequency shift. The equation of motion of the rotor-blade system with a periodic time-varying form derived using Lagrangian dynamics can be transformed into a series of algebraic equations by using the wavelet-Galerkin method.

The proposed method is based on the improved backward substitute method (IBSM) in conjunction with the finite difference technique. For temporal derivative, the finite difference technique and for spatial derivatives , the IBSM are utilized to discretize the equation. The newly developed method is an RBF-based meshless approach, whose solution is constructed by the primary approximation and a series of basis functions. The primary approximation is given to satisfy boundary conditions. Each basis function is the sum of radial basis functions and a specific correcting function. Seven different types of numerical experiments are analyzed to validate the efficiency and wide applicability for multidimensional VO-TF-ADREs.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, two novel conservative relaxation methods are developed for the space-fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The first type of relaxation scheme adopts the exponential time difference method in time, the scheme can preserve the energy conservation of the space-fractional nonlinear Schrödinger. Furthermore, although the proposed scheme does not preserve the mass conservation, we can also prove that it can conserve the mass boundedness of the space-fractional nonlinear Schrödinger for the case β &gt; 0 β&amp;gt;0 , which may be helpful for the analysis of unconditional convergence of the energy conservative scheme. The second type of relaxation scheme adopts the integral factor method in time, this scheme can be proved to inherit the mass conservation of space-fractional nonlinear Schrödinger. All these two schemes are linearly implicit, and thus can avoid costly nonlinear computations. Numerical experiments show that both of the proposed schemes are remarkable efficiency and have good stability comparing with the original relaxation scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an efficient p-adaptive numerical algorithm is proposed for solving two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) binary fluid surfactant phase field models. The equation is a coupled system of a fourth-order nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard equation and a second-order nonlinear diffusion equation. There are three new ideas about algorithm design. Firstly, the high-dimensional equation is split into an array of one-dimensional sub-problems that could be solved via parallel processes. Secondly, global stability is constructed by guaranteeing the local stability of the sub-problems, and the one-dimensional problems are solved by a stabilized semi-implicit scheme with the fourth-order compact difference discretization. Finally, with the extrapolation method for convergence order improvement, a temporal p-adaptive strategy, which dynamically selects the order of extrapolation according to the speed of energy change, is developed to ensure efficiency and high precision. Besides that, the proposed numerical algorithm gratifies the discrete mass conservation properties and can be easily programmed. Via numerical testing, it has good convergence performance and computational stability. Numerical simulations including the surfactant absorption and coarsening dynamics verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

The solutions of these problems exhibit interior layers due to the discontinuity in the convection and source terms. In this article, a numerical approach is proposed by using a hybrid-difference technique (a suitable combination of the midpoint upwind technique in the smooth regions and the central difference technique in the layer regions) on a propitious layer-adaptive piecewise-uniform Shishkin mesh which leads to an almost second-order estimate.

Unfortunately, there is a shortcoming that post-processing operator cannot be proposed due to the complication of the composite interpolation. In this manuscript, we provide two simple interpolations, i.e., the vertices-edges-element interpolation and the Lagrange interpolation based on Gauß-Lobatto points, which are both superclose to the numerical solution. Moreover, based on the supercloseness result of the Lagrange interpolation, a post-processing operator is proposed according to the structure of the Bakhvalov-type mesh. For this operator, we present a new analysis and a special anisotropic interpolation bound to yield its stability and approximation properties. We also prove that the post-processing operator can be exploited to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution.},

The VEM is very flexible in handling general polygon elements and can treat hanging nodes as polygon vertices without additional processing. Besides, to effectively simulate the phase separation behavior of strong segregation systems, we present an adaptive method on polygonal mesh equipped with a new Log marking strategy. Compared with the traditional strategies, the Log marking strategy not only marks the elements that need to be refined or coarsened, but also indicates the times of adaptation, which makes full use of the information contained in the numerical results. Using the halfedge data structure, we can apply the adaptive method to the arbitrary polygonal mesh. Numerical results demonstrate that the developed method is efficient in simulating the phase behavior of block polymers on complex geometric domains. The adaptive method can greatly reduce the computational cost to obtain prescribed numerical accuracy for strong segregation systems.},

The major mathematical difficulty of this system lies in the indefinite leading order contributed by the Beavers-Joseph condition to the total energy. The remedy is to introduce a proper re-scaling factor for the coupled system and transfer the original problem into a new space for discussion. An a priori estimate as well as the existence and local uniqueness are established under suitable assumptions of physical parameters (such as exchange coefficient α , the fluid density ρ ) and the large sufficient fluid viscosity ν . Error estimates and convergence of the coupled finite element approximation are obtained.

Some new a priori estimates are derived for the semidiscrete solution, which helps to prove the convergence result. Then, based on the Stolz-Cesaro theorem, a priori bounds for the second-order backward difference scheme are derived, which are valid uniformly in time as t N → ∞ tN→∞ and uniformly in the dispersion coefficient μ as μ → 0 μ→0 . For the discrete problem at each time step, it is shown using one variant of Brouwer&#39;s fixed point theorem that, there exists a discrete solution and uniqueness follows in a standard way. Moreover, existence of a discrete global attractor is established. Optimal error estimates in ℓ ∞ ( L 2 ) ℓ∞(L2) and ℓ ∞ ( H 0 1 ) ℓ∞(H01) -norms are obtained, whose bounds may depend exponentially on time. Subsequently, error bounds are established, which are valid uniformly in time under uniqueness conditions. Additionally, it is shown that as μ → 0 μ→0 , the completely discrete solution of the 2D Sobolev equation converges to the corresponding discrete solution of the Burgers&#39; equation.

Equations of this type are also commonly called fractional evolution equations, whose solutions have some singular behaviours near the initial time . This makes that it&#39;s difficult to reach an expected convergence result for the numerical treatment concerning time variable on uniform meshes. In the temporal direction, a generalized Crank-Nicolson difference scheme and the product integration formula on graded meshes are used to discretize the differential term and the integral term, respectively. Moreover, it&#39;s proved that the time discrete scheme is unconditionally stable and quadratically convergent. Further, a fully discrete numerical approach is structured with spacial directional discretization in terms of barycentric rational interpolation. The results of numerical experiments display the efficiency of the method and confirm the theoretical analyses. In addition, the present scheme can reach second-order convergence in time both for smooth initial value and non-smooth initial value .},

  abstract     = {In this study, we introduce a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) algorithm. The proposed architecture is employed to solve the inverse Cauchy problems of the Laplace equation . Our neural network-based algorithm is a kind of meshless method that does not encounter the dense or ill-condition matrix. Despite traditional methods, there is no need to apply any regularization technique, most of which reduce the accuracy of the results. In addition, it is important to note that RBFNN can be directly applied to the inverse problems without known fundamental solutions used in some meshless methods. In this work, we investigate theoretically and numerically the convergence of the proposed RBFNN to an analytic solution in a suitable function space for the Cauchy problems. We conduct numerical experiments to validate the robustness of our neural network architecture for the Cauchy problems in various domains. Moreover, to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, we make a comparison with the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a new scheme based on neural networks strategies.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the dual hybrid influences of both discrete spatial diffusions and discrete time in a stochastic inertial neural network via first order exponential Euler difference and second order central finite difference. Based on a non-decomposed constant variation formula, global existence, global mean square boundedness and stability are addressed to the discrete space and time stochastic inertial neural networks. In particular, the optimal exponential convergence rate is discussed by solving nonlinear optimization problem under nonlinear constraints. Further, an implementable computer algorithm is given to calculate the optimal exponential convergence rate. Finally, random periodic solution to the discrete space and time stochastic inertial neural networks is researched by the theories of semi-flow and metric dynamical system and two numerical examples are given to illustrate the feasibility of the derived main results. The research findings show that the spatial diffusions with nonnegative smaller intensive coefficients have no influence on global mean square boundedness and stability, random periodicity of the networks under some suitable assumptions. Meanwhile, the results tell us the bigger strength of the neurons can better ensure global mean square boundedness and stability, random periodicity of the networks. This discussion is pioneering in considering discrete spatial diffusions and offers a studying base for future researches.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this work is to improve an appropriate generalized thermoelastic heat transport framework. In the proposed model, the mathematical heat transfer equation is characterized by the fourth-order Moore-Gibson-Thompson (MGT) equation. Construction of the system equation in Green-Naghdi type III model involves the addition of the phase lag delay coefficient up to the second degree. This proposed model is advantageous because it is compatible with observable physical processes and allows speed reduction as heat waves travel within the solid. The presented model can also be used to derive a number of alternative models of thermoelasticity as special cases. The Hall current influence is considered to analyze the magneto-thermoelastic couplings in an infinite conducting viscoelastic medium with a cylindrical cavity under a strong magnetic field propagating along the cavity axis. It is assumed that the viscoelastic material of the medium is Kelvin-Voigt type. Also, in contrast to many cases where the thermal conductivity factor remains unchanged, it is considered that this coefficient varies with changes in temperature. To solve the system of equations, the Laplace transform methodology is used. The studied fields are shown schematically, and the implications of viscosity and thermal fluctuation are explained. Moreover, tabular representations of numerical data are provided, and the suggested model is validated via comparison with the existing frameworks.},

  abstract     = {In eddy current (EC) testing applications, ECs σ E σE ( E : electric field, σ : conductivity) are induced in tested metal parts by a low-frequency (LF) source idealized as a closed current loop in air. In the case of highly conducting (HC) parts, a boundary integral equation (BIE) of the first kind under the magneto-quasi-static approximation - which neglects the displacement current - was shown in a previous work to coincide with the leading order of an asymptotic expansion of the Maxwell BIE in a small parameter reflecting both LF and HC assumptions. The main goal of this work is to generalize the latter approach by establishing a unified asymptotic framework that is applicable to configurations that may involve multiple moderately-conducting ( σ = O ( 1 ) σ=O(1) ) and non-conducting objects in addition to (possibly multiply-connected) HC objects. Leading-order approximations of the quantities relevant to EC testing, in particular the impedance variation, are then found to be computable from a reduced set of primary unknowns (three on HC objects and two on other objects, instead of four per object for the Maxwell problem). Moreover, when applied to the Maxwell BIE, the scalings suggested by the asymptotic approach stabilize the condition number at low frequencies and remove the low-frequency breakdown effect. The established asymptotic properties are confirmed on 3D numerical examples for simple geometries as well as two EC testing configurations, namely a classical benchmark and a steam generator tube featured in pressurized water reactors of nuclear power plants.},

In particular, methods based on the moving mesh PDE (MMPDE) methods are a class of adaptive mesh refinement methods which generate meshes as the minimizer to meshing functionals which prescribe what a desirable mesh will be for a particular context. Recent work in this area has improved the computational efficacy of these methods, with one focus in particular being the development of parallel methods. We introduce a novel optimization-based approach for variational mesh adaptation based on recent practical MMPDE methods, combined with recent techniques for quickly solving large-scale non-linear constraint problems in parallel. We call this method MM-ADMM. The resulting method resembles meshing algorithms based on the spring analogy while producing high-quality adaptive meshes using more principled variational models. We demonstrate the advantages of our method over standard MMPDE methods for generating two and three-dimensional meshes parallel.},

A vertex-centered finite volume method is constructed with both cell-centered and edge-midpoint of each control volume . We then propose a mesh adaptation procedure based on energy-norm error-estimates, which significantly increases the efficiency of the method. The proposed approach is accurate in capturing the details of the scattered and diffracted waves with highly refined elements following the evolution of the wave patterns. This is a critical feature of the approach as waves can propagate in vast domains and we successfully refine the mesh only where needed. Unlike many other methods for evolution problems in which the differential operator is solved after each error estimation , the proposed approach allows for multiple adaptations of meshes within a single error estimation. This nested adaptive finite volume method requires only treatment of conformity in meshes for multiple adaptations which is dealt with using a Newest-Vertex-Bisection algorithm. Comparisons with the finite element and with reference solutions are considered for progressive radial waves, waves reflection and a wave scattering and diffraction around barriers. The proposed approach results are more efficient and highly accurate, hence, the significant potential when applied to the time-domain simulation of wave problems.},

An implicit Runge-Kutta-standard/shifted Grünwald difference scheme for RSFADEs is introduced, and its stability and convergence are also studied. In the one-dimensional case, the coefficient matrix of the discretized linear system is the sum of an identity matrix , a Toeplitz matrix and a square of Toeplitz matrix . We construct a class of Toeplitz times Toeplitz splitting (TTTS) iteration methods to solve the corresponding linear systems. We prove that it converges uniformly to the exact solution without imposing any additional condition, and the optimal parameters for the TTTS iteration method are given. Meanwhile, we design an induced sine transform based preconditioner for two-dimensional problems to accelerate the convergence rate of the conjugate gradient method . Theoretically, we prove that the spectra of the preconditioned matrices of the proposed methods are clustering around 1.

The entropy stable Riemann solver involves three key ingredients: entropy variable, entropy conservative flux and entropy dissipation. Based on the derivation of wave strengths within entropy dissipation, the reasonable domination of the logarithmic pressure diffusion jump on entropy wave is conducive to shock stability. Thus, the basic idea of this approach is to introduce the additional logarithmic pressure diffusion term . The heuristic logarithmic pressure sensor with tanh function is constructed to detect shock discontinuities and activate this logarithmic diffusion term. In addition, the nonlinear eigenvalues are slightly modified by the neighboring cell values. Then, numerical test cases demonstrate its high shock robustness and shear layer resolution with attractive application to supersonic and hypersonic flows.},

Subsequently, for the first application, the proposed CSPH-SFCD coupled with up-wind (UW) scheme (CSPH-SFCD-UW) is tentatively extended to investigate the nonlinear shock-wave phenomena in 2D space-fractional Burgers&#39; problem (SFBP) with fractional Neumann boundary at high Reynolds number . The proposed mesh-free scheme for time-dependent SFCD/SFBP with fractional boundary is mainly motived by: (a) the SFCD model with RL fractional calculus is discretized by employing a numerical integral formula and a CSPH scheme, and then a conditionally stable CSPH-SFCD method is first derived; (b) the UW scheme is introduced to stabilize the numerical investigation of convection-dominated SFBP; (c) the fractional Neumann boundary (FNB) condition can be easily enforced in the proposed discretized scheme, and the integer-order NB condition is treated by employing virtual particles interpolation technique; (d) the MPI parallel computing technique is adopted to enhance the computational efficiency. Firstly, the numerical convergence and stability of the proposed scheme are discussed and illustrated by solving several multi-dimensional benchmarks. Secondly, the cases of two-sided and left-sided RL fractional derivatives are also discussed and demonstrated in the numerical tests. The advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated by simulating the 2D/3D SFCD equations in convex domains or under non-uniform point distribution. Finally, the 2D two-component SFBP with FNBC are numerically investigated by using the proposed method, and compared with the FDM results. The complex nonlinear non-local properties governed by SFBP are numerically predicted by the proposed scheme. All the numerical results show that the proposed mesh-free method for time-dependent spatial SFCD problems is high-efficient, flexible and accurate.},

The passive/active electrolyte flow behavior with the moving solid boundary is described and simulated using Nernst-Plank-Poisson compensation of the electrolyte flow. The proposed numerical results are validated by comparing them with those available in the literature. Finally, the influence of scale dependency and Casimir force on the nano-scanner&#39;s dynamic performance and pull-in instability are investigated. Also, as torsional nano-scanners might be immersed in ionic media, the impact of ionic concentration on the pull-in voltage of a nano-scanner is investigated. The obtained results demonstrate that increasing the ionic concentration reduces the instability voltage of the nano-scanner considerably.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, based on the Wachspress generalized barycentric coordinates, we propose and analyze a polygonal finite volume element method (PFVEM) for solving the anisotropic diffusion equation on convex polygonal meshes. In particular, the PFVEM reduces to the classical P 1 P1 -FVEM on triangular meshes and it is not identical to the classical Q 1 Q1 -FVEM on quadrilateral meshes. A new proof is given to Proposition 8 in [19] , a result that is crucial to the derivation of the interpolation error estimates in both H 1 H1 and H 2 H2 norms. The original proof is based on a certain geometric assumption, which is shown not always true by a counterexample given in this paper. Moreover, for the error analysis of the PFVEM, we prove the H 2 H2 error estimate of the Wachspress interpolation. Under the coercivity assumption, the optimal H 1 H1 error estimate for the finite volume element solution is obtained. Several numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method for the heterogeneous and anisotropic diffusion problems on polygonal meshes.},

First of all, by the first-order necessary optimality condition , we derive the optimality system, and then use the finite element method to discretize the system directly. With the aim of obtaining the second-order time discretization scheme , we introduce the BDF2 backward and forward formulas for the state and co-state equations, respectively.

First, the basic mathematical concepts and key steps of the TDQM are presented. Then, several examples including homogeneous/inhomogeneous heat conduction equations and wave propagation equations are solved by the proposed method to show its detailed scheme. The influences of sampling point types, discrete point numbers and numerical Laplace transform inversion on the convergence and error of computational results are also discussed. Besides, we show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method by comparing the TDQM with the alternating direction implicit (ADI) scheme of the finite difference method. Compared with the traditional differential quadrature method (DQM), the TDQM introduces the integral transform theorem to decompose the solution process into a small-scale matrix inversion and a transform inversion. The number of algebraic equations is greatly reduced so that the difficulty of large-scale matrix inversion is avoided, and the computational efficiency is improved. Besides, the TDQM is no longer limited to finite entities, and reduces the limitation and influence of boundary conditions on computational results. This strategy is especially suitable for multi-dimensional problems with complex variables such as non-axisymmetric or three-dimensional problems.},

In this paper, the Red blood cell is the main focus because of their importance and remarkable deformability presenting particular simulation challenges in the L-shaped cavity. In order to study such complex fluids possessing complicated nature and multi-scale properties, the partial differential equations have been used to formulate the mathematical model of the complex fluids. To solve the mathematical model, energy stable schemes have been first constructed. Next, the numerical results are calculated followed by discussion for different surface tensions. A nonlinear coupling system is discretized into a (1) decoupled (2) stable, and (3) linear multi-step numerical scheme by adding a stability term. Fourth-order phase field equation is transformed into two second-order elliptic problems by using some reasonable decouple techniques, which is easy to implement. Furthermore, the finite element method is used for the spatial discretization . Numerical results confirm the energy decay property and deformability of the Red blood cell in the L-shaped domain.},

So, if the pressure function is integrated along the streamline , it must have a jump across the interior curve emanating from the vertex ( 0 , 0 ) (0,0) . Hence the pressure gradient is not well-defined. To handle this we construct a vector field which lifts the pressure jump value on the curve into the region. The precise structure of the solution is found by splitting from the solution the lifting vector field, the contact singularity , the corner singularity and the smoother part. The smoother one is shown to have the twice differentiability . The contact singularity is because the lifting vector show a non-smooth behavior at the contact point where the interface curve meets the boundary. The corner singularity is due to the non-convex vertex. Finally we give some numerical examples confirming the critical roles of each part in the decomposition.},

The resulting model is anisotropic viscoelastic which means that it is defined by a complex-valued frequency-dependent stiffness tensor that can be recomputed into the frequency-dependent phase velocities and attenuation of seismic waves. Numerical upscaling requires a solution of parabolic approximation of the Biot poroelastic equation for anisotropic media in frequency space for a series of frequencies and multiple right-hand sides. The approach is based on the finite-difference approximation of the quasi-static formulation of the Biot equation with the use of a direct solver to resolve the obtained system of linear algebraic equations. The direct solver allows for efficiently treating multiple right-hand sides which is an essential statement of the upscaling problem. The presented realization of the algorithm allows solving the problems of the size of up to 2000 points in each spatial direction using a single machine, which allows dealing with representative fractured-porous models. To illustrate the applicability of the algorithm we provide several series of experiments illustrating the effects of fracture connectivity and anisotropy of fracture-filling material on seismic waves dispersion and attenuation if propagating in complex fluid-saturated fractured-porous media.},

The trained neural network contains the underlying physical information of the equation and it can predict the solution of the next time step. Additionally, a key feature of this approach is that, unlike other commonly used numerical approaches, it is mesh free. As such, it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality associated with high dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs). Besides, the approximate ability of the neural network is proved by the convergence of the loss function and the convergence of the neural network to the exact solution in L 2 L2 norm. Finally, the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated by some numerical examples, especially in the ten dimensional case. Moreover, the predictions remain robust even when the training data are corrupted with 1% uncorrelated Gaussian noise.},

  abstract     = {Future advanced aero-engine features highly complex internal flow mechanisms, such as small gap blade row interactions and coupled fluid-structure interactions. Simulating these is challenging for convectional body-fitted computation fluid dynamics methods. As a first step towards this ultimate goal, this paper presents applications of an immersed boundary (IB) method for internal-flow problems at high Reynolds numbers . A hybrid mesh strategy, with a single-block and structured mesh to fit the physical domain and an IB method to model the internal walls, is adopted to the internal-flow problems. To achieve this, an adaptive forcing distance (AFD) technique is proposed for determining the forcing point locations when large-aspect-ratio cells are involved near the walls. This extends the IB method to curvilinear grids so that the domain boundaries can be resolved by a body-fitted mesh, which significantly reduces the total cell number needed to resolve the boundaries compared to the usage of a Cartesian grid , and thus improve the computational efficiency. The present methodologies are firstly validated on a Cartesian grid through a 2D NACA0012 test case. Subsequently, the methods are tested for two internal flow problems with increasing complexity: a 3D subsonic compressor cascade and a well-known transonic rotor, NASA Rotor 37. These case studies prove that the present method can achieve the same overall accuracy for the pressure distribution with the traditional body-fitted simulations at the attached-flow regions, and further studies are still necessary to improve the accuracy of predicting the friction coefficient and separated flows .},

To capture the sharp gradient/discontinuous part in data, we introduce a non-zero mean function in terms of the Sigmoid function in the Gaussian process prior. We test the method using noise-free and noisy data on the regression problem and the inverse problem of Burgers&#39; equation, inviscid Burgers&#39; equation, and the nonlinear wave system (NLWS), and verify its effectiveness and robustness.},

When the close-out value of the contract is chosen as a fraction of the adjusted value, the latter verifies a non-linear, not explicitly solvable BSDE. In a Markovian setting, this adjusted value is a deterministic function of the state variables verifying a non-linear PDE. Thus, we build a numerical method to approximate the solution of this non-linear PDE, as an alternative to the commonly used Monte Carlo simulations, which require large computational times, especially when the number of the state variables grows. We construct this approximated solution by the simple method of finite differences and we show the method to be accurate and efficient.},

Due to the discontinuity in the source term and the presence of the diffusion parameter, the solutions to such problems have, in general, boundary, corner and weak-interior layers. In this work, a numerical approach is carried out using a finite-difference technique defined on an appropriated layer-adapted piecewise uniform Shishkin mesh to provide a good estimate of the error.

With this method, the systems of equations are first coupled together and then solved by preconditioned GMRES, so the solutions at arbitrary time steps can be obtained simultaneously at a time. Under some mild assumptions, we develop an optimal convergence theory and show that the convergence rate is bounded independently of the mesh sizes , the subdomain partition and the window size. Some numerical results are reported to illustrate the optimality and scalability of the proposed method. Moreover, the numerical comparison also shows that our method has a faster convergence rate.},

Thus, the presented Pagosa can be expected to predict the whole deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) process in future. In Pagosa, spatial discretization is implemented on cubic staggered grids by computing different variables at the vertex and the cell center, respectively, a special operator-splitting technique is employed to reduce the computational cost, and an artificial viscosity is added to handle the discontinuous shock waves in our simulations. To quantitatively evaluate the capability of Pagosa to solve these kinds of instabilities, the single mode Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) and the multimode RMI at an air/SF 6 interface are first performed, respectively. The Pagosa results are compared with the related numerical solutions in the existing references and the experimental result. Moreover, a theoretical derivation of growth of RTI is also provided based on our numerical method . Subsequently, we explore the multi-mode RMI at an air/HE interface as well as the effects of several factors using Pagosa. Numerical results show that Pagosa is a powerful toolset to generate the right structures and the amplitude of RTI and RMI at an air/SF 6 interface. The solid HE can be penetrated by a strong shock wave and forms RMI deformations. The RMI at an air/HE interface behaves very different than at an air/SF 6 interface, periodic, decreased oscillation is observed due to material character, and is very sensitive to the initial simulation settings, that is, a tiny change in physical quantities will lead to a remarkable RMI structure, which is also observed in a shock bubble interaction [41] . The findings in this work are significant, and will present a new insight for the high explosive field.},

This system not only contains complex coupling and nonlinear terms but also satisfies the thermodynamically consistent property, i.e., energy dissipation property. This work aims to develop linear, totally decoupled, and energy dissipation-preserving schemes for the flows-coupled conservative Allen–Cahn two-phase flow system. To efficiently treat the nonlinear and coupling terms, a modified time-dependent auxiliary variable approach is adopted to construct equivalent forms and time-marching schemes. To enhance the consistency between modified and original energy functionals, a simple and effective correction technique is adopted. The estimation of discrete versions of energy dissipation law can be easily established. In each time step, our proposed schemes are uniquely solvable and the implementation is easy to follow because we only need to separately update variables by solving linear elliptic equations . The fully discrete numerical algorithm based on finite difference approximation in space is described in detail. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed method not only achieves desired accuracy, consistency, and energy stability but also has good capability to simulate typical two-phase flow problems.},

Nevertheless, all current three-dimensional SPH models in this ever-growing field of application are based on a uniform discretization size (i.e., single-resolution domain) and cannot exploit the computational efficiency of this method from an algorithmic point of view. In this work, we present a spatially fully-adaptive SPH scheme and apply it for the first time to simulate the melt pool behavior in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing. The implementation contains state-of-the-art numerical stabilization techniques to ensure the SPH stability and robustness, as well as all crucial physical phenomena, such as the recoil pressure, wetting, and Marangoni effects, to capture the melt pool dynamics in detail. Full spatial adaptivity is enabled by particle splitting and merging, where the spatial resolution can be refined and coarsened concurrently multiple times. As a result of this and a novel sorting algorithm, the code performs about 5x faster in powder-based AM applications, making it feasible to simulate multi-track LPBF processes within reasonable times without parallel computing for the first time.},

A numerical model based on this approach is validated using experimental data generated in a climate-controlled wind tunnel coupled with a soil test bed. The developed modeling approach is based on a combination of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for simulating the fluid flow and the mixed-hybrid finite element method (MHFEM) for solving constituent transport. Both those methods individually, as well as when coupled, are implemented entirely on a GPU accelerator in order to utilize its computational power and avoid the hardware limitations caused by slow communication between the GPU and CPU over the PCI-E bus. In order to utilize vast computational resources available on modern supercomputers, the implementation is extended for distributed multi-GPU computations based on domain decomposition and the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We describe the mathematical details behind the computational method, focusing primarily on the coupling mechanisms. The performance of the solver is demonstrated on a modern high-performance computing system. Flow and transport simulation results are validated and compared herein with experimental velocity and relative humidity measurements made above a flat partially saturated soil layer exposed to steady air flow. Model robustness and flexibility is demonstrated by introducing cuboidal bluff-bodies to the flow in several different experimental scenarios. The experimentally measured values are available in a publicly available dataset that can serve as a benchmark for future studies. Finally, we discuss potential improvements for the model as well as future experimental efforts.},

Such problems are heavily impacted by back-propagating waves which are often neglected when devising optimized transmission operators for the Schwarz method. This work explores new operators taking into account those back-propagating waves and compares them with well-established operators neglecting these contributions. Notably, this paper focuses on the case of rectangular cavities , as the optimal (non-local) transmission operator can be easily determined. Nonetheless, deviations from this ideal geometry are considered as well. In particular, computations of the acoustic noise in a three-dimensional model of the helium vessel of a beamline cryostat with optimized Schwarz schemes are discussed. Those computations show a reduction of 46% in the iteration count , when comparing an operator optimized for cavities with those optimized for unbounded problems.},

The solution to this class of problems possesses weak singularity in the vicinity of the initial time t = 0 t=0 and an exponential boundary layer at the right lateral surface as the singular perturbation parameter ε → 0 ε→0 . To tackle the initial layer at time t = 0 t=0 , a classical L 1 finite difference scheme is employed on a graded mesh to discretize the time-fractional derivative. Further, a standard upwinding procedure in the spatial direction is used on a piecewise uniform Shishkin mesh. It is shown that the resultant fully discrete scheme is parameter uniformly convergent with order of convergence O ( M − p + N − 1 log ⁡ N ) O(M−p+N−1log⁡N) , where p = min ⁡ { 2 − α , r α } p=min⁡{2−α,rα} , r is the graded mesh exponent and N , M N,M are the number of mesh subintervals in space and time direction respectively.

In the present work, we proposed the Grad&#39;s distribution function for 13 moments-based moment gas kinetic solver (G13-MGKS) and the macroscopic governing equations are derived based on the moment integral of the discrete Boltzmann equation under the finite volume framework. Numerical fluxes at the cell interface related to the macroscopic variables, stress and heat flux can be reconstructed from the Boltzmann equation along the characteristic line directly. The initial distribution function is approximated by Grad&#39;s distribution function for 13 moments at the cell interface, so the explicit expression of numerical fluxes could be derived to release the present solver from the discretization and numerical integration in the molecular velocity space. The G13-MGKS with the discrete and explicit form of numerical fluxes are examined by several tests covering the steady and unsteady flows from the continuum regime to rarefied flow regimes. Numerical results indicate that the G13-MGKS could simulate continuum flows accurately and present reasonable predictions for rarefied flows at moderate Knudsen numbers .

  abstract     = {This work develops a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methodology with controllable accuracy within prescribed frequency bands, which is suitable for problems incorporating material dispersion described by the Lorentz model. An optimization technique is introduced, which is based on the one-dimensional (1D) numerical dispersion relation and modifies appropriately the form of the spatial operators. Through the implementation of a least-squares approach, the numerical wavenumber is forced to be close to the exact one within arbitrary parts of the frequency spectrum, located either below or above the medium&#39;s absorption band, according to the spectral content of the simulation. The formulation initially considers 1D problems and lossless materials. Yet, generalizations to multi-dimensional problems and the incorporation of at least low-loss materials are also discussed.},

By introducing power- and exponential-type scalar auxiliary variables to define the system&#39;s energy and to balance the incompressible condition&#39;s influence respectively, we first convert the Navier-Stokes equations with variable density into an equivalent form . Then, with the help of the equations of scalar auxiliary variables, we construct a linear decoupled fully discrete finite element scheme, which can be implemented efficiently. Moreover, the mass, momentum and energy identical relations which are analogous to that for the continuous equations are proved uniformly regardless of the discretization parameters. Both lower- and upper-bound of the numerical density measured in L 2 L2 -norm are deduced, too. Finally, we report some numerical examples to verify the correctness and efficiency of the proposed scheme, including an extension of a coupled nonlinear model with temperature.},

Decomposing the displacements field into potentials is a well-known tool in elastodynamics that takes advantage of the decoupling of pressure waves and shear waves inside a homogeneous isotropic media . In the spectral problem on a bounded domain , this decomposition decouples the elasticity equations into two Laplacian-like equations that only interact at the boundary. We show that spurious eigenvalues appear when Lagrangian finite elements are used to discretize the problem. Then, we propose an alternative weak formulation which avoids this drawback. A finite element discretization of this weak formulation based again on Lagrangian finite elements is proposed and tested by means of some numerical experiments, which show convergence and absence of spurious modes.},

As one of the most famous anisotropic diffusion equations , the PM model has been widely used in noise removal, image segmentation , edge detection and image enhancement. However, the major disadvantages of the traditional PM model are the high difficulty of choosing the best threshold and the tendency of impairing details, so that the denoising is either excessive or insufficient in the whole process. These defects are more obviously when dealing with the image that polluted by noise from multiple distributions. By designing a dynamical threshold function in the edge indicator, we establish a new PM model that can change the diffusion mode and strength adaptively according to the image features . The existence and uniqueness of the weak solution are proven. After theoretical analysis, we give an experimental approach to show the efficiency of this kind of model, especially to the image containing multi–noise and multi–details.},

We use the two-grid method to overcome the computational difficulties arising from the strong nonlinear coupling system. The stability and convergence of the two-grid method are obtained under the proper assumption of time discretization size k , space discretization size h and interface thickness ε . The analysis shows that the two-grid methods can get the same convergence as the classical one-grid methods provided that we choose proper coarse and fine mesh sizes. However, the two-grid methods can save much computational time compared with the one-grid methods. Some numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper an implicit peridynamic (PD) framework is devised for the solution of quasi-static problems involving brittle and quasi-brittle fracture. A common way to deal with such problems, in explicit frameworks, is to incorporate artificial damping into the PD equation of motion. This may contribute to non-physical behavior of the system. Also, implicit frameworks, based on the Newton-Raphson method, fail to trace the snap-back behavior. To this end, we develop an implicit peridynamic framework to deal with quasi-static problems involving snap-back/snap-through instabilities. This is achieved through two different approaches. The first approach is based on the global arc-length method applicable to problems with zero displacement constraints. The second one is based on a displacement-controlled arc-length method, suitable for problems with non-zero prescribed displacements. The framework is developed for linear elastic as well as softening (degrading) material damage models, respectively appropriate for brittle and quasi-brittle fracture modeling. The robust performance of the proposed framework, within various loading scenarios and damage models, is demonstrated. To boost the numerical performance of the proposed PD framework, a hybrid integration scheme is employed. We demonstrate the advantages of this scheme over the conventional (standard) one in terms of efficiency for quasi-static problems.},

The H(div) CDG method is derived from the H(div) conforming formulation by replacing the classical gradient operator with a weak gradient operator, where the weak one is locally computed by the k th-order Raviart-Thomas (RT) element. We prove optimal a-priori error estimates for both semi-discrete scheme and fully-discrete scheme with the backward Euler discretization in time. The implicit constants in the error estimates are robust for the arbitrarily large Lamé coefficient and the arbitrarily small constrained specific storage coefficient. Our method has no stabilizers, which simplifies the finite element formulations. Meanwhile, it can also overcome the poroelasticity locking mathematically and preserve the pointwise mass conservation on the discrete level.

We propose a novel semi-implicit discretization in time that uses a standard convex-concave splitting method of the nonlinear double-well potential, as well as special treatment to the elastic energy. We show that the resulting discrete system is equivalent to a convex minimization problem , and propose and prove the convergence of alternating minimization applied to it. Finally, we present numerical experiments that show the robustness and effectiveness of both alternating minimization and the monolithic Newton method applied to the newly proposed discrete system of equations. We compare it to a system of equations that has been discretized with a standard convex-concave splitting of the double-well potential, and implicit evaluations of the elasticity contributions and show that the newly proposed discrete system is better conditioned for linearization techniques.},

  abstract     = {The necessity of using non-Newtonian models for hemodynamics in geometries mimicking large vessels is investigated. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) measurements are performed on a specially-designed phantom representing the aorta while using several types of fluids. These measurements are compared against the results of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulator in 3D. On the phantom side, two types of non-Newtonian fluids (water-based solutions of glycerine with xanthan gum and sucrose with xanthan gum) and Newtonian fluid (clear water) are used in the experiments; three different acrylic plates are inserted to represent aortic stenosis of varying degrees; and two constant flow regimes with high and low flow rates are used. The CFD simulations in the geometry and inflow boundary conditions corresponding to each experiment are performed both with non-Newtonian and Newtonian approaches. Additionally, the accuracy of the PC-MRI flow measurements is assessed and discussed with respect to the known PC-MRI flow underestimation due to turbulence. Based on the type of stenosis and inflow rate, the results indicate that the Newtonian models produce comparable results with the experimentally acquired data, which is in favor of overall less expensive Newtonian models.},

The dimension splitting method is based on auxiliary variables for spatial derivative terms and the operator splitting approach. It converts the 2D or 3D problem into a series of one-dimensional (1D) problems which can be solved by using multi-thread. The stability and accuracy of the proposed method are improved by a local stabilizing approach and extrapolation. The analyses of discrete energy and discrete mass conservation property are shown.

  abstract     = {The problem of multiplicative noise removal has attracted much attention in recent years. Unlike additive noise, multiplicative noise destroys almost all information of an image; therefore, it is more difficult to remove them from corrupted images. In this paper, we propose a denoising model of fractional-order diffusion coupled with integer-order diffusion for multiplicative gamma noise, which takes advantage of both texture-preserving property of fractional-order diffusion and edge-preserving property of integer-order diffusion. We explore the mutual mechanism of two diffusion equations in the diffusion process, i.e., mutual transfer of texture and edge information respectively from two filtering images, and mutual regularization on the diffusion coefficients in both equations. We design an alternating numerical scheme based on semi-implicit finite difference and discrete Fourier transform for solving the coupled diffusion system. The proposed model is tested on some commonly-used images and is compared with six state-of-the-art models, qualitatively and quantitatively. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed model in reducing multiplicative gamma noise while preserving textures and edges.},

  abstract     = {The implementation methods of finite element analysis (FEA) have remained essentially unchanged since the inception of FEA in the 1960s. Alterations of any of the input or design parameters to the FEA model can potentially nullify the previous results and subsequent additional simulations will be required. This is particularly relevant for situations that require active monitoring where telemetry is to be passed to remote systems capable of carrying out FEA computations. In this paper, we train an artificial neural network that was originally developed for image processing to emulate FEA. Conventionally generated FEA results are transformed into image pairs where the load, material and geometric properties are assigned different colour channels. These images are used to train a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). The subsequent “trained” cGAN can generate predictions for arbitrary inputs which correspond to the domain of input on which the developed cGAN was trained. Three numerical experiments were conducted resulting in three separate cGANs trained to infer (a) deflections from forces, (b) stresses from deflections and (c) stresses from forces. After a moderate training regime of 200 epochs each, the outputs of the trained networks are shown to be in reasonable agreement to the ground truth with mean errors in the range of 5-10%. The contribution of this work lies in transforming FEA results into images which enables the usage of cGANs to solve a computational mechanics problem. The implementation herein allows for near real-time computations which highlights the potential of the proposed methodology in applications where simulation results are required in a timely manner such as predictive control, interactive virtual environment, etc. All the codes used in this research will be openly available at Qatar University&#39;s Institutional Repository 1 ; the data used in this work will be available upon request from the corresponding author.},

  abstract     = {Nonresectable liver tumors can be successfully treated with radioembolization (RE) using yttrium-90 ( 90 Y) microspheres . However, hepatocellular carcinoma&#39;s therapeutic methods are hindered primarily by the complex arterial morphology of the liver and its high dependence on arteries&#39; geometry to target the tumors. Thus, this study aims to investigate the particle-fluid dynamics of yttrium-90 ( 90 Y) loaded microspheres injected into the blood flow within a comprehensive hepatic artery system consisting of 17 daughter vessels branches. Also, the effect of particles&#39; characteristics (size and density) with two types of commercially available 90 Y microspheres, SIR-Spheres and TheraSpheres, and time infusion intervals (various release phases) were studied leading to a total of 20 investigated cases. The results demonstrated the vital influence of flow dynamics on the particles&#39; preference to deposit in specific daughter vessels. Regardless of phase shift, except GDA, outlet 1 receives the largest portion of CHA inflow with nearly 14.5% which consequently implies the highest value of exit fraction after particles injection, and outlet 11 receives the minimum portion of CHA inflow with 1.97%. The maximum and minimum reductions of mean flow rate through the phase shift from acceleration toward minimum phase are for daughter vessels 17 and 10 with nearly 17.7% and 4.8%, respectively. The maximum percentage of particles that remains in the domain after 4 heart cycle simulation time is for glass microspheres consisting of particles with the diameter of 80 μ m 80μm released at t = 0 t=0 sec, indicating that 25.4% of the injected particles are unable to discharge the domain. Whereas, the minimum percentage (0.16%) of remaining particles is for resin microspheres with a diameter of 20 μ m 20μm released at t = 0 t=0 sec. Moreover, regardless of particles type, 7 daughter vessels discharge their maximum number of particles at the time point of injection associated with the minimum velocity of CHA flow rate which highlights the significant importance of minimum phase for those daughter vessels, potentially terminating tumor cells. Results exhibit that for none of the daughter vessels, the acceleration phase and peak phase (except for the GDA outlet) are proper time zones to release the 90 Y microspheres, regardless of particles type. Finally, to conduct the released particles to particular vessels which are connected to tumor cells, the best radial position of the micro-catheter at the CHA inlet cross-section was identified by generating particle release maps (PRMs) for each investigated case.},

We derive error bounds of the approximate solutions from our presented algorithm by the theoretical tool of local a priori estimate for the grad-div stabilized finite element solution. Numerical results verify the validity of the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm. On the one hand, compared with the counterpart one excluding grad-div stabilization, this algorithm can reduce significantly the effect of pressure on the approximate velocities, and hence, yields much better approximate velocities in the case of small viscosities .

Since the GMLS approximation uses basic polynomials as shape functions, there is no need to construct complex shape functions in the moving least-square (MLS) approximation. In addition, the calculation of numerical integrals in the local weak form of the equation is simple. We also give proof of the convergence and stability of the time-discrete scheme. The analytical results show that the semi-discrete time scheme is unconditionally stable and the convergence order is O ( Δ t 2 ) O(Δt2) . Moreover, to show the accuracy and efficiency of the methods, we use the regular and irregular domains with distributions of uniform and scattered nodes in numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {In the present paper, a new strategy of multigrid method is introduced to accelerate the convergence speed of numerical simulations via lattice Boltzmann method. Based on the popular V-cycle multigrid algorithm, a simplified multigrid algorithm is presented and validated through the simulations of the classic lid-driven cavity flow for steady states. The novelty of the present algorithm resides in the construction of the information transferring process, in which, for a full cycle, the numerical simulation starts on the coarse mesh, transferring to medium mesh and then streams to the fine mesh through a prolongation operator. Afterwards, instead of using a restriction operator, the fluid information jumps back directly from the fine mesh to the coarse mesh via an assignment operator. The accuracy and efficiency of the simplified new algorithm are validated by comparing the results obtained when employing the classic V-cycle multigrid algorithm and the traditional lattice Boltzmann method with uniform Cartesian grid .},

The proposed scheme uses the operator splitting method to reduce the multi-dimensional partial differential equation to a set of one-dimensional sub-problems. The computational domain is discretized with a uniform space and time step size to approximate the option values and asset correlation-related terms by piecewise quadratic polynomials . In order to obtain the numerical solutions of the sub-problems, we analytically integrate the polynomials to estimate the expectation of the Feynman-Kac formula. We compare our method with the implicit operator splitting method (OSM), a widely used finite difference method in the industry. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms OSM in terms of convergence in space and time directions. We also provide analysis to guarantee the unconditional stability of our method by exploiting the Feynman-Kac recursively.},

We try to understand the useful hidden features of both exact and discrete problems. When discretized with finite elements of degree one, the discrete and exact problems behave in diametrically opposite ways. Indeed, existence of the discrete solution is always guaranteed while its uniqueness may be lost. In contrast, the solution of the exact problem may not exist, but it is unique. We show how existence of the so called “ weak spurious modes ”, of the exact variational formulation, is source of instability and the reason why existence may fail. For the discrete problem, we find that the cause of non uniqueness is actually the occurrence of “ spurious modes ”. We track their fading effect asymptotically when the mesh size tends to zero. In order to restore uniqueness, we recall the discrete version of the Holmgren principle, introduced in Azaïez et al. (2011) [4] , and we discuss the effect on uniqueness of the finite element mesh, using some graph theory basic material.},

Within this framework, we show that it is possible to recover a wide range of methods independently of the spatial discretization , including positivity preserving , discrete maximum principle satisfying, entropy dissipative, and invariant domain preserving schemes. Furthermore, these schemes are proven to recover the order of accuracy of the underlying Runge–Kutta method upon which they are built. The additional computational cost is the evaluation of two nonlinear mappings which generally have closed-form solutions. We show the utility of this approach in numerical experiments using a pseudospectral spatial discretization without any explicit shock capturing schemes for nonlinear hyperbolic problems with discontinuities.},

We extend the existing semi-implicit method to propose a new semi-monolithic method for FSI simulation that uses a velocity boundary equation of a pressure Poisson equation so that only the pressure variables of the fluid domain are coupled with the displacement variables of the solid domain in a monolithic manner. The fluid domain is solved by employing a fractional four-step method for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations based on an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) formulation, and the solid domain is solved by an updated Lagrangian method for simulating large nonlinear deformations. We applied the proposed method to 2D/3D benchmark problems with various time steps and density ratios, and the results confirmed that FSI problems with not only a strong added-mass effect but also a large deformation are simulated well. The proposed method is faster than the existing monolithic method because it solves a smaller matrix whose diagonal blocks are diagonally dominant matrices, which are much easier to precondition.},

The main novelty of this work is the error analysis of the reduced-order model. For the first time an error estimate is derived for the reduced-order solution of the parametrized Allen-Cahn equation. To the best of our knowledge, no published paper takes into account the impact of the diffusion parameter when proving bounds on the errors.

They are meant for the design of stable and conservative mixed formulations of multiphysics systems combined with advanced numerical strategies. For instance, they support general polytopal meshes and/or allow trace interface constraints. These are appealing attributes for various challenging domains in computational practice, e.g. in hp -adaptivity, meshing of complex regions, multiscale simulations etc. Firstly, we consider standard finite element exact sequences of composite polynomial approximations inside the polytopal subdomains , based on conformal and regular sub-partitions of them. Over a partition of the mesh skeleton (faces and/or edges), we fix a sequence of trace spaces of piecewise polynomials . These trace spaces are supposed to form a hierarchy of lower dimensional exact sequences. Then, the trace-constrained subspaces only keep the non-vanishing trace components constrained by the given (coarser) trace spaces, but the internal components of the original local finite element spaces, having vanishing traces, are all kept. These internal (bubble) components may be richer to different extents when compared with the trace components with respect to internal mesh size , internal polynomial degree , or both. In principle, polynomial degree, mesh resolution and geometry are allowed to vary over different subdomains, but some interface compatibility properties are required. The operators over these trace-constrained exact finite element spaces commuting de Rham diagram are constructed in the context of projection-based interpolants . Some non-conventional examples of these sequences are described, illustrating the use of the specific finite element pairs in H ( div , Ω ) × L 2 ( Ω ) H(div,Ω)×L2(Ω) .},

Firstly, the convergence of the L1 scheme is established with an arbitrary sectorial operator of spectral angle &amp;lt;π/2 , that is the resolvent set of this operator contains {z∈C∖{0}:|Argz|&amp;lt;θ} for some π/2&amp;lt;θ&amp;lt;π . The relationship between the time fractional order α∈(0,1) and the constants in the error estimates is precisely characterized, revealing that the L1 scheme is robust as α approaches 1. Then an inverse problem of a fractional diffusion equation is analyzed, and the convergence analysis of a temporal discretization of this inverse problem is given.

  abstract     = {For the first time, a nonlinear interface problem on an unbounded domain with nonmonotone set-valued transmission conditions is analyzed. The investigated problem involves a nonlinear monotone partial differential equation in the interior domain and the Laplacian in the exterior domain. Such a scalar interface problem models nonmonotone frictional contact of elastic infinite media. The variational formulation of the interface problem leads to a hemivariational inequality, which lives on the unbounded domain, and so cannot be treated numerically in a direct way. By boundary integral methods the problem is transformed and a novel hemivariational inequality (HVI) is obtained that lives on the interior domain and on the coupling boundary, only. Thus for discretization the coupling of finite elements and boundary elements is the method of choice. In addition smoothing techniques of nondifferentiable optimization are adapted and the nonsmooth part in the HVI is regularized. Thus we reduce the original variational problem to a finite dimensional problem that can be solved by standard optimization tools. We establish not only convergence results for the total approximation procedure, but also an asymptotic error estimate for the regularized HVI.},

  abstract     = {Droplet evaporation is a typical multiphase flow with various applications in many natural phenomena and industrial processes. Different numerical methods have been used to simulate this type of flow. Front-Tracking is one of the common methods in the study and simulation of multiphase flows. The Front-Tracking method requires very fine resolution when dealing with high density ratios with phase change. As a result, Front-Tracking method has rarely been used for solving problems at high-density ratios. In this paper, by using a two-step algorithm for moving the front, the Front-Tracking method is modified for problems with high-density ratios. Also, the fluid around the droplet is considered as a gas mixture, and the generated vapor is considered as a different component from the primary gas that surrounds the droplet. The results of the two-step algorithm are compared with the existing algorithm, and the available analytical results for a static droplet. The evaporation of a falling droplet is also studied, and the results of the two-step algorithm and common algorithm are compared. The effect of droplet deformation on the evaporation process for a falling is investigated. The effect of vapor properties on evaporation rate is also studied. The two-step algorithm is used for different three-dimensional cases, and static droplet evaporation is simulated. Results are compared with existing analytical results. Next, a falling droplet is modeled and the results are compared with experimental data. The effect of density ratio on falling droplet evaporation is also investigated. Finally, two and three-dimensional results are presented and compared for a specified case. For some cases, the conservation of mass and the dependence of results to grid resolution are presented which indicates the accuracy of the numerical method.},

The unknown coefficients of the assumed velocity profile in the non-equilibrium wall model are determined from the constraints provided by the vertically integrated turbulent-boundary-layer equations and appropriate matching conditions . Instead of the no-slip condition, the no-penetration condition and the wall shear stress yielded by the non-equilibrium analytical wall model are enforced at the immersed boundary to calculate the velocity components at an exterior dependent node. A local coordinate system is introduced, so that three-dimensional wall modeling is transformed into a two-dimensional one and the complexity of model implementation is reduced. In the IB framework, a bilinear interpolation is constructed to evaluate the streamwise derivatives in the integrated turbulent-boundary-layer equations. To reduce the oscillations of the computed derivatives in the solution of the wall model, an inverse-distance-weighted averaging is applied. Numerical experiments for various turbulent flows have been conducted to verify the ability of the present LES-DFD method. The predicted results agree well with the published experimental data or numerical results and also show some improvements in comparison with the equilibrium model.},

The standard analysis of the global L 2 L2 superconvergence is combined with the weak estimate of the second type (WE2). However, the WE2 of the tetrahedral quadratic finite element has kept absent for a rather long time. To this end, we define the four-element-based uniform tetrahedral mesh , and then present the simplified weak estimate of the second type (SWE2), which simplifies the result of the WE2 and can also derive the global L 2 L2 superconvergence. For the completeness, the proof of the WE2 can be found in the appendix. Finally, this supercloseness will be used to construct a post-processing that increases the order of approximation to the exact solution in L 2 L2 norm.

  abstract     = {We design a fully discrete MFE (Mixed Finite Element) scheme, based on a PDM (Primal-Dual Mixed) formulation, combined with the Crank-Nicolson method for multidimensional parabolic equations in which the finite element spaces are included in H div Hdiv and L 2 L2 . We state and prove novel convergence results with convergence rate towards the “velocity” p ( t ) = − ∇ u ( t ) p(t)=−∇u(t) and “pressure” u ( t ) u(t) in, respectively, the L ∞ ( H div ) L∞(Hdiv) and W 1 , ∞ ( L 2 ) W1,∞(L2) norms, under assumption that the solution is smooth, in a general setting of finite element spaces which require only the known discrete assumption of inf ⁡ − sup inf⁡−sup and a coerciveness hypothesis similar to that developed in [15, Theorem 7.4.1, Page 249] for the case of elliptic equations . The order is proved to be two in time and is optimal in space. These results are obtained thanks to a new well-developed discrete a priori estimate . We apply these results to two known families of finite element spaces. The first one is the R T l RTl (Raviart-Thomas finite elements of an arbitrary order l ) and the second one has been proposed by Brezzi, Douglas and Marini in dimension d = 2 d=2 and by Brezzi, Douglas, Duran and Fortin when d = 3 d=3 . For these two families, it is proved that the order is respectively k 2 + h l + 1 k2+hl+1 and k 2 + h l k2+hl in the L ∞ ( H div ) × W 1 , ∞ ( L 2 ) L∞(Hdiv)×W1,∞(L2) -norm ( L ∞ ( H div ) L∞(Hdiv) for velocity and W 1 , ∞ ( L 2 ) W1,∞(L2) for pressure) when using respectively R T l RTl and spaces of piecewise polynomials of degree less than or equal l , where h (resp. k ) is the mesh size of the space (resp. time) discretization . Some other possible second order time accurate PDMFE schemes are also discussed. This work is an extension and improvement of two previous works. The first one is [3] in which similar estimates are proved for first order time (order one in time) accurate PDMFE under a restrictive hypothesis between the finite elements spaces. This hypothesis is a particular case of the one considered here. The second work is [4] in which a new convergence result with convergence rate towards only the “velocity” p ( t ) = − ∇ u ( t ) p(t)=−∇u(t) in only the norm of L 2 ( H div ) L2(Hdiv) is proved using the particular case of the lowest degree Raviart-Thomas Spaces R T 0 RT0 as discretization in space combined with the use of Crank-Nicolson method as discretization in time. This contribution is motivated by two pioneer works in MFEMs (Mixed Finite Element Methods) for two dimensional parabolic equations . The first one is [13] in which the convergence of semi-discrete MFE (discretization is only in space) schemes is proved towards velocity and pressure in only L ∞ ( ( L 2 ) 2 ) L∞((L2)2) and L ∞ ( L 2 ) L∞(L2) norms, see [13, Theorem 2.1] . The second work is [18] in which a fully discrete scheme, based on a MFE formulation which is different from that we consider here, is established. The finite element spaces considered in [18] are included in ( L 2 ) 2 (L2)2 and H 0 1 H01 . In addition to the difference in the spaces considered here and in [18] , the formulation of the scheme presented here is simpler than that of [18] .},

The modified von Kármán equations serve as the paradigmatic object of investigation. They are derived in the framework of the modified coupled stress theory with the inclusion of the von Kármán geometric nonlinearity . The elliptic type PDEs are reduced to a system of ODEs using several methods, and the results are compared in order to quantify them for rectangular nano-plates. The following ROM methods have been used: Fourier method of separation of variables, the Kantorovich-Vlasov method (KVM), the variational iterations method (VIM) known as the extended Kantorovich method (EKM), the Agranovskii–Baglai–Smirnov method (ABSM) in combination with the KVM and VIM. We have found that the solutions obtained by combining VIM with the ABSM can be considered exact solutions of the von Kármán equations. The convergence of the developed iterative procedures is justified by a number of theorems for the static analysis of nanoplates on a rectangular plane.},

The non-linear behaviour is encoded in terms of a general scalar diffusivity function with suitable properties, which allows to balance the diffusion intensity over different regions of the image while preventing smoothing artefacts. For the proposed model, conservation properties (average intensity and non-negativity) are proved and a variational interpretation is showed for specific choices of the diffusivity function. Upon suitable spatial discretisation, both an explicit and a semi-implicit iterative schemes are considered, for which convergence conditions and unconditional stability results are proved, respectively. To validate the proposed modelling and the computational speed of the numerical schemes considered, we report several results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, showing that artefact-free and computationally efficient results are obtained in comparison to standard linear and anisotropic osmosis models.},

  abstract     = {We develop in this work an adaptive inexact smoothing Newton method for a nonconforming discretization of a variational inequality. As a model problem, we consider the contact problem between two membranes. Discretized with the finite volume method, this leads to a nonlinear algebraic system with complementarity constraints. The non-differentiability of the arising nonlinear discrete problem a priori requests the use of an iterative linearization algorithm in the semismooth class like, e.g., the Newton-min. In this work, we rather approximate the inequality constraints by a smooth nonlinear equality, involving a positive smoothing parameter that should be drawn down to zero. This makes it possible to directly apply any standard linearization like the Newton method. The solution of the ensuing linear system is then approximated by any iterative linear algebraic solver. In our approach, we carry out an a posteriori error analysis where we introduce potential reconstructions in discrete subspaces included in H 1 ( Ω ) H1(Ω) , as well as H ( div , Ω ) H(div,Ω) -conforming discrete equilibrated flux reconstructions. With these elements, we design an a posteriori estimate that provides guaranteed upper bound on the energy error between the unavailable exact solution of the continuous level and a postprocessed, discrete, and available approximation, and this at any resolution step. It also offers a separation of the different error components, namely, discretization, smoothing, linearization, and algebraic. Moreover, we propose stopping criteria and design an adaptive algorithm where all the iterative procedures (smoothing, linearization, algebraic) are adaptively stopped; this is in particular our way to fix the smoothing parameter. Finally, we numerically assess the estimate and confirm the performance of the proposed adaptive algorithm, in particular in comparison with the semismooth Newton method.},

Instead of choosing the RBF centres inside the problem domain, we use fictitious centres that can be located outside it to deal with the double boundary conditions of the fourth-order PDEs, and to also improve the computational accuracy. Furthermore, additional polynomial constraints applied to the approximation matrix of the RBFCM using fictitious centres, significantly alleviate the sensitivity of the method to the variation of the shape parameter, whereby it makes the RBFCM more practical for solving partial differential equations. We also apply the proposed method to a fourth-order elliptic PDE with random forcing terms (input data of the model). The input data are assumed to depend on a finite number of random variables at the collocation points. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the selection of the shape parameter. In addition, the numerical results show that the proposed method achieves a higher accuracy than the conventional RBFCM.},

The approach embeds the PDEs formula into the loss function of the neural networks and the resulting networks is trained to meet the equations along with the boundary conditions, initial conditions and interface conditions. The advantage of this method is that it avoids grid generation compared with the grid based methods and it is parallel for the equations and variables. In order to improve the approximation ability of the CPINNs, we add the loss weights before some terms of the loss function. Moreover, the approximate ability of the CPINNs is demonstrated by the theoretical analysis of convergence.

Particular emphasis is given to the nonlinear deformation regime, where it is known that the discrepancies between constitutive laws are most prominent. Hence, the experiments of optical tweezers and micropipette aspiration are considered here, for which relationships between the individual shear elastic moduli of the constitutive laws can also be established through analysis of the tension-deformation relationship. All constitutive laws were found to adequately predict the axial and transverse deformations of a red blood cell subjected to stretching with optical tweezers for a constant shear elastic modulus value. As opposed to Skalak law, the neo-Hookean and Yeoh laws replicated the erythrocyte membrane folding, that has been experimentally observed, with the trade-off of sustaining significant area variations. For the micropipette aspiration, the suction pressure-aspiration length relationship could be excellently predicted for a fixed shear elastic modulus value only when Yeoh law was considered. Importantly, the neo-Hookean and Yeoh laws reproduced the membrane wrinkling at suction pressures close to those experimentally measured. None of the constitutive laws suffered from membrane area compressibility in the micropipette aspiration case.},

To the best of our understanding, the proposed computational algorithm is new and has not been previously applied for solving VDMNDOFDE and DOT-FNPDE. The matrix representation of distributed order fractional derivatives, integer order derivatives and product term associated with the integral based on LW and BW are established to find the numerical solutions of the proposed VDMNDOFDE and DOT-FNPDE. Moreover, the association of standard tau rule and Legendre-Gauss quadrature (LGQ) techniques along with constructed matrix representation of differential and integral operators diminish VDMNDOFDE and DOT-FNPDE into system of nonlinear algebraic equations. Here, these systems of nonlinear algebraic equations are solved by the Newton&#39;s method to get the value of unknown vectors. Error bounds, convergence analysis, numerical algorithms of the VDMNDOFDE and DOT-FNPDE are rigorously investigated.

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a local Fourier analysis for multigrid methods with coarsening by a factor of three for the staggered finite-difference method applied to the Stokes equations . In [1] , local Fourier analysis has been applied to a mass-based Braess-Sarazin relaxation, a mass-based σ -Uzawa relaxation, and a mass-based distributive relaxation, with standard coarsening on staggered grids for the Stokes equations . Here, we consider multigrid methods with coarsening by a factor of three for these relaxation schemes. We derive theoretically optimal smoothing factors for this coarsening strategy. The optimal smoothing factors of coarsening by a factor of three are nearly equal to those obtained from standard coarsening. Thus, coarsening by a factor of three is superior computationally. Moreover, coarsening by a factor of three generates a nested hierarchy of grids, which simplifies and unifies the construction of grid-transfer operators.},

Classically, the neural network is expressed as a power series by optimization of the coefficients to get an approximate solution of the partial differential equations (PDEs). Due to well-defined approximate properties of orthogonal polynomials, orthogonal polynomials are used to construct the neural network. Compared with PINN, PI-PINN clearly has a simple structure and is easy to be understood. We carry out some numerical experiments, including parabolic partial differential equations, hyperbolic partial differential equations and an application in fluid mechanics. By these investigations, it is further demonstrated that the PI-PINN structure is effective in solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Further, investigations on reverse problems are taken and accurate results are obtained.},

The discretization in time is taken care of by the backward Euler scheme with respect of a partitioning of the time interval , whereas the C 0 IPDG method can be derived from a six-field formulation of the finite element discretized von Kármán equations. For each time step, the equilibrated a posteriori error estimator provides an upper bound for the discretization error in the broken W 2 , 2 W2,2 norm in terms of the associated primal and dual energy functionals. It requires the construction of equilibrated fluxes and equilibrated moment tensors which can be computed on local patches around interior nodal points of the triangulations. The relationship with a residual-type a posteriori error estimator is studied as well. The fully discretized quasi-static von Kármán equations are solved by a predictor-corrector continuation strategy featuring constant continuation as a predictor and Newton&#39;s method as a corrector which allows an adaptive choice of the time steps.

  abstract     = {A Rotated Lattice Boltzmann Flux Solver (RLBFS) with improved stability is proposed in this paper for the effective simulation of compressible flows with intense shock waves at high Mach numbers . Unlike the conventional LBFS or conventional Riemann solvers, which evaluate its mass, momentum and energy fluxes in the normal direction of each cell interface, the present RLBFS decomposes the outer normal direction of the cell interface into two perpendicular directions of the velocity difference and their counterparts. The fluxes in these two directions are respectively evaluated by the LBFS and the final fluxes at each interface are obtained by weighted summations of the two obtained fluxes. The matrix-based stability theory is applied to analyze the proposed solver by simulating the strong normal shock problem from Mach number 1.5 to 10. It reveals that the RLBFS has a smaller negative eigenvalue than the original LBFS, indicating that the RLBFS is more stable. The numerical accuracy of the RLBFS is evaluated by simulating the advection of density perturbation . The performance of the RLBFS is further demonstrated by simulating seven more compressible flows, including the transonic flow over RAE2822 airfoil , odd-even grid perturbation problem, a Mach 3 wind tunnel with a step, supersonic corner flow, double Mach reflection of a strong shock, shock-boundary layer interaction and hypersonic viscous flow around a blunt body . The obtained results agree well with the published data, showing that the RLBFS can effectively avoid the phenomenon of shock instability and thus has a potential for simulating practical compressible flows with intense shock waves at high Mach numbers.},

By employing this operator in the discretizations of the nonlinear term and the body force, we introduce a pressure-robust virtual element method on polygonal meshes. The well-posedness and convergence analyses are carried out, which imply that the velocity error in energy norm is not affected by the continuous pressure. A series of numerical examples are shown to support the theoretical findings, including the optimal convergence rates for the velocity and pressure, the pressure-robust property and an application in a coupled flow-transport problem.

The focus of this contribution is to describe a novel algorithmic approach to constructing hierarchical estimators of the Bank–Weiser type that is designed for implementation in a modern high-level finite element software with automatic code generation capabilities. We show how to use the estimator to drive (goal-oriented) adaptive mesh refinement for diverse Poisson problems and for mixed approximations of the nearly-incompressible elasticity problems .

Typically, the related physical values in the equilibrium state, including the potential, the electron concentration, and the hole concentration, are used as the initial iterate for solving the equations with a given bias voltage. Due to the strong nonlinearity, by using the typical initial iterate, the nonlinear iterate converges slowly or even can not converge when the given bias voltage is large. In this paper, an efficient initial iterate is constructed by exploiting the application features of the drift-diffusion equations. The key idea is to construct an approximate equation of the drift-diffusion equations by neglecting the recombination effect and casting the effects of the bias voltage on carriers&#39; quasi-Fermi potential. And the initial iterate is obtained by solving the approximate equation. Some physical interpretations and theoretical analyses for the proposed method are given. Numerical results show that the proposed initial iterate is effective, and the number of nonlinear iterations can be reduced by about 90% at most compared to the typical initial iterate. In some cases, the nonlinear iteration can not converge when the typical initial iterate is used, while the iteration converges if the new initial iterate in this paper is used.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a new strategy for solving highly oscillatory two-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson systems by means of a specific version of the parareal algorithm. The novelty consists in using reduced models, obtained from the two-scale convergence theory, for the coarse solving. The reduced models are useful to approximate the original Vlasov-Poisson model at a low computational cost since they are free of high oscillations. Both models are numerically solved in a particle-in-cell framework. We illustrate this strategy with numerical experiments based on long time simulations of a charged beam in a focusing channel and under the influence of a rapidly oscillating external electric field . On the basis of computing times, we provide an analysis of the efficiency of the parareal algorithm in terms of speedup.},

However, all existing VISMs in literature lack the uniqueness of an energy minimizing solute-solvent interface and thus prevent us from studying many important properties of the interface profile. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a new constrained VISM and conduct a rigorous analysis of the model. Existence, uniqueness and regularity of the energy minimizing interface has been studied. A necessary condition for the formation of a sharp solute-solvent interface has been derived. Moreover, we develop a novel approach to the variational analysis of the constrained model, which provides a complete answer to a question in our previous work [55] . Model validation and numerical implementation have been demonstrated by using several common biomolecular modeling tasks. Numerical simulations show that the solvation energies calculated from our new model match the experimental data very well.},

More important is that the new scheme has the ability to deal with arbitrary discontinuities. The coercivity is proved under a certain assumption. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first linear cell-centered scheme that is interpolation-free and of second order accuracy on arbitrary meshes with arbitrary discontinuities.

The proof is inspired by Ku&#39;s proof [36] based on the a priori estimate of the PDE. For general linear second-order elliptic PDEs, the uniqueness, existence, and well-posedness are equivalent due to the compactness of the operator and Fredholm alternative. Thus only a minimal uniqueness assumption is assumed: the homogeneous equation has a unique zero solution. The proof presented in the paper is a straightforward and short proof using the inf-sup stability of the standard variational formulation. The proof can potentially be applied to other equations or settings once having the standard formulation&#39;s stability. As an application, we also discuss least-squares finite element methods for problems with a nonsingular H − 1 H−1 right-hand side.},

A priori error estimates of the semidiscrete velocity and pressure approximations in L ∞ ( L 2 ) L∞(L2) and L ∞ ( L 2 ) L∞(L2) -norms, respectively, using the discontinuous Galerkin method are then derived.

Darcy&#39;s law is used for fluid flow calculation, and the drug metabolism is determined using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Using the model, penetration and distribution of a drug in a tissue are investigated. Mainly, the effects of fluid flow and drug metabolism together with the particle size effects on drug delivery are explored. It is observed that the particles of sizes 10 and 100 nm can penetrate the tissue with advection; however, without advection, such particles accumulate around the capillary, the source of the drug to the interstitium. In fluid flow regions, drug metabolism may not affect penetration and distribution of drug; the results are similar to those without drug metabolism. However, metabolism may significantly reduce drug penetration in the absence of fluid flow. It is observed from the sensitivity analysis that the model is most sensitive to the parameters that model the transport processes of extracellular space while least sensitive to those that incorporate the intracellular processes.},

The strain smoothing methods have been applied in numerous finite element analyses, especially for analyzing solids and structures; however, there have been no studies on efficient numerical solvers for the methods. We need mathematically and numerically well-elaborated iterative solvers for efficient applications to large-scale problems. In this study, we investigate how to design appropriate preconditioners for the methods with inspiration from the spectral properties of the strain smoothing methods. First, we analyze the spectrums of the stiffness matrices of the edge-based S-FEM and SSE. Subsequently, we propose improved two-level additive Schwarz preconditioners for the strain smoothing methods by modifying local solvers appropriately. For convenience of implementation, an alternative form of the preconditioners is proposed by defining the coarse-scale operation in terms of the standard FEM.

The core idea of the dual-level fast direct solver is to construct a sparse approximate inverse matrix to indirectly approximate the solution of linear equations . The solution process consists of the smoothing process and the correction process. Therefore, the dual-level fast direct solver only needs to solve a small-scale coarse-mesh matrix and a series of small-scale least squares problems defined on fine mesh. The drawback that the GMRES cannot efficiently solve large-scale dense linear system is overcome.

  abstract     = {In this paper we present a finite element analysis for a Dirichlet boundary control problem governed by the Stokes equation . The Dirichlet control is considered in a convex closed subset of the energy space H 1 ( Ω ) H1(Ω) . Most of the previous works on the Stokes Dirichlet boundary control problem deals with either tangential control or the case where the flux of the control is zero. This choice of the control is very particular and their choice of the formulation leads to the control with limited regularity. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce the Stokes problem with outflow condition and the control acts on the Dirichlet boundary only hence our control is more general and it has both the tangential and normal components. We prove well-posedness and discuss on the regularity of the control problem. The first-order optimality condition for the control leads to a Signorini problem. We develop a two-level finite element discretization by using P 1 P1 elements (on the fine mesh) for the velocity and the control variable and P 0 P0 elements (on the coarse mesh) for the pressure variable. The standard energy error analysis gives 1 2 + δ 2 12+δ2 order of convergence when the control is in H 3 2 + δ ( Ω ) H32+δ(Ω) space. Here we have improved it to 1 2 + δ 12+δ , which is optimal. Also, when the control lies in less regular space we derived optimal order of convergence up to the regularity. The theoretical results are corroborated by a variety of numerical tests.},

In present method, the traditional linear nodal interpolation functions for low order finite elements are enriched by the augmented enrichment function. For the purpose of improving the computation accuracy and reducing the numerical dispersion error, the polynomial bases and the trigonometric functions are utilized to form the enrichment functions. In addition, a simple and direct approach is introduced with the aim to tackle the possible linear dependence of the system equations. The numerical results show that the accuracy of the obtained numerical results can be markedly improved by the proposed method in comparison with the standard finite elements. What&#39;s more, it can be found that the calculated solutions from the proposed method with the appropriate temporal discretization scheme are able to monotonically converge to the exact solution in transient wave analysis. In consequence, it is possible to consistently increase the solution accuracy by directly decreasing temporal discretization step size. This valuable and important property enable the present approach to be particularly suitable to tackle the wave propagations in nonhomogeneous media.},

  abstract     = {Neutron diffusion kinetics equation contains a diffusion type equation and a set of ordinary differential equations, which form a coupled system. In this paper, we give a positivity theorem for neutron diffusion kinetics equation with delayed neutrons and propose a nonlinear positivity-preserving finite volume scheme on general star-shaped quadrilateral meshes, which can deal with discontinuous and anisotropy diffusion coefficient problems. The existence of solution for the nonlinear system is proved under certain constraint on time step size, which is independent of spatial mesh size. Three nonlinear iteration strategies are introduced to solve the nonlinear system. Numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate that the scheme is positivity-preserving and keeps approximately second order accuracy in space. The computational costs of three nonlinear iteration strategies are compared. Another example is also present to show some constraint on time step size is necessary for the convergence of the nonlinear iteration.},

  abstract     = {The presented article is based on the detection and resolution algorithms that are assigned to the adaptive finite element methods for solid mechanics problems, in which the boundary layer phenomenon cannot be neglected. In the considered problems , the quantity of interest is the global strain energy. The algorithms were applied within the exemplary hpq -adaptive finite element method composed of 3D-based hierarchical modelling and approximation , residual equilibration method of error estimation and a three step adaptive procedure. This procedure is extended through the inclusion of the additional step of adaptation where the boundary layer is a posteriori detected and resolved. The detection algorithm is based on a simple sensitivity analysis performed locally for the finite elements adjacent to the boundary. The detection algorithm is also extended onto: assessment of the boundary layer significance, determination of the optimal ratio of the exponential refinement, and iterative repetition of the refinement. The resolution of the boundary layer was based on the exponential (or graded) refinement of the mesh in the direction normal to the boundary. In the paper, our theoretical considerations, algorithms, and numerical examples are consistently limited to elliptic shells and plates, however the proposed approach can be extended to parabolic and hyperbolic shells.},

In contrast to the previous research on parabolic bio-heat transfer models, this work concerns a more involved and practical hyperbolic model used in biomedical engineering . First, the unique solvability of the linear inverse source problems is established. Then, the inverse problems are recast as variational problems , allowing the gradients of the least-squares objective functionals to be derived. These latter problems are solved iteratively using the conjugate gradient method combined with the discrepancy principle . Finally, the inversion algorithm is tested on identifying one- and two-dimensional space-dependent sources.},

  abstract     = {We reconstruct the unknown shape of a flow domain using partially available internal velocity measurements. This inverse problem is motivated by applications in cardiovascular imaging where motion-sensitive protocols, such as phase-contrast MRI, can be used to recover three-dimensional velocity fields inside blood vessels. In this context, the information about the domain shape serves to quantify the severity of pathological conditions, such as vessel obstructions. We consider a flow modeled by a linear Brinkman problem with a fictitious resistance accounting for the presence of additional boundaries. To reconstruct these boundaries, we employ a multi-step gradient-based variational method to compute a resistance that minimizes the difference between the computed flow velocity and the available data. Afterward, we apply different post-processing steps to reconstruct the shape of the internal boundaries. To limit the overall computational cost, we use a stabilized equal-order finite element method. We prove the stability and the well-posedness of the considered optimization problem. We validate our method on three-dimensional examples based on synthetic velocity data and using realistic geometries obtained from cardiovascular imaging.},

  abstract     = {Particles sedimentation in porous media is ubiquitous in natural and industrial fields. In this work, the immersed boundary method (IBM) and the lattice Boltzmann flux solver (LBFS) were combined to study the particles sedimentation in porous media for the first time. The hybrid method (IB-LBFS) preserves the advantages of the IBM in treating the solid-fluid boundaries and the LBFS in solving the fluid flow. The effects of porous media arrangement, particle-fluid density ratio, specific surface area, and particle diameter on the behaviors of the settling particles were discussed systematically. The results show that compared with the staggered array porous media, the in-line array porous media are beneficial for particles transport because of the low tortuosity. It is easier for the particles with high density to descend among obstacles due to a higher inertia. The averaged longitudinal coordinate of particles decreases rapidly for higher density ratio, whereas decreases slowly for lower density ratio. For porous media with identical porosity, the channel in porous media with large specific surface area is narrow, leading to the increase in gas-solid interaction and the decrease in particle flow velocity. In addition, for particles with the same total mass, the small particles are easier to descend than the large particles owing to the low collision probability between particles and porous media. The present work not only demonstrates the capacity of the IB-LBFS to deal with complicated fluid-solid interaction problems, but also sheds light on the mechanism of particles sedimentation in porous media.},
