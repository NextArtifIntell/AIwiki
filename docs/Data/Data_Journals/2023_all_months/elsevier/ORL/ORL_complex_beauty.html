In this paper, the alignment probability of other coalitions out of a priori coalition is considered as an affection, so that the relative value as a new CS-value is proposed. By different extension of splitting axioms, three kinds of relative values are introduced and axiomatized. These relative values not only take consideration of existing coalition structure, but also other possible coalition structures. Thus, the relative values for a coalition structure in this study are more stable than the Owen value, because the potential affection of other coalition structures is taken into consideration.},

This discrete model is instrumental in a simulation procedure to estimate the optimal reservation prices in the original continuous model. Important benefits of the proposed model are that the model is intuitive and close to reality, because it includes both the customers&#39; willingness to pay and substitution behavior explicitly, and it can handle any type of correlation between products.},

  abstract     = {It is a well-known result that bilevel linear optimization is NP-hard. In many publications, reformulations as mixed-integer linear optimization problems are proposed, which suggests that the decision version of the problem belongs to NP. However, to the best of our knowledge, a rigorous proof of membership in NP has never been published, so we close this gap by reporting a simple but not entirely trivial proof. A related question is whether a large enough “big M” for the classical KKT-based reformulation can be computed efficiently, which we answer in the affirmative. In particular, our big M has polynomial encoding length in the original problem data.},

  abstract     = {We consider bilevel linear programs (BLPs) that model hierarchical decision-making settings with two independent decision-makers (DMs), referred to as a leader (an upper-level DM) and a follower (a lower-level DM). BLPs are strongly NP -hard. In general, the follower&#39;s rational reaction (i.e., a set that contains optimal solutions of the lower-level problem for a given leader&#39;s decision) is not a singleton. If we assume that, for a given leader&#39;s decision, the follower always selects a solution from the rational reaction set that is most (least) favorable to the leader, then we obtain the optimistic (pessimistic) model. It is known that the optimistic (pessimistic) model remains NP -hard even if an optimal pessimistic (optimistic) solution of the same BLP is known. One interesting generalization of these two approaches studied in the related literature is to consider the so-called α -strong-weak model, where parameter α ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] α∈[0,1] controls the leader&#39;s level of conservatism. That is, α provides the probability of the follower&#39;s “cooperation” in a sense that, the lower-level&#39;s rational decisions that are most and least favorable to the leader are picked with probabilities α and 1 − α 1−α , respectively. In this note we show that for any fixed α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) α∈(0,1) the problem of finding an optimal α -strong-weak solution remains strongly NP -hard, even when both optimal optimistic and pessimistic solutions for the same BLP are known.},

In this paper, we explore four existing mixed integer optimization formulations of the max k -cut problem. Specifically, we show that the continuous relaxation of a binary quadratic optimization formulation of the problem is: (i) stronger than the continuous relaxation of two mixed integer linear optimization formulations and (ii) at least as strong as the continuous relaxation of a mixed integer semidefinite optimization formulation. We also conduct a set of experiments on multiple sets of instances of the max k -cut problem using state-of-the-art solvers that empirically confirm the theoretical results in item (i). Furthermore, these numerical results illustrate the advances in the efficiency of global non-convex quadratic optimization solvers and more general mixed integer nonlinear optimization solvers. As a result, these solvers provide a promising option to solve combinatorial optimization problems . Our codes and data are available on GitHub.},

Instead, we reframe the problem of finding good cutting planes as a continuous optimization problem over weights parametrizing families of valid inequalities. This problem can also be interpreted as optimizing a neural network to solve an optimization problem over subadditive functions, which we call the subadditive primal problem of the MILP. To do so, we propose a concrete two-step algorithm, and demonstrate empirical gains when optimizing generalized Gomory mixed-integer inequalities over various classes of MILPs.

These policies order a constant amount in every period from the slow supplier and order up to a target level in every period from the faster and more expensive supplier. We prove an asymptotic convergence result on the cost of an optimal TBS policy as the unit inventory holding cost goes to zero while keeping the service level constant and simultaneously increasing the unit cost of procurement from the faster supplier. The asymptotic value of cost also serves as an upper bound on the optimal cost of all dual sourcing systems with the same service level and product of unit procurement and holding cost. This bound is better than the previously best known upper bound on the cost of an optimal dual sourcing policy in the same regime.},

Memoryless policies, which take decisions based on the last observation only, are generally considered useless in the literature because we can construct POMDP instances for which optimal memoryless policies are arbitrarily worse than history-dependent ones. Our purpose is to challenge this belief. We show that optimal memoryless policies can be computed efficiently using mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and perform reasonably well on a wide range of instances from the literature. When strengthened with valid inequalities, the linear relaxation of this MILP provides high quality upper-bounds on the value of an optimal history dependent policy. Furthermore, when used with a finite horizon POMDP problem with memoryless policies as rolling optimization problem, a model predictive control approach leads to an efficient history-dependent policy, which we call the short memory in the future (SMF) policy. Basically, the SMF policy leverages these memoryless policies to build an approximation of the Bellman value function. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of our approach on benchmark instances from the literature.},

We study three popular approximation schemes for distributionally robust chance constrained programs over Wasserstein balls, where the ambiguity set contains all probability distributions within a certain Wasserstein distance to a reference distribution. The first approximation replaces the chance constraint with a bound on the conditional value-at-risk, the second approximation decouples different safety conditions via Bonferroni&#39;s inequality, and the third approximation restricts the expected violation of the safety condition(s) so that the chance constraint is satisfied. We show that the conditional value-at-risk approximation can be characterized as a tight convex approximation, which complements earlier findings on classical (non-robust) chance constraints, and we offer a novel interpretation in terms of transportation savings. We also show that the three approximations can perform arbitrarily poorly in data-driven settings, and that they are generally incomparable with each other.},

The diffusion limits are established in the many-server heavy-traffic regime where ( 1 − ρ n ) n α → β (1−ρn)nα→β as n → ∞ n→∞ , for α ∈ ( 0 , ∞ ) ∖ { 1 / 2 } α∈(0,∞)∖{1/2} and ρ n ρn a notion of normalized system load. This encompasses the so-called sub-Halfin-Whitt, super-Halfin-Whitt, non-degenerate slowdown, and super-slowdown regimes. The diffusion limits are universal in that they depend only on whether α α&amp;lt;1/2 or α &gt; 1 / 2 α&amp;gt;1/2 and do not depend on specific values of α and β in both cases.},

  abstract     = {The capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (CVRPSD) is a variant of the deterministic capacitated vehicle routing problem where customer demands are random variables. While the most successful formulations for several deterministic vehicle-routing problem variants are based on a set-partitioning formulation, adapting such formulations for the CVRPSD under mild assumptions on the demands remains challenging. In this work we provide an explanation to such challenge, by proving that when demands are given as a finite set of scenarios, solving the LP relaxation of such formulation is strongly NP-Hard. We also prove a hardness result for the case of independent normal demands.},

The estimates rely on expressions for subgradients and local Lipschitz moduli of min-value functions and require only the solution of the nominal problem. Across 54 mixed-integer optimization models, the median error in estimating the increase in minimum value is 12\%. The results inform analysts about the possibility of obtaining cost-effective, parameter-robust decisions.},

Unaware of complexity theory, they argued that, since partition is not known to have a simple algorithm, one cannot expect to find simple algorithms for these scheduling problems either. Their work did not go completely unnoticed, but it received little recognition. We describe the approach and review the results.},
