In those applications, it is essential to carry out valid inference after selecting a subset of the available variables. We construct confidence sets for the fixed effects in Gaussian LMMs that are based on Lasso-type estimators. Aside from providing confidence regions, this also allows for quantification of the joint uncertainty of both variable selection and parameter estimation in the procedure. To show that the resulting confidence sets for the fixed effects are uniformly valid over the parameter spaces of both the regression coefficients and the covariance parameters, we also prove the novel result on uniform Cramér consistency of the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimators of the covariance parameters. The superiority of the constructed confidence sets to naïve post-selection procedures is validated in simulations and illustrated with a study of the acid-neutralization capacity of lakes in the United States.},

The related wild bootstrap test turns out to be a consistent asymptotically level α α test. With the finite sample correction applied, the test keeps the level well. An extensive simulation study demonstrates good finite sample behaviour of the test in comparison to the existing procedures. The main role in the proofs is played by tools from empirical processes.

We present a new approach, the invariant orthogonal integration, permitting to obtain the exact first four moments of the RV coefficient under the null hypothesis. Our proposal can be applied to any multivariate setting endowed with Euclidean distances between the observations. It also covers the weighted setting of observations of unequal importance, where the exchangeability assumption, justifying the usual permutation tests , breaks down. The proposed RV moments express as simple functions of the kernel eigenvalues occurring in the weighted multidimensional scaling of the two configurations (spectral effective dimensionality, spectral skewness and spectral excess kurtosis). The expressions for the third and fourth moments seem original, and explain the marked asymmetry and kurtosis of the RV coefficient. They permit to test the significance of the RV coefficient by Cornish–Fisher cumulant expansion, beyond the normal approximation, as illustrated on a small dataset. The first three moments can be obtained by elementary means, but computing the fourth moment requires a more sophisticated apparatus, the Weingarten calculus for orthogonal groups .},

  abstract     = {The Gaussian covariance graph model is popular for revealing the underlying dependency structures among random variables. In this paper, we consider a spike and slab prior, which is a mixture of point-mass and normal distribution , on the off-diagonal entries. The spike and slab prior naturally introduces sparsity to the covariance structure so that the resulting posterior renders covariance structure learning. Under the spike and slab prior, we calculate the posterior model probabilities of covariance structures and natural Bayesian quantities for model selection using the Laplace approximation . We show that the error due to the Laplace approximation becomes asymptotically marginal at a rate that depends on the posterior convergence rate of the covariance matrix under the Frobenius norm . We propose a covariance structure estimation method based on the approximated posterior model probabilities . We also propose a block coordinate descent algorithm to determine the mode of the posterior density conditional on the structure of the covariance. The posterior mode is an estimate of the covariance matrix once the structure is chosen and the Laplace approximation is computed around it. Through a simulation study based on five numerical models, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms its competitors. The proposed method is applied to the breast cancer and Parkinson’s disease datasets, as well as the prediction of telephone call counts using telephone call center data, and compared with its competitors in terms of the linear discriminant analysis classification accuracy.},

To balance the ability to detect two types of changes, that is, a change from the null to the alternative and back to the null, we propose a new multiple testing procedure based on a penalized version of the generalized likelihood ratio test statistics for change detection. The false discovery rate (FDR) at each time point is shown to be controlled under some mild conditions on the dependence structure of data streams.

However, most of the existing methods are developed based on regularization strategy and model assumptions such as linear model and Gaussian distribution , which limit their application range. And also, they were mainly designed to deal with univariate response and cannot handle multiple responses situations. To tackle these issues, we introduce a new association measure for multiple responses and univariate predictor, called multiple explained variability (MEV), and further propose a feature screening procedure, named MEV-SIS, based on MEV. MEV-SIS removes the commonly used model assumptions and can conduct feature screening for multiple responses simultaneously. The asymptotic properties of MEV are deduced, and the sure screening property and ranking consistency property of MEV-SIS are obtained. Extensive simulation studies and real data application demonstrate the advantage of MEV-SIS over the existing screening procedures in sufficiency and robustness.},

This paper links compositional data analysis with graph signal processing, and it extends the Aitchison geometry to a setting where only selected log-ratios can be considered. The presented framework retains the desirable properties of scale invariance and compositional coherence. A real data example from bioinformatics underlines the usefulness of this approach.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider an estimation problem in a generalized tensor regression model with multi-mode covariates . We generalize the main results in recent literature in four ways. First, we weaken assumptions underlying the main results of the previous works. In particular, the dependence structure of the error and covariates are as weak as an L 2 − L2− mixingale array, and the error term does not need to be uncorrelated with regressors . Second, we consider a more general constraint than the one considered in previous works. Third, we establish the asymptotic properties of the tensor estimators. Specifically, we derive the joint asymptotic distribution of the unrestricted tensor estimator (UE) and restricted tensor estimator (RE). Fourth, we propose a class of shrinkage-type estimators in the context of tensor regression, and under a general loss function, we derive sufficient conditions for which the shrinkage estimators dominate the UE. In addition to these interesting contributions, we derive a kind of functional central limit theorem for mixingale vector-valued and we establish some identities which are useful in studying the risk dominance of shrinkage-type tensor estimators. Finally, to illustrate the application of the proposed methods, we corroborate the results by some simulation studies of binary, Normal and Poisson data and we analyze a multi-relational network and neuro-imaging datasets.},

  abstract     = {Selection of covariates is crucial in the estimation of average treatment effects given observational data with high or even ultra-high dimensional pretreatment variables. Existing methods for this problem typically assume sparse linear models for both outcome and univariate treatment, and cannot handle situations with ultra-high dimensional covariates . In this paper, we propose a new covariate selection strategy called double screening prior adaptive lasso (DSPAL) to select confounders and predictors of the outcome for multivariate treatments, which combines the adaptive lasso method with the marginal conditional (in)dependence prior information to select target covariates, in order to eliminate confounding bias and improve statistical efficiency. The distinctive features of our proposal are that it can be applied to high-dimensional or even ultra-high dimensional covariates for multivariate treatments, and can deal with the cases of both parametric and nonparametric outcome models, which makes it more robust compared to other methods. Our theoretical analyses show that the proposed procedure enjoys the sure screening property, the ranking consistency property and the variable selection consistency. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed approach selects all confounders and predictors consistently and estimates the multivariate treatment effects with smaller bias and mean squared error compared to several alternatives under various scenarios. In real data analysis, the method is applied to estimate the causal effect of a three-dimensional continuous environmental treatment on cholesterol level and enlightening results are obtained.},

We suggest a slicing procedure to estimate the kernel projection divergence, which divides a random sample of size n n into H H slices, each of size c c . The entire procedure has the complexity of O ( n 2 ) O(n2) , which is prohibitive if n n is extremely large. To alleviate computational complexity, we implement this slicing procedure together with a block-wise estimation, which divides the whole sample into B B blocks, each of size d d . This block-wise and slicing estimation has the complexity of O { n ( c + d + log n ) } O{n(c+d+logn)} , which reduces the computational complexity substantially if c c and d d are relatively small. The resultant estimation is asymptotically normal and has the convergence rate of { n ( c d ) / ( c + d ) } − 1 / 2 {n(cd)/(c+d)}−1/2 . More importantly, this block-wise implementation has the same asymptotic properties as the naive slicing estimation, if c c is relatively small, indicating that the block-wise implementation does not result in power loss in independence tests. We demonstrate the computational efficiencies and theoretical properties of this block-wise and slicing estimation through simulations and an application to psychological datasets.},

These loadings matrices are then estimated using an eigendecomposition of symmetric non-negative definite matrices involving the real and imaginary parts of the spectral matrix.

However, most current approaches do not yet guarantee positive definiteness or deal with the asymptotic efficiency of the covariance estimator. Focusing on the classical setting when the number of Gaussian variables is fixed and the sample size increases, we construct a positive definite and asymptotically efficient estimator by the iterative conditional fitting algorithm (Chaudhuri et al., 2007) when the location of the zero entries is known. If the location of the zero entries is unknown, we further construct a positive definite thresholding estimator by combining the iterative conditional fitting algorithm with thresholding . We prove our thresholding estimator is asymptotically efficient with probability tending to one. In simulation studies, we show our estimator more closely matches the true covariance and more correctly identifies the non-zero entries than competing estimators. We apply our estimator to a neuroimaging study of Huntington disease to detect non-zero correlations among brain regional volumes. Such correlations are timely for ongoing treatment studies to inform how different brain regions are likely to be affected by these treatments.},

In this paper, we introduce a new family of iterative schemes based on vector extrapolation methods. We also construct and numerically test a randomly relaxed version of the scheme. Our results demonstrate that these new strategies can significantly and stably accelerate the convergence of the EM algorithm compared to existing methods. Moreover, these strategies are highly versatile as they can accelerate any linearly convergent fixed point iteration , including EM-type algorithms. Finally, we provide statistical modeling experiments at the end of the paper to demonstrate the applicability and interest of these convergence acceleration schemes, whether applied to the EM algorithm or one of its variants.},

  abstract     = {The behavior of the leading singular values and vectors of noisy low-rank matrices is fundamental to many statistical and scientific problems. Theoretical understanding currently derives from asymptotic analysis under one of two regimes: classical , with a fixed number of rows, large number of columns or vice versa; and proportional , with large numbers of rows and columns, proportional to one another. This paper is concerned with the disproportional regime, where the matrix is either “tall and narrow” or “short and wide”: we study sequences of matrices of size n × m n n×mn with aspect ratio n / m n → 0 n/mn→0 or n / m n → ∞ n/mn→∞ as n → ∞ n→∞ . This regime has important “big data” applications. Theory derived here shows that the displacement of the empirical singular values and vectors from their noise-free counterparts and the associated phase transitions—well-known under proportional growth asymptotics—still occur in the disproportionate setting. They must be quantified, however, on a novel scale of measurement that adjusts with the changing aspect ratio as the matrix size increases. In this setting, the top singular vectors corresponding to the longer of the two matrix dimensions are asymptotically uncorrelated with the noise-free signal.},

In this work, we study the non-asymptotic behavior of these estimators, for data sampled from a distribution that satisfies one of the following properties: (1) independent sub-Gaussian entries, up to a linear transformation ; (2) log-concave distributions; (3) distributions satisfying a convex concentration property. Our main contribution is the derivation of tight non-asymptotic concentration bounds of these M-estimators around a suitably scaled version of the data sample covariance matrix . Prior to our work, non-asymptotic bounds were derived only for Elliptical and Gaussian distributions. Our proof uses a variety of tools from non asymptotic random matrix theory and high dimensional geometry. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our results on two examples of practical interest: sparse covariance and sparse precision matrix estimation.},

There exist an abundance of validation methods that, implicitly or explicitly, assume a certain clustering notion. In this paper, we focus on groups that can be well separated by quadratic or linear boundaries. The reference cluster concept is defined through the quadratic discriminant function and parameters describing clusters’ size, center and scatter. We develop two cluster-quality criteria that are consistent with groups generated from a class of elliptic–symmetric distributions. Using the bootstrap resampling of the proposed criteria, we propose a selection rule that allows choosing among many clustering solutions, eventually obtained from different methods. Extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed methodology achieves a better overall performance compared to established alternatives from the literature.},

By virtue of the m m -dependence approximation of a stationary random field, it is shown that under certain regularity conditions , the proposed GISE statistics has an asymptotic normal distribution . Further, a grid-based block bootstrap (GBBB) procedure is also proposed to deal with the complicated asymptotic variance involved in the limit distribution.

It can measure the marginal and conditional contributions of any subset of all available explanatory variables to the overall regression association in a hierarchical manner taking into account the order of the explanatory variables. Thus, the proposed method enables a holistic description of various aspects of regression association in a multivariate contingency table, including marginal and conditional associations between an ordinal response variable and a subset of explanatory variables of interest. We investigate theoretical properties of the proposed decomposition method , and we further illustrate its performance through simulation and two real data examples, one from a randomized controlled trial and the other from a longitudinal epidemiological study.},

When the number of samples is less than this amount, reliable recovery of all edges is impossible. In many applications, it is more important to learn the distribution of the edge (coupling) parameters over the network than the specific locations of the edges. Assuming that the entire graph can be partitioned into a number of spatial regions with similar edge parameters and reasonably regular boundaries, we develop new information-theoretic sample complexity bounds and show that a bounded number of samples can be sufficient to consistently recover these regions. Finally, we introduce and analyze an efficient region growing algorithm capable of recovering the regions with high accuracy.

Error variances in all cells are assumed to be heterogeneous and data are unbalanced. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) and two heuristic tests named Min-T and Max-T are proposed. Numerical procedures to find solutions of likelihood equations under null hypothesis space and full parameter space are developed. The existence and uniqueness of the solutions and the convergence of the algorithm are established. Parametric bootstrap (PB) is used to evaluate critical points and to estimate sizes and powers of these tests. Asymptotic distributions of the heuristic test statistics are derived and tests are proposed based on these also. Asymptotic accuracy of bootstrap procedures is established in all cases. Using Max-T test we have derived simultaneous confidence intervals for successive pair-wise differences of row-effects. An extensive simulation study shows that all the proposed PB tests maintain a preassigned type I error 0.05. Power comparison shows that LRT achieves more power values than all the other tests. However, Min-T and Max-T tests are easy to implement and take considerably less time as these do not need the evaluation of maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs). The robustness of all tests is also studied and it is seen that LRT is not robust for some skewed distributions. However, heuristic tests are robust in all cases. This is also one advantage of using Min-T and Max-T tests.},

Our main result is that, if P P and Q Q are both elliptical distributions , then, to show that P = Q P=Q , it suffices merely to check that P L = Q L PL=QL for a certain set of ( d 2 + d ) / 2 (d2+d)/2 lines L L .

In order to analyze such longitudinal data , we need to consider the correlations from the same subject, and it is inappropriate to use a simple multivariate model assuming independence structure. Motivated by a large scale longitudinal public health study that requires longitudinal data analysis with correlated multivariate discrete responses from repeated measurements and very high dimensional covariates , we adopt a flexible semiparametric approach for simultaneous variable selection and estimation without the requirement of specifying the full likelihood. Specifically, we propose generalized partially linear single-index models using penalized quadratic inference functions for longitudinal data in ultra-high dimensions. A key feature is that we allow the number of single-index covariates in the nonparametric term to diverge and even to be in ultra-high dimensions. The penalized quadratic inference functions easily incorporate within-subject correlation and pursue efficient estimation, and the single-index models can incorporate nonlinearity and some interactions while avoiding the curse of dimensionality . In this challenging setting, we contribute both an efficient algorithm and new asymptotic theory for our proposed approach for diverging and even ultra-dimensional covariates and a multivariate correlated response in longitudinal data. We apply our method to investigate diabetes status within a continuing longitudinal public health study with very high-dimensional genetic variables and phenotype variables.},

  abstract     = {We revisit the well-known Behrens–Fisher problem in an original and challenging high-dimensional framework, and propose a testing procedure which accommodates a low-dimensional latent factor model. The developed inferential framework is general, as it applies to problems where the underlying populations may be non-normal, the dimension of the population mean vectors may highly exceed the sample size, the design may be unbalanced, and the loading factor dimensions may be different. Under a high-dimensional asymptotic regime, combined with fairly weak technical conditions, we show that null limiting distributions of the test statistics follow a weighted mixture of chi-square distributions, which depends only on the spectrum of the noise covariance matrix and the number of latent factors. As these latter are usually unknown in practice, we exploit an estimation procedure which builds on recent advances in random matrix theory . The asymptotic power of the proposed test is established. A numerical study confirms good analytical properties of the new test that compares favorably to existing procedures used in a similar context. Real data applications are demonstrated with a study of a leukemia data set.},

When the dimension of these two random vectors are fixed, the existing tests based on the distance covariance and Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion with many desirable properties , including the capacity to capture linear and non-linear dependence. However, these tests may fail to capture the non-linear dependence due to the “curse of dimensionality” when the random vectors are high dimensional. To attack this problem, we propose a general framework for testing the dependence of two random vectors to randomly select two subspaces consisting of components of the vectors, respectively. To enhance the performance of this method, we repeatedly implement this procedure to construct the final test statistic. The new method can also work for non-linear dependence detection in a high-dimensional setup. Theoretically, if the replication time tends to infinity to get the final statistic, we can avoid potential power loss caused by lousy subspaces. Therefore, the two proposed tests are consistent with general alternatives. The weak limit under the null hypothesis is normal; thus, determining critical value need not resort to resampling approximation. We demonstrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed test by using Monte Carlo simulations and the analysis for a real-data example.},

As a complement, it is shown here that the Aitchison–Lauder estimator can achieve the minimax rate asymptotically for a suitable choice of bandwidth whenever ( p , β ) ∈ [ 1 , 3 ) × ( 0 , 2 ] (p,β)∈[1,3)×(0,2] or ( p , β ) ∈ A d (p,β)∈Ad , where A d Ad is a specific subset of [ 3 , 4 ) × ( 0 , 2 ] [3,4)×(0,2] that depends on the dimension d d of the Dirichlet kernel.

In each case, the resulting portmanteau test statistic is based on multivariate residuals and multivariate squared residuals. Moreover, single- and multiple-lag mixed multivariate portmanteau-type tests are introduced. These test statistics are designed to detect different forms of inadequacies in the model residuals jointly. All proposed tests take uncertainty due to model estimation properly into account. The asymptotic null distribution of each test statistic follows from the asymptotic distribution of the general portmanteau-type test statistic in a natural way. Some considerations are given to the empirical size and power of six test statistics via a simulation study. All tests have satisfactory size and power properties in finite samples. To demonstrate their practical use, the proposed test statistics are applied to the residuals of a vector bivariate nonlinear threshold model fitted to U.S. interest rates.},

In this paper, a penalized Whittle likelihood approach is developed for nonparametric estimation of spectral density functions for regularly spaced spatial data. In particular, the estimated spectral density is the minimizer of a criterion which is developed based on the Whittle likelihood and a penalty for roughness. This approach aggregates several popular nonparametric density estimation methods into a coherent framework. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are derived under mild assumptions without assuming Gaussianity. In addition, a computationally efficient method is developed to optimize the penalized likelihood function.

To estimate the regression coefficients robustly, we apply the projected principal component analysis method to recover the factors and nonparametric loadings. The Huber estimator and the penalized Huber estimator of the regression coefficients are obtained through iterative optimization procedures, where both factors and idiosyncratic errors are allowed to be heavy-tailed and serially-correlated. Moreover, we establish the non-asymptotic properties of the estimated factors, loadings, and regression coefficients under some mild conditions.

Typically, this model is used in stochastic hydrology, with N N as the number of raindays, and S S as total rainfall amount during a certain time period, or in actuarial science , with N N as the number of losses, and S S as total loss expenditure during a certain time period. The compound Poisson exponential model is characterized in the way that a specific transform associated with the distribution of ( S , N ) (S,N) satisfies a certain differential equation. Mimicking the function part of this equation by substituting the empirical counterparts of the transform we obtain an expression the weighted integral of the square of which is used as test statistic. We deal with two variants of the latter, one of which being invariant under scale transformations of the S S -part by fixed positive constants. Critical values are obtained by using a parametric bootstrap procedure. The asymptotic behavior of the tests is discussed. A simulation study demonstrates the performance of the tests in the finite sample case. The procedure is applied to rainfall data and to an actuarial dataset.

  abstract     = {Measuring the dependency between lagged random vectors in time series is extremely important to detect appropriate models for fitting real data. Vector autoregressive processes (VAR), in particular, are among the most popular multivariate time series that allow modeling schemes for two or more random variables. However, if the series of innovations process does not have finite second-order moments, the classical analysis that uses the empirical auto-covariance function is not adequate as its theoretical counterpart is not defined. After perceiving the lack of a suitable multivariate version of the codifference function, we propose an adaptation of this tool to measure interdependence in multivariate α -stable processes. We establish such a function based on notions presented in the existing literature. We also show some of its properties and give an estimator based on the empirical characteristic function. Subsequently, we evaluate another measure of dependence with different properties but similar usage for comparison reasons. These two measures are computed for VAR(1) processes with α -stable innovations, proving to be useful in the identification of associated patterns related to them. Finally, we demonstrate how these measures can be applied with real data sets by analyzing the monthly number of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and the registered values of PM10 in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, from January 2008 to December 2021.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the uniform limit theory for a U U -statistic of increasing degree, also called an infinite-degree U U -statistic. Infinite-degree U U -statistics (IDUS) (or infinite-order U U -statistics (IOUS)) are useful tool for constructing simultaneous prediction intervals that quantify the uncertainty of several methods such as subbagging and random forests. The stochastic process based on collections of U U -statistics is referred to as a U U -process, and if the U U -statistic is of infinite-degree, we have an infinite-degree U U -process. Heilig and Nolan (2001) provided conditions for the pointwise asymptotic theory for the infinite-degree U U -processes. The main purpose here is to extend their findings to the Markovian setting. The second aim is to provide the uniform limit theory for the renewal bootstrap for the infinite-degree U U -process, which is of its own interest. The main ingredients are the decoupling technique combined with symmetrization techniques of Heilig and Nolan (2001) to obtain uniform weak law of large numbers and functional central limit theorem for the infinite-degree U U -process. The results obtained in this paper are, to our knowledge, the first known results on the infinite-degree U U -process in the Markovian setting.},

Classical statistical and machine learning techniques can be used on these representations for downstream tasks and applications. Here, we consider an unsupervised downstream task, namely, topic modeling with mixed membership models. Prototypical mixed membership models like the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model use only simple discrete observed features. However, state-of-the-art representations of images, text, and other modalities are given by continuous feature vectors. Therefore, we study mixed membership Gaussians that operate on continuous feature vectors. We prove that the parameters of this model can be learned efficiently and effectively by Pearson’s method of moments and corroborate our theoretical findings on synthetic data. Experiments on standard labeled image data sets show that mixed membership Gaussians on state-of-the-art image representations yield topics that are semantically meaningful, coherent, and cover the labels that have not been used during training well.},

One of the appealing properties of the Gaussian distribution is that conditional independence can be fully characterized by the sparseness in the precision matrix. The skewed Gaussian distribution adds a shape parameter to the Gaussian distribution to take into account possible skewness in the data; thus it is more flexible than the Gaussian model. Nevertheless, the appealing property of the Gaussian distribution is retained to a large degree: the conditional independence is still characterized by the sparseness in the parameters, which now include a shape parameter in addition to the precision matrix. As a result, the skewed Gaussian graphical model can be efficiently estimated through a penalized likelihood method just as the Gaussian graphical model. We develop an algorithm to maximize the penalized likelihood based on the alternating direction method of multipliers , and establish the asymptotic normality and variable selection consistency for the new estimator. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our method performs better than the Gaussian and Gaussian copula methods when these distributional assumptions are not satisfied. The method is applied to a breast cancer MicroRNA dataset to construct a gene network, which shows better interpretability than the Gaussian graphical model.},

Under some regularity conditions , the oracle property is established, which the number of parameters is allowed to diverge. Furthermore, we also propose a split-and-conquer variable selection procedure for high-dimensional general semiparametric models with massive data. Under some weak regularity conditions , we establish the oracle property of the proposed procedure when the number of subsets does not grow too fast. What is more, the split-and-conquer procedure enjoys the oracle property as the penalized estimator by using all the dataset, and can substantially reduce computing time and computer memory requirements.

We also investigate a multivariate Gaussian-based symmetric multiproposal mechanism and prove that it also enjoys the same simplified acceptance step. This insight leads to significant theoretical and practical speedups.

  abstract     = {Weighted nearest neighbors (WNN) classifiers are popular non-parametric classifiers. Despite the significant progress in WNN, most existing WNN classifiers are designed for traditional supervised learning problems where both training samples and test samples are assumed to be independent and identically distributed. However, in many real applications, it could be difficult or expensive to obtain training samples from the distribution of interest. Therefore, data collected from some related distributions are often used as supplementary training data for the classification task under the distribution of interest. It is essential to develop effective classification methods that could incorporate both training samples from the distribution of interest (if they exist) and supplementary training samples from a different but related distribution. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Transfer learning weighted Nearest Neighbors (TNN) classifier. As a WNN classifier, TNN determines the weights on the class labels of training samples for different test samples adaptively by minimizing an upper bound on the conditional expectation of the estimation error of the regression function . It puts decreasing weights on the class labels of the successive more distant neighbors. To accommodate the difference between training samples from the distribution of interest and supplementary training samples, TNN adds a non-negative offset to the distance between each supplementary training sample and the test sample, and thus constrains the excessive influence of the supplementary training samples on the prediction. Our theoretical studies show that, under certain conditions, TNN is consistent and minimax optimal (up to a logarithmic factor) in the covariate shift setting. In the posterior drift or the more general setting where both covariate shift and posterior drift exist, the excess risk of TNN depends on the maximum posterior discrepancy between the distribution of the supplementary training samples and the distribution of interest. Both our simulation studies and an application to the land use/land cover mapping problem in geography demonstrate that TNN outperforms other existing methods. It can serve as an effective tool for transfer learning.},

  abstract     = {Principal Components Analysis is a widely used approach of multivariate analysis . Over the past 30 years, it has gained renewed attention in the context of functional data, chiefly as a commonly used tool for dimension reduction or feature extraction. Consequently, a large body of statistical theory has been developed to justify its application in various contexts. This theory focuses on the convergence of sample PCs to their population counterparts in a multitude of statistical models and under diverse data collection assumptions. What such results have in common is the assumption that the population covariance operator exists.This paper is concerned with multivariate and functional data that have infinite variance and, consequently, for which the population covariance operator is not defined. However, the sample covariance operator and its eigenfunctions are always defined. It has been unknown what the asymptotic behavior of these important statistics is in the context of infinite variance multivariate or functional data. We derive suitable large sample theory . In particular, we specify normalizing sequences and conditions for suitably defined consistency. We study multivariate models in which explicit limits can be derived. These examples show that definitions, results and intuition developed for multivariate and functional data with finite variance need not apply in the setting we consider.},

In this paper we consider a generalization of this measure, where the random variables of main interest ( Y ( 1 ) , Y ( 2 ) ) (Y(1),Y(2)) are observed together with a random covariate X ∈ R d X∈Rd , and where the Y ( 1 ) Y(1) excess is also power transformed. This leads to the concept of conditional marginal excess moment for which an estimator is proposed allowing extrapolation outside the data range. The main asymptotic properties of this estimator have been established, using empirical processes arguments combined with the multivariate extreme value theory . The finite sample behavior of the estimator is evaluated by a simulation experiment. We apply also our method on a vehicle insurance customer dataset.},

The regions of rejection are computed using a bootstrap procedure which mimics conditional independence by generating samples from the product measure of the estimated conditional marginals. Under certain (high-level) conditions (on the estimated conditional marginals), rates of convergence for the weighted partial copula process and the test statistic as well as the weak convergence under the null of the normalized test statistic are established. These high-level conditions on the estimated margins are shown to be valid in a variety of examples ranging from nonparametric kernel to linear quantile regression estimates. Finally, an experimental section demonstrates that the proposed test has competitive power compared to recent state-of-the-art methods such as kernel-based test.},

Nevertheless, many more skewness measures, or also called asymmetry measures (or indices) exist, each with their benefits. Extending the concept of skewness or asymmetry to a multivariate setting is a much harder problem. Attempts have been made, but the unanimity of the univariate setting is no longer present. Most asymmetry indices are scalar or vector based measures, but this can lead to a loss of information concerning asymmetry. To this end, we propose a novel functional asymmetry index which is based on the natural idea of reflective symmetry around the mode. The proposed index is also extended to the multivariate setting and a summarizing scalar (or vector based index in multivariate setting) is derived from it.},

The test is easy to implement with no tuning parameters, robust to heavy-tailedness and theoretically justified with both fixed- n n and sequential asymptotics under both null and alternatives, where n n is the sample size. We demonstrate that the fixed- n n asymptotics provide a better approximation to the finite sample distribution and thus should be preferred in both testing and testing-based estimation. To estimate the number and locations when multiple change-points are present, we propose to combine the p p -value under the fixed- n n asymptotics with the seeded binary segmentation (SBS) algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show that the spatial sign based procedures are robust with respect to the heavy-tailedness and strong coordinate-wise dependence, whereas their non-robust counterparts proposed in Wang et al. (2022) [28] appear to under-perform. A real data example is also provided to illustrate the robustness and broad applicability of the proposed test and its corresponding estimation algorithm.},

We considered a recently introduced class of prior distributions, which is called the family of enriched standard conjugate prior distributions , and compared the Bayesian predictive distributions based on these prior distributions. Furthermore, we studied the performance of the Bayesian predictive distribution based on the reference prior distribution in the family and showed that there exists a prior distribution in the family that dominates the reference prior distribution.

In multivariate linear regression on the other hand, predictors that are neither correlated with both the remaining predictors nor with the dependent variables have a regression coefficients equal to zero. Hence, if the goal is to select a number of predictors, variables that do not correlate are discarded as it is also done in principal loading analysis. That both methods select the same variables occurs not only for the special case of zero correlation however. We contribute conditions under which both methods share the same variable selection.

In this article, we introduce an extention of the Heckman sample selection model to the wide class of symmetric distributions . In the new class of sample selection models, covariates are used to describe its dispersion and correlation parameters explaining heteroscedasticity and sample selection bias, respectively. We derive mathematical and statistical properties of the introduced model, and estimate its parameters with the maximum likelihood method .
