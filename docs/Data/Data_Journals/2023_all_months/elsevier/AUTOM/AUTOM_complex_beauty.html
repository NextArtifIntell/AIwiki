  abstract     = {This paper investigates the event-triggered control problem for a class of strict-feedback uncertain nonlinear systems . For such kind of systems, many backstepping-based event-triggered control methods have been proposed. However, these currently available methods all adopt static event conditions which cannot simultaneously guarantee zero tracking/stabilization error and non-existence of the Zeno behavior. In this paper, a dynamic event-triggered control scheme for strict-feedback uncertain nonlinear systems is proposed. In this scheme, an auxiliary dynamic variable is included in the event condition. By properly designing the dynamics of this auxiliary variable, the proposed dynamic event-triggered control scheme can ensure zero tracking/stabilization error in the absence of Zeno behavior. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and verify the established theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The static output feedback control problem is important, as it is concerned with the case when one cannot measure all state variables. It seeks to obtain a stabilising control under these conditions and is, often, difficult to solve. For a certain class of linear dynamical systems, we provide a novel approach to obtain a stabilising control gain matrix . The class of plants considered is of those, for which we can measure at least half of all state variables and where those measurements affect at least half of all state variables. Moreover, when we write the (linearly transformed) system matrix in block form, we require that either the two lower block matrices are nonsingular, or, if the inputs affect the measured state variables directly, at least the lower left one is nonsingular. We then show that we can determine the stabilising control gain matrix from the solution of a linear matrix inequality. Finally, we apply the approach to different benchmark problems, where it performs well, and confirm its good performance through additional numerical experiments.},

The local estimates of the observer are sampled and updated at the periodic sampling time, while the local samples are transmitted aperiodically between neighboring agents. Thus, it allows the asynchronous intermittent communication in the network with the interval time-varying communication delay. Then, the distributed controller is constructed based on the distributed observer to achieve exponential output synchronization.

  abstract     = {This paper concerns the problem of tracking a position-related periodic signal for an uncertain nonlinear rotational system. Applying the additive-state-decomposition (ASD) technique decomposes the original uncertain nonlinear system into two subsystems: A primary linear time-invariant system that performs spatial repetitive control, and a secondary nonlinear system that ensures robust stability of the whole system with respect to unknown nonlinear dynamics and exogenous disturbances . This method has four features: (i) The ASD technique provides an effective way to deal with the coupling between the spatial periodicity and other factors (temporal and state-dependent uncertainties and disturbances) in a rotational system. This technique ensures satisfactory tracking and disturbance rejection performance; (ii) A real-time digital implementation of a spatial repetitive controller enables repetitive control with an exact period in the position. This ensures the synchronous execution of repetitive control in the position domain and robust stability in the time domain; (iii) The method of accurate phase compensation in a spatial repetitive controller leads to a significant improvement in steady-state tracking performance; and (iv) An extended-state observer precisely estimates the overall effect of disturbances. Integrating a disturbance estimate into a control input effectively compensates for disturbances. Stability criteria and design algorithms are presented in detail. Finally, experiments of a rotational speed-control system demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.},

In contrast to the current numerical approaches, which are based on the discretization of the continuous-time FBSDE, we propose a converse approach, namely, we obtain a discrete-time approximation of the value function, and then we derive a discrete-time estimator that resembles the continuous-time counterpart. The proposed approach allows for the construction of higher accuracy estimators along with an error analysis. The approach is applied to the policy improvement step in a reinforcement learning framework. Numerical results, along with the corresponding error analysis, demonstrate that the proposed estimators show significant improvement in terms of accuracy over classical Euler–Maruyama-based estimators. In the case of LQ problems, we demonstrate that our estimators result in near machine-precision level accuracy, in contrast to previously proposed methods that can potentially diverge on the same problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the minimal order of strongly stabilizing controllers for a two-link planar robot moving in a vertical plane with a single actuator and sensor, focusing on stabilizing the robot around its upright equilibrium point where both links are upright. By designing an output as the horizontal displacement of a point along the second link’s straight line, existing literature demonstrates that the robot’s strong stabilization problem is equivalent to that of a fourth-order linear plant, featuring two pairs of symmetric real poles and adjustable zeros. In contrast to an existing second-order strongly stabilizing controller tailored to a pair of symmetric real zeros around the origin within a given range, this paper achieves four main contributions. First, this paper obtains a parameterization of second-order strongly stabilizing controllers allowing the positive real zero in an expanded range. Second, this paper considers the plant with a pair of symmetric real zeros around the origin, a double origin zero, and a pair of conjugate imaginary zeros in a unified manner, and presents a more general parameterization of second-order strongly stabilizing controllers accommodating these three types of zeros in a more expanded range. Third, this paper provides a necessary and sufficient condition on these zeros (equivalently, all ranges of the observation point) for the existence of a second-order strongly stabilizing controller. Fourth, this paper demonstrates that a first-order stabilizing controller does not exist for the plant, regardless of its types of zeros, confirming that the minimal order of the strongly stabilizing controllers is two. This paper obtains all feasible regions for the parameters in each parameterization by explicitly expressing the range of each parameter using inequalities in a cascade structure, which makes the inequalities easy to check and verify. The results are applicable to both the Acrobot and Pendubot. The paper validates the theoretical findings through numerical investigations and simulations.},

Under some mild assumptions, a novel I&amp;I adaptive control algorithm is proposed, leading to an interconnection of an ISS estimation error subsystem and an ISS tracking error subsystem. Using an ISS small-gain condition, the desired uniform global asymptotic stability of the resulting interconnected “error” system can be achieved and a sum-type strict Lyapunov function can be explicitly constructed. Taking advantage of this ISS-based design framework, it is shown that the corresponding robustness with respect to the input perturbation can be rendered ISS. To remove the need to solve the immersion manifold shaping PDE, a new filter-based approach is proposed, which preserves the ISS-based design framework. Finally, we demonstrate the validness of the proposed framework on a tracking problem for series elastic actuators.},

Prominent examples with two shape variables are the low Reynolds number 3-link “Purcell swimmer” with inputs of 2 joint angles and the “ideal fluid” swimmer. Gait analysis of these systems allows for intelligent decisions to be made about the swimmer’s locomotive properties, increasing the potential for robotic autonomy. In this work, we present comparative analysis of gait optimization using two different methods. The first method is variational approach of “Pontryagin’s maximum principle” ( PMP ) from optimal control theory. We apply PMP for several variants of 3-link swimmers, with and without incorporation of bounds on joint angles. The second method is differential–geometric analysis of the gaits based on curvature (total Lie bracket) of the local connection for 3-link swimmers. Using optimized body-motion coordinates, contour plots of the curvature in shape space give visualization that enables identifying distance-optimal gaits as zero level sets. Combining and comparing results of the two methods enables better understanding of changes in existence, shape and topology of distance-optimal gait trajectories, depending on the swimmers’ parameters.},

  abstract     = {LaSalle theorems, sometimes called as invariance-like theorems, have witnessed abundant applications as powerful tools of analysing system convergence. However, these theorems have twofold limitations: On the one hand, the uniformity of convergence with respect to initial state values cannot be offered, which indicates that the possibility of excessively slow convergence could not be ruled out for a given bounded set of initial state values. On the other hand, unbounded time-variations are not allowed in the systems, and meanwhile, the boundedness of all the states are required even if one merely concerns the convergence of partial states, precluding many scenarios with the unboundedness (e.g., induced by stochastic noise) for some states defined on the whole time horizon. Towards the limitations of LaSalle theorems, this paper seeks to further develop convergence theorems in the stochastic framework. First, a Lyapunov-like function based theorem on the convergence owning the uniformity with respect to initial state values is presented for Itô-type stochastic systems , with the infinitesimal of Lyapunov-like functions exploited more delicately than those in stochastic LaSalle theorems. Based on this, a framework of adaptive stabilization with the uniformity of convergence is established for uncertain stochastic nonlinear systems . In particular, the performance specifications involved are impossible to achieve by applying LaSalle theorems as in the related results. Second, an enlarged convergence theorem is established with Lyapunov-like conditions moderately relaxed, which allows the unboundedness for partial states defined on the whole time horizon and has potential applications in the presence of unbounded time-variations. What is notable, the enlarged convergence theorem is nontrivial to verify, which compels us to propose an extended Barbălat lemma with the conventional requirement of uniform continuity relaxed in the stochastic framework.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies distributed time-varying formation control problems for a class of linear systems with heterogeneous uncertainties and directed graphs. Both the cases without and with an active leader having unknown control inputs are considered. Two new robust adaptive formation protocols are designed in a totally distributed fashion, both of which incorporate two parts: a fully distributed nominal controller relying on the neighbors’ relative state information and an adaptive compensating signal to restrain the influences of uncertainties. An original adaptive compensating strategy is proposed herein to deal with uncertainties related to not only system states but also control inputs. On the basis of adaptive mechanism, the controller design requires neither global information about communication topologies nor the upper bounds of uncertainties and the leader’s control inputs. Based on Lyapunov arguments, sufficient conditions to achieve the desired formation are derived in terms of Riccati equations . The proposed protocols guarantee that the formation errors can converge to zero. Finally, the theoretical results are demonstrated by numerical simulations.},

To this end, the control law in MPC is described by the Koopman operator, which is a linear operator defined on the infinite-dimensional lifted state space. Then, the problem of data-driven finite-dimensional approximation of the operator is addressed. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem subject to a specified dissipativity constraint, which guarantees closed-loop stability and is modeled by a set of matrix inequalities. This paper also presents a computationally efficient algorithm of solving the optimization problem. Finally, a numerical simulation of controller construction is performed. The approximated MPC control law shows the stability of the overall control system while demonstrating high control performance.},

This paper presents an overview of graph-theoretic methods for analyzing the resilience of distributed control systems . We survey distributed algorithms that have been proposed to solve a variety of problems in networked systems, and summarize their resilience against adversarial actions in the context of the structure of the underlying networks. We also discuss graph-theoretic methods to quantify the attack impact, and reinterpret some system-theoretic notions of robustness from a graph-theoretic standpoint to mitigate the impact of the attacks.

The central question is proposed as: given a steady state, which part of the state space of density operators does it attract and which part does it not attract? We answer this question by presenting necessary and sufficient conditions that determine, for any steady state and initial state, whether the latter belongs to the attraction domain of the former. Furthermore, it is found that the attraction domain of a steady state is the intersection between the set of density operators and an affine space which contains that steady state. Moreover, we show that steady states without uniqueness in the set of density operators have attraction domains with measure zero under some translation invariant and locally finite measures. Finally, an example regarding an open Heisenberg XXZ spin chain is presented. We pick two of the system’s steady states with different magnetization profiles and analyse their attraction domains.},

Although B2B optimization uses feedback from previous batch runs to learn about model uncertainty and improve the operation of future runs, the standard techniques have the limitations of passive learning and being myopic in making adjustments. This work proposes a novel way to use the reinforcement learning approach to embed the active learning feature into B2B optimization. For this, the B2B optimization problem is formulated as a maximization of a long-term performance of repeated batch runs, which are modeled as a stochastic process with uncertain parameters. To solve the resulting Bayes-Adaptive Markov decision process (BAMDP) problem in a near-optimal manner, a policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm is employed. Through case studies, the behavior and effectiveness of the proposed B2B optimization method are examined by comparing it with the traditional certainty equivalence based B2B optimization method with passive learning.},

In an open neighborhood of this singularity, classical absolutely continuous Filippov solutions may fail to exist, preventing indefinite continuation of such solutions. This note introduces a generalized Filippov solution definition based on the notion of generalized absolute continuity in the restricted sense. Conditions for the continuability of such generalized solutions are presented and it is shown, in particular, that generalized Filippov solutions of systems with an equilibrium that is attractive, in prescribed time or otherwise, can always be continued indefinitely. The results are demonstrated by applying them to a prescribed-time control design example for a perturbed second-order integrator chain},

Most notably, the settling time estimate can be computed without using any global information, which is distinctive from the existing fixed-time protocols. Furthermore, a scaling technique is applied for the proposed protocol such that the fixed-time attraction region can be contracted by only tuning a scaling parameter and the original settling time estimate remains unchanged.

Coverage control provides an efficient framework to address MAS deployment problem for optimizing the cost of tackling unknown events. By means of the divide-and-conquer methodology, this paper proposes a sectorial coverage formulation to configure MASs in non-convex hollow environments while ensuring load balancing among subregions . Thereby, a distributed controller is designed to drive each agent towards a desirable configuration that minimizes the coverage cost by simultaneously adopting sectorial partition mechanism. Theoretical analysis is conducted to ensure the asymptotic stability of closed-loop MASs with exponential convergence of equitable partition. In addition, a circular search algorithm is proposed to identify desirable solutions to such a sectorial coverage problem, which guarantees approximating the optimal deployment of MASs with arbitrarily small tolerance. Finally, both numerical simulations and multi-robot experiments are conducted to substantiate the efficiency of the present sectorial coverage approach.},

The agent’s goal is to optimize the total objective function of the cooperators. Since agents can only communicate with their neighbors, they are unable to obtain complete information about cooperators. The distributed optimization algorithm is proposed to classify cooperative subnetworks by introducing additional auxiliary variables, and the outputs of all agents exponentially converge to the optimal solution of the optimization problem under the condition of satisfying the global equality constraint of the subnetwork. The Lyapunov stability theory is used to analyze the algorithm’s convergence.

Due to the prescribed-time convergence of the PTFG-EDO and the modified TSDA control, the settling time of the closed-loop system can be predetermined irrespective of the initial conditions, design parameters, and admissible disturbances. The chattering problem of the original TSDA control is greatly alleviated, and the disturbances, especially the mismatched disturbance which cannot be handled in the original TSDA control, are significantly suppressed.

In this paper, we propose a new online constraint removal framework for linear systems, for which we coin the term constraint-adaptive MPC (ca-MPC). In so-called exact ca-MPC, we adapt the imposed constraints by removing, at each time-step, a subset of the state constraints in order to reduce the computational complexity of the receding-horizon optimal control problem , while ensuring that the closed-loop behavior is identical to that of the original MPC law. We also propose an approximate ca-MPC scheme in which a further reduction of computation time can be accomplished by a tradeoff with closed-loop performance, while still preserving recursive feasibility, stability, and constraint satisfaction properties. The online constraint removal exploits fast backward and forward reachability computations combined with optimality properties.},

To represent the delayed bilateral inputs, we introduce two 2-D transport PDEs that form a cascade system with the original PDE. A novel set of backstepping transformations is proposed for delay compensator design, including one Volterra integral transformation and two affine Volterra integral transformations. Unlike the kernel equation for 1-D PDE systems with delayed boundary input, the resulting kernel equations for the 2-D system have singular initial conditions governed by the Dirac Delta function . Consequently, the kernel solutions are written as a double trigonometric series with singularities . To address the challenge of stability analysis posed by the singularities , we prove a set of inequalities by using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, the 2-D Fourier series , and the Parseval’s theorem.

However, due to the limited communication resources and the QoS requirement constraints, only some of the sensors can be allowed to transmit their measurements. To estimate the system state as accurately as possible, it is essential to select sensors for transmission appropriately. We formulate the sensor selection problem as a non-convex optimization problem. It is difficult to solve such a problem and even to find a feasible solution. To obtain a solution which can achieve good estimation performance, we first reformulate and relax the formulated problem. Then, we propose an algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) to solve the relaxed problem. By utilizing the solution of the relaxed problem, we propose a heuristic sensor selection algorithm which can provide a good suboptimal solution.

Sufficient conditions in terms of matrix inequalities are established to design the parameters of the event-triggering mechanism and compute an inner-approximation of the region of attraction for the perturbed feedback system. The theoretical conditions are obtained by using a quadratic Lyapunov function and an abstraction of the activation functions via quadratic constraints to decide whether the outputs of the layers should be transmitted through the network or not. Such conditions allow us to reduce the computational activity on the neural network while preserving the stability and performance level of the perturbed feedback system.

The motion planning of the mobile agents is designed under maximal speed and acceleration constraints . When there is only one mobile agent, it is shown that its path planning and velocity planning can be designed separately. We first obtain an optimal velocity policy and the corresponding optimal coverage performance for a given path, which provides a criterion to prescribe a good path. Then, path planning is generated to meet the effective coverage constraint by connecting a set of “inspection points”. Inspired by the optimal velocity policy, we propose three methods to generate the inspection points and obtain the optimal order of connecting the inspection points by a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)-based method. Finally, we extend the one-mobile-agent motion planning scheme to multiple mobile agents by proposing two methods. Simulation examples are included to compare the performance of the three methods for generating inspection points and compare the performance of the proposed methods for multiple mobile agents.},

  abstract     = {The prevalence of neural networks in applications is expanding at an increasing rate. It is becoming clear that providing robust guarantees on systems that use neural networks is very important, especially in safety-critical applications. A trained neural network’s sensitivity to adversarial attacks is one of its greatest shortcomings. To provide robust guarantees, one popular method that has seen success is to describe and bound the activation functions in the neural network using equality and inequality constraints . However, there are numerous ways to form these bounds, providing a trade-off between conservativeness and complexity. We approach the problem from a different perspective, using sparse polynomial optimisation theory and Positivstellensatz, a key result in real algebraic geometry. The former exploits the natural cascading structure of the neural network using ideas from chordal sparsity while the latter tests the emptiness of a semi-algebraic set using algebra, to provide tight bounds. We show that bounds can be tightened significantly, whilst the computational time remains reasonable.

In particular, we show that with the sparse polynomial framework the solve time and accuracy can be improved over other methods for neural network verification, for networks with ReLU, sigmoid and tanh activation functions.},

The existence of uncertain time-varying parameters makes the system in question intrinsically different from that in prescribed-time stabilization or event-triggered control. Moreover, the existing prescribed-time control methods require the real-time continuous control input. For this reason, a novel event-based adaptive prescribed-time control strategy is presented by skillfully utilizing a key scaling technique and a new event-triggering mechanism. It is proved that the proposed event-triggering mechanism can enlarge the trigger time interval and effectively reduce the number of trigger moments compared with the existing event-triggered control methods. An important stability criterion is proposed based on the defined prescribed-time adjustment function. Furthermore, the proposed control algorithm can effectively reduce the computational burden and save the control effort.

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a novel methodology that allows us to design, in a purely data-based fashion and for linear single-input and single-output systems, both robustly stable and performing control systems for tracking piecewise constant reference signals. The approach uses both (i) virtual reference feedback tuning for enforcing suitable performance and (ii) the set membership framework for providing a-priori robust stability guarantees. Indeed, an uncertainty set for the system parameters is obtained through set membership identification, where an algorithm based on the scenario approach is proposed to estimate the inflation parameter in a probabilistic way. Based on this set, robust stability conditions are enforced as linear matrix inequality constraints within an optimization problem whose linear cost function relies on virtual reference feedback tuning. To show the generality and effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to two of the most widely used yet simple control schemes, i.e., where tracking is achieved thanks to (i) a static feedforward action and (ii) an integrator in closed-loop. The proposed method is not direct due to the set membership identification. However, the uncertainty set is used with the objective of providing robust stability guarantees for the closed-loop system and it is not used for the definition of the cost function, which instead is based on data. The effectiveness of the method is shown with reference to three simulation examples. A comparison with other data-driven methods is carried out.},

This model order reduction approach preserves the Lur’e-type model structure, inherits the frequency-response function interpretation of moment matching, preserves the convergence property , and allows formulating a posteriori error bound. By the grace of the preservation of the convergence property, the reduced-order Lur’e-type model can be reliably used for generalized excitation signals without exhibiting instability issues.

The entire domain of designs could be divided into several adjacent partitions, and the performances of designs in each partition were estimated using a regression metamodel. We assumed the underlying function in each partition to be quadratic.

The objective of each agent is to reconstruct the global posterior of the unknown model parameters through local learning along with interaction with neighboring agents. We propose an event-triggered communication mechanism for a distributed Langevin algorithm to limit the inter-agent interactions and thus reduce the communication overhead. We provide conditions on the algorithm step sizes and the triggering threshold to ensure mean-square consensus of the agents’ parameter estimates and convergence of the estimates to the global posterior as if the data sets were aggregated at a central location. A major improvement of our result over previous studies is the establishment of said consensus without imposing any bounded restriction of the gradient of the objective function. Additionally, we establish probabilistic guarantees to prevent consecutive triggering by any agent while maintaining the same rate of convergence as in the case without event-triggering We demonstrate the DETULA using distributed supervised-learning problems. Our results indicate that the agents successfully recover the global posterior by periodically sharing their samples with neighbors.},

  abstract     = {Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for nonlinear system identification has proven to be a promising approach, but despite of all recent research efforts, many practical and theoretical problems still remain open. Specifically, noise handling and models, issues of consistency and reliable estimation under minimization of the prediction error are the most severe problems. The latter comes with numerous practical challenges such as explosion of the computational cost in terms of the number of data samples and the occurrence of instabilities during optimization. In this paper, we aim to overcome these issues by proposing a method which uses a truncated prediction loss and a subspace encoder for state estimation. The truncated prediction loss is computed by selecting multiple truncated subsections from the time series and computing the average prediction loss. To obtain a computationally efficient estimation method that minimizes the truncated prediction loss, a subspace encoder represented by an artificial neural network is introduced. This encoder aims to approximate the state reconstructability map of the estimated model to provide an initial state for each truncated subsection given past inputs and outputs. By theoretical analysis, we show that, under mild conditions, the proposed method is locally consistent, increases optimization stability, and achieves increased data efficiency by allowing for overlap between the subsections. Lastly, we provide practical insights and user guidelines employing a numerical example and state-of-the-art benchmark results.},

The technical treatment combines elements from set-valued theory, nonsmooth analysis, and algebraic graph theory to imbue the proposed constraints with regularity properties so that they can be smoothly combined with other control constraints.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate solutions and stability properties of switched nonlinear differential–algebraic equations (DAEs). We introduce a novel concept of solutions, called impulse-free (jump-flow) solutions, and provide a geometric characterization that establishes their existence and uniqueness. This characterization builds upon the impulse-free condition utilized in previous works such as Liberzon and Trenn (2009, 2012), which focused on linear DAEs. However, our formulation extends this condition to nonlinear DAEs. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the stability conditions based on common Lyapunov functions , previously proposed in our work (Chen and Trenn, 2022) (distinct from those in Liberzon and Trenn (2012)), can be effectively applied to switched nonlinear DAEs with high-index models. It is important to note that these models do not conform to the nonlinear Weierstrass form. Additionally, we extend the commutativity stability conditions presented in Mancilla-Aguilar (2000) from switched nonlinear ordinary differential equations to the case of switched nonlinear DAEs. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed stability conditions, we present simulation results involving switching electrical circuits and provide numerical examples. These examples serve to demonstrate the practical utility of the developed stability criteria in analyzing and understanding the behavior of switched nonlinear DAEs.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the problem of deploying multi-agent systems using single-parameter adaptive neural network control in time and space where the system is modeled by a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE). We investigate the agent model, simplify the pointwise dynamics using a PDE model, and consider the deployment problem when the number of agents is relatively large. In order for the deployed agents to follow the desired trajectory, we augment the agent dynamics with individual control inputs, accounting for the unknown interference faced by each agent during the deployment process. In the proposed approach, a radial basis function neural network structure is introduced to enhance the systems’ adaptivity under unknown interference. The unknown parameter is estimated via the single-parameter idea for reducing the computation of the entire process and increasing the calculation speed. Asymmetric performance constraints are imposed on the tracking error of the system to ensure that each agent is deployed in the required position. The results of numerical simulation prove the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract     = {When a group of heterogeneous node dynamics are diffusively coupled with a high coupling gain, the group exhibits a collective emergent behavior which is governed by a simple algebraic average of the node dynamics called the blended dynamics. This finding has been utilized for designing heterogeneous multi-agent systems by building the desired blended dynamics first and then splitting it into the node dynamics. However, to compute the magnitude of the coupling gain, each agent needs to know global information such as the number of participating nodes, the graph structure, and so on, which prevents a fully decentralized design of the node dynamics in conjunction with the coupling laws. To resolve this issue, the idea of funnel control, which is a method for adaptive gain selection, can be exploited for a node-wise coupling, but the price to pay is that the collective emergent behavior is no longer governed by a simple average of the node dynamics. Our analysis reveals that this drawback can be avoided by an edge-wise design premise, which is the idea that we present in this paper. After all, we gain benefits such as a fully decentralized design without global information, collective emergent behavior being governed by the blended dynamics, and the plug-and-play operation based on edge-wise handshaking between two nodes.},

Each agent only has access to the information associated with its own cost function and a local block of the constraint function, and can exchange local information with its immediate neighbors via a time-varying digraph. Moreover, the information of current cost functions and constraint functions is not available to agents until decisions are made. Of particular interest is that the cost function is considered to be strongly pseudoconvex. To handle this problem, an auxiliary optimization-based online distributed primal–dual algorithm is proposed. The performance of the algorithm is measured by the dynamic regret and the constraint violation. Under mild assumptions on graphs, we prove that if the cumulative deviation of minimizer sequence grows within a certain rate, then both the dynamic regret and the violation of coupled inequality constraints grow sublinearly. Finally, a simulation example is given to corroborate the validity of our results.},

Second, by designing some proportional–integral (PI) auxiliary variables, the boundary dynamics of manipulators are reconstructed as some new second-order systems, where the nonlinear uncertainties are estimated by the adaptive radial basis neural networks (RBFNNs) and the compound disturbances are compensated by the adaptive method. Third, a boundary local angle interaction protocol is given under a digraph. Then combining the virtual control and Lyapunov design, some novel distributed fault-tolerant control algorithms are obtained to ensure that the vibration states and the angle consensus error are uniformly ultimately bounded.

  abstract     = {This study is intended to investigate the asynchronous stabilization problem for discrete-time Markov jump linear systems (MJLSs) with complex mode transition probabilities (C-TPs). A practical scenario is considered in this study. First, the system mode may not always be precisely detected in practice, therefore a hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to characterize the mismatched mode phenomenon. Second, some mode TPs associated with the Markov process of the original system may be unknown or inaccurate, rendering the C-TPs scenario. This issue could also exist in the conditional TPs associated with the joint process of the HMM. A mode separation strategy is proposed to separate the Markov process and the joint process such that we can deal with the C-TPs associated with them, respectively. Based on the above considerations, a unified controller design framework is established for MJLSs with or without C-TPs. Moreover, the results developed in this study can cover some existing works as special cases without introducing additional conservativeness . A DC motor device is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.},

The hybrid multi-agent system is composed of N followers with discrete-time or continuous-time linear dynamics and one leader with discrete-time linear dynamics. The proposed distributed consensus tracking controller consists of a compensation term and an optimal control term. Specifically, the compensation term is introduced to address the effect of agents’ inherent dynamics on consensus tracking, and the optimal control term is designed to achieve the performance goal. By designing distributed observers for the following agents, we first propose a model-based distributed consensus tracking protocol. A model-free distributed consensus tracking protocol is further constructed via designing adaptive observers and identifying agents’ dynamics. The salient features of the model-free consensus tracking protocol are that the system matrix of the leader is only available for some followers and any follower does not need to know the eigenvalues of the graph matrix. Moreover, in order to reduce the computational burden, a system identification process is implemented based on the parallel learning method.

  abstract     = {Incorporating pattern-learning for prediction (PLP) in many discrete-time or discrete-event systems allows for computation-efficient controller design by memorizing patterns to schedule control policies based on their future occurrences. In this paper, we demonstrate the effect of PLP by designing a controller architecture for a class of linear Markovian jump systems (MJSs) where the aforementioned “patterns” correspond to finite-length sequences of modes. In our analysis of recurrent patterns, we use martingale theory to derive closed-form solutions to quantities pertaining to the occurrence of patterns: (1) the expected minimum occurrence time of any pattern from some predefined collection, (2) the probability of a pattern being the first to occur among the collection. To make our method applicable to real-world dynamics, we make two extensions to common assumptions in prior pattern-occurrence literature. First, the distribution of the mode process is unknown, and second, the true realization of the mode process is not observable. As demonstration, we consider fault-tolerant control of a dynamic topology-switching network, and empirically compare PLP to two controllers without PLP: a baseline based on the novel System Level Synthesis (SLS) approach and a topology-robust extension of the SLS baseline. We show that PLP is able to reject disturbances just as effectively as the topology-robust controller at reduced computation time and control effort. We discuss several important tradeoffs, such as the size of the pattern collection and the system scale versus the accuracy of the mode predictions, which show how different PLP implementations affect stabilization and runtime performance.},

Then, SKR constructs a data-driven realization of a diagnostic observer. Through disturbance elimination and reference tracking, online optimization using SIR provides a data-driven solution to the model matching problem (MMP) whilst the controller is re-configured and optimized in real time.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of active fault diagnosis (AFD) is investigated for a class of linear stochastic systems subject to chance constraints, where the input signals are specifically designed to enhance diagnosis performance by discriminating between multi-fault modes. As the misdiagnosis probability cannot be expressed in the closed form, a reachable upper bound on it is derived to construct a novel input design criterion for AFD based on the Cauchy–Schwarz divergence. A sufficient condition is provided to decompose the multivariate chance constraints into a set of univariate ones. A three-stage optimization approach is proposed to solve the input design problem incorporating chance constraints for AFD. In the upper stage, the best iteration parameter is determined for subsequent iterative optimization to obtain the least conservative risk allocation scheme. In the middle stage, the total risk of violating the multivariate constraints is optimally allocated to a set of univariate ones through iterative optimization, which can improve diagnosis performance. In the lower stage, a set of univariate chance constraints is equivalently converted into expectation constraints under the allocated risk, and then the input design problem under the constructed design criterion is solved to global optimality . The optimal input signals are injected, and the AFD decision is made based on real-time measurement information according to the minimum probability of misdiagnosis decision principle. Finally, simulation results on a four-tank system demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed AFD method.},

  abstract     = {The paper introduces a general structure for parameter adaptation/learning algorithms (PALA). This structure is characterized by the presence of an embedded ARMA (poles-zeros) filter in the PALA. The key question is how to select the coefficients of this filter in order, on the one hand, to guarantee the stability of the parameter estimator for any (positive) value of the adaptation gain/learning rate and for any initial conditions and on the other hand to accelerate the adaptation transient. In order to achieve this, it is shown that on one hand the embedded ARMA filter should be characterized by a positive real transfer function and on the other hand the filter acting on the correcting term (the dynamic adaptation gain) should be characterized by a strictly positive real transfer function. Specific conditions for the design of a second order ARMA embedded filter (ARIMA2 algorithm) are provided. It is shown in the paper that many parameter adaptation/learning algorithms (PALA) used in adaptive control, system identification and neural networks (Nesterov, Conjugate gradients, Momentum back propagation , Averaged gradient, Integral+proportional+derivative, …) are particular cases of the PALA structure introduced in this paper and specific conditions for the stable operation of these algorithms are given. Performance of the ARIMA2 algorithm as well as of the other algorithms reviewed in the paper will be comparatively evaluated by simulations and experimental results obtained on an active noise control system.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the stability analysis of discrete-time systems with a time-varying delay. Different from the recent related works that reduce the conservatism by increasing the complexity of Lyapunov functions , this paper aims at conservatism-reduction by using relatively simple Lyapunov functions with an augmented double summation term. The key point for achieving this task is that a delay-dependent matrix-separation-based inequality is established to estimate the augmented-type summation term arising in the forward difference of Lyapunov functions. The proposed method provides a general form of inequalities, which realizes the effective reduction of estimation gap, and also introduces several tractable delay-dependent matrices, which achieves the full use of available delay-related information. As a result, for two types of time-varying delays, the usage of the proposed inequality under different separations leads to two less conservative and low complex stability criteria, whose advantages are demonstrated via three examples.},

  abstract     = {A switching feedback has more flexibility in stabilizing systems compared to a feedback being continuous in state. In practice, a system controlled by a state-triggered switching law exhibits more robustness than by a time-triggered one. However, designing an admissible switching law in the static feedback form is difficult or even impossible when the switching sequence is subjected to certain constraints, such as the minimum dwell-time constraints. This study proposes a class of switching feedbacks with dynamic switching logic for discrete-time switched systems with constrained switching. First, a logic dynamic generator (LDG) is constructed to generate all admissible switching sequences. By combining the switched system with the LDG, the original switched system is transformed into a switched system without constraint on switching. Then, the logic and the continuous states are merged by using the theories of the semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices and the vector-representation of logic. Using this technique, the problem considered is then transformed into a problem of designing a state-triggered switching feedback for a merged switched system without constraints, and then to a problem of solving a set of bilinear matrix inequalities. Examples show that the proposed switching law with dynamic logic can stabilize certain switched systems that cannot be stabilized by existing switching laws in the static feedback form.},

In sharp contrast to existing approaches where the position, the velocity, and the acceleration of the reference trajectory are assumed to be measurable, we propose a class of dynamic output feedback control laws which depends on the tracking error of the position and that of the velocity. Specifically, by characterizing the reference trajectory and the disturbances with an exosystem, we design an internal model to learn the desired feedforward input such that the reference trajectory can be tracked in spite of unknown system parameters and disturbances. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by its application to trajectory tracking control of a three-link cylindrical robot arm.},

The control input applies through a Robin boundary condition. The system output is selected as either a Dirichlet or Neumann boundary trace. The developed control design procedure does not aim to compensate, but rather to dominate the state delayed term. This is achieved by introducing an observer that only estimates a finite number of modes of the PDE while applying a suitable pole shifting-based procedure on a truncated model that captures the unstable part of the plant. We show that the reported output feedback control strategy always achieves, for an arbitrarily given value of the state delay, the exponential stabilization of the plant in H 1 H1 -norm. A notable feature of the domination-based approach is that the tuning of the controller and observer gains, as well as the subsequent stability conditions, appears to be independent of the value of the state delay.},

To address this communication bottleneck, we compress the exchanged information between neighboring agents to solve decentralized online convex optimization problem , where each agent has a time-varying local loss function and the goal is to minimize the accumulated global loss by choosing actions sequentially. We develop a decentralized online gradient descent algorithm based on compressed communications, where the compression operators can reduce the amount of data to be sent significantly. Error-compensation technique is utilized to mitigate the error accumulation caused by the communication compression. We further analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the regret is bounded from above by O ( T ) O(T) ( T T is the time horizon), which is the same as (in order sense) the regret bound for vanilla decentralized online gradient descent with perfect communication. Thus, the proposed algorithm is capable of reducing the communication overhead remarkably without much degradation of the optimization performance. This is further corroborated by numerical experiments, where compressed communication reduces the number of transmitted bits by an order of magnitude without compromising the optimization performance.},

The added agents are represented by nodes that are latent, where no corresponding time-series measurements are available; however, here all the exogenous excitements are spatially (that is, across agents) uncorrelated. Generalizing affine correlations, it is shown that, under polynomial correlations, the latent nodes in the expanded networks can be excited by clusters of noise sources, where the clusters are uncorrelated with each other. The clusters can be replaced with a single noise source if the latent nodes are allowed to have non-linear interactions. Finally, using the sparse plus low-rank matrix decomposition of the imaginary part of the inverse power spectral density matrix (IPSDM) of the time-series data, the topology of the network is reconstructed.

When subsystems are unobservable and switching sequences are random, the classical Kalman–Bucy filters that are applied to observable sub-states are shown to be potentially divergent. It is also shown that unless the switching interval T T can be selected to be sufficiently small from the outset, MS convergence may never be achieved, regardless of how the observers for the subsystems are designed. The critical threshold T m a x Tmax on T T is derived for MS convergent observers to be achievable. Under the condition T T&amp;lt;Tmax , this paper introduces design algorithms for subsystem observers to generate a globally MS convergent observer for the entire continuous state. A fundamental design tradeoff between convergence speeds and steady-state estimation errors is analyzed. This paper extends our recent new framework and algorithms for strong convergent observer design in RSLSs by including observation noises, considering multi-output systems, establishing new algorithms for MS convergence, and developing design tradeoff analysis. Examples and a practical case study are presented to illustrate the design procedures, main convergence properties , and error analysis.},

In this paper, we consider multi-dimensional sources under quadratic criteria in the presence of a bias leading to a mismatch in the criteria, where we show that the generalization from the scalar setup is more than technical. We show that the Nash equilibrium solutions lead to structural richness due to the subtle geometric analysis the problem entails, with consequences in both system design, the presence of linear Nash equilibria, and an information theoretic problem formulation. We first provide a set of geometric conditions that must be satisfied in equilibrium considering any multi-dimensional source. Then, we consider independent and identically distributed sources and characterize necessary and sufficient conditions under which an informative linear Nash equilibrium exists. These conditions involve the bias vector that leads to misaligned costs. Depending on certain conditions related to the bias vector, the existence of linear Nash equilibria requires sources with a Gaussian or a symmetric density. Moreover, in the case of Gaussian sources, our results have a rate–distortion theoretic implication that achievable rates and distortions in the considered game theoretic setup can be obtained from its team theoretic counterpart.},

Then, a robust recursive linear quadratic regulator is obtained, solving an optimization problem through robust regularized least-squares approaches. The solution is given in terms of algebraic Riccati equations . We assess the proposed regulator through a numerical example and compare its performance with other robust control approaches.},

The minimum SNR required for stabilization is shown to be the modulus of the product of unstable poles of the plants. Two types of optimal control laws that achieve this minimum are constructed based on the gains for expensive control, that is, LQ optimal control without input weight. It is observed that channel feedback does not improve the SNR limitation, which means feedback for control is efficient enough for communication.},

One of the core issues in nonlinear filtering is to numerically solve the Duncan–Mortensen–Zakai (DMZ) equation, which is an evolution equation satisfied by the unnormalized conditional density of state process under noisy observations, in a real-time and memoryless manner. When the noise in observations is correlated to the state process, the DMZ equation we need to deal with is a second-order stochastic partial differential equation . In this paper, we will propose an algorithm to solve the DMZ equation in this case, based on Hermite–Galerkin spectral method. According to this method, the DMZ equation is converted into a system of linear stochastic differential equations generated by the observation process. The effects of different discretization schemes on this stochastic differential system will also be discussed. Moreover, rigorous convergence analysis of the algorithm is given under mild conditions. Numerical results show that the method proposed in this paper can provide an instantaneous and accurate estimation to the state process of the system.},

Even though it is easy to predict the occurrence of faults in advance accurately for a prognosable discrete event system, it is much more difficult to do so for systems that are not prognosable. In this paper, we solve the online prognosis problem in a stochastic discrete event system framework. Our idea is to calculate the probability of the occurrence of faults in the future when a no-fault observable string is observed. We say an observable string is no-fault if no faults have occurred when it is observed. We then compare the probability with a pre-set threshold to decide whether to issue an alert or not. We develop a method to calculate the lower bound for possible thresholds, which has the fewest false alerts and no missed alerts of faults. For a given threshold, we use the rate of missed fault alerts and the rate of false fault alerts to evaluate the performance of fault prognosis. We formally define these two rates and develop algorithms to calculate them. These results can guide us in choosing a proper threshold to achieve the best trade-off between false fault alerts and missed alerts of faults.},

In sharp contrast to the model-based analysis, we approach it by directly using the input and state feedback data of the unknown system. Via a new concept of sufficient richness of input sectional data, we first establish the necessary and sufficient condition for the minimum input design to excite the system for property ID. Specifically, the input sectional data is sufficiently rich for property ID if and only if it spans a linear subspace that contains a property dependent minimum linear subspace, any basis of which can also be easily used to form the minimum excitation input. Interestingly, we show that many structural properties can be identified with the minimum input that is however unable to identify the explicit system model. Overall, our results rigorously quantify the advantages of the direct data-driven analysis over the model-based analysis for linear systems in terms of data efficiency.},

Therefore, at a local observer, an accurate full state estimation relies on communications with neighbors if the outputs available for use are restricted. In such distributed scenarios, this paper gives conditions for the unknown input decoupling state estimation, under which the designed distributed observer works and has a lower order. For a linear dynamical system of dimension n n , the i i th local observer is of dimension n − p i n−pi if p i pi -dimensional outputs are available. Each local observer can produce an n n -dimensional state estimation with an exponential rate of convergence , free from unknown inputs and more efficient than its full-order counterparts.

However, since all the observed data are used to compute the posterior distributions of the global variables at each iteration of the classical variational inference, the computation complexity is too high to be suitable for large data sets, especially for large-scale networks, where more data is needed for the inference. In this paper, we derive an efficient algorithm to maximize a lower bound function in the Bayesian inference based on stochastic optimization, where only a part of data is used at each iteration. Compared with the traditional variational Bayesian inference approach, the proposed method can significantly decrease the computation so that it is more suitable for the network identification with large data sets.

The specific scenario is that the smart sensors transmit innovations via a wireless network to the remote estimator. There are two types of sensors—safe and suspicious ones, where the innovations of safe sensors have no possibility of being modified by a malicious attacker, but the innovations from suspicious sensors may be intercepted and modified. The typical integrity attacks focus on utilizing the innovations of suspicious sensors and current innovations, which underutilize the available information that limits the impact on remote estimation and may be exposed under mutual verification between safe and suspicious sensors. Consequently, we propose a stealthy integrity attack with a finite horizon of historical data from both types of sensors, i.e., the so-called integrity attack with spatial–temporal information sources, which further enhances the effectiveness of integrity attacks. The stealthiness constraints and the corresponding estimation error covariances under the proposed attacks are obtained. The analytical expressions of optimal integrity attack strategies are derived by maximizing the estimation error under stealthiness constraints. In addition, we investigate the properties of the optimal integrity attack strategies when the attacks occur consecutively. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

One of the main technical contributions is the derivation of corresponding tube dynamics based on CCMs that account for the state and input dependent nature of the model mismatch. Furthermore, we online optimize over the nominal parameter, which enables general set-membership updates for the parametric uncertainty in the MPC.

First, via S-procedure, system stability analysis results have been obtained, and then, two novel data-driven controller design methods in the form of linear matrix inequalities and equations have been proposed such that the resulting closed loop system is asymptotically stable. For PWA systems with unknown state space partition information, an online data-driven control method has been further proposed to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the resulting closed loop systems.

  abstract     = {Virtual constraints are relations imposed in a control system that become invariant via feedback instead of real physical constraints acting on the system. Nonholonomic systems are mechanical systems with non-integrable constraints on the velocities. In this work, we introduce the notion of virtual nonholonomic constraints in a geometric framework. More precisely, it is a controlled invariant distribution associated with an affine connection mechanical control system. We show the existence and uniqueness of a control law defining a virtual nonholonomic constraint and we characterize the trajectories of the closed-loop system as solutions of a mechanical system associated with an induced constrained connection. Moreover, we characterize the dynamics for nonholonomic systems in terms of virtual nonholonomic constraints, i.e., we characterize when can we obtain nonholonomic dynamics from virtual nonholonomic constraints.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a counterexample-guided iterative algorithm to compute convex, piecewise linear (polyhedral) Lyapunov functions for continuous-time piecewise linear systems . Polyhedral Lyapunov functions provide an alternative to commonly used polynomial Lyapunov functions. Our approach first characterizes intrinsic properties of a polyhedral Lyapunov function including its “eccentricity” and “robustness” to perturbations. We then derive an algorithm that either computes a polyhedral Lyapunov function proving that the system is asymptotically stable, or concludes that no polyhedral Lyapunov function exists whose eccentricity and robustness parameters satisfy some user-provided limits. Significantly, our approach places no a-priori bound on the number of linear pieces that make up the desired polyhedral Lyapunov function. The algorithm alternates between a learning step and a verification step, always maintaining a finite set of witness states. The learning step solves a linear program to compute a candidate Lyapunov function compatible with a finite set of witness states. In the verification step, our approach verifies whether the candidate Lyapunov function is a valid Lyapunov function for the system. If verification fails, we obtain a new witness. We prove a theoretical bound on the maximum number of iterations needed by our algorithm. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on numerical examples.},

Considering the different output properties of grid-forming and grid-feeding converters, distributed secondary controllers with mixed V–I droop and I–V droop controllers are designed to achieve accurate bidirectional current sharing and voltage regulation. As few converters have access to the information of the common bus, an observer is designed for each local controller to estimate the bus voltage . Then, the observer state is used to generate voltage correction term in the feedback loop, which gets potential faster regulation compared with the existing approaches that use pinning gains. Based on the rank-one perturbation analysis , a stability criterion of DC microgrid is given for the case of ZI load, where global voltage regulation and current sharing are guaranteed. Then, the stability criterion is extended to the case of ZIP load, where local stability of the DC microgrid is guaranteed. Both numerical examples and experimental tests are given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel completely model-free method to solve continuous-time linear quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs). We consider the setting where agents can only access their own states and are coupled via their individual infinite-horizon discounted costs. For such games, a set of Nash certainty equivalence-based strategies, determined by two gain matrices and the aggregate population effect, i.e. mean field (MF) state , are developed, providing an ɛ ɛ ɛ -Nash equilibrium under certain assumptions. Note that the gain matrices are solved from two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs), respectively, and the MF state is given by the linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). All the solutions of these three equations require the exact model of system dynamics . To implement the NCE-based strategy with completely unknown system dynamics , the proposed approach develops a single-agent policy iteration (PI) and a single-agent MF generator to solve the above parameters. Specifically, first, model-based iterative equations with guaranteed convergence are developed to approximate two gain matrices. Then, the requirement of dynamical model is removed from the iteration process via the integral reinforcement learning (IRL) technique. A model-free algorithm is conducted by using measured data from a selected agent as reinforcement signals over a certain time interval. Finally, based on the obtained gain matrices, the MF state is computed offline depending on samples collected from the same agent. A numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

By quantifying the unknown modeling error that is closely related to the threshold used in FD tasks, an upper bound is obtained so that trial-and-error for finding the threshold can be avoided.

However, when a robot picks up tools of unknown lengths, orientations and mass, its kinematics and dynamics are varying and unavailable. There are few controllers that can achieve asymptotic tracking of multi-task in the presence of kinematic and dynamic uncertainties. Thus, in this paper we present a passivity-based adaptive Jacobian hierarchical multi-task controller. New reference velocity and kinematic regressor matrix are defined for the multi-task case with strict priority to guarantee the asymptotic convergence of both tracking error and parameter estimation error. A novel natural adaption law is specially designed for this method to guarantee the correctness of estimated dynamic parameters and increase the rate of convergence . Experiment results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.},

We derive a condition under which the system cannot be stabilized by any controller from that class. In the finite-dimensional case the condition states that diffusive controllers cannot stabilize agents that share common unstable dynamics, directions included. This class always contains the group of homogeneous unstable agents, like integrators . We argue that the underlying reason is intrinsic cancellations of unstable agent dynamics by such controllers, even static ones, where directional properties play a key role. The intrinsic lack of internal stability explains the notorious behavior of some distributed control protocols when affected by measurement noise or exogenous disturbances .},

We show that, for our largest hvac control problem, our symmetry exploiting the pdip algorithm reduces the computation-time from minutes to seconds in comparison with the baseline pdip algorithm.

We show that the value function and the optimal feedback trading strategy can be expressed in terms of the solution of a coupled matrix Riccati differential system. The presence of the market resilience and the Markov switching results in the coupled Riccati system being non-canonical. We manage to establish a set of transparent sufficient conditions to ensure the well-posedness of the coupled system.

However, equipping distributed optimization with differential privacy, the state-of-the-art privacy protection mechanism, will unavoidably compromise optimization accuracy. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to achieve rigorous ϵ ϵ -differential privacy in gradient-tracking based distributed optimization with enhanced optimization accuracy. More specifically, to suppress the influence of differential-privacy noise, we propose a new robust gradient-tracking based distributed optimization algorithm that allows both stepsize and the variance of injected noise to vary with time. Then, we establish a new analyzing approach that can characterize the convergence of the gradient-tracking based algorithm under both constant and time-varying stepsizes. To our knowledge, this is the first analyzing framework that can treat gradient-tracking based distributed optimization under both constant and time-varying stepsizes in a unified manner. More importantly, the new analyzing approach gives a much less conservative analytical bound on the stepsize compared with existing proof techniques for gradient-tracking based distributed optimization. We also theoretically characterize the influence of differential-privacy design on the accuracy of distributed optimization, which reveals that inter-agent interaction has a significant impact on the final optimization accuracy. Numerical simulation results confirm the theoretical predictions.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the 3D trajectory tracking problem for a class of torpedo-type underwater vehicles which are a typical underactuated and also non-minimum phase systems. Two spherical coordinate transformations are introduced to transform the vehicles’ tracking model into a certain three-input-three-output form which, unfortunately, is not in a strict-feedback form. To avoid possible singularity problem in the recursive control design, an exponential modification of orientation (EMO) concept is introduced and forces the vehicles to track this modified trajectory instead of directly tracking the reference one. As for the non-minimum phase problem, since the input matrix in the transformed three-input-three-output form is always invertible, this problem can be easily handled in this paper. Numerical studies are also carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed tracking scheme.},

We begin our approach with the design of a Kalman filter for the linear motion subsystem under non-vanishing perturbations. The filter attenuates the noise of position measurements, and simultaneously estimates the linear velocity of the vehicle as well as an unknown term of lumped dynamics, which includes model parametric uncertainty and exogenous perturbations. The output and residual of the filter are then fed to a nonlinear controller whose thrust actuation is bounded with respect to the position and velocity errors. The total error stemming from the closed-loop system is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Experimental results and comparison data are presented to showcase the performance of our strategy in different real-world applications using a quadrotor vehicle.},

  abstract     = {Adding a physical watermarking signal to the control input of a networked control system increases the detection probability of data deception attacks at the expense of increased control cost. This paper proposes a parsimonious policy to limit the average number of watermarking events when the attack is not present, which in turn reduces the control cost. We model the system as a stochastic optimal control problem and apply dynamic programming to minimize the average detection delay (ADD) for fixed upper bounds on false alarm rate (FAR) and an average number of watermarking events (ANW) before the attack. Under practical circumstances, the optimal solution results in a two threshold policy on the posterior probability of attack, derived from the Shiryaev statistics for sequential change detection and assuming the change point is a random variable . We derive asymptotically approximate analytical expressions of ADD and FAR, applying the non-linear renewal theory for non-independent and identically distributed data. The derived expressions reveal that ADD reduces with the increase in the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) between the post- and pre-attack distributions of the test statistics. Therefore, we further design the optimal watermarking that maximizes the KLD for a fixed increase in the control cost. The relationship between the ANW and the increase in control cost is also derived. Simulation studies are performed to illustrate and validate the theoretical results.},

However, the obtained state estimates are also overlapping and contain redundant information that can be shared to further improve estimation performance for subsystems. To better utilize such overlapping estimates from neighbors, zonotopic fusion criteria are proposed to combine local estimates into a better result. Notice that the proposed distributed zonotopic estimator does not require knowing the correlations of estimation errors, such as the complex calculation of cross-covariances, so it can be implemented online. Moreover, robust stability conditions are provided to ensure the boundedness of estimation errors. Finally, illustrative examples are employed to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

In particular, the existing results have shortcomings in determining the asymptotic behavior of a given dynamics in a designated game. Although there is a large body of literature on developing convergent dynamics to the Nash equilibrium (NE) of a game, in general, the asymptotic behavior of an underlying dynamics may not be even close to a NE. In this paper, we initiate a new direction toward game dynamics by studying the contraction properties of the map of dynamics in games. To this aim, we first decompose the map of a given dynamics into contractive and non-contractive parts and then explore the asymptotic behavior of those dynamics using the proximity of such decomposition to contraction mappings . In particular, we analyze the non-contractive behavior for better/best response dynamics in discrete-action space sequential/repeated games and show that the non-contractive part of those dynamics is well-behaved in a certain sense. That allows us to estimate the asymptotic behavior of such dynamics using a neighborhood around the fixed point of their contractive part proxy. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our framework via an example from the duopoly Cournot games.},

The state-estimation-error dynamics for the analysis of MDF under hybrid random and bounded uncertainties is divided into two sub-dynamics. The first sub-dynamics is only affected by the bounded uncertainties . Under the precondition of Schur stability, an outer-approximation of minimal robust positively invariant set with any given precision is obtained. While the second sub-dynamics is only affected by the random uncertainties following the Gaussian distributions. It is proved that the behavior of the second sub-dynamics at steady stage also follows a certain Gaussian distribution, which can be bounded by confidence zonotopes given a proper confidence level. MDF for actuator and sensor faults can be obtained by solving a non-convex optimization problem to minimize the magnitude of fault subjected to the residual set-separation constraints, which is equivalent to compute a distance from the origin to hyperplane along a fixed direction by exploiting the geometric property. At the end of this paper, a two-link manipulator model and a vehicle model are used to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

To alleviate these perception costs, we develop a novel simultaneous perception–action design framework wherein an agent senses only the task-relevant information. This formulation differs from that of a partially observable Markov decision process , since the agent is free to synthesize not only its policy for action selection but also its belief-dependent observation function. The method enables the agent to balance its perception costs with those incurred by operating in its environment. To obtain a computationally tractable solution, we approximate the value function using a novel method of invariant finite belief sets , wherein the agent acts exclusively on a finite subset of the continuous belief space. We solve the approximate problem through value iteration in which a linear program is solved individually for each belief state in the set, in each iteration. Finally, we prove that the value functions, under an assumption on their structure, converge to their continuous state-space values as the sample density increases.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the prescribed-time control problem of nonholonomic systems. By using some properties of a class of parametric Lyapunov equations and constructing time-varying Lyapunov-like functions, a time-varying high-gain feedback controller is firstly proposed for the chained nonholonomic system such that the state of the closed-loop system converges to zero at any prescribed time. The advantage of time-varying feedback is revealed by comparison with time-invariant feedback. Then time-varying high-gain feedback controllers for a class of perturbed nonholonomic systems are designed to achieve prescribed time convergence of the states. Both state feedback and observer-based output feedback are considered and the controls are proved to be bounded in all the cases. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Quantum detector tomography (QDT) is a fundamental technique for calibrating quantum devices and performing quantum engineering tasks. In this paper, we utilize regularization to improve the QDT accuracy whenever the probe states are informationally complete or informationally incomplete. In the informationally complete scenario, without regularization , we optimize the resource (probe state) distribution by converting it to a semidefinite programming problem. Then in both the informationally complete and informationally incomplete scenarios, we discuss different regularization forms and prove the mean squared error scales as O ( 1 / N ) O(1/N) or tends to a constant with N N state copies under the static assumption. We also characterize the ideal best regularization for the identifiable parameters, accounting for both the informationally complete and informationally incomplete scenarios. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of different regularization forms and a quantum optical experiment test shows that a suitable regularization form can reach a reduced mean squared error .},

There is a compromise between perception latency, precision for the overall robotic system, and computational resource usage referred to here as the latency-precision trade-off. In this work, we analyze a robot model given by a linear system, a zero-order hold controller, and measurements taken by several perception mode possibilities with different noise levels. We show that the analysis of this system is reduced to studying an equivalent switching system. Our goal is to schedule perception modes such that stability is attained while optimizing a cost function that models the latency-precision trade-off. Our solution framework comprises three main tools: the construction of perception scheduling policy candidates, admissibility verification for policy candidates, and optimal strategies based on admissible policies.},

These random observer’s location errors (OLEs) seriously deteriorate the filtering precision, since the additional errors are introduced into the angle measurements when the noisy observer location is directly used to estimate the target state of interest. A new pseudo-linear measurement model is firstly constructed in the presence of OLEs, and the first two-order statistical moments of the pseudo-linear measurement noises are analyzed conditioned on the exact observer location. Then, on the premise of deriving the azimuth and elevation errors caused by OLEs and re-analyzing the first two-order statistical moments of the pseudo-linear measurement noises conditioned on the noisy observer location, a novel pseudo-linear Kalman filter in the presence of OLEs (abbreviated as OPKF) is put forward. A closed-form bias estimate of this proposed OPKF is further derived recursively, and the corresponding bias-compensated and instrumental variable-based pseudo-linear Kalman filters in the presence of OLEs are finally designed to improve filtering precision. The advantages of filtering precision of the proposed method over the existing pseudo-linear Kaman filter and its variants are demonstrated by an example of 3D AOT in the presence of OLEs, in terms of different levels of sensor accuracy and observer’s location errors.},

We develop a sensitivity measure that describes the maximum rotational change in a network’s output with respect to a Euclidean change in its input. We show that this measure is a type of Lipschitz constant, and that it is bounded by the product of a network’s Euclidean Lipschitz constant and an intrinsic property of a rotation parameterization which we call the “distance constant”. We derive the distance constant for several rotation parameterizations, and then discuss why the structure of most of these parameterizations makes it difficult to construct a pose estimation network with provable sensitivity bounds. However, we show that sensitivity bounds can be computed for networks which parameterize rotation using unconstrained exponential coordinates. We then construct and train such a network and compute sensitivity bounds for it.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents methodologies for constructing Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for nonlinear, control-affine systems, in the presence of input constraints and bounded disturbances . More specifically, given a constraint function with high-relative-degree with respect to the system dynamics , the paper considers three methodologies, two for relative-degree 2 and one for higher relative-degrees, for creating CBFs whose zero sublevel sets are subsets of the constraint function’s zero sublevel set Three special forms of Robust CBFs (RCBFs) are developed as functions of the input constraints, system dynamics , and disturbance bounds, such that the resultant RCBF condition on the control input is always feasible for states in the RCBF zero sublevel set. The RCBF condition is then enforced in a switched fashion, which allows the system to operate safely without enforcing the RCBF condition when far from the safe set boundary and allows tuning of how closely trajectories approach the safe set boundary The proposed methods are verified in simulations demonstrating the developed RCBFs in an asteroid flyby scenario for a satellite with low-thrust actuators.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the constrained attitude control of a rigid body. We propose an Explicit Reference Governor (ERG) specifically designed to handle constraints on S O ( 3 ) SO(3) . Two types of constraints are considered: (i) input torque constraints, and (ii) geometric conic pointing constraints. The objective of this paper is to design a control law that is able to steer the attitude of a rigid body to the desired attitude reference while enforcing constraints at all times. To this end, the first step is to design a controller that makes the desired attitude asymptotically stable when constraints (i) and (ii) are neglected. Next, the proposed control scheme is augmented with a novel ERG scheme able to add constraint-handling capabilities to the overall architecture. All the proposed solutions are defined in terms of S O ( 3 ) SO(3) and do not make use of any parameterization such as quaternions or Euler angles . Numerical simulations are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Guaranteeing prescribed performance is critical to maintaining system efficiency and reliability. The state-of-the-art approaches achieve different performance specifications with different control structures and settings. In this paper, we propose a novel control methodology to uniformly address the prescribed performance problem for uncertain multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems in the presence of actuator faults. By constructing a non-monotonic function transformation and an asymmetric barrier function, we recast the underlying problem into one that only needs for simple selection of certain design parameters. With such a treatment, different performance behaviors can be achieved under a single (unified) control framework without the requirement for alternating the control structure, making the design more user-friendly and implementation less demanding. Furthermore, by embedding the available information on the state-dependent diagonal matrix into the filtered-error-like design procedure, the obstacle of ensuring the controllability of the closed-loop system, caused by the actuator faults and performance behaviors, is circumvented. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed method.},

Next, we use a nonlinear infinite-dimensional backstepping transformation to convert the cascade system to a suitable target system that is chosen to be finite-time or fixed-time stable. We perform the stability analysis on the target system by means of classical non-asymptotic concepts and tools such as the linear homogeneity and “generalized KL KL ” functions. Then, we use the inverse transformation to transfer back the stability property to the closed-loop system. Finally, we give some characterizations of finite/fixed time predictor-based controllers followed by numerical simulations.},

A nominal RNN model is first identified using available measurements. The system dynamics are then assumed to change, leading to an unacceptable degradation of the nominal model performance on the perturbed system. To cope with the mismatch, the model is augmented with an additive correction term trained on fresh data from the new dynamic regime. The correction term is learned through a Jacobian Feature Regression (JFR) method defined in terms of the features spanned by the model’s Jacobian with respect to its nominal parameters. A non-parametric view of the approach is also proposed, which extends recent work on Gaussian Process (GP) with Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK-GP) to the RNN case (RNTK-GP). This can be more efficient for very large networks or when only few data points are available. Implementation aspects for fast and efficient computation of the correction term, as well as the initial state estimation for the RNN model are described. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in presence of significant system variations.},

The relay channel under consideration is a wireless communication channel with a so-called relay node . Under the effects of relay node , the signal transmission between the plant and estimator is determined by a combination of three communication processes, namely the sensor-to-estimator, the sensor-to-relay and the relay-to-estimator communication processes. In order to characterize the impact of such kind of relay-channel-based communication, a three-terminal relay model is employed to describe the signal transmission behaviors between the plant and the estimator. Three Bernoulli-distributed white sequences are adopted to model the packet losses occurring in the communication processes. A full information estimation strategy is firstly developed in the sense of maximum a posteriori according to the system dynamics and transmission behaviors. Then, a moving horizon estimator is designed based on the derived full information estimation strategy. Furthermore, the solution of the proposed moving horizon estimation strategy is achieved by using the completing-the-square approach and, subsequently, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the mean-square ultimate boundedness of the resultant error dynamics of the state estimation. Two simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed estimation scheme.},

The proposed approach captures the worst-case exponential growth in the number of convex sets required to represent the nonconvex reachable set while exhibiting only linear growth in the complexity of the hybrid zonotope set representation. Redundancy removal techniques are provided that leverage binary trees to store the combinations of binary factors of the hybrid zonotope that map to nonempty convex subsets. Numerical examples show the hybrid zonotope’s ability to compactly represent nonconvex reachable sets with an exponential number of features. Furthermore, the hybrid zonotope is shown to be closed under linear mappings, Minkowski sums, generalized intersections, and halfspace intersections.},

Furthermore, the design is extended to the case in which an integral action is included in order to achieve constant output regulation. Following a similar approach, the design of contractive observers for the aforementioned class of systems is also considered. Finally, based on previous conditions, we establish a new nonlinear separation principle in which the feedback and the observer gains may be designed independently.

The considered problem is to jointly recover the community labels of the agents and estimate interaction probabilities between the agents, based on a single trajectory of the model. We first study stability and limit theorems of the model, and then propose a joint recovery and estimation algorithm based on a trajectory.

The main advantage is that it effectively enables the RMPC to be designed based on a model with reduced uncertainties. The proposed sliding mode observer (SMO) is finite-time convergent allowing the estimation error of the additive disturbance to be explicitly bounded by a predictable and decreasing limit. Due to the compensation of the estimated disturbance, the uncertainty that the RMPC has to handle is reduced from the original disturbance to the estimation error of the disturbance. This ensures all the admissible state trajectories are limited within a shrinking neighborhood of the origin and the steady-state error is therefore reduced. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Depending on whether the communication resources of the attacker are limited, two different attack strategies are introduced under the distributed consensus estimation framework. Then an event-triggered distributed consensus extended Kalman filter is devised for nonlinear systems , where the upper bound for the estimation error covariance matrix is derived in terms of the variance-constrained method. The stability analysis is executed to establish sufficient conditions that guarantee the boundedness of the estimation error. Finally, the results of a numerical simulation are analyzed to show the estimation performances of the proposed distributed consensus algorithm.},

  abstract     = {We propose two branch-and-bound, optimistic planning algorithms for discrete-time nonlinear optimal control problems in which there is a continuous and a discrete action (input). The dynamics and rewards (negative costs) must be Lipschitz but can otherwise be general, as long as certain boundedness conditions are satisfied by the continuous action, reward, and Lipschitz constant of the dynamics. We start by investigating the structure of the space of hybrid-input sequences. Based on this structure, we propose for the first algorithm an optimistic selection rule that picks for refinement (branching) the subset with the largest upper bound on the value. At the price of a higher budget, the second method reduces the reliance on the Lipschitz constant, by refining all sets that are potentially optimistic. This effectively means that the Lipschitz constant is automatically optimized. The way to select the largest-impact action along which to refine the sets is the same for both algorithms, and still depends on the Lipschitz constant. We provide convergence rate guarantees for both methods, which link the computational budget to the near-optimality of the action sequences returned, in a way that depends on a problem complexity measure. We also give empirical results for a nonlinear problem , where the algorithms are applied in receding horizon, and depending on the budget either one or the other algorithm works better.},

Measurements collected from the extremities of the exchanger tube are used to estimate the heat distribution over the length of the exchanger, which induces a boundary estimation problem. This system, which is part of any standard cooling plant, is particularly challenging due to the distributed nature of its variables. It is modeled by a system of (2 × 2) hyperbolic PDEs, coupled with an ODE at the boundary. To solve the estimation problem, we consider a general class of systems consisting of a (2 × 2) hyperbolic system coupled with a set of n X nX linear time-varying (LTV) ODEs at the boundary. Both the PDE and the ODEs have uncertain parameters to be estimated. The objective is to estimate the PDE states, the ODE states, and the parameters simultaneously with no assumption on the ODEs stability. We design a Luenberger state observer, and our method is mainly based on the decoupling of the PDE estimation error states from that of the ODEs via swapping design. We then derive the observer gains from the Lyapunov analysis of the decoupled system after proving the boundedness of the swapping filters. We give sufficient conditions of the exponential convergence of the adaptive observer through differential Lyapunov inequalities (DLIs). Finally, we apply the developed theory on the coupled heat exchanger–heater model to evaluate the performance of the observer in numerical simulations.},

Assume that the switching is slow enough and the attacker’s energy is limited, we propose a coding transmission strategy based on bandwidth allocation, which selects a part of the network bandwidth for reverse data transmission. Under such strategy, partial detection of attacks and synchronous update of quantization rules are realized. Combined the increasing/decreasing rate of Lyapunov function with the success rate of attack detection, the sufficient conditions ensuring the mean square exponential stability of the system are given. Taking the maximum convergence rate as a performance indicator, the optimal bandwidth allocation scheme is provided for the specific values, which realizes a trade-off between attack detection rate and quantization error .

Since such an interpolant is needed in the strong stabilization problem, the interpolation result is used to develop a control design algorithm, so that a stable stabilizing controller is constructed using the matrices F F and H H . It is shown (also by examples) that the algorithm works with large-scale plants possessing both real and complex invariant zeros in ℜ [ s ] ≥ 0 ℜ[s]≥0 . The design algorithm is applied to the sugar mild process, and it is shown that the obtained controller is more suitable for practical implementation, in respect to the literature.

  abstract     = {In this paper we present a language-based fault diagnosis framework for both permanent and intermittent faults, where each fault is associated with two events, describing respectively the activation and deactivation of the fault. We first introduce the concept of F F -diagnosability, which requires a fault to be identifiable before it may disappear owing to recovery. Then we present a language-based sufficient and necessary condition to ensure F F -diagnosability. Considering the PSPACE-hard nature of verifying F F -diagnosability, our key contribution is to present a verifiable condition called F F -consistency and a polynomial-time verification algorithm, relying on a novel state-weight updating strategy. If the plant is not F F -diagnosable for a specific fault, then the algorithm will output false , which means the algorithm ensures no missing alarms , in the sense of misclassifying a non- F F -diagnosable plant as an F F -diagnosable one. But if the plant is F F -diagnosable, then the algorithm will guarantee to output true , if the plant is F F -consistent for the fault F F . In other words, the proposed verification algorithm attains a tradeoff between computational complexity and quality of verification by reducing the original PSPACE-complete complexity to a polynomial-time complexity, and at the same time allowing possible false alarms , i.e., misclassifying an F F -diagnosable plant as a non- F F -diagnosable one, unless the proposed F F -consistency property for the fault F F holds in the plant. Theoretically speaking, our work identifies a subclass of plants that are F F -consistent for a fault F F , upon which the problem of verifying F F -diagnosability becomes polynomial-time solvable instead of being PSPACE-complete.},

  abstract     = {Cybersecurity of discrete event systems (DES) has been gaining more and more attention recently, due to its high relevance to the so-called 4th industrial revolution that heavily relies on data communication among networked systems. One key challenge is how to ensure system resilience to sensor and/or actuator attacks, which may tamper data integrity and service availability. In this paper we focus on some key decidability issues related to smart sensor attacks. We first present a sufficient and necessary condition that ensures the existence of a smart sensor attack, which reveals a novel demand–supply relationship between an attacker and a controlled plant, represented as a set of risky pairs. Each risky pair consists of a damage string desired by the attacker and an observable sequence feasible in the supervisor such that the latter induces a sequence of control patterns, which allows the damage string to happen. It turns out that each risky pair can induce a smart weak sensor attack. Next, we show that, when the plant, supervisor and damage language are regular, it is possible to remove all such risky pairs from the plant behaviour, via a genuine encoding scheme, upon which we are able to establish our key result that the existence of a nonblocking supervisor resilient to smart sensor attacks is decidable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind in the DES literature on cyber attacks . The proposed decision process renders a specific synthesis procedure that guarantees to compute a resilient supervisor whenever it exists, which so far has not been achieved in the literature.},

The multi-agent system is cast as a relay-explorer problem, where a relay agent intermittently provides navigational feedback to multiple explorer agents that do not have on-board absolute navigational sensors in a pre-defined sub-region. Within each sub-region, there is one relay agent responsible for servicing the corresponding explorer agents, and the estimated trajectory of an explorer agent can cross the boundary and enter another sub-region. We develop a reactive synthesis approach to formulate the mission specifications, while the state–space system dynamics provide real-time information for state corrections. Specifically, we pre-synthesize a set of planning strategies corresponding to candidate instantiations (i.e., pre-specified representative information scenarios) to dynamically switch among the explorers, and the planning strategies enable transfer of the servicing responsibility between relay agents. To guarantee stability of the switching strategies and the approximate consensus of the explorer agents, we develop maximum dwell-time conditions using a Lyapunov-based analysis to allow the explorer agents to drift for a pre-defined period without requiring servicing from the relay agents. Finally, we include a simulation study to demonstrate the performance of the developed method.},

To save resources and ensure robustness to unknown disturbances, a hybrid time-dynamic event triggered mechanism is designed, under which the time triggered mechanism is utilized to determine the explicit lower bound of inter-event time and a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced to further avoid redundant triggering actions. Unlike most existing relevant literature, the stability analysis of systems and the procedure for the choice of parameters do not rely on conditions to which the existence of solutions is not proved. In addition, by the decomposition of weight-unbalanced directed graphs coupled with graph theory and matrix theory , the obtained results could be extended from strong strongly connected graphs to more general directed graphs only containing a spanning tree. Then, the corresponding robust asynchronous variable period sampling control strategy is also derived to avoid the continuous detection of triggering conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on the spacecraft formation flying problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper is about the construction of a family of centrally synergistic potential functions from a single modified trace function on SO(3) . First, we demonstrate that it is possible to complete the construction through angular warping with multiple directions, particularly effective in the unresolved cases in the literature. Second, it can be shown that for each potential function in the family, there exists a subset of the family such that the synergistic gap is positive at the unwanted critical points. This allows the switching condition to be checked within the selected subsets while implementing synergistic hybrid control. Furthermore, the positive lower bound of synergistic gap is explicitly expressed by selecting a traditional warping angle function. Finally, we apply the proposed synergistic potential functions to obtain robust global attitude tracking.},

Using the recently introduced time-varying feedback tools for prescribed-time stabilization, we achieve source seeking in prescribed time, i.e., the convergence to a small but bounded neighborhood of the source, without the measurements of the position and velocity of the unicycle, in as short a time as the user desires, starting from an arbitrary distance from the source. The practical convergence is established using a singularly perturbed version of the Lie bracket averaging method, combined with time dilation and time contraction operations . The algorithm is robust, provably, even to bounded nonvanishing perturbations and an arbitrarily strong gradient-dependent repulsive velocity drift emanating from the source.},

Populations consisting of exclusively one of these types are known to reach an equilibrium, where every individual is satisfied with her decision. Yet it remains unknown whether oscillations take place in a population consisting of both types, and if they do, what features they share. We study a well-mixed population of individuals, which are either a coordinator or anticoordinator, each associated with a possibly unique threshold and initialized with the strategy A A or B B . At each time, an agent becomes active to update her strategy based on her threshold: an active coordinator (resp. anticoordinator) updates her strategy to A A (resp. B B ) if the portion of other agents who have chosen A A exceeds (falls short of) her threshold, and updates to B B (resp. A A ) otherwise. We define the state of the population dynamics as the distribution over the thresholds of those who have chosen A A . We show that the population can admit several minimally positively invariant sets , where the solution trajectory oscillates. We explicitly characterize a class of positively invariant sets , prove their invariance, and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for their stability. Our results highlight the possibility of non-trivial, complex oscillations in the absence of noise and population structure and shed light on the reported oscillations in nature and human societies.},

Since simple examples show that a minimal realization will depend on the switching times, our algorithm cannot result in a minimal realization in general, but we conjecture that it results in a minimal realization for almost all switching times.

To save the communication resource, the output measurements are transmitted to the controller based on a novel double-events-triggered (DET) mechanism driven by transient performance request. Due to the use of triggered mechanism, only discontinuous output signals can be utilized such that the derived virtual controls are discontinuous, of which the derivatives cannot be computed as often done in standard backstepping design procedure. To overcome this difficulty, a new error signal decomposition and compensation mechanism is proposed to quantify and compensate for the difference between the virtual controls derived by using the event-triggered measurement signals and the real-time system outputs. Through a nonsmooth stability analysis where the closed-loop stability is considered under different conditions of output data transmissions, it is shown that the tracking error remains within a prespecified performance bound all the time. In contrast to the existing backstepping results addressing event-triggered outputs, the designed DET mechanism does not require the virtual control signals to be reversely transmitted to the sensor side from the controller side and guarantees the communication burden can be reduced under tracking performance guarantees.},

Under the distributed fusion framework, the optimal local estimator on each observable subspace is obtained by the ideas similar to those in the centralized fusion framework. Then, two different distributed fusion estimators are respectively designed by means of a spectral radius inequality and a trace inequality, where the former achieves better estimation performance and the latter is more computationally efficient.

The deflation process as well as the partial truncation and compression are presented to control the growth of the columns of the low-ranked factors, effectively reducing the complexity of the FSS method. The convergence of the banded and the low-ranked parts is established and the banded part is shown being always numerically banded under some assumptions.

It is well-known that if the model order is not chosen carefully, models with either large variance or large bias would be resulted, which is one of the obstacles to further improve the modeling and tracking performances of data-driven ILC in practice. An emerging trend in the system identification community to deal with this issue is using regularization instead of the statistical tests, e.g., AIC, BIC, and one of the representatives is the so-called kernel-based regularization method (KRM). In this paper, we integrate KRM into data-driven ILC to handle a class of repetitive linear time-varying systems, and moreover, we show that the proposed method has ultimately bounded tracking error in the iteration domain. The numerical simulation results show that in contrast with the least squares method and some existing data-driven ILC methods, the proposed one can give faster convergence speed, better accuracy and robustness in terms of the tracking performance.},

Unlike the existing parametric estimation methods, our proposed algorithm does not require prior knowledge about the state to be estimated, e.g. the number of modes and the feasible classes of function. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is not required to store massive parameters during filtering as the existing nonparametric Bayesian filters, e.g. the particle filter. The parameters of the proposed parametrization can also be determined by a convex optimization scheme with moments constraints, to which the solution is proved to exist and be unique. A necessary and sufficient condition for all the power moments of the density estimate to exist and be finite is provided. The errors of power moments are analyzed for the density estimate being either light-tailed or heavy-tailed. Error upper bounds of the density estimate for the one-step prediction are proposed. Simulation results on different types of density functions of the state are given, including the heavy-tailed densities, to validate the proposed algorithm.},

Second, using averaging tools several variants of the time-varying perturbations are considered and the respective conditions are derived evaluating the stability margins in the system. The results are obtained by a careful choice and comparison of Lyapunov–Krasovskii and Lyapunov–Razumikhin approaches. Finally, the obtained theoretical findings are illustrated on two mechanical systems .},

  abstract     = {The data-driven model predictive control (MPC) approach has been an effective tool for unknown constrained systems. However, most of the existing designs rely on the prior collected data sequence through offline trials, which may be affected by time-varying disturbances, or the online estimated system model with the non-trivial computation cost. This limits the applications of these designs. To alleviate these restrictions, in this paper, an input-mapping data-driven scheme is developed. This scheme online directly maps the future control policy and the predicted state to the past online noisy input/state data which are updated once new data come. This overcomes the limitations of previous designs. To ensure the system constraints, this scheme is combined with a tube MPC method and the proposed input-mapping data-driven tube MPC can guarantee the recursive feasibility and the input-to state stability. Two examples illustrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

The estimation of the control gain matrices , especially in some non-canonical forms, may be singular during parameter adaptation, which leads to the singularity problems of the adaptive control laws. This paper employs the matrix decomposition technique to solve the problem under a linearly parameterized adaptive control framework. The state and output feedback cases are addressed, respectively, to ensure closed-loop stability and asymptotic output tracking. Compared with the existing results, the features of the proposed adaptive control scheme include: (i) the proposed control laws do not involve the high-gain issue commonly encountered in robust control methods; (ii) two different filtered tracking error signals are introduced for the state and output feedback cases, respectively. These filters are crucial to avoid causality contradiction of the adaptive control laws commonly encountered in adaptive control of discrete-time systems; and (iii) a future time signal estimation-based adaptive control law is developed to ensure asymptotic output tracking for the output feedback case without requiring the high-gain observer.

This paper proposes a distributed feasible method (DFM) for resource allocation based on barrier functions. In DFM, every iterate is feasible and safe to implement since it does not violate the physical constraints. We prove that, under mild conditions, DFM converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimum. Numerical experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of DFM.},

However, most existing works focus on the situation without knowledge of the process and measurement noise shaping matrices, i.e., the latter two are taken to be identity matrices in most existing methods. In practice, one might have some prior structural information about how the process/measurement noises affect the system dynamics/measurements. For the above case where the noise shaping matrices are not identity matrices , concise conditions under which the system noise covariances can be uniquely identified have not been discovered so far. To fill the above gap, in this paper, we propose to use deadbeat filters in the ALS framework. By doing so, we will establish concrete sufficient conditions under which one can uniquely identify the process, measurement, and the cross noise covariance matrices . The above results will also be extended to systems with unknown inputs. Albeit the results might be of limited scope, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such conditions have been presented in the literature for standard linear systems and systems with unknown inputs.},

We show in the absence of the G C D GCD condition that the system is nearly controllable, i.e., controllable except for a set of Lebesgue measure zero.

  abstract     = {We consider distributed consensus in networks where the agents have integrator dynamics of order two or higher ( n ≥ 2 n≥2 ). We assume all feedback to be localized in the sense that each agent has a bounded number of neighbors and consider a scaling of the network through the addition of agents in a modular manner, i.e., without re-tuning controller gains upon addition. We show that standard consensus algorithms, which rely on relative state feedback, are subject to what we term scale fragilities, meaning that stability is lost as the network scales. For high-order agents ( n ≥ 3 n≥3 ), we prove that no consensus algorithm with fixed gains can achieve consensus in networks of any size. That is, while a given algorithm may allow a small network to converge, it causes instability if the network grows beyond a certain finite size. This holds in families of network graphs whose algebraic connectivity, that is, the smallest non-zero Laplacian eigenvalue, is decreasing towards zero in network size (e.g. all planar graphs). For second-order consensus ( n = 2 n=2 ) we prove that the same scale fragility applies to directed graphs that have a complex Laplacian eigenvalue approaching the origin (e.g. directed ring graphs). The proofs for both results rely on Routh–Hurwitz criteria for complex-valued polynomials and hold true for general directed network graphs. We survey classes of graphs subject to these scale fragilities, discuss their scaling constants, and finally prove that a sub-linear scaling of nodal neighborhoods can suffice to overcome the issue.},

For this purpose, we define a completely synchronous composition of a timed automaton and a given timed pattern. Then, a timed pattern recognizer and a diagnoser are designed, which are suitable to solve the timed pattern diagnosis problem as a state isolation problem.

It evaluates the performance of the system designs in a finite set by sampling and aims to correctly make ordinal comparison of the designs. A well-known method in OO is the optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA). It builds the optimality conditions for the number of samples allocated to each design, and the sample allocation that satisfies the optimality conditions is shown to asymptotically maximize the probability of correct selection for the best design. In this paper, we investigate two popular OCBA algorithms. With known variances for samples of each design, we characterize their convergence rates with respect to different performance measures . We first demonstrate that the two OCBA algorithms achieve the optimal convergence rate under measures of probability of correct selection and expected opportunity cost. It fills the void of convergence analysis for OCBA algorithms. Next, we extend our analysis to the measure of cumulative regret, a main measure studied in the field of machine learning. We show that with minor modification, the two OCBA algorithms can reach the optimal convergence rate under cumulative regret. It indicates the potential of broader use of algorithms designed based on the OCBA optimality conditions.},

In principle, finding such a controller is a non-convex robust optimization problem. Our main result shows that, by exploiting duality, the problem can be recast into a convex, albeit infinite-dimensional, functional Linear Program . To address the computational complexity entailed in solving this problem, we show that a sequence of increasingly tight finite dimensional semi-definite relaxations can be obtained using sum-of-squares and Putinar’s Positivstellensatz arguments. Finally, we show that these arguments can also be used to find controllers that minimize a worst-case (over all plants in the consistency set) closed-loop H 2 H2 cost.

The output-feedback synchronization problem in the context of this work is formulated via robust output regulation and reinforcement learning modeling the interactions among agents by a zero-sum game. The proposed learning and control structure only requires the local system data for each agent and distributed output data among communicating neighbors. We utilize system-level synchysis for the continuous-time state reconstruction for the distributed learning with convergence and stability proofs under the proposed output-feedback policy for solving the zero-sum game. We further show that policy learning is assured under the proposed data criteria relating to input–output data only rather than any inter-immediate gains from policy iterations . Based on the cooperative robust output regulation, this work gains robustness after the learning is complete and establishes an output data-driven distributed optimal robust synchronization without knowing accurate system dynamics . A numerical example shows the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm.},

Distributed observers are developed for each vehicle to provide the position reference under the effects of switching topologies and unpredictable maneuvers of the leaders.

The associated control problem is inherently difficult since it is both nonlinear and underactuated. This paper describes a novel control strategy for Matrix Converters based on Transient Power Balance. The scheme achieves the following design objectives: tracking of a desired load current, tracking of a desired supply (leading or lagging) power factor, rapid active damping of supply-current oscillations, arising from a supply-side resonant filter, without needing any additional resistance on the supply side, and mitigation of supply-current distortion arising from supply-voltage distortion. Achieving these goals simultaneously has hitherto been an open problem in this area. All of these goals are achieved in the face of significant errors in circuit component values. A proof of local asymptotic stability of the proposed algorithm is given and associated design constraints are addressed. The claims are illustrated by simulation studies.},

Then, a new encryption approach, which is composed of two-step sequential noise injections, is developed such that the highest confidentiality rank can be achieved. It is rather remarkable that the weighting fusion matrix, which is unique in the distributed fusion estimation field, is utilized to design perturbation noises. In this case, the compensating fusion estimator of legitimate user can effectively reduce the adverse impact of disturbance with null space design in the proposed approach. Moreover, the probability distribution of inserted noises simultaneously satisfies the differential privacy, which strongly enhances the confidentiality level of local state estimates.

The classical assumptions for MDP structural results require supermodularity of the rewards and transition probabilities. However, supermodularity does not hold in many applications. This paper uses a sufficient condition for interval dominance (called I I ) proposed in the micro-economics literature, to obtain structural results for MDPs under more general conditions. We present several MDP examples where supermodularity does not hold, yet I I holds, and so the optimal policy is monotone; these include sigmoidal rewards (arising in prospect theory for human decision making), bi-diagonal and perturbed bi-diagonal transition matrices (in optimal allocation problems). We also consider MDPs with TP3 transition matrices and concave value functions. Finally, reinforcement learning algorithms that exploit the differential sparse structure of the optimal monotone policy are discussed.},

Prediction methods must be accurate for reliable navigation, but also computationally efficient to enable online path planning. Efficient prediction methods are especially crucial when testing large sets of candidate trajectories. We present a prediction method that has the same accuracy as existing methods, but up to an order of magnitude faster. This is achieved by rewriting the conflict prediction problem in terms of the first-passage time distribution using a dimension-reduction transform. First-passage time distributions are analytically derived for a subset of Gaussian processes describing vehicle motion. The proposed method is applicable to 2-D stochastic processes where the mean can be approximated by line segments, and the conflict boundary can be approximated by piece-wise straight lines. The proposed method was tested in simulation and compared to two probability flow methods, as well as a recent instantaneous conflict probability method. The results demonstrate a significant decrease of computation time.},

Each SVO is designed for one healthy or faulty system mode to obtain the corresponding output estimation set (OES). The principle of fault diagnosis is to check whether the considered OES includes the system output. Compared with the existing works that mainly make use of SVOs to obtain accurate estimation results, our proposed method optimizes the observer gains to deform OESs such that the exclusion tendency of the system output in each OES is maximized. With this idea, inconsistent system modes can be removed rapidly, and faults can be diagnosed. The design logic is formulated as a bi-level max–min problem, which is transformed into a linear problem by Lagrangian duality and solved efficiently. At the end of this paper, a quadruple-tank example is used to compare the results of our proposed method with an existing fault diagnosis method to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A payoff vector quantifying the incentives provided by a planner for each strategy, after deducting the strategies’ intrinsic costs, influences the revision process. An evolutionary dynamics model captures the population’s preferences in the revision process by specifying as a function of the payoff vector the rates at which the agents’ choices flow toward strategies with higher payoffs. Our main result is a dynamic payoff mechanism that is guaranteed to steer the epidemic variables (via incentives to the population) to the endemic equilibrium with the smallest infectious fraction, subject to cost constraints.

The hierarchical controller, developed based on a dual-time-scale model decomposition, consists of two loops of control: the outer-loop translation control and the inner-loop rotation control. For translation control, we propose a novel fault-tolerant Lyapunov-based model predictive control strategy with the integration of an adaptive parameter estimator. For rotation control, feedback linearization and adaptive estimation are employed and a fault-tolerant control law is designed. The two loops of the developed hierarchical control system are both implemented in a sample-and-hold scheme with dual sampling rates — the outer-loop is sampled several times slower than the inner-loop. With the inter-sample behavior and the interconnection between the translational and rotational dynamics taken into account, the closed-loop stability of the dual-loop and dual-rate control system is rigorously proven using singular perturbation theory. Sufficient stability conditions are established, based on which control parameters and sampling periods can be tuned jointly such that a trade-off between computation efficiency and control accuracy can be attained. Results of numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design in trajectory tracking and fault tolerance.},

  abstract     = {To deal with the issue of model uncertainty, extensive stochastic MPC methods have been investigated, where the uncertainties are typically assumed to follow given statistical distributions. However, in practical scenarios, the statistical properties of model uncertainties may depend on certain hyperparameters varying both temporally and spatially. For instance, in the applications of aero-engine control, different types of uncertainties may occur under different operational conditions, such as flight altitudes and Mach numbers , which are dynamically changing. Traditionally, the stochastic MPC methods may not be able to handle these types of uncertainties directly. Therefore, we propose a spatiotemporal learning-based stochastic model predictive control algorithm to study the stochastic optimal control problem with dynamically changing uncertainties, by constructing spatiotemporal Gaussian processes (GPs) to approximate the uncertainties based on measurement data. Since the spatiotemporal GPs may be difficult to evaluate with long processing time series, we present a state–space representation of GPs to employ computationally efficient Kalman filtering. Then, we derive a computationally tractable control strategy by parameterizing the controller and reformulating the cost and chance constraints, and analyze the corresponding recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to the compressor control of the aero-engine, and the comparisons with other MPC controllers are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of our methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of indistinguishable group target tracking, where the individual targets within a group are closely spaced and resolvable, move in a coordinated manner, and the group splitting and merging may occur. In such a case, the performance of the commonly used multi-target tracking methods may be degraded. We focus on three aspects of the problem: deal with the group association, group splitting and merging, and derive the state estimates of the individual targets. First, in order to deal with the group partition and the group association globally, we propose a novel group target tracking method within the multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) framework by extending the target partition and the measurement partition as parts of global hypotheses. An efficient algorithm is given to find the M M -best group partition and association simultaneously. Second, we use the undirected graph to represent the interaction between groups and then obtain an identification method of the group splitting and merging. Third, in response to the state estimate of the group target, a group-individual Bayesian filter is designed to estimate the states of the virtual leader and the individual targets. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The conditions for exact satisfaction of the optimality conditions are also discussed. Further, the equivalence between the tangential interpolation conditions and the gramians-based necessary condition for the local optimum is established. Based on this equivalence, iterative algorithms that nearly satisfy these interpolation-based necessary conditions are proposed. The deviations in satisfaction of the optimality conditions decay as the order of the reduced-model is increased. Moreover, stationary point iteration algorithms that satisfy two out of three necessary conditions for the local minimizer are also proposed. There also, the deviation in satisfaction of the third optimality condition decays as the order of the reduced-model is increased. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is validated by considering benchmark examples known for testing model order reduction algorithms.},

The particle filtering technique plays a key role in the developed DSE scheme with aim to tackle the nonlinearities and the non-Gaussian noises. To mitigate the negative impact from the measurement outliers on the DSE performance, a novel sliding-window-based online algorithm is proposed to detect and further locate the possible outliers based on the historical measurement data. Specifically, some criteria are constructed to (i) determine whether a newly arriving measurement vector is contaminated by measurement outliers and (ii) locate the abnormal components of such a vector. A conditional posterior Cramér–Rao lower bound is derived to evaluate the estimation performance of the proposed DSE algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out on the IEEE-39 bus system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed DSE algorithm under the non-Gaussian noises and the measurement outliers.},

Employing a standard observer-based state feedback control law, a self-triggering mechanism that dictates the next sampling time based on quantized output is co-developed with an output encoding scheme. If, in addition, the transmission protocols at the controller-to-actuator (C–A) and sensor-to-controller (S–C) channels can be adapted, the self-triggered control architecture can be considerably simplified, leveraging a delicate observer-based deadbeat controller to eliminate the need for running the controller in parallel at the encoder side . To account for denial-of-service (DoS) in the S–C channel, the proposed output encoding and self-triggered control schemes are further made resilient. It is shown that a linear time-invariant system can be exponentially stabilized if some conditions on the average DoS duration time are met. There is a trade-off between the maximum inter-sampling time and the resilience against DoS attacks . Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the practical merits of the proposed self-triggered control schemes and associated theory.},

Here, by using a global structural approach , we study the net rank-controllability (NRC), a structural property of the TCPN. Under the assumption of liveness, it is shown that NRC is a sufficient condition for controllability; nevertheless, if liveness is not fulfilled then controllability is not guaranteed by NRC The advantage of this approach is that NRC is characterized in terms of global structural objects of the net, thus, avoiding the analysis by configurations. In this sense, some new structural sufficient conditions for NRC are introduced for general TCPNs. Finally, polynomial-time algorithms for the verification of NRC are provided.},

Given a dictionary of functions, these methods approximate the projection of the action of the operator on the finite-dimensional subspace spanned by the dictionary. We propose the Tunable Symmetric Subspace Decomposition algorithm to refine the dictionary, balancing its expressiveness and accuracy. Expressiveness corresponds to the ability of the dictionary to describe the evolution of as many observables as possible and accuracy corresponds to the ability to correctly predict their evolution. Based on the observation that Koopman-invariant subspaces give rise to exact predictions, we reason that prediction accuracy is a function of the degree of invariance of the subspace generated by the dictionary and provide a data-driven measure to measure invariance proximity. The proposed algorithm iteratively prunes the initial function space to identify a refined dictionary of functions that satisfies the desired level of accuracy while retaining as much of the original expressiveness as possible. We provide a full characterization of the algorithm properties and show that it generalizes both Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Symmetric Subspace Decomposition. Simulations on multiple systems show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in producing Koopman approximations of tunable accuracy that capture relevant information about the dynamical system.},

  abstract     = {Joint utility-maximization problems for multi-agent systems often should be addressed by distributed strategy-selection formulation. Constrained by discrete feasible strategy sets, these problems are broadly formulated as NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. In many cases, these problems can be cast as constrained submodular set function maximization problems, which also belong to the NP-hard domain of problems. A prominent example is the problem of multi-agent mobile sensor dispatching over a discrete domain. This paper considers a class of submodular optimization problems that consist of maximization of a monotone and submodular set function subject to a partition matroid constraint over a group of networked agents that communicate over a connected undirected graph. We work with the value oracle model. Consequently, the only access of the agents to the utility function is through a black box that returns the utility function value given a specific strategy set. We propose a distributed suboptimal polynomial-time algorithm that enables each agent to obtain its respective strategy via local interactions with its neighboring agents. Our solution is a fully distributed gradient-based algorithm using the submodular set functions’ multilinear extension followed by a distributed stochastic Pipage rounding procedure. This algorithm results in a strategy set that when the team utility function is evaluated at the worst case, the utility function value is in 1 c ( 1 − e − c − O ( 1 / T ) ) 1c(1−e−c−O(1/T)) of the optimal solution with c c being the curvature of the submodular function. An example demonstrates our results.},

Unlike existing methods whose time-varying gain tends to infinity, our approach yields a time-varying gain that remains bounded at the convergence time.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the optimal estimation problem for linear time-invariant systems over lossy communication networks subject to multi-channel packet losses . In its full generality, we assume that the random packet losses are spatially correlated across different channels. The problem is addressed by employing a modified Kalman filter to estimate the system’s states, and the primary issue under study is the convergence of the state estimate under a mean-square criterion. This convergence is shown to be equivalent to the existence of a stabilizing solution to a modified algebraic Riccati equation . We provide a necessary and sufficient condition to characterize the existence of the stabilizing solution, and show that the solution can be computed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Additionally, from a robust convergence perspective, we consider further packet losses whose probabilities are unknown and uncertain. We develop a matrix measure referred to as the critical matrix to characterize the maximal tolerance for the modified Kalman filter to converge. Specifically, we show that the mean-square estimation error is bounded if and only if the critical matrix satisfies a positive semi-definiteness condition.},

First, the definition of prescribed-time stability for nonlinear time-delay systems is given, and the necessary conditions to realize the finite-time (including fixed/prescribed-time) stabilization of the nonlinear time-delay system are illustrated. Then, the prescribed-time Lyapunov stability theorem is proposed by utilizing the prescribed-time adjustment function and Lyapunov–Krasovskii (L–K) functional method. The stability of the resulting closed-loop system is proved and the different situations for uncertain time-delay systems are discussed. For first-order fully actuated system, a continuous controller is designed. The effects of different prescribed-time adjustment functions on the controller are also studied.

  abstract     = {A collection of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) – such as air conditioners – can vary their power consumption within limits to help the balancing authority of a power grid maintain demand supply balance. Doing so requires loads to coordinate their on/off decisions so that the aggregate power consumption tracks a grid-supplied reference. At the same time, each consumer’s quality of service (QoS) must be maintained. While there is a large body of work on TCL coordination, they do not provide guarantees on the reference tracking performance or QoS maintenance, and they do not provide a means to compute a suitable reference signal for power demand of a collection of TCLs. In this work we provide a framework that addresses these two weaknesses. The framework enables coordination of an arbitrary number of TCLs that: (i) is computationally efficient, (ii) is implementable at the TCLs with local feedback and low communication, and (iii) enables reference tracking by the collection while ensuring that temperature and cycling constraints are satisfied at every TCL at all times. The framework is based on a Markov model obtained by discretizing a pair of Fokker–Planck equations derived in earlier work by Malhame and Chong (1985). We then use this model to design randomized policies for TCLs. The balancing authority broadcasts the same policy to all TCLs, and each TCL implements this policy which requires only local measurement to make on/off decisions. Simulation results are provided to support these claims. Matlab implementation is made publicly available.},

  abstract     = {Interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSMs) are gaining popularity in e-mobility applications due to their wide constant power speed range when compared with other electric motors. The high-performance of IPMSMs is due to the pronounced degree of magnetic saliency, which originates from embedding their magnets inside the rotor. Yet, this feature complicates their control since it increases nonlinear phenomena such as cross-magnetization and saturation. This results in pronounced variations of the machine inductances, which are highly dependent on the machine current. This behaviour is of particular relevance in e-mobility applications, where a highly dynamic operation of the machine is required. In contrast to most existing current control approaches, where precise inductance knowledge is required, we address this challenge by deriving a controller that exploits the machine dynamics to achieve exponential current tracking in the presence of unknown and varying inductances. By interpreting the flux linkage as a modelled disturbance, we propose a dynamic compensator based on the internal model principle. As a by-product, the method provides an estimate of the flux linkage. The gain in performance compared to the standard PI controller is illustrated in simulation.},

Inspired by reference governor techniques, we introduce a virtual governor system, whose state specifies an output regulation point for the actual system and is controlled to adaptively track an output reference without violating the constraints. Our main contribution is a governor-parameterized barrier function (PBF) that quantifies the trade-off between safety (distance from constraint violation) and system energy (output-regulation Lyapunov function). The PBF defines a local safe set that varies as the system-governor state or the sensor measurements change. This safe set induces a governor control law, which guarantees safe and stable output tracking for the real system. We demonstrate our adaptive output-tracking controller on a feedback-linearizable system navigating in an unknown environment, where obstacle distances are measured online.},

Motivated by this scenario, we investigate the continued capability of control systems to perform their task despite partial loss of authority over their actuators. We say that a system is resilient to such a malfunction if for any undesirable inputs and any target state there exists an admissible control driving the state to the target. Building on controllability conditions and differential games theory, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the resilience of linear systems. As their task might be time-constrained, ensuring completion alone is not sufficient. We also want to estimate how much slower the malfunctioning system is compared to its nominal performance. Relying on Lyapunov theory we derive analytical bounds on the reach times of the nominal and malfunctioning systems in order to quantify their resilience.

Compared with the existing TOD scheduling, the proposed scheduling scheme has the advantage of jumping out the attacked nodes by designing node weighting matrices. To reduce the effects of DoS attacks, an attack-model-independent impulsive closed-loop model is well established, which couples the effects of the proposed protocol and DoS attacks in a unified framework. Then, a sufficient attack-model-independent stabilization criterion is derived.

First, by considering the nonperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that only constrain their frequency and duration and removing the strict assumption on the malicious information injected by deception attacks in existing literature, an unexplored hybrid cyberattack model is proposed. Second, a novel NN-based adaptive event-triggered state-feedback controller is designed, which not only flexibly solves the resource constraints of CPSs while considering the adverse effects of DoS attacks, but also adopts an on-line weight-adjusted NN to approximate and mitigate the malicious information injected by deception attacks. Then, the switched delay system model is established for the closed-loop control system with the designed novel controller. By carefully constructing a switched Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and using the switched delay system theory and NN technology, the explicit form of the designed novel controller is obtained, which can ensure that the closed-loop control system is exponentially asymptotically stable (EAS). Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

The tangent barrier Lyapunov function (TAN-BLF) is selected to ensure that the system states satisfy their corresponding time-varying constraint bounds .

We consider specifically filtered PID controllers, out of the necessity in practical implementation of PID controllers. We examine first-order unstable systems and seek to find analytical expressions of the maximal gain and phase margins achievable by filtered PID control, where the maximal gain and phase margins are referred to as the largest ranges of gain and phase variations within which the system is guaranteed to be stabilizable. Our results show that the maximal gain margin can be determined explicitly, while the maximal phase margin can be computed by solving a third-order polynomial, which in turn can be solved explicitly. We also investigate the gain and phase maximization problems subject to a performance constraint, which has direct linkages to the steady-state and transient performances of a system. Our results show how in a practically implementable PID control scheme the gain and phase margins may be confined by the plant characteristics, and how in the limit it can perform equally well as other optimal controllers . The results also shed light into the tradeoff between performance and robustness of PID controllers.},

The result is applied in the robustness analysis with respect to uncertainties both in the system matrices and in the delays. It provides a simple way to prove the robust stability conditions due to obviating the need to work with indefinite derivatives of functionals along the solutions of a perturbed system.

  abstract     = {Non-holonomic systems are of immense practical value and increasingly subject to automation. However, controlling them accurately, e.g., when parking vehicles, is challenging for automatic control methods, including model predictive control (MPC). Combining results from MPC theory and sub-Riemannian geometry in the form of homogeneous nilpotent system approximations, this paper proposes the first comprehensive, ready-to-apply design procedure for MPC controllers to steer controllable, driftless non-holonomic systems into given setpoints . It can be ascertained that the resulting controllers nominally asymptotically stabilize the setpoint for a large-enough prediction horizon. The design procedure is exemplarily applied to four systems, including the kinematic car and a differentially driven mobile robot with up to two trailers. The controllers use a non-quadratic cost function tailored to the non-holonomic kinematics. Novelly, it is proven that a quadratic cost employed in an otherwise similar controller is insufficient to reliably asymptotically stabilize the closed loop for all considered vehicles. Since quadratic costs are the conventional choice in control, this highlights the relevance of the findings. To the knowledge of the authors, it is the first time that MPC controllers of the proposed structure are formulated and applied to non-holonomic systems beyond very simple ones, in particular (partly) on hardware.},

Gaussian Process regression is used to estimate the threat field from these measurements. Crucially, the sensors are configurable, i.e., parameters such as location and size of field of view can be changed. A main innovation of this work is that sensor configuration is performed by maximizing a so-called task-driven information gain (TDIG) metric, which quantifies uncertainty reduction in the cost of the planned path. For computational efficiency, a surrogate metric called the self-adaptive mutual information (SAMI) is introduced and shown to be submodular. The proposed method is shown to vastly outperform traditionally decoupled information-driven sensor configuration in terms of the number of measurements required to find near-optimal plans.},

The plant is modeled as a discrete-time stochastic linear system with sensor measurements transmitted to the remote estimator over an intelligent relay. A dynamic cooperative team is formulated in which the sensor and the relay sharing the same cost function are equipped with corresponding energy harvesters , and need to decide on the transmission power levels to minimize the average error covariance at the remote estimator. Since the nodes make simultaneous decisions to achieve a common goal, the sensor and the relay do not have access to the transmission power that will be selected by another node in advance, and hence they cannot build a value estimation of the cost function directly at each time point, which poses a challenge to determine the optimal transmission policies of both sides. To overcome this challenge, we provide a local-action value function and prove that both nodes select the transmission power with respect to the local-action value function without any loss of performance. In addition, a Markov decision process (MDP) and a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm are presented to obtain the optimal transmission power schedule over an infinite time horizon. Finally, simulation examples are provided to corroborate and illustrate the theoretical results.},

In the absence of network attack, an optimal distributed minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator is developed by fusing the interaction measurements from neighboring nodes in the sensor network. Also, the boundedness of distributed estimation covariance is discussed over a regionally observable sensor network, which weakens the requirement for local observability of each sensor. Then, a stealthy attack framework embedded with an adjustable parameter is proposed, under which the attack strategy is to maximize the distributed estimation covariance. Sufficient conditions on the boundedness of the compromised covariance are derived, and the tradeoff between attack stealthiness and attack effects is determined. Finally, numerical examples are shown to verify the developed techniques.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven predictive control (DDPC) has been recently proposed as an effective alternative to traditional model-predictive control (MPC) for its unique features of being time-efficient and unbiased with respect to the oracle solution. Nonetheless, it has also been observed that noise may strongly jeopardize the final closed-loop performance, since it affects both the data-based system representation and the control update computed from the online measurements. Recent studies have shown that regularization is potentially a successful tool to counteract the effect of noise. At the same time, regularization requires the tuning of a set of penalty terms, whose choice might be practically difficult without closed-loop experiments In this paper, by means of subspace identification tools, we pursue a three-fold goal: ( i ) (i) we set up a unified framework for the existing regularized data-driven predictive control schemes for stochastic systems ; ( i i ) (ii) we introduce γ γ -DDPC, an efficient two-stage scheme that splits the optimization problem in two parts: fitting the initial conditions and optimizing the future performance, while guaranteeing constraint satisfaction; ( i i i ) (iii) we discuss the role of regularization for data-driven predictive control, providing new insight on when and how it should be applied. A benchmark numerical case study finally illustrates the performance of γ γ -DDPC, showing how controller design can be simplified in terms of tuning effort and computational complexity when benefiting from the insights coming from the subspace identification realm.},

The core of the proposed approach consists in defining an ad-hoc versatile framework whose main feature consists in the ability of being geared to different classes of attacks. This is formally achieved by resorting to the receding horizon philosophy that is fully exploited for detection, countermeasures and control purposes. In particular, set-theoretic model predictive arguments are combined with the perturbation analysis and sequential quadratic programming to reduce as much as possible the occurrence of refresh procedures on the communication network when resilient command actions are no longer available. Further, one of its main merits consists in the dismissal of constructive assumptions existing in recent competitors. In this respect, the framework is customized for covert attacks by specifying actuation/detection phases and proving feasibility and closed-loop stability properties.},

Considering the impulsive effect, the destabilizing and stabilizing delayed impulses are studied, respectively. It is revealed that the random delay in impulses plays a significant role on the stability of the system, which may not only destabilize a stable system but also stabilize an unstable system. In particular, our results allow the delays in continuous dynamics and impulsive dynamics to exceed the length of the impulsive interval, which are more general than previous results.

In this paper, it is applied to estimate the states and the output’s derivatives for linear singular systems with multiple inputs and multiple outputs in noisy environment . First, the considered singular system is transformed into a form similar to the Brunovsky’s observable canonical form with the injection of the inputs’ and outputs’ derivatives. Second, algebraic integral formulas are obtained both for the state variables and the outputs’ derivatives. After giving solutions of the required auxiliary systems, error analysis in discrete noisy case is addressed, where a provided noise error bound can be used to select design parameters.

To be specific, we take into account the detection delay of topology switchings when designing the corresponding observers. The novelty of the design arises in the continuity of the Lyapunov function at the switching instants and in the discontinuity when the topology modes and the observer modes are matched. This property can possibly allow the value of the Lyapunov function to be non-increasing during the unmatched intervals, which reduces the conservativeness of topology switching signal in the sense that a more relaxed condition than state-of-the-art ones can be obtained. Moreover, a new Laplacian matrix is incorporated into our design to handle the dilemma that each agent can only receive the local neighboring information from the common neighbors before and after topology switchings. Hypersonic flight vehicles have been employed to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.},

The triggering decisions of the sensor determine the transmissions of measurements, and are unknown to the remote estimator due to the interference of channel noises. Based on a commonly-accepted Gaussian assumption, an approximate minimum mean squared error estimator with adaptive weights is derived by a Bayesian inference approach. The approximate estimator convexly combines the estimates for both transmission and no transmission cases, and the weights are adaptively updated according to the received data. Further, the proposed estimator behaves like the Kalman filtering with intermittent observations under two extreme situations. Finally, the a posteriori distribution of the estimation process is analyzed when the remote estimator knows the triggering decisions. Numerical results demonstrate that the performance of our estimator is comparable to those that know the triggering decisions, and also better than the detection-based estimator.},

This leads to a nonlinear, hyperbolic, integro-partial differential equation (IPDE) with non-local integral boundary conditions (BC) in the modeling. The steady-states of this system can be uniquely determined by a substitution due to the non-local BC. Using the asymptotic properties of the system, the IPDE is split into finite-dimensional dynamics and infinite dimensional internal dynamics. The internal dynamics are globally exponentially stable. Therefore, a feedforward control based on the finite dimensional dynamics is designed, augmented with a feedback control to compensate for the remaining influence of the internal dynamics on the output. Finally, the control concept is supplemented by an observer. Global exponential attractiveness of certain reference trajectories is proven. The overall control concept is validated experimentally with a bioreactor. A system parameter is identified and it is shown that by applying the control concept, the biomass can track various reference trajectories with small errors.},

This result checks stability in terms of a scalar called the network gain, hence we call the result the network gain theorem. The result generalizes the previously known matrix small-gain theorem and cyclic small-gain theorem for ISS. As in these results, our theorem does not assess the stability of a given networked system, but of a whole family of networked systems satisfying certain common assumption. An advantage of our stability condition is that it is not only sufficient, but also necessary, in the sense that, if not met, there exists an unstable networked system within that family. To complement our theoretical result, we propose a fully distributed algorithm to compute the network gain. We present simulation results to illustrate the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Model reduction by moment matching for linear time-invariant (LTI) models is a reduction technique that has a clear interpretation in the Laplace domain. In particular, for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) LTI case, Krylov subspace methods aim at matching the transfer-function matrix (and possibly its derivatives) of the reduced-order model to the transfer-function matrix of the full-order model along so-called tangential directions at desired interpolation points. A straightforward application of time-domain moment matching to MIMO LTI models does not result in such a match in the transfer-function matrix. In this paper, we derive a relation between the MIMO transfer-function matrices of the full- and the reduced-order models that follows from the application of time-domain moment matching on MIMO LTI models. This is subsequently exploited to formulate conditions on the parameters of time-domain moment matching under which the transfer-function matrix is matched along tangential directions, thus ensuring consistency with classical Krylov subspace methods.},

  abstract     = {We present a new fixed-order H-infinity controller design method for potentially large-scale port-Hamiltonian (pH) plants. Our method computes controllers that are also pH (and thus passive) such that the resulting closed-loop systems is again passive, which ensures closed-loop stability simply from the structure of the plant and controller matrices. In this way, we can avoid computationally expensive eigenvalue computations that would otherwise be necessary. In combination with a sample-based objective function which allows us to avoid multiple evaluations of the H-infinity norm (which is typically the main computational burden in fixed-order H-infinity controller synthesis), this makes our method well-suited for plants with a high state–space dimension. In our numerical experiments, we show that applying a passivity-enforcing post-processing step after using well-established H-infinity synthesis methods often leads to a deteriorated H-infinity performance. By contrast, our method computes pH controllers, that are automatically passive and simultaneously aim to minimize the H-infinity norm of the closed-loop transfer function. Moreover, our experiments show that for large-scale plants, our method is significantly faster than the well-established fixed-order H-infinity controller synthesis methods.},

  abstract     = {For a general optimal control problem for dynamical systems with hybrid dynamics, we study the dependency of the optimal cost on perturbations to problem constraints and mappings. The former limits the allowable values for the state, input, initial and terminal condition, and the terminal time, while the latter is given by the right-hand sides of the differential/difference inclusions defining the dynamics, as well as the functions defining the cost functional We show that upper and lower semicontinuous dependence of solutions on initial conditions – properties that are captured by outer and inner well-posedness, respectively – lead to the existence of a solution to the optimal control problem and upper/lower semicontinuity of the optimal cost. In particular, by exploiting properties of finite horizon reachable sets for hybrid systems, we show that the optimal cost varies upper semicontinuously when the hybrid system is outer well-posed, and lower semicontinuously when it is inner well-posed and an additional assumption requiring partial knowledge of solutions holds. Consequently, when the system is both inner and outer well-posed and the aforementioned assumption holds, the optimal cost varies continuously, and optimal solutions vary outer/upper semicontinuously. We further show that even in the absence of this solution-based assumption, the optimal cost (respectively, solutions) can be continuously (respectively, outer/upper semicontinuously) approximated. Results are demonstrated by examples, theoretically and numerically.},

In some cases, the data gathered is non-numerical or symbolic, and conventional approaches to privacy, e.g., adding noise, do not apply, though such systems still require privacy protections. Accordingly, we present a novel differential privacy framework for protecting trajectories generated by symbolic systems. These trajectories can be represented as words or strings over a finite alphabet. We develop new differential privacy mechanisms that approximate a sensitive word using a random word that is likely to be near it. An offline mechanism is implemented efficiently using a Modified Hamming Distance Automaton to generate whole privatized output words over a finite time horizon. Then, an online mechanism is implemented by taking in a sensitive symbol and generating a randomized output symbol at each timestep. This work is extended to Markov chains to generate differentially private state sequences that a given Markov chain could have produced. Statistical accuracy bounds are developed to quantify the accuracy of these mechanisms, and numerical results validate the accuracy of these techniques for strings of English words.},

The communication between sensor nodes and filters is implemented through a wireless digital communication network with limited bandwidth. A bit rate constraint is first established to quantify the extent to which the network is constrained. A component-based coding–decoding procedure is proposed that enables individual decoder to decode messages from different components scattering in different physical locations. Based on this procedure, a decoded-measurement-based recursive SMF scheme with a prediction–correction structure is put forward. The desired parameters of the set-membership filter can be calculated recursively by the proposed recursive SMF scheme. Furthermore, the co-design issue of the bit rate allocation protocol and the filter gain is converted into the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem that is solved by means of the particle swarm optimization and the recursive filtering algorithms. Finally, numerical simulations on two scenarios are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SMF approach.},

Formal methods have been traditionally used to specify and verify the behavior of computer programs and digital circuits . Enabled by abstraction techniques for dynamical systems and the availability of verification and synthesis tools for finite systems, they have been adopted by the control and robotics communities. In particular, in autonomous driving, recent research proposes formal languages such as temporal logics to specify driving behaviors ranging from safety, such as collision avoidance , to compliance with complex rules of the road. Our review focuses on formal verification, monitoring, and synthesis techniques enabling autonomous vehicles to adhere to such specifications. We only consider works about system-level methods that have an ego-centric perspective, i.e., we focus on the behavior of an autonomous vehicle in its entirety, rather than specific software code within the vehicle or traffic networks consisting of multiple vehicles. This paper also identifies the main remaining challenges.},

A distributed sparse least squares algorithm is proposed by minimizing a local information criterion formulated as a linear combination of accumulative local estimation error and L 1 L1 -regularization term. The upper bound of the estimation error of the proposed algorithm is presented. Furthermore, by designing a suitable adaptive weighting coefficient based on the local observation data, the set convergence of zero elements with a finite number of observations is obtained under a cooperative non-persistent excitation condition. It is shown that the proposed distributed algorithm can work well in a cooperative way even though none of the individual sensors can fulfill the estimation task. Our theoretical results are obtained without relying on the independency assumptions of regression signals that have been commonly used in the existing literature. Thus, our results are expected to be applied to stochastic feedback systems. Finally, the numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

A set of event-triggering conditions are designed for not only the controller but also the parameter estimators, with which the parameter estimator-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels are both event-triggered simultaneously. It is proved that, with our proposed scheme, all the closed-loop signals are globally uniformly bounded, and the system output converges into a compact set which can be made small by appropriately adjusting the design parameters. Also, the Zeno behavior is proved to be excluded. Besides, a modified FTC scheme is designed for the case with finite number of failures, which ensures the asymptotic convergence of system states.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an inverse-kinematics controller for a class of multi-robot systems in the scenario of sampled communication. The goal is to make a group of robots perform trajectory tracking in a coordinated way when the sampling time of communications is much larger than the sampling time of low-level controllers, disrupting theoretical convergence guarantees of standard control design in continuous time. Given a desired trajectory in configuration space which is pre-computed offline, the proposed controller receives configuration measurements, possibly via wireless, to re-compute velocity references for the robots, which are tracked by a low-level controller. We propose joint design of a sampled proportional feedback plus a novel continuous-time feedforward that linearizes the dynamics around the reference trajectory : this method is amenable to distributed communication implementation where only one broadcast transmission is needed per sample. Also, we provide closed-form expressions for instability and stability regions and convergence rate in terms of proportional gain k k and sampling period T T . We test the proposed control strategy via numerical simulations in the scenario of cooperative aerial manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a realistic simulator ( Fly-Crane ). Finally, we compare our proposed controller with centralized approaches that adapt the feedback gain online through smart heuristics, and show that it achieves comparable performance.},

In the paper, by applying the properties of the reachability set of curvature-bounded paths, the explicit conditions for the existence of curvature-bounded paths joining two oriented points with an expected length are established. These existence conditions are numerically verifiable, allowing readily checking the existence of curvature-bounded paths between two prescribed oriented points with a desired length. In addition, once the existence conditions are met, elongation strategies are provided to get curvature-bounded paths with the expected length.

Besides, the designed DNES algorithms are sampled without continuous measurements, which means players can update their actions at each sampling moment to avoid the increasing cost brought by continuous information interaction among players.

Later on, we consider the case where the drift vector fields are unknown and employ GPR for functional fitting as its standard use. GPR describes learning errors in terms of probability, and thus we further discuss how to incorporate stochastic learning errors into the proposed LMI framework.},

Through introducing a sort and filter approach, a novel distributed secure state estimation strategy, where the impact of malicious agents is mitigated through discarding partial extreme values from the received vectors, is proposed. Sufficient conditions on the graph topology and the system matrices to tolerant a bounded number of malicious agents are given. It is shown that by adopting the proposed secure state estimation strategy, normal agents can effectively generate correct state estimate in the presence of malicious agents. Besides, for efficiently updating the state estimate while new measurements are available, a distributed observer is also designed. Compared with the existing techniques searching an appropriate candidate from multiple ones, the proposed secure state estimation strategies are much more computationally efficient since reliable state estimates are generated without brute force search.

The algorithms are completely decentralized, allowing efficient parallelization and applications where the agents may have different behavior policies and different initial state distributions while evaluating a common target policy. It is proved under nonrestrictive assumptions that the proposed algorithms weakly converge to the solutions of the mean ordinary differential equation (ODE) common for all the agents. It is also proved that the whole system may be stabilized by a proper choice of the network and that the parameter estimates weakly converge to consensus. Discussion is given on the asymptotic bias and variance of the estimates, on the projected forms of the proposed algorithms, as well as on restrictiveness of the adopted assumptions.

The model takes the form of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), whose states are given by the number of subjects in different health conditions. The model also exposes the different parameters that have an impact on the spread of the disease and the various decision variables that can be used to control it (e.g, social distancing, number of tests administered to single out infected subjects). The model describes the stochastic phenomena that underlie the spread of the epidemic and captures, in the form of deterministic parameters, some fundamental limitations in the availability of resources (hospital beds and test swabs). The model lends itself to different uses. For a given control policy, it is possible to verify if it satisfies an analytical property on the stochastic evolution of the state (e.g., to compute probability that the hospital beds will reach a fill level, or that a specified percentage of the population will die). If the control policy is not given, it is possible to apply POMDP techniques to identify an optimal control policy that fulfils some specified probabilistic goals. Whilst the paper primarily aims at the model description, we show with numeric examples some of its potential applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an iterative algorithm to compute a Robust Control Invariant (RCI) set, along with an invariance-inducing control law, for Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems. As real-time measurements of the scheduling parameters are typically available, we allow the RCI set description and the invariance-inducing controller to be scheduling parameter dependent. Thus, the considered formulation leads to parameter-dependent conditions for the set invariance, which are replaced by sufficient Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) via Polya’s relaxation. These LMI conditions are then combined with a novel volume maximization approach in a Semidefinite Programming (SDP) problem, which aims at computing the desirably large RCI set. Besides ensuring invariance, it is also possible to guarantee performance within the RCI set by imposing a chosen quadratic performance level as an additional constraint in the SDP problem. Using numerical examples, we show that the presented iterative algorithm can generate RCI sets for large parameter variations where commonly used robust approaches fail.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the distributed strategy design for Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking in multi-cluster games under a partial-decision information scenario. In the considered game, there are multiple clusters and each cluster consists of a group of agents. A cluster is viewed as a virtual noncooperative player that aims to minimize its local payoff function and the agents in a cluster are the actual players that cooperate within the cluster to optimize the payoff function of the cluster through communication via a connected graph. In our setting, agents have only partial-decision information, that is, they only know their own local cost functions, local feasible strategy sets and strategies of neighboring agents. To solve the NE seeking problem of this formulated game, a discrete-time distributed algorithm, called distributed projected gradient tracking algorithm (DPGT), is devised based on the inter- and intra-communication of clusters. In the designed algorithm, each agent is equipped with strategy variables including its own strategy and estimates of other clusters’ strategies. With the help of a weighted Frobenius norm and a weighted Euclidean norm , theoretical analysis is presented to rigorously show the linear convergence of the algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed algorithm.},

Secondly, both algebraic condition and graph condition of network localizability in dynamic networks are given. Thirdly, a distributed localization protocol is proposed such that all the agents can cooperatively find their positions by solving the complex constraints in dynamic networks. Fourthly, the proposed method is extended to address the problem of integrated distributed localization and formation control.

This observer estimates the average states of the clusters, which are identified under explicit consideration of estimation error. Moreover, given the clustering, the proposed observer design algorithm exploits the structure of the estimation error dynamics to achieve computational tractability. Simulations show that the computation of the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than the usual H 2 / H ∞ H2/H∞ observer design techniques. On the other hand, compromise on the estimation error characteristics is shown to be marginal.},

  abstract     = {Most cyber–physical systems (CPS) encounter a large volume of data which is added to the system gradually in real time and not altogether in advance. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that yields optimal control strategies for such CPS at the intersection of control theory and learning. In the proposed framework, we use the actual CPS, i.e., the “true” system that we seek to optimally control online, in parallel with a model of the CPS that is available. We then institute an information state for the system which does not depend on the control strategy. An important consequence of this independence is that for any given choice of a control strategy and a realization of the system’s variables until time t , t, the information states at future times do not depend on the choice of the control strategy at time t t but only on the realization of the decision at time t , t, and thus they are related to the concept of separation between estimation of the state and control. Namely, the future information states are separated from the choice of the current control strategy. Such control strategies are called separated control strategies. Hence, we can derive offline the optimal control strategy of the system with respect to the information state, which might not be precisely known due to model uncertainties or complexity of the system, and then use standard learning approaches to learn the information state online while data are added gradually to the system in real time. We show that after the information state becomes known, the separated control strategy of the CPS model derived offline is optimal for the actual system. We illustrate the proposed framework in a dynamic system consisting of two subsystems with a delayed sharing information structure.},

We consider several different types of optimization objectives , such as (1) minimization of attack energy cost, and (2) minimization of time cost to cause damage infliction; for the latter one, asynchronous event firings and concurrent event firings at the plant are both considered. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal attacker for both the energy minimization case and damage infliction time minimization case.

Unlike the conventional passive FE approaches that maintain the performance of FE by only adjusting parametric matrices, the proposed method guarantees the precision and optimality of FE by actively designing optimal inputs at each time instant under the set-theoretic framework, which is named as active fault estimation (AFE). Meanwhile, by constructing a quadratic Lyapunov function , the stability of augmented estimation-error dynamics can be guaranteed based on H ∞ H∞ setting by solving a group of matrix inequalities. In addition, the optimal inputs are also designed to implement the objective of integrated AFE and FTC for LPV systems, which leads to a balance between the goal of AFE and the reference output tracking performance. Although the original optimization problem computing the optimal inputs is not convex, it is proved that this problem can be equivalently transformed to a family of convex quadratic programming problems with linear constraints. At the end, a physical vehicle model is used to verify the effectiveness of our proposed integrated AFE and FTC method.},

Thanks to the proposed reduction mechanism in the parametric learning law, iteration-varying initial state errors, as well as the unknown inertia matrix and external disturbances , can be addressed effectively. Moreover, to avoid the chattering phenomenon of the control signals, we introduce an approximation of the sign function. Of note is that this approximation leads to a class of non-negative definite problems. A new analytical method is consequently exploited with a Lyapunov-like theory based on contraction-mapping and composite-energy-function, which rigorously shows the boundedness and convergence of the iterative learning process in the presence of initial state errors and non-negative definite problems. These observations are validated by implementing the proposed chattering-free adaptive iterative learning method to achieve the specific attitude tracking task of an uncertain spacecraft.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a frequency-dependent portfolio optimization problem with multiple assets using a control-theoretic approach. The expected logarithmic growth (ELG) rate of wealth is used as the objective performance metric. It is known that if the portfolio contains a special asset, the so-called dominant asset , then the optimal ELG level is achieved by investing all available funds in that asset. However, this “all-in” strategy is arguably too risky to implement. As a result, we study the case where the portfolio weights are chosen in a rather ad-hoc manner, and a linear buy-and-hold strategy is subsequently used. We show that if the underlying portfolio contains a dominant asset, buy and hold on that specific asset is asymptotically log-optimal with a logarithmic convergence rate. This result also extends to the scenario when a trader does not have a probabilistic model for returns or does not trust a model based on historical data. Specifically, we prove a version of the one fund theorem , which states that if a market contains a dominant asset, buying and holding a market portfolio with nonzero weights for each asset is asymptotically log-optimal. Additionally, we extend an existing result regarding the property called high-frequency maximality of an ELG-based portfolio from a single asset to a multi-asset portfolio case. This means that, in the absence of transaction costs, high-frequency rebalancing is unbeatable in terms of ELG. This result enables us to further improve the log-optimality obtained previously. Finally, we provide a result on the issue of how often a portfolio should be rebalanced, if needed. Examples using simulations with high-frequency historical trading data are included throughout to illustrate the theory.},

A periodic event-triggered system naturally excludes Zeno behavior as the system operates at discrete-time instants.

We develop an exact finite optimization-based framework to numerically solve an optimal bank of filters in which the contribution of measurement noise to the residual is minimized. The design problem is safely approximated through linear matrix inequalities and thus becomes tractable. We further propose a thresholding policy along with probabilistic false-alarm guarantees to estimate the active system mode in real-time. In comparison with the existing results, the guarantees improve from a polynomial dependency in the probability of false alarm to a logarithmic form. This improvement is achieved under the additional assumption of sub-Gaussianity, which is expected in many applications. The performance of the proposed approach is validated through a numerical example and an application of the building radiant system.},

It aims to select the best design (the design with the largest mean performance) from a finite set, where the mean of each design is unknown and has to be learned by samples. Great research efforts have been devoted to this problem in the literature for developing procedures with superior empirical performance and showing their optimality . In these efforts, myopic procedures were popular. They select the best design using a “naive” mechanism of iteratively and myopically improving an approximation of the objective measure. Although they are based on simple heuristics and lack theoretical support, they turned out highly effective, and often achieved competitive empirical performance compared to procedures that were proposed later and shown to be asymptotically optimal. In this paper, we theoretically analyze these myopic procedures and prove that they also satisfy the optimality conditions of R&amp;S, just like some other popular R&amp;S methods. It explains the good performance of myopic procedures in various numerical tests, and provides good insight into the structure and theoretical development of efficient R&amp;S procedures.},

Our approach is based on the duality between estimation and optimal control, which allows for reformulating the estimation problem over a fixed time window into an optimal control problem . The resulting optimal control problem has a cost function that depends on the measurements, and the closed-loop dynamics under optimal control coincides with the posterior distribution over the trajectories for the corresponding estimation problem. By recursively solving these optimal control problems approximately as new measurements become available, we obtain an optimal control based particle filtering algorithm . Our algorithm uses path integrals to compute the weights of the particles and is thus termed the path integrals particle filter (PIPF). A distinguishing feature of the proposed method is that it uses the measurements over a finite-length time window instead of a single measurement for the estimation at each time step, resembling the batch methods of filtering, and improving fault tolerance. The efficacy of our algorithm is illustrated with several numerical examples.},

We develop theoretical results under the assumptions that all modules are equal and with equal signal-to-noise ratio throughout the network. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate that there is an excitation and measurement pattern that results in more accurate estimates than others. Moreover, we show that some excitation and measurement patterns yield equal overall precision. From these results, guidelines based on the topology of the network emerge for the choice of the experimental setting.

Serious fluctuations can prompt desynchronization, which may lead to widespread power outages . Here, we model the stochastic disturbance by a Brownian motion process in the linearized system of the non-linear power systems and characterize the fluctuations by the variances of the frequency and the phase angle differences in the invariant probability distribution. We propose a method to calculate the variances of the frequency and the phase angle differences. For the system with uniform disturbance-damping ratio, we derive explicit formulas for the variance matrices of the frequency and the phase angle differences. It is shown that the fluctuation of the frequency at a node depends on the disturbance-damping ratio and the inertia at this node only, and the fluctuations of the phase angle differences in the lines are independent of the inertia. In particular, the synchronization stability is related to the cycle space of the network. We reveal the influences of constructing new lines and increasing capacities of lines on the fluctuations in the phase angle differences in the existing lines. The results are illustrated for the transmission system of Shandong Province of China. For the system with non-uniform disturbance-damping ratio, we further obtain bounds of the variance matrices.},

Differently from the results existing in the literature, where restrictive (sufficient) conditions on the load parameters, voltage trajectory and voltage reference are assumed to be satisfied, this is the first paper (to the best of our knowledge) proposing a controller that relaxes such conditions and guarantees the exponential stability of the desired equilibrium point, whose region of attraction can be increased by simply tuning the control gains. In the case the network is affected by unknown time-varying disturbances, local input-to-state stability (l-ISS) is ensured.

To quantify the difference between the true and estimated frequency response, this paper presents the bias of the non-parametric closed-loop frequency response estimate for the closed-loop system with updated controller parameters. It is calculated for the case where the estimate of the closed-loop frequency response of the system with an initial controller is used, to estimate the new closed-loop frequency response with an updated controller. Such estimates are useful in the process of gain re-tuning based on closed-loop experiments, where new controller parameters are calculated to satisfy requirements for the closed-loop frequency response. It is shown that the estimate appears similar in structure to the indirect non-parametric plant estimate, and hence the bias is reduced with an increasing excitation-to-noise-ratio for the closed-loop experiment. It is also seen that the bias tends to zero when the change in the controller parameters tends to zero or the feed-forward is increased sufficiently.

Existing research demonstrates that the constraints on the players’ population distribution can be satisfied by enforcing tolls. However, computing the minimum toll value for constraint satisfaction requires accurate modeling of the player’s congestion costs . Motivated by settings where an accurate congestion cost model may be unavailable (e.g. transportation networks), we consider an MDP congestion game with unknown congestion costs. We assume that a constraint-enforcing authority can repeatedly enforce tolls on a population of players that converges to an ϵ ϵ -optimal population distribution for any given toll. We then construct a myopic update algorithm to compute the minimum toll value while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied on average. We analyze how the players’ sub-optimal responses to tolls impact the rates of convergence towards the minimum toll value and constraint satisfaction. Finally, we construct a congestion game model for Uber drivers in Manhattan, New York City (NYC) using data from the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to illustrate how to efficiently reduce congestion while minimizing the impact on driver earnings.},

  abstract     = {With decentralized optimization having increased applications in various domains ranging from machine learning, control, to robotics, its privacy is also receiving increased attention. Existing privacy solutions for decentralized optimization achieve privacy by patching information-technology privacy mechanisms such as differential privacy or homomorphic encryption, which either sacrifices optimization accuracy or incurs heavy computation/communication overhead. We propose an inherently privacy-preserving decentralized optimization algorithm by exploiting the robustness of decentralized optimization dynamics. More specifically, we present a general decentralized optimization framework, based on which we show that the privacy of participating nodes’ gradients can be protected by adding randomness in optimization parameters. We further show that the added randomness has no influence on the accuracy of optimization, and prove that our inherently privacy-preserving algorithm has R R -linear convergence when the global objective function is smooth and strongly convex. We also prove that the proposed algorithm can avoid the gradient of a node from being inferable by other nodes. Simulation results confirm the theoretical predictions.},

  abstract     = {In many practical stochastic dynamic optimization problems with countable states, the optimal policy possesses certain structural properties. For example, the ( s , S ) (s,S) policy in inventory control, the well-known c μ cμ -rule and the recently discovered c / μ c/μ -rule (Xia et al. (2022)) in scheduling of queues. A presumption of such results is that an optimal stationary policy exists. There are many research works regarding to the existence of optimal stationary policies of Markov decision processes with countable state spaces (see, e.g., Bertsekas (2012); Hernández-Lerma and Lasserre (1996); Puterman (1994); Sennott (1999)). However, these conditions are usually not easy to verify in such optimization problems. In this paper, we study the optimization of long-run average of continuous-time Markov decision processes with countable state spaces. We provide an intuitive approach to prove the existence of an optimal stationary policy. The approach is simply based on compactness of the policy space, with a special designed metric, and the continuity of the long-run average in the space. Our method is capable to handle cost functions unbounded from both above and below, which makes a complementary contribution to the literature work where the cost function is unbounded from only one side. Examples are provided to illustrate the application of our main results.},

This attack targets neither sensors nor actuators, but just poisons the learning algorithm and parameter estimator that is part of the regulation scheme. We focus on the adaptive optimal control algorithm introduced by Abbasi-Yadkori and Szepesvari and provide regret analysis in the presence of attacks as well as modifications that mitigate their effects. A core step of this algorithm is the self-regularized on-line least squares estimation, which determines a tight confidence set around the true parameters of the system with high probability. In the absence of malicious data injection, this set provides an appropriate estimate of parameters for the aim of control design. However, in the presence of attack, this confidence set is not reliable anymore. Hence, we first tackle the question of how to adjust the confidence set so that it can compensate for the effect of the poisonous data. Then, we quantify the deleterious effect of this type of attack on the optimality of control policy by bounding regret of the closed-loop system under attack.},

A regular vhc is a vhc with the property that the accelerations imparted by the control forces are everywhere transverse to the constraint surface. This paper proposes a methodology for the design of regular vhc s for mechanical systems with degree of underactuation one based on the notion of a virtual constraint generator , a control system on the configuration manifold of the mechanical system whose orbits are all the regular vhc s for the mechanical system. Designing a regular vhc corresponds to designing controllers for the virtual constraint generator. We show how to design regular vhc s inducing two kinds of motions for the constrained dynamics: traversal of the vhc in one direction or oscillation back and forth along the vhc . We propose an optimal control problem for the virtual constraint generator whose solutions are regular vhc s inducing the kind of motions just described and, at the same time, meeting geometric requirements such as obstacle avoidance. We demonstrate the utility of our technique by designing a constraint for an overhead crane making the trolley move from left to right with bounded speed while ensuring that the cable angle remains within fixed limits, and a constraint for a cart–acrobot making the cart oscillate back and forth underneath an obstacle placed overhead while ensuring that the acrobot avoids the obstacle and remains as close as possible to being in the upright position.},

Mass action kinetics in these systems result in power law behavior, while complex interactions cause signal propagation delays . Incomplete network characterization makes delay state-dependence unknown. Manipulating network activity via modulated protein concentrations to attain desired performance is restricted by upper-bounds on concentration actuator authority. Here, an innovative control law exploits system dynamics to compensate for control domain restrictions. A Lyapunov stability analysis establishes that the reference tracking error of the closed-loop system is uniformly ultimately bounded.

Here, an extension of frequency domain analysis is proposed for aperiodic control loops with time-varying delays, assumed to be independent and identically distributed and to follow an exponential distribution . In aperiodic control loops, the actuation is updated immediately after a delayed sensor measurement arrives at the controller. In the present framework, the amplitudes of expected values and variances of output responses to sinusoidal inputs are plotted as a function of the input frequency. This plot allows for inferring the behavior of the response to general input signals. The usefulness of the results is illustrated in the control of a double integrator with delayed measurements.},

It has been conjectured that the existence of a suitable linear time-invariant (LTI) O’Shea–Zames–Falb multiplier is not only sufficient but also necessary. Roughly speaking, a successful proof of the conjecture would require: (a) a conic parameterisation of a set of multipliers that describes exactly the set of nonlinearities, (b) a lossless S-procedure to show that the non-existence of a multiplier implies that the Lurye system is not uniformly robustly stable over the set of nonlinearities, and (c) the existence of a multiplier in the set of multipliers used in (a) implies the existence of an LTI multiplier. We investigate these three steps, showing the current bottlenecks for proving this conjecture. In addition, we provide an extension of the class of multipliers which may be used to disprove the conjecture.},

Applying the impulsive control method, the communication among agents is only needed at impulsive control instants. For the connectivity of communication topologies, we only require that partial communication topologies contain a directed spanning tree, which remove the restriction that every communication topology contains a directed spanning tree in existing works. Using the Lyapunov function method and the stationary distribution of semi-Markovian process, the impulsive control protocol (ICP) is designed to ensure the almost surely exponential consensus of stochastic MASs. As an application, the obtained result is used to solve the secure impulsive consensus of stochastic MASs under random cyber-attacks. We proposed a novel model of random cyber-attacks, in which adversaries can destroy communication links of agents and durations of attack-active interval and attack-free interval are random variables .

Dissipativity can express stability and performance jointly, but existing results are limited to the regions around the equilibrium points of these nonlinear systems. The incremental framework, based on the convergence of the system trajectories, removes this limitation. We investigate how stability and performance characterizations of nonlinear systems in the incremental framework are linked to dissipativity, and how general performance characterization beyond the L 2 -gain concept can be understood in this framework. This paper presents a matrix inequalities-based convex incremental dissipativity analysis for nonlinear systems via quadratic storage and supply functions. The proposed dissipativity analysis links the notions of incremental, differential, and general dissipativity. We show that through differential dissipativity, incremental and general dissipativity of the nonlinear system can be guaranteed. These results also lead to the incremental extensions of the L 2 -gain, the generalized H 2 -norm, the L ∞ -gain, and passivity of nonlinear systems.},

Despite some recent advances addressing each of the two problems separately, no results have been reported that have theoretical guarantees on both privacy protection and saddle/maximum avoidance in decentralized nonconvex optimization. We propose a new algorithm for decentralized nonconvex optimization that can enable both rigorous differential privacy and saddle/maximum avoiding performance. The new algorithm allows the incorporation of persistent additive noise to enable rigorous differential privacy for data samples, gradients, and intermediate optimization variables without losing provable convergence, and thus circumventing the dilemma of trading accuracy for privacy in differential privacy design. More interestingly, the algorithm is theoretically proven to be able to efficiently guarantee accuracy by avoiding convergence to local maxima and saddle points, which has not been reported before in the literature on decentralized nonconvex optimization. The algorithm is efficient in both communication (it only shares one variable in each iteration) and computation (it is encryption-free), and hence is promising for large-scale nonconvex optimization and learning involving high-dimensional optimization parameters. Numerical experiments for both a decentralized estimation problem and an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) problem confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel geometry optimization strategy for the online robust active fault diagnosis (AFD) of discrete-time linear parameter varying (LPV) systems under set-theoretic framework. By establishing a bank of zonotopic set-value observers to match healthy/faulty system modes, the key of the optimization strategy comes down to the design of the optimal system inputs and gain matrices simultaneously. The criterion on the design of optimal inputs is characterized by fully utilizing the geometry property of zonotopes, which formulates a non-convex fractional programming problem able to be solved under 0–1 mixed integer quadratic programming framework based on a series of transformations. While the optimal gain matrices can be obtained analytically based on a so-called zonotopic kalman filtering process. The proposed method can improve the sensitivity of AFD as much as possible while ensuring the stability of the designed observer. At the end, two physical models are used to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In adaptive sliding mode control methods, an updating gain strategy associated with finite-time convergence to the sliding set is essential to deal with matched bounded perturbations with unknown upper-bound. However, the estimation of the finite time of any adaptive design is a complicated task since it depends not only on the upper-bound of unknown perturbation but also on the size of initial conditions. This brief proposes a uniform adaptive reaching phase strategy (ARPS) within a predefined reaching-time. Moreover, as a case of study, the barrier function approach is extended for perturbed MIMO systems with uncertain control matrix . The usage of proposed ARPS in the MIMO case solves simultaneously two issues: giving a uniform reaching phase with a predefined reaching-time and adapting to the perturbation norm while in a predefined vicinity of the sliding set.},

For a network that has an unstable healthy state, and follows the networked SIS model, a problem of interest is to stabilize the healthy state by increasing the curing rates of individuals, while minimizing the total cost associated with the additional curing rates over the network. Here this minimum control budget problem is reformulated as a standard semidefinite programming problem and an iterative algorithm is developed for determining the optimal additional curing rates for each agent in the network. We address arbitrary undirected topologies, with both symmetric and asymmetric infection rates. For a number of topologies, solutions have been provided for the case of uniform curing and infection rates for all possible ranges of the effective infection rate. Moreover, we have investigated the case of discrete-time SIS models and have shown that the algorithm developed based on the continuous-time model can be extended to this case. Based on the daily COVID-19 infections over the USA, the curing and infection rates have been estimated for a simulation scenario. Using these simulations, the algorithm is shown to have lower complexity than the well-known SDPT3 tool, and to have orders of magnitude lower computational and memory requirements.},

This lifting leads to an infinite-dimensional convex optimization formulation of the optimal control problem . The data-driven approximation of the optimization problem relies on the approximation of the Koopman operator and its dual: the Perron–Frobenius operator, using a polynomial basis function . We write the approximate finite-dimensional optimization problem as a polynomial optimization which is then solved efficiently using a sum-of-squares-based optimization framework.

We mainly consider the case where the side-information is provided as the H ∞ H∞ -norm of the system being bounded by a given scalar. This framework allows considering different forms of frequency domain side-information, such as the dissipativity of the system. We propose a nonparametric identification approach for estimating the impulse response of the system under the given side-information. The estimation problem is formulated as a constrained optimization in a stable reproducing kernel Hilbert space, where suitable constraints are considered for incorporating the desired frequency domain features. The resulting optimization has an infinite-dimensional feasible set with an infinite number of constraints. We show that this problem is a well-defined convex program with a unique solution. We propose a heuristic that tightly approximates this unique solution. The proposed approach is equivalent to solving a finite-dimensional convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. The efficiency of the discussed method is verified by several numerical examples.},

For FIE being RGAS, our only assumptions are that the system is time-discounted incrementally input–output-to-state-stable (i-IOSS) and that the time-discounted FIE cost function is compatible with the i-IOSS estimate. Since for i-IOSS systems such a compatible cost function can always be designed, we show that i-IOSS is sufficient for the existence of RGAS observers. Based on the stability result for FIE, we provide sufficient conditions such that the induced MHE scheme is RGAS as well for sufficiently large horizons. For both schemes, we can guarantee convergence of the estimation error in case the disturbances converge to zero without incorporating a priori knowledge . Finally, we present explicit converge rates and show how to verify that the MHE results approach the FIE results for increasing horizons.},

Both theoretical and numerical comparisons are given among D-ETIC, static ETIC (S-ETIC), and the recently developed static intermittent control schemes, including time-triggered intermittent control and event-triggered aperiodic intermittent control. It is shown that the proposed D-ETIC achieves the lowest MATR.

The semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique is often used as a computationally efficient approximation technique to solve QCQPs. It turns out that the QCQPs formulated from the phase and gain margin problems in this paper fall under the class of quadratic optimization problem, for which the SDR is exact. This is so in the sense that optimal values of the QCQP and its SDR are equal, and an optimal solution for the original QCQP problem can be obtained from an optimal solution of its SDR.

Its realization calls for subtle treatments, e.g., the Lyapunov method with low-order terms and homogeneity with negative degree. However, the methods available for finite-time control are based on some basic exclusions and essential restrictions to system uncertainties and nonlinearities. This paper addresses for the first time unknown control coefficients without any known bound, and meanwhile extends system nonlinearities, within the framework of continuous adaptive feedback. The success is typically due to several sets of disparate powers in control design and analysis. Specifically, the nonidentical power-type parameters are introduced in high-gain dynamics, instead of an identical one in the literature, to ensure the stabilizing terms have lower powers than the terms containing uncertainties, enabling finite-time convergence. Thus an adaptive finite-time controller is achieved. New integral-type functions are exploited to make up the important Lyapunov function , which are equipped with different powers to make possible the anticipated performance analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated by a simulation example.},

To deal with the difficulty of nonlinearity, instead of linearizing the nonlinear system , a semi-infinite programming (SIP) approach is used to transform the nonlinear system into a linear one, which allows us to obtain a more accurate estimation ellipsoid. For the solution of the SIP, an ADMM algorithm is proposed to handle the state estimation constraints, and each iteration of the algorithm can be solved efficiently. Finally, the proposed filter is applied to typical numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The advances in data science and machine learning have resulted in significant improvements regarding the modeling and simulation of nonlinear dynamical systems. It is nowadays possible to make accurate predictions of complex systems such as the weather, disease models or the stock market. Predictive methods are often advertised to be useful for control, but the specifics are frequently left unanswered due to the higher system complexity, the requirement of larger data sets and an increased modeling effort. In other words, surrogate modeling for autonomous systems is much easier than for control systems. In this paper we present the framework QuaSiModO (Quantization-Simulation-Modeling-Optimization) to transform arbitrary predictive models into control systems and thus render the tremendous advances in data-driven surrogate modeling accessible for control. Our main contribution is that we trade control efficiency by autonomizing the dynamics – which yields mixed-integer control problems – to gain access to arbitrary, ready-to-use autonomous surrogate modeling techniques. We then recover the complexity of the original problem by leveraging recent results from mixed-integer optimization. The advantages of QuaSiModO are a linear increase in data requirements with respect to the control dimension, performance guarantees that rely exclusively on the accuracy of the predictive model in use, and little prior knowledge requirements in control theory to solve complex control problems.},

A generalized Laplacian-class model is proposed by admitting the time-varying relative self-effect of each agent, which can be reflected by a newly introduced notion of the diagonal dominance degree. With a state transition matrix-based approach, sufficient conditions on uniform asymptotic stability and uniform bipartite consensus subject to any initial time are obtained for signed networks, respectively. It is shown that these uniform convergence behaviors depend on not only the topology structure but also the diagonal dominance degree. The uniform convergence results for time-varying signed networks are further applied to cope with the uniform asymptotic stability problem of general linear time-varying systems.},

In order to achieve the desired performance of the closed-loop system via utilizing a controller with fewer modes, a mode monitoring mechanism related to the system modes is employed to describe the jumping characteristics among different controller modes. Based on the mode monitoring mechanism, a multi-mode controller is constructed, in which the number of controller modes may be fewer than the one of system modes. Moreover, a self-triggered strategy is developed to reduce network loads, according to which the next triggering instant on state transmission is calculated via the past and current transmitted states at the triggering instants. By introducing a sufficiently small scalar, a solving algorithm is proposed for obtaining the self-triggered multi-mode controller gains to ensure the stochastic stability of the closed-loop system with the given L 2 L2 gain performance. Finally, the simulation results are provided to illustrate the proposed self-triggered control scheme.},

In contrast to smooth ordinary differential equations, where the evolution of this probability measure is described by the Liouville equations, the flow map associated with the nonsmooth differential inclusion is not necessarily invertible and one cannot directly derive a continuity equation to describe the evolution of the distribution of states. Instead, we consider Lipschitz approximation of our original nonsmooth system and construct a sequence of measures obtained from Liouville equations corresponding to these approximations. This sequence of measures converges in weak-star topology to the measure describing the evolution of the distribution of states for the original nonsmooth system. This allows us to approximate numerically the evolution of moments (up to some finite order) for our original nonsmooth system, using a solver that uses finite order moment approximations of the Liouville equation. Our approach is illustrated with the help of two academic examples.},

We propose an online identification algorithm consisting of parameter estimation and prediction of original system output. The parameter estimation and the prediction of original output are strongly coupled but mutually reinforcing. By analyzing the two estimates at the same time instead of analyzing separately, we finally prove that the parameter estimate can converge to the true parameter with convergence rate O ( 1 / k ) O(1/k) under certain conditions.

Then, with the well-posedness, we reduce the inverse problem to some root finding problem of the expectation of a random variable involved with the value function, which has a unique solution. Based on this result, we propose a numerical method for our inverse problem by replacing the expectation above with arithmetic mean of observed optimal control processes and the corresponding state processes. The recent progress of numerical analysis of Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations enables the proposed method to be implementable for multi-dimensional cases. In particular, with the help of the kernel-based collocation method for Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations, our method for the inverse problems still works well even when an explicit form of the value function is unavailable. Several numerical experiments show that the numerical method recovers the unknown penalty parameter with high accuracy.},

The control input is the acceleration of the tank and a Control Lyapunov Functional methodology is used. The measurements are the tank position and the liquid level at the tank walls. The control scheme is a combination of a state feedback law with functional observers for the tank velocity and the liquid momentum. Four different types of output feedback stabilizers are proposed. A full-order observer and a reduced-order observer are used in order to estimate the tank velocity while the unmeasured liquid momentum is either estimated by using an appropriate scalar filter or is ignored. The reduced order observer differs from the full order observer because it omits the estimation of the measured tank position. Exponential convergence of the closed-loop system to the desired equilibrium point is achieved in each case. An algorithm is provided that guarantees that a robotic arm can move a glass of water to a pre-specified position no matter how full the glass is, without spilling water out of the glass, without residual end point sloshing and without measuring the water momentum and the glass velocity.

  abstract     = {The control of multiple magnetic microrobots is of particular interest for therapeutic applications. Yet the controllability of such a system is not straightforward since, on most of such systems designs, there is only a single control input per axis. The paper addresses the controllability and control synthesis for several magnetic microrobots navigating in blood vessels. First, controllability requires the microrobots to magnetically interact in order to achieve trajectory tracking along an admissible reference trajectory , whether swimming at low or high Reynolds. Then the resulting nonlinear system is shown to be diffeomorphic to different nonlinear canonical forms depending on the choice of the microrobots, so that the stabilization of the system along any admissible reference trajectory can be achieved using a backstepping controller synthesis , yet sometimes at the price of a zero dynamics stability analysis. Simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

This class of switching is referred to as the modeled random switching. By regarding the switching model as a part of the system, a combined switched system with i.i.d. switching is obtained, which is of a hybrid nature, that is, the augmented state vector has both logic and continuous components. The semi-tensor product of matrices and the vector representation of logic are applied to merge the logic and the continuous components of the state. The equivalence between the mean-square stability of the original switched system and that of the merged switched system under i.i.d. switching is proved. By deriving the dynamics of the column-stacking form of the covariance matrix , necessary and sufficient conditions of mean-square stability for discrete-time linear switched systems with modeled random switching are obtained.

  abstract     = {A multi-defender single-invader target defense game is a differential game where the invader intends to enter a target area protected by a group of defenders, while the defenders intend to capture the invader before it enters. This game has been extensively studied and a geometric solution exists. However, this solution has only been justified under special cases. The main contribution of this paper is to prove that the geometric solution satisfies the HJI equation under the general condition. Specifically, the target area is not required to take a peculiar shape, such as circles, lines, etc. In addition, the defenders are allowed to move freely in the two-dimensional plane, the capture range of the defenders is non-zero, and the number of defenders is not restricted. This generalized formulation imposes an important challenge on an essential step of the proof, computing the derivatives of the value function. This challenge is resolved in this paper therefore the proof can be accomplished. The significance of studying the geometric solution is that it provides a state feedback control law using an adequate amount of computation. The target defense game is inherently challenging to be solved with numerical methods, because it is highly nonlinear and suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The proof presented in this paper provides a solid theoretic foundation for the geometric solution, so the difficulties raised by the numerical methods can be circumvented.},

Our control design methodology is based on the proposition of two models, namely the parametric-phase control model and the curve-phase control model. We also characterize the trajectory-constraining set based on the magnitude of the safe distance of the exterior boundary from the desired curve. We further establish a connection between the perimeters and areas of the trajectory-constraining set with the perimeter and area of the desired curve. We obtain bounds on different quantities of interest in the post-design analysis and provide simulation results to illustrate the theoretical findings.},

We study both non-local and boundary control via a modal decomposition approach. For both cases, we suggest a direct Lyapunov method applied to the full-order closed-loop system. The nonlinear terms are compensated by using Parseval’s inequality, leading to efficient and constructive linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions for obtaining the controller dimension and gain. For non-local control we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee global stabilization for any linear growth bound via either linear or nonlinear controller, provided the number of actuators is large enough. We prove that the nonlinear controller achieves at least the same performance as the linear one. For the case of boundary control, we employ a multi-dimensional dynamic extension, whereas in the numerical example we manage with a larger linear growth bound. The introduced direct Lyapunov approach gives tools for a variety of robust control problems for semilinear parabolic PDEs.},

To do this, the agent has to decide its sequence of target-visits and the corresponding dwell-times at each visited target. For a given visiting sequence, we prove that in an optimal dwelling time allocation the peak uncertainty is the same among all the targets. This allows us to formulate the optimization of dwelling times as a resource allocation problem and to solve it using a novel efficient algorithm. Next, we optimize the visiting sequence using a greedy exploration process, using heuristics inspired by others developed in the context of the traveling salesman problem. Numerical results are included to illustrate the contributions.},

First, a closed-loop discrete-time stochastic system is constructed by considering the random sampling periods, deception attacks and packet losses in a unified framework. Second, an equivalent yet tractable stochastic model is established with the aid of matrix exponential computation. By reduced-order confluent Vandermonde matrix approach, law of total expectation, convolution formula and Kronecker product operation, a controller is designed such that the exponential stability in the mean-square sense of closed-loop stochastic system is guaranteed. Subsequently, a special model is discussed where no deception attack occurs and then the corresponding controller is designed.

Verified by the improved coefficient precision of the aerodynamic forces and moments, using a curve fitting technique on available flight data, it is demonstrated that a nonlinearly parametrized model can more accurately capture the vehicle dynamics than a linearly parametrized model. For control design, the air vehicle model is decomposed into a flight-path angle subsystem with rotational dynamics and a speed subsystem with engine actuation dynamics. An adaptive control scheme is developed using the combination of a function bounding technique and a modified backstepping control method for two interconnected subsystems. The designed adaptive control laws ensure both global stabilization and adaptive non-zero equilibrium point regulation of the closed-loop control system. A thorough simulation study is presented to show the effectiveness of the developed adaptive control scheme for a nonlinearly parametrized air vehicle system model.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of ensuring stability in a DC microgrid by means of decentralized conditions. Such conditions are derived which are formulated as input–output properties of locally defined subsystems. These follow from various decompositions of the microgrid and corresponding properties of the resulting representations. It is shown that these stability conditions can be combined together by means of appropriate homotopy arguments, thus reducing the conservatism relative to more conventional decentralized approaches that often rely on a passivation of the bus dynamics. Examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and the applicability of the results derived.},

Recently, a removal scheme with a less conservative bound on the constraint violation probability of the final decision has been proposed. In this letter, we further contribute to the theoretical properties of such a scheme by extending the number of discarded scenarios to be arbitrary, as opposed to an integer multiple of the dimension of the decision space. There are two facets to the results of this paper. On the one hand, our feasibility guarantees outperform the standard “sampling-and-discarding” bound in the literature. On the other hand, we highlight an inherent property of the discarding mechanism, namely, the fact that removing a number of scenarios that is not an integer multiple of the dimension of the decision space is likely to introduce additional conservatism.},

  abstract     = {The normal form, which is also known as Byrnes–Isidori normal form, of a linear system is very important in control theory, as it is a fundamental tool for solving a couple of important problems. It is known that the normal form exists only if the system has a relative degree and a nonsingular coupling matrix , which is not always satisfied. Though both the relative degree and the non-singularity of the coupling matrix are invariant under state and input transformations, they can be changed by output transformation. This paper establishes novel necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an output transformation such that the transformed system has a well defined relative degree and nonsingular coupling matrix, namely, the existence of a normal form for linear multivariable systems . The conditions are expressed by two rank identities in terms of the coefficient matrices of the linear system. When these two rank conditions are satisfied, an algorithm for constructing the output transformation matrix is also provided. The output tracking problem is revisited with the help of the obtained results. Examples are given to illustrate the obtained results.},

The proposed observer has a linear part, which is designed based on the linear observer theory, and a discontinuous part based on the sliding mode technique to reject the disturbance signals. Here, the discontinuous injection of output error is fed only to the sliding mode part of the observer, whereas the linear part is designed with the linear injection of output error. We state the sufficient condition which guarantees the existence of the proposed sliding mode observer. The main outcome of this design is that the steady-state accuracy of the observer is improved from that of the existing ones, where the full order discontinuous output error vector is injected into the observer dynamics. These switching terms in discrete dynamics often result in numerical chattering, which is attenuated in our proposed observer. We also show the global convergence of estimation error for this observer in the presence of disturbance. Finally, we demonstrate the design technique of the proposed sliding mode observer with an example.},

To overcome these difficulties, two homotopies, including the thrust-homotopy and the longitude-homotopy, are combined to investigate the solution space of the low-thrust minimum-time trajectory optimization problem. The thrust-homotopy can be interpreted as a continuation on the maximum thrust magnitude, and the longitude-homotopy is proposed via a continuation on the final cumulative true longitude. Afterwards, the structure of the solution space is revealed by simulating a transfer scenario from the geostationary transfer orbit to the geostationary orbit . A bounded and smooth solution surface, where each point represents a solution with specific thrust and final cumulative true longitude, is formed by intersecting longitude-homotopy paths and thrust-homotopy paths. Based on the solution surface, the thrust-longitude-combined homotopic approach and a new hybrid homotopy are proposed to obtain local solutions by tracking homotopy paths from a solution of an easy problem, avoiding initial guessing. Finally, the longitude-homotopy is applied to search the global minimum-time solution from an obtained local solution.},

These sequence of actions are referred to as the policy of the SDM. Often these problems comprise of additional (fixed and manipulable) parameters; and the objective is to determine the optimal policy as well as the manipulable parameters that minimizes the SDM cost. In this paper we address the class of SDM problems that are characterized by dynamic parameters; where the dynamics is pre-specified for a subset of parameters and manipulable for others. The objective is to determine the manipulable parameter dynamics as well as the time-varying policy such that the associated SDM cost gets minimized at each time instant. To this end, we develop a control-theoretic framework to design the manipulable parameter dynamics such that it tracks the optimal values of the parameters, and simultaneously determines the time-varying optimal policy. Our methodology builds upon a Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) based framework that addresses SDMs. More precisely, the above framework results into a smooth approximation of the SDM cost which we utilize as a control Lyapunov function . We show that under the resulting control law the parameters asymptotically track the local optimal, the proposed control law is Lipschitz continuous and bounded, and the policy of the SDM is optimal for a given set of parameter values. The simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {In the contest of optimal control problems , regularity results for optima are known when addressing fiber-strictly convex Lagrangian. For infinite time horizons, or for settings with infinite dimensional dynamics, the equivalence between minima/maxima and extremals could break down. Commonly, this is due to a loss of convexity/concavity of the cost functional or to a presence of state constraints, in which further controllability assumptions are needed. For many science applications, this trend is not required, as in energy saving problems. In the present paper, we deal with the set of a functional’s extremals subject to end-point restrictions. We consider an affine control system and a cost functional associated to an autonomous Lagrangian. The dynamics is smooth, satisfying the Lie bracket condition, and the functional is assumed merely Fréchet differentiable. Here we provide a regularity result for controls in the context of constrained extremization problems, under weaker conditions on Lagrangian than the not met classical ones. More precisely, we show a characterization for the Lipschitz regularity of controls associated with the extremal trajectories steering two fixed points, assuming the absence of singular controls. As main application, we construct a locally Lipschitz inversion mapping from the ambient space to the set of constrained extremals.},

In this paper, for the first time we extend this method to the stochastic 1D heat equation with nonlinear multiplicative noise . We consider the Neumann actuation and study the observer-based as well as the state-feedback controls via the modal decomposition approach. We employ either trigonometric or polynomial dynamic extension. For observer-based control we consider a noisy boundary measurement. First, we show the well-posedness of strong solutions to the closed-loop systems. Then by suggesting a direct Lyapunov method and employing Itô’s formula, we provide mean-square L 2 L2 exponential stability analysis of the full-order closed-loop system, leading to linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions for finding the observer dimension and as large as possible noise intensity bound for the mean-square stabilizability . We prove that the LMIs are always feasible for small enough noise intensity and large enough observer dimension (for observer-based control). We further show that in the case of state-feedback and linear noise, the system is always stabilizable for noise intensities that guarantee the stabilizability of the stochastic finite-dimensional part of the closed-loop system with deterministic measurement. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the efficiency of our method. For both state-feedback and observer-based controls, the trigonometric extension always allows for a larger noise than the polynomial one in the example.},

There are m m positive characteristic velocities and 2 N − m 2N−m negative characteristic velocities in the congested traffic after linearizing the model equations around the steady state depending on the spatial variable. By using the backstepping method, a controller implemented by a ramp metering at the inlet boundary is designed for rejecting the disturbances to stabilize the 2 N × 2 N 2N×2N heterogeneous traffic system. The developed controller in terms of proportional integral control is derived from mapping the original system to a target system with a proportional integral boundary control rejecting the disturbances.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a label-free controller for a second-order multi-agent system to cooperatively fence a moving target of variational velocity into a convex hull formed by the agents whereas maintaining a rigid formation. Therein, no label is predetermined for a specified agent. To attain a rigid formation with guaranteed collision avoidance , each controller consists of two terms: a dynamic regulator with an internal model to drive agents towards the moving target merely by position information feedback, and a repulsive force between each pair of adjacent agents. Significantly, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop systems governed by the proposed fencing controller. Rigorous analysis is provided to eliminate the strong nonlinear couplings induced by the label-free property. Finally, the effectiveness of the controller is substantiated by numerical simulations.},

A sensor takes measurements of the system output and forwards its dynamic state estimates to a remote controller over a packet-dropping link. The controller determines the optimal control law for the process using the estimates it receives. An attacker aims at degrading the control performance by increasing the packet-dropout rate with a DoS attack on the sensor-controller channel. We assume both the controller and the attacker are rational in a game-theoretic sense and establish a partially observable stochastic game to derive the optimal joint design of scheduling and control. Using dynamic programming we prove that the control and scheduling policies can be designed separately without sacrificing optimality , making the problem equivalent to a complete information game. We employ Nash Q-learning to solve the problem and prove that the solution is guaranteed to constitute an ϵ ϵ -Nash equilibrium. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the interactions between the controller and the attacker.},

  abstract     = {The Back Propagation (BP) neural network model is one of the neural network models suitable for model recognition and classification. However, a single BP network model cannot fully tap the feature information hiding in the data and is vulnerable to the uncertainty associated with system parameter changes and also suffers from the effects of long diagnosis times, inaccurate and undesired diagnosis results in applying a large amount of high-dimensional feature data . In addition, the standard BP algorithm has limitations in pattern recognition and classification. For example, it adopts the quadratic cost function to train the neural network, which can lead to low convergence accuracy, low convergence rate, and so on. Compared with the quadratic cost function, the cross-entropy cost function can effectively improve the convergence accuracy and the convergence rate of the neural network. The Dempster–Shafer (D–S) evidence theory is a powerful tool for handling incomplete, imprecise, and uncertain information and merging it when it derives from multiple BP networks. In order to overcome the drawbacks of a single BP network , it is necessary to divide the high-dimensional feature data into several different categories of low-dimensional feature data and to input the same dimensional feature data into the same BP network model, as well as to design the information fusion algorithms based on D–S evidence theory and multiple improved BP networks with the cross-entropy cost function. For this reason, this paper proposes a novel information fusion diagnosis approach based on D–S evidence theory and multiple improved BP networks for fault diagnosis and classification of multiple devices in a ballast system subjected to extreme environmental conditions . The proposed diagnosis approach utilizes multiple neural networks to carry out local fault diagnosis, adopts the D–S evidence theory to fuse the results of local diagnosis and derive the decision results, and introduces an improved BP algorithm based on the cross-entropy cost function into the individual neural networks to enhance the convergence rate and diagnosis accuracy of the individual neural networks. This method can overcome the deficiencies of individual BP networks in multiple BP networks in their poor diagnostic ability to handle incomplete, imprecise, and uncertain sample information. According to the design idea of the proposed diagnosis approach, a new fusion modeling for fault diagnosis of multiple devices is constructed for a ballast system. The validity of the proposed diagnosis method and model is illustrated through both simulation studies and experimental tests.},

On the output side the requirement is to track a desired current to feed a load. The novel aspects of the scheme are that (i) the optimisation is posed in terms of the converter’s modulation matrix, whose entries represent the duty cycles of each of the converter switches; and that (ii) the solution of the optimisation is obtained in closed form and shown to be implementable with a small number of elementary operations.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for a regular language to be copredictable are provided, and also a strategy for designing local fault predictor systems, to be used in online fault prediction. We also address the problem of verifying if all fault occurrences can be predicted at least K events prior to their occurrences (K-copredictability) and provide both a necessary and sufficient conditions for a regular language to be K-copredictable and an automaton-based test to verify if a regular language is K-copredictable.},

  abstract     = {The problem of designing a stabilizing feedback controller in the presence of saturating actuators and multi-rate (asynchronous) aperiodic state measurements is studied. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which measurements of the plant states are collected at the controller end in a sporadic and asynchronous fashion. A hybrid controller is used to perform a fusion of measurements sampled at different times. In between sampling events, the controller behaves as a copy of the plant and provides a feedback control signal based on the reconstruction of the plant state. The presence of saturation at the plant input limits the value of the components of this signal to a bounded range. When a new measurement is available, the controller state undergoes an instantaneous jump. The resulting system is augmented with a set of timers triggering the arrival of new measurements and analyzed in a hybrid systems framework. Relying on Lyapunov tools for hybrid systems and techniques for control design under saturation, we propose sufficient conditions in the form of matrix inequalities to ensure regional exponential stability of a closed-set containing the origin of the plant, i.e., exponential stability with a guaranteed region of attraction. Specifically, explicit estimates of the basin of attraction are provided in the form of ellipsoidal sets. Leveraging those conditions, a design procedure based on semidefinite programming is proposed to design a stabilizing controller with maximized size of the basin attraction. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is shown in an example.},

  abstract     = {To date, most schemes of adaptive stabilization are confined to convergence, and cannot specify the convergence rate. As such, the possibility of excessively slow convergence could not be ruled out, which undermines the application scope of adaptive schemes. Such imperfection is mainly due to the limited capability of compensation/learning mechanisms which lack the ingredients affording specific convergence rate. For stronger applicability, more comprehensive compensation/learning mechanisms need to be exploited, inevitably aggravating control synthesis and analysis. This paper aims to enhance adaptive control in terms of convergence rate , and particularly, seeks exponential regulation via adaptive output feedback for stochastic nonlinear systems allowing large uncertainties coupling to unmeasurable states and dynamic uncertainties. To this end, a refined adaptive output-feedback scheme is established in the stochastic framework, though no non-stochastic counterpart exists. Critically, a novel dynamic high gain is introduced in a universal manner, with its updating law delicately incorporating the gain-dependent time-varying information in exponential form. The dynamic gain would not only become sufficiently large to capture the large uncertainties, but also render the desired convergence with the rate online regulated to match the dynamic uncertainties. In this way, an adaptive output-feedback controller based on dynamic-gain observer is designed, which guarantees the system and observer states to almost surely converge to zero at an exponential rate. The stochastic framework complicates the validity verification of the established scheme, entailing subtle martingale-based analysis. Correspondingly, a distinctive analysis pattern is developed for the resulting closed-loop system, to attain expected stochastic convergence and boundedness .},

To eliminate the negative effect of DoS attacks, an active control strategy consisting of a predictor mechanism and a buffer mechanism is devised. In such a strategy, the controller sends a sequence of control signals to the actuator to guarantee the system energy does not increase too fast, even if the sensor–controller and the controller–actuator channels are attacked simultaneously. Furthermore, the mismatch of the controller and the subsystem is addressed due to the presence of event-triggered scheme and DoS attacks. It is shown that the systems’ states allow a bounded divergency over mismatched interval. To this end, the switching signal is designed in connection with the properties of DoS attacks, event-triggered scheme and system parameters.

The second observer estimates the heading direction of the mobile robot, i.e. , its dynamics evolves on the unit circle S 1 S1 . The first and second observers rely on linear velocity measurements. On the other hand, the third observer presents a globally exponentially stable error dynamics and requires only Cartesian position measurements but does not evolve on S 1 S1 . Additionally, a control-observer algorithm is proposed to solve the trajectory-tracking problem of WMRs.

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, stabilization problems have been solved for various cascade and “sandwich” configurations involving linear ODEs and PDEs of both hyperbolic and parabolic types. In this paper, we consider systems in which the output of the ( i + 1 ) th ODE subsystem is the control input of the i th PDE subsystem, and in which the state of the i th PDE subsystem enters as control into the i th ODE subsystems. We extend the existing results, among which a representative one is for the case where the ODEs in the chain are scalar and the PDEs are pure delays, in two major directions. First, we allow for the virtual inputs to be affected by PDE dynamics different from pure delays: we allow the PDEs to include diffusion, i.e., to be parabolic, and to even have counter-convection, and, in addition, for the PDE dynamics to enter the ODEs not only with the PDE’s boundary value but also in a spatially-distributed (integrated) fashion. Second, we allow the ODEs in the chain to be not just scalar ODEs in a strict-feedback configuration but general LTI systems. We develop an n -step backstepping procedure and prove that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable. A simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our controllers.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the recursive filtering issue for an array of two-dimensional systems with random sensor failures and dynamic quantizations. The phenomenon of sensor failure is introduced whose occurrence is governed by a random variable with known statistical properties. In view of the data transmission over networks of constrained bandwidths, a dynamic quantizer is adopted to compress the raw measurements into the quantized ones. The main objective of this article is to design a recursive filter so that a locally minimal upper bound is ensured on the filtering error variance. To facilitate the filter design, states of the dynamic quantizer and the target plant are integrated into an augmented system , based on which an upper bound is first derived on the filtering error variance and subsequently minimized at each step. The expected filter gain is parameterized by solving some coupled difference equations. Moreover, the monotonicity of the resulting minimum upper bound with regard to the quantization level is discussed and the boundedness analysis is further investigated. Finally, effectiveness of the developed filtering strategy is verified via a simulation example.},

The existing design methods often require the discount factor to be small enough to guarantee the closed-loop stability. However, solving the discounted algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) may lead to ill-conditioned numerical issues if the discount factor is too small. By singular perturbation theory, we decompose the full-order discounted ARE into a reduced-order ARE and a Sylvester equation , which facilitate designing the feedback and feedforward control gains. The obtained controller is proved to be a stabilizing and near-optimal solution to the original LQTC problem. In the framework of reinforcement learning, both on-policy and off-policy two-phase learning algorithms are derived to design the near-optimal tracking control policy without knowing the discount factor. The advantages of the developed results are illustrated by comparative simulation results.},

Under the assumption that several sensors remain secure, local reorganized subsystems including FDI attack signals and “un-attacked” sensor measurements are constructed by the augmentation method. Then, nonlinear local joint estimators are designed based on the bounded recursive optimization method to estimate the system state and FDI attack signals simultaneously. To improve the estimation performance for system states, a learning-based fusion criterion is proposed by introducing an estimation compensation term that is designed by learning an expected objective. Moreover, it is proved that the designed fusion estimator can be boundedly stable under certain conditions. Finally, an illustrative example is employed to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods.},

In this paper, the discrete-time, finite-horizon case is considered, where the agents are also assumed to be homogeneous and indistinguishable. The latter means that the agents all have the same dynamics and objective functions and the observations are in terms of “snap shots” of all agents at different time instants, but what is not known is “which agent moved where” for consecutive observations. This absence of linked optimal trajectories makes the problem challenging. We first show that this problem is globally identifiable. Then, for the case of noiseless observations, we show that the true cost matrix, and hence the closed-loop system matrices, can be recovered as the unique global optimal solution to a convex optimization problem . Next, for the case of noisy observations, we formulate an estimator as the unique global optimal solution to a modified convex optimization problem. Moreover, the statistical consistency of this estimator is shown. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by a number of numerical examples.},

The obtained open-loop equilibrium of this two-tier game is shown to be weakly time-consistent in the sense that the adopted policies will no longer be denied in the future only if past policies are consistent with the equilibrium policies. On the existence and uniqueness of such a solution, necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained, which are characterized via the solutions of several Riccati-like equations.},

  abstract     = {Opacity, as an important property in information-flow security, characterizes the ability of a system to keep some secret information from an intruder. In discrete-event systems, based on a standard setting in which an intruder has the complete knowledge of the system’s structure, the standard versions of current-state opacity and initial-state opacity cannot perfectly characterize higher-level privacy requirements. To overcome such a limitation, in this paper we propose two stronger versions of opacity called strong current-state opacity and strong initial-state opacity for partially-observed nondeterministic finite-state automata. Strong current-state (resp., initial-state) opacity describes that for each run of a system ending (resp., starting) at a secret state, there exists a non-secret run whose observation is the same as that of the previous run. Then we propose an information structure using a novel concurrent-composition technique to verify strong current-state opacity and strong initial-state opacity, which has time complexity O ( ( | Σ | | X | 2 + | Σ o | | X ∖ X S | 2 ( 1 + | Σ u o | ) ) 2 | X ∖ X S | ) O((|Σ||X|2+|Σo||X∖XS|2(1+|Σuo|))2|X∖XS|) , where | X | |X| (resp., | Σ | |Σ| , | Σ o | |Σo| , | Σ u o | |Σuo| , | X ∖ X S | |X∖XS| ) is the number of states (resp., events, observable events, unobservable events, non-secret states) of an automaton. Finally, the proposed information structure is also used to check strong infinite-step opacity, which has lower time complexity than the previous one in the literature.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers general heterodirectional linear hyperbolic PDEs with boundary actuation and collocated measurement, that are bidirectionally coupled with nonlinear ODEs at the unactuated boundary. An output feedback regulator is designed to have the control output track a reference in the presence of disturbances, with a nonlinear signal model generating the reference and the disturbances. This leads to new challenges for both the observer and controller design . The regulator design makes use of results from output regulation theory for nonlinear lumped-parameter and distributed-parameter systems. The derivation of the state feedback regulator requires solving a new type of regulator equations, which consist of a Cauchy problem for linear and semilinear hyperbolic PDEs . A key component of the novel observer design is a nonlinear retarded observer for a finite-dimensional subsystem. Both the controller and the observer design are systematic in nature and derived in several successive steps, that include backstepping transformations and, most notably, predictions of PDE and ODE states. The latter are shown to be the unique solution of general nonlinear Volterra integro-differential equations. Combining the observer with the state feedback regulator is proven to achieve output regulation for the closed-loop system. A numerical example illustrates and confirms the theoretical results.},

Classical first-order sliding-mode techniques are capable to compensate unmatched perturbations if differentiations of the output of sufficiently high order are included in the sliding variable. For such perturbations it is commonly assumed that they do not affect the relative degree of the system. In this contribution we consider perturbations that alter the relative degree of the process and study their impact on the closed-loop control system with a classical first-order sliding-mode design. In particular we consider systems with full (nominal) relative degree subject to a perturbation reducing the relative degree by one and analyse the resulting closed-loop system. It turns out that the sliding-manifold is not of reduced dimension and the uniqueness of the solution may be lost. Also attractivity of the sliding-manifold and global stability of the origin may be lost whereas the disturbance rejection properties of the sliding-mode control are not impaired. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of unique solutions for the closed-loop system. The second-order case is studied in great detail and allows to parametrically specify the conditions obtained before. We derive a necessary condition for the global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Further we present a constructive condition for the global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system using a piece-wise linear Lyapunov function .

Our main contribution is to propose a number of easily verifiable data informativity conditions for this identification problem. Among these conditions, we distinguish a sufficient data informativity condition that can be verified based on the topology of the network and a necessary and sufficient data informativity condition that can be verified via a rank condition on a matrix of coefficients that are related to a full-order model structure of the network. These data informativity conditions allow to determine different situations (i.e., different excitation patterns) leading to data informativity. In order to be able to distinguish between these different situations, we also propose an optimal experiment design problem that allows to determine the excitation pattern yielding a certain pre-specified accuracy with the least excitation power.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to deal with the control analysis and synthesis problem of data-driven learning, regardless of unknown plant models and iteration-varying uncertainties. For the tracking of any desired target, a Kalman state–space approach is presented to transform it into two robust stability problems, which bridges a connection between data-driven control and model-based control. The proposed approach makes it possible to employ the extended state observer (ESO) in the design of data-driven learning to overcome the effect of iteration-varying uncertainties. It is shown that ESO-based data-driven learning ensures model-free systems to achieve the robust tracking of any desired target, and particularly is applicable for realizing the accurate tracking objective subject to the iteration-varying uncertainties with quasi-disappearing variations. Further, our developed results apply to iterative learning control , which is also verified by an example.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicle charging facilities offer their capacity constrained electric charge and parking to users for a fee. As electric vehicle adoption grows, so too does the potential for excessive resource utilization. In this paper, we study how prices set by the charging facility impact the likelihood that specified resource utilization levels are exceeded. Specifically, we present probabilistic bounds on the number of charging spots and the total power supply needed at a facility based on the characteristics of the arriving vehicles. We assume the charging facility either offers a set of distinct and fixed charging rates to each user or allows the user to decide a charging deadline, from which a charging rate is determined. Users arrive randomly, requiring a random amount of charge. Additionally, each user has a random impatience factor that quantifies their value of time, and a random desired time to stay at a particular location. Assuming rational user behavior, and with knowledge of the probability distribution of the random parameters, we present high-confidence bounds on the total number of vehicles parked at the station and the aggregate power use of all vehicles actively charging. We demonstrate how these bounds can be used by a charging facility to determine appropriate pricing parameters and investigate through a Monte–Carlo simulation case study the tightness of the bounds.},

The constraints are then imposed on a finite set of discrete time points. This technical communiqué is concerned with the problem of checking whether a matrix polynomial solution obtained in this manner satisfies the original DLMI constraints .

  abstract     = {The notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) has emerged in system identification during the past decade. In the resulting framework, the impulse response estimation problem is formulated as a regularized optimization defined on an infinite-dimensional RKHS consisting of stable impulse responses. The consequent estimation problem is well-defined under the central assumption that the convolution operators restricted to the RKHS are continuous linear functionals. Moreover, according to this assumption, the representer theorem hold, and therefore, the impulse response can be estimated by solving a finite-dimensional program. Thus, the continuity feature plays a significant role in kernel-based system identification. We show that this central assumption is guaranteed to be satisfied in considerably general situations, namely when the input signal is bounded, the kernel is an integrable function, and in the case of continuous-time dynamics, continuous. Furthermore, the strong convexity of the optimization problem and the continuity property of the convolution operators imply that the kernel-based system identification admits a unique solution. Consequently, it follows that kernel-based system identification is a well-defined approach.},

  abstract     = {The problem of differentiating a function with bounded second derivative in the presence of bounded measurement noise is considered in both continuous-time and sampled-data settings. Fundamental performance limitations of causal differentiators , in terms of the smallest achievable worst-case differentiation error, are shown. A robust exact differentiator is then constructed via the adaptation of a single parameter of a linear differentiator. It is demonstrated that the resulting differentiator exhibits a combination of properties that outperforms existing continuous-time differentiators: it is robust with respect to noise, it instantaneously converges to the exact derivative in the absence of noise, and it attains the smallest possible—hence optimal—upper bound on its differentiation error under noisy measurements. For sample-based differentiators, the concept of quasi-exactness is introduced to classify differentiators that achieve the lowest possible worst-case error based on sampled measurements in the absence of noise. A straightforward sample-based implementation of the proposed linear adaptive continuous-time differentiator is shown to achieve quasi-exactness after a single sampling step as well as a theoretically optimal differentiation error bound that, in addition, converges to the continuous-time optimal one as the sampling period becomes arbitrarily small. A numerical simulation illustrates the presented formal results.},

The information-based attack policy that can bypass the anomaly detector and cause the maximum estimation quality degradation is derived. For both attacks with strict and relaxed stealthiness, the optimal compromised measurements can be designed with three steps: obtain the minimum mean-square error estimation of the prediction error, de-correlate the estimate with historical compromised innovations, and design the compromised innovation as an optimal linear transformation . All available information for attackers is fully utilized for performance maximization while the stealthiness constraint is satisfied precisely to deceive the anomaly detector. The attack effect depends on both the amount of online information and the duration of detection interval. Contrary to well-studied innovation-based attacks using static linear combinations , the information-based deception policy is shown to be generated by a linear time-varying system, whose coefficients can be completely determined offline. The optimality of the proposed attack is verified with numerical examples and comparative studies.},

First of all, necessary and sufficient conditions are established for preserving the differential privacy and unobservability of the global sensitive initial values, respectively to show their independent properties. Specifically, we show that the observability matrix reduced by the set of sensitive initial states not only characterizes the structural property of noises for achieving the differential privacy, but also affects the achievable privacy levels, while the unobservability relies on the rank of such reduced observability matrix. Next, the inherent network nature of the considered linear system is explored, where each individual state corresponds to a node and the state and output matrices induce interaction and sensing graphs, leading to a network system. Under this network perspective, the previously established results are extended for initial values of local nodes to study their differential privacy and connections with their observability. Moreover, it is shown that the qualitative property of the differential initial-value privacy is either preserved generically or lost generically, which is the same as the unobservability in the local sense, while subject to a subtle difference from the unobservability in the global sense that is either preserved fully or lost generically. Finally, a privacy-preserving consensus algorithm is revisited to illustrate the effectiveness of the established results.},

In light of the complexity of financial markets, we formulate an uncertain multi-period mean-entropy-variance model, where bankruptcy, liquidity, diversification and self-financing are considered as realistic constraints. Furthermore, the maximum return and the minimum risk are both achieved in a single-objective model through the normalization method. Then the equivalent deterministic forms of two secondary models for main model are provided. In addition, we develop a modified root system growth algorithm, which is more suitable for the proposed model.

In the game, the agents are subjected to local set constraints and coupling nonlinear constraints within each coalition. To deal with the local set constraint in a dynamical system, a barrier function is designed and its convexity as well as differentiability are proved. By adapting the original cost function, a new game is formulated, the solution of which is proved to be an ɛ ɛ ɛ -GNE of the original game and the solution error can be arbitrarily small. To solve the adapted N N -coalition noncooperative game, a distributed algorithm leveraging consensus and primal–dual gradient dynamics is designed. By means of stability theory of differential inclusions , the convergence to the variational GNE is established. Meantime, the local set constraint can be satisfied along the whole trajectory.

First, the solvability of the disturbance decoupled secure state estimation problems is analyzed by introducing the concepts of redundantly strong observability and redundantly strong detectability . It is proved that the states can be reconstructed (estimated asymptotically) despite the existence of attacks and disturbances if and only if the system is redundantly strongly observable (redundantly strongly detectable). Second, the design procedure for reconstructing (asymptotically estimating) the states is provided based on the orthogonal projection technique. Specifically, by calculating a sequence of orthogonal projections of the sensors’ measurements, a residual signal is constructed to identify a reliable set for state reconstruction (asymptotic state estimation), and then a least square-based method (an observer-based method) is proposed to reconstruct (asymptotically estimate) the states. Third, the effects of numerical errors on the residual signals are discussed. Finally, two examples are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {A systematic Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) approach based on minimal Robust Positively Invariant (mRPI) sets is presented for decomposing linear constrained dynamic systems. Specifically, a novel distance metric is proposed where the distance between neighboring subsystems is computed based on the volume of the mRPI sets. Through this distance metric, the proposed AHC approach simultaneously accounts for subsystem dynamics, the constraints on states and inputs, and disturbances created by the dynamic coupling between subsystems. A combination of simple and complex numerical examples is used to demonstrate the key features of the approach including the sensitivity of the proposed AHC to system structure, parameters, and constraints. Finally, numerical results show the benefit of using the proposed AHC when determining potential system decompositions for robust decentralized Model Predictive Control (MPC).},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with general bilinear feasibility problems. A nonlinear transformation is introduced that reformulates a general bilinear feasibility problem as a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem augmented with a single non-convex quadratic constraint. The single non-convex quadratic constraint has a regular concave constraint function. Due to the LMI part of this formulation, it is easier to analyze, and we prove that the solution space of this formulation is located inside several ellipsoids and outside a sphere. This leads to our proposed Inside-Ellipsoid and Outside-Sphere (IEOS) model for general bilinear feasibility problems. Then, the feasibility analysis of our proposed IEOS model is performed. The related necessary feasibility conditions and sufficient feasibility conditions are theoretically developed. Moreover, an iterative algorithm for solving our IEOS model is also proposed. Two applications including matrix-factorization problem in control systems and power-flow problem in power systems are considered to evaluate the practicality of our proposed approach. Both problems are formulated as IEOS models. It is shown that our proposed model can provide more accurate solutions to these problems as compared to previous competing approaches in the relevant literature.},

We study this problem at the supervisory layer of the control system, using discrete event systems techniques. The attacker can edit the outputs from the sensors of the system before they reach the supervisory controller as well as it can edit actuator commands before they reach the system. In this context, we formulate the problem of synthesizing a supervisor that is robust against a large class of edit attacks on the sensor readings and actuator commands. Intuitively, we search for a supervisor that guarantees the safety of the system even when sensor readings and actuator commands are compromised. Given the similarities of the investigated problem to the standard supervisory control problem, our solution methodology reduces the problem of synthesizing a robust supervisor against deception attacks to a supervisory control problem. This new and intuitive solution methodology improves upon prior work on this topic.},

  abstract     = {The task of inducing, via continuous static state-feedback control, an asymptotically stable heteroclinic orbit in a nonlinear control system is considered in this paper. The main motivation comes from the problem of ensuring convergence to a so-called point-to-point maneuver in an underactuated mechanical system . Namely, to a smooth curve in its state–control space which is consistent with the system dynamics and connects two (linearly) stabilizable equilibrium points. The proposed method uses a particular parameterization, together with a state projection onto the maneuver as to combine two linearization techniques for this purpose: the Jacobian linearization at the equilibria on the boundaries and a transverse linearization along the orbit. This allows for the computation of stabilizing control gains offline by solving a semidefinite programming problem. The resulting nonlinear controller, which simultaneously asymptotically stabilizes both the orbit and the final equilibrium, is time-invariant, locally Lipschitz continuous, requires no switching, and has a familiar feedforward plus feedback–like structure. The method is also complemented by synchronization function–based arguments for planning such maneuvers for mechanical systems with one degree of underactuation . Numerical simulations of the non-prehensile manipulation task of a ball rolling between two points upon the “butterfly” robot demonstrates the efficacy of the synthesis.},

As a building block, we devise the continuous-time counterpart of the recently proposed (discrete-time) distributed gradient tracking called Continuous Gradient Tracking . By using a Lyapunov approach, we prove exponential stability of the equilibrium corresponding to agents’ estimates being consensual to the optimal solution, with arbitrary initialization of the local estimates. Then, we propose two triggered versions of the algorithm. In the first one, the agents continuously integrate their local dynamics and exchange with neighbors their current local variables in a synchronous way. In Asynchronous Triggered Gradient Tracking , we propose a totally asynchronous scheme in which each agent sends to neighbors its current local variables based on a triggering condition that depends on a locally verifiable condition. The triggering protocol preserves the linear convergence of the algorithm and avoids the Zeno behavior, i.e., an infinite number of triggering events over a finite interval of time is excluded. By using the stability analysis of Continuous Gradient Tracking as a preparatory result, we show exponential stability of the equilibrium point holds for both triggered algorithms and any estimate initialization. Finally, the simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on a data analytics problem, showing also improved performance in terms of inter-agent communication.},

The actuation is either available through one of the ODE or at the boundary of the PDE. The proposed framework covers a broad general class of interconnected systems. Assuming that a stabilizing controller is available, we derive simple sufficient conditions under which appropriate low-pass filters can be combined with the control law to robustify the closed-loop system. Our approach is based on a rewriting of the distributed dynamics as a delay-differential algebraic equation and an analysis in the Laplace domain . The proposed technique will simplify the design of stabilizing controllers for the class of systems under consideration (which can now be done only on a case-by-case basis due to the complexity and generality of the underlying interconnections) since it dissociates the stabilization problem from the robustness aspects. Indeed, it becomes possible to use convenient (but non-robust) techniques for the stabilization of such systems (as the cancellation of the boundary coupling terms or the inversion of the ODE dynamics), knowing that the resulting control law can be made robust (to delays and uncertainties) using the proposed filtering methodology.},

Then we obtain the state-feedback representation of the open-loop type optimal solutions for the leader and the follower in terms of the coupled Riccati differential equations (CRDEs) by generalizing the classical Four-Step Scheme to the case with Markovian jumps. Unlike the existing literature, the Four-Step Scheme in our paper is not symmetric due to the presence of the nonsymmetric quadratic variation induced by the Markov chain. We develop the decoupling approach to find the simplified expression of the corresponding quadratic variation. Under the well-posedness of the CRDEs, the state-feedback type optimal solutions for the leader and the follower constitute the Stackelberg equilibrium. We also show the well-posedness of the CRDEs for the follower under suitable assumptions of the coefficients.

An essential issue in the development of the direct method is the selection of the finite element mesh . Although there have been many pieces of research on adaptive mesh refinement , few works focused on finite element layout optimization before the refinement. This paper proposes an enhanced moving finite element method (EMFE), taking the length of each finite element as a variable, based on the geometric estimation of non-collocation-point error (NCPE) and generalized finite element length (GFEL). The features of EMFE include flexible problem reformulation, stable numerical calculation and the ability to locate breakpoints for singular control problems (the control variables appear linearly in the problems) and finding the local minimum numerical error. The theoretical basis of the ability to locate the breakpoints for singular control problems and the feature of NCPE estimate has also been investigated. Three numerical examples, two of which are singular control problems for lunar landing and the other is a multi-phase nonlinear problem for launch vehicles, demonstrated the performance and features of the proposed EMFE method.},

The parameter space method aims to solve the robust structured controller design problems based on a convex reformulation technique. Despite its attractiveness , the structural constraints are limited to be either decentralized or linear dependence among entries within the same row or column in the current literature. And the global optimal solution is yet to be guaranteed, since a non-convex constraint is introduced in the parameter space after reformulating it as the output feedback synthesis problem. In this paper, we extend the parameter space method to a more generalized structured optimal control problem , such that the linear dependence can occur among its arbitrary entries. A bilinear factorization to the feedback gain matrix is proposed by a special Kronecker product decomposition. Subsequently, an equivalent transformation is proposed to convert this structured control design problem to a controller synthesis problem under decentralized full-state feedback. Thereby, the prior non-convex constraint in the parameter space is removed and the globally optimal structured controller is synthesized by convex programming. Examples such as integrated design and formation control demonstrate its practical appeals.},

Available results range from early move-blocking ideas to singular-value decomposition. For schemes more complex than move-blocking it is seemingly not straightforward to guarantee recursive feasibility of the receding-horizon optimization. Decomposing the space of decision variables related to the inputs into active and inactive complements, this paper proposes a general framework for effective feasibility-preserving dimensionality reduction in NMPC. We show how – independently of the actual choice of the subspaces – recursive feasibility can be established. Moreover, we propose the use of global sensitivity analysis to construct the active subspace in data-driven fashion based on user-defined criteria. Numerical examples illustrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. Specifically, for a chemical reactor we obtain a significant reduction by factor 20 − 40 at a closed-loop performance decay of less than 0.05\%.},

  abstract     = {How to predict and control the collective decision-making dynamics in networked populations is of great significance for various applications in engineering, social and natural sciences, and attracts burgeoning interdisciplinary researches across networked systems and control theory. In this paper, we investigate the asynchronous best-response dynamics in networks of anticoordinating agents. To identify the influence of threshold of the anticoordinating model, we consider the homogeneous-threshold networks and explore how the threshold affects the convergence time and network equilibrium. Results on the convergence time show that upper bound of the total number of strategy switches is determined by three factors: the number of network edges, the number of network nodes, and the value of network threshold. Based on the Lyapunov method , asymptotic stability analyses of the network equilibrium are performed. Meanwhile, by introducing relevant payoff incentives (i.e., reward or punishment) during the game playing, the maximal anticoordinating equilibrium with neighboring agents in different strategies will be achieved in finite time to acquire more stable system-wide outcomes.},

It is assumed that both the output of the ODE and the output of the PDE, selected as a boundary Dirichlet trace, are available for feedback control . The proposed control strategy takes the form of a finite-dimensional observer-based controller. Under a suitable structural controllability property, we show that the reported control strategy achieves the exponential stabilization of the plant when the order of the observer is selected large enough. We then demonstrate how such a control strategy can be adapted and augmented with a predictor component in order to achieve the stabilization of the above mentioned PDE–ODE cascade when the output of the ODE enters into the PDE with an arbitrarily long delay.},

The confidence domains of output are formulated as the Minkowski sum of a zonotope and an ellipsoid. The fault diagnosis task is done based on the separation of all the confidence domains of different fault situations, which leads to a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC).

In addition, if such a feedback control exists, then compute a structured gain vector, which has minimum free-entries. To address the underlying problems, graph theoretic approach is used, where it is shown that the computation of spanning cycle families of a directed graph, corresponding to a suitably defined structured matrix, plays an important role.

By incorporating some auxiliary functions into a backstepping-like design procedure, a smooth adaptive control scheme is constructed using neural network (NN) approximation, making the closed-loop dynamics exhibits a unique feasible solution with all the involved signals evolving within some compact sets during a finite time interval . As a result, the safety and reliability of the application of NN approximators is guaranteed in advance and the algebraic loop issue arising from the control input coupling is removed completely. Thereafter, by combining the Lyapunov stability analysis with contradiction, the boundedness of those signals over the entire time domain is established. It is shown that with the proposed control scheme, the impact of the sensor faults from all state (except for output) on the output tracking is counteracted automatically while maintaining the output constraints. Furthermore, the proposed method enlarges the pure feedback systems considered by relaxing the state-of-the-art controllability conditions. Finally, the efficacy of the approach is verified and clarified via simulation studies.},

To reduce the transmission burden and relieve the data congestion, a stochastic scheduling protocol is established via Markov chain to determine the transmission of system state, under which only one sensor node is permitted to transmit the state signal at each instant. Different from the existing results, the key feature of the proposed protocol is that the transition probability matrix of Markov chain is co-designed with the controller, rather than given a priori . Moreover, the scheduling signal (also called token) reflecting the selected node is integrated to design a token-dependent sliding mode controller , where controller’s membership functions are constructed based on the available state. By establishing the relation between the membership functions in fuzzy system and the ones in controller, sufficient conditions are obtained to attain the stochastic stability of the closed-loop system and the reachability of the sliding domain. Moreover, an iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to search token-dependent parameters and sliding matrix with the objective of reducing the sliding domain. Finally, the effectiveness of the co-design control scheme is verified via simulation examples.},

Leveraging this type of relations, the lower bound for the probability of satisfying the desired specifications can be well ensured by refining controllers synthesized over abstract systems to the original games. Moreover, we propose an algorithmic procedure to construct such a relation for a particular class of nonlinear stochastic systems with slope restrictions on the nonlinearity.

  abstract     = {State estimation of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems by using a network of distributed observers is studied in this paper. We assume that each observer has access to a local measurement which may be insufficient to provide the observability of the system, but the ensemble of all measurements in the network guarantees the observability. In this condition, the objective is to design a distributed state estimation approach such that, while the observers can exchange their estimated state vectors under a communication network, the estimated state vector of each observer converges to the state vector of the system. We consider a scenario when the communication links may fail and rebuild over time and the communication network does not stay connected constantly. Accordingly, the main contribution of the paper is to propose a distributed approach (with guarantees on the feasibility of the design) such that the state vector of the system is estimated by each observer if the union/joint of communication links in bounded intervals of time makes the network communication graph connected. Moreover, we also consider a scenario when the LTI system is subject to external disturbances and measurement noise. In this case, we derive sufficient conditions on the proposed approach such that if the communication topology stays connected during links failure, a desired ℋ ∞ ℋ∞ performance to attenuate the effect of external disturbances and measurement noise on estimation errors is guaranteed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed estimation approach.},

  abstract     = {We propose an algebraic approach to investigate K K -diagnosability of partially observed labeled Petri nets which can be either bounded or unbounded. Namely, a necessary and sufficient condition for K K -diagnosability is established based on the resolution of an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. When the system is K K -diagnosable, our approach also yields the minimal value K m i n ≤ K Kmin≤K that ensures K m i n Kmin -diagnosability. The value of K m i n Kmin is calculated directly, using the same ILP formulation, i.e , without testing 1 , … , ( K m i n − 1 ) 1,…,(Kmin−1) -diagnosability. A second K K -diagnosability approach, which is derived from the first one, is also developed on a compacted horizon providing a sufficient condition for K K -diagnosability. This second technique allows for reducing the system dimensionality yielding a higher computational efficiency and allowing the characterization of the length of the sequences that lead to the fault occurrence, which is necessary to perform the K K -diagnosability test of the first approach.},

Based on a Lyapunov–Krasovskii type input-to-state stability result, we propose a novel event-triggered control algorithm that works as follows. The control inputs are updated only when a certain measurement error surpasses a dynamical threshold depending on both the system states and the evolution time. Sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the closed-loop system maintains its asymptotic stability . It is shown that the time-dependent portion in the dynamical threshold is essential to derive the lower bound of the times between two consecutive control updates. As a special case of our results, we demonstrate the performance of the designed event-triggering algorithm for a class of linear control systems with time delays. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and theoretical results.},

We address this challenge by employing a variational inference (VI) approach, which is a principled method that has deep connections to maximum likelihood estimation . This VI approach ultimately provides estimates of the model as solutions to an optimisation problem, which is deterministic, tractable and can be solved using standard optimisation tools. A specialisation of this approach for systems with additive Gaussian noise is also detailed. The proposed method is examined numerically on a range of simulated and real examples focusing on the robustness to parameter initialisation; additionally, favourable comparisons are performed against state-of-the-art alternatives.},

In particular, we focus on the maximal admissible invariant set contained in some given constraint set. For special types of nonlinear systems , which can be exactly immersed into higher dimensional linear systems with state transformations, invariant sets of the original nonlinear system can be characterized using the higher dimensional linear representation. For general nonlinear systems without the immersibility property, approximate immersions are defined in a local region within some tolerance and linear approximations are computed by leveraging the fixed-point iteration technique for invariant sets.

When the network is strongly connected, the strictly positive equilibrium is the only equilibrium of the system if and only if the network includes either at least one inhibiting function, or a strictly positive external input (otherwise, the zero vector is an equilibrium). The proposed stability results hold also for more general classes of interaction functions, and even in the presence of arbitrary delays in the interactions.},

This class of systems consists of a continuous-time, linear time-invariant system combined with discrete-time linear time-invariant dynamics in a prescribed region of the state space. The former regulates the evolution of the system between any two consecutive resetting events, while the latter governs the instantaneous state jumps occurring whenever the system trajectory intersects a resetting set , which is a portion of the state space assumed to be time-independent. Stabilization of SD-IDLS through a state feedback control design is specifically discussed in this paper, by making use of a candidate quadratic control Lyapunov function . By considering the conical hulls of the resetting set subregions and imposing some cone copositivity properties on the chosen control Lyapunov function , a sufficient and constructive condition for the global asymptotic stabilization of SD-IDLS is provided. Such a result, based on the solution of a feasibility problem that involves a set of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), is shown to be less conservative and more numerically amenable with respect to other results available in the literature. An example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

As expected, the solution is bang–bang and the switching times can be easily determined. We are also able to find a cost-to-go-function, in an analytic form, by solving a simple nonlinear differential equation. On an infinite horizon, we consider the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman theory and we show that the HJB equation can be solved exactly. Moreover, we show that the optimal solution is constant and the cost-to-go function is linear and copositive. This function is the solution of a nonlinear equation. We propose an iterative scheme for solving this equation, which converges in finite time. We also show that an exact solution can be found if there is a positive external disturbance affecting the process and the problem is formulated in a min sup minsup framework.

Existing works on SMO design for NIO systems did not consider UIs in the output equation. In order to overcome the difficulty caused by UIs in output channels and the NIO condition, we reformulated the original system and introduced new UIs to replace the original UIs to obtain an equivalent infinitely observable descriptor system whose output does not contain any UI. Based on the developed equivalent system, a new SMO method is proposed to estimate both the states and the UIs. Subsequently, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the SMO are derived in terms of the original system matrices, which thus makes the conditions easy to be examined.

Each agent is allowed to be of single-output and additional poles and zeros are introduced into edges to construct the channel filter with previous data stored in the memories. We firstly focus on the consensus design by reserving two terms of the non-recursive filter and then propose a simplified design approach exploiting a single parameter, which is of low complexity and can be readily implemented. We also discuss the consensus design by using the non-recursive channel filter with higher-order realizations. Finally, as an extension, we discuss the consensus design based on the first-order recursive channel filter. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the illustrative simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the adaptive speed tracking control problem of high-speed trains (HSTs) in the presence of stochastic disturbances. Considering the complicated operation environments, the HST dynamics are firstly formulated into a stochastic control system, and then an improved minimum variance self-tuning regulator is proposed by incorporating with an attenuation factor and the Tchebycheff series, which is proven to be able to improve the robustness of the HST system to the parameter estimation uncertainties and the stochastic disturbances. The global stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed by establishing the logarithm law of the improved generalized minimum variance loss function. Moreover, a sufficient condition for the optimality of the closed-loop system is provided, which also guarantees the convergency of the proposed control method. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Input design is an important problem for system identification and has been well studied for the classical system identification, i.e., the maximum likelihood/prediction error method. For the emerging regularized system identification, the study on input design has just started, and it is often formulated as a non-convex optimization problem minimizing a scalar measure of the Bayesian mean squared error matrix subject to certain constraints. Among the state-of-art input design techniques for regularized system identification is the so-called quadratic mapping and inverse embedding (QMIE) method. Based on the quadratic mapping between the input and its covariance, the QMIE method is first to obtain the optimal autocovariance by solving a transformed convex optimization problem and then to find all the inputs corresponding to the optimal autocovariance by the time domain inverse embedding (TDIE). In this paper, we report some new results on the embeddings/inverse embeddings of the QMIE method. Firstly, we present a general result on the frequency domain inverse embedding (FDIE) that is to find the inverse of the quadratic mapping described by the discrete-time Fourier transform. Then we show the relation between the TDIE and the FDIE from a graph signal processing perspective. Finally, motivated by this perspective, we further propose a graph induced embedding and its inverse, which include the previously introduced embeddings as special cases. This deepens our understanding of input design from a broader perspective beyond the time domain and frequency domain viewpoints.},

Stochastic nonlinearities are taken into account in both state and measurement equations. The energy-harvesting technique is employed to mitigate the phenomenon of energy depletion and supply energy for data transmissions between the sensors and the remote estimator. By augmenting the state/measurements and their respective second-order Kronecker powers, the original SNS is converted into a new nonlinear system that exploits more information about the non-Gaussian noises, and the resultant quadratic estimator can then be designed by developing an efficient recursive variance-minimization algorithm. Subsequently, an upper bound is proven to exist on the estimation error covariance matrix via solving certain matrix difference equations, and such an upper bound is minimized by resorting to the design of appropriate gain parameters of the quadratic estimator. Moreover, we analyze the monotonicity of the trace of the minimal upper bound with respect to the probability of measurement transmission. Finally, a simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed quadratic estimation algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Traditional process monitoring methods, such as PCA, PLS, ICA , MD et al., are strongly dependent on continuous variables because most of them inevitably involve Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance. With industrial processes becoming more and more complex and integrated, binary variables also appear in monitoring variables besides continuous variables, which makes process monitoring more challenging. The aforementioned traditional approaches are incompetent to mine the information of binary variables, so that the useful information contained in them is usually discarded during the data preprocessing . To solve the problem, this paper focuses on the issue of hybrid variable monitoring (HVM) and proposes a novel unsupervised framework of process monitoring with hybrid variables including continuous and binary variables. HVM is addressed in the probabilistic framework , which can effectively exploit the process information implicit in both continuous and binary variables at the same time. In HVM, the statistics and the monitoring strategy suitable for hybrid variables with only healthy state data are defined and the physical explanation behind the framework is elaborated. In addition, the estimation of parameters required in HVM is derived in detail and the detectable condition of the proposed method is analyzed. Finally, the superiority of HVM is fully demonstrated first on a numerical simulation and then on an actual case of a thermal power plant.},

It is supposed that discrete-time point-like or averaged measurements are available. The system is known to be stabilizable by static output-feedback employing several distributed in space actuators and sensors, but is not stabilizable by only one of the actuator–sensor pairs. Does there exist a switching stabilizing static output-feedback such that at all times, only one actuator–sensor pair is active? We give a positive answer and find the appropriate switching sampled-data control law. The proposed switching controller can be implemented either by N N actuators and sensors placed in each subdomain (here switching control may reduce the energy that the system spends) or by using one actuator–sensor pair that can move to the active subdomain . For implementation of the control law by moving actuators and sensors, we take into account a moving time by treating it as an additional switching between the open-loop system and the closed-loop switched system. The guidance of active (or mobile) actuators and sensors is provided by using output-dependent switching. Constructive conditions are derived to ensure that the resulting closed-loop system is regionally stable by means of the Lyapunov approach. Numerical example illustrates the efficiency of the method.},

Moreover, the existing proofs do not clarify how conservative the assumptions are. We provide an alternative constructive proof for the single-input case.

  abstract     = {In this note it is shown that J. Willems’ and R. Brockett’s time-varying version of the powerful multiplier class of R. O’Shea, G. Zames and P. Falb does not enhance absolute stability tests for Lur’e interconnections with sector-bounded nonlinearities if the main plant is time-invariant.},
