A simple extension to abstract domains is possible: principles of intuitionistic set theory on top of minimal logic suffice to ensure that every countably based bounded complete dcpo has a maximal element. The aforesaid theorem is a ready instance.},

In SCA, the attacker can obtain information leakage from a device executing cryptographic algorithms by means of the measure of side-channels such as power consumption, electromagnetic radiation and execution time. For this reason, effective countermeasures against SCA are indispensable in implemented cryptographic devices . The use of masking schemes (in which intermediate computations are independent from the sensible input data) constitutes the most effective approach to achieve resistance against physical attacks. Among the different masking methods proposed for hardware, domain-oriented masking is one of the most promising due to its lower implementation costs, level of security and glitch resistance. In this paper, a new bit-parallel first-order domain-oriented masked finite field multiplier is presented which incorporates the addition of fresh random values without increasing the computation delay. Explicit expressions for the computation of the new masked multiplier for the binary extension field used in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are also given.},

  abstract     = {Graph invariants are a useful tool in graph theory. Not only do they encode useful information about the graphs to which they are associated, but complete invariants can be used to distinguish between non-isomorphic graphs. Polynomial invariants for graphs such as the well-known Tutte polynomial have been studied for several years, and recently there has been interest to also define such invariants for phylogenetic networks, a special type of graph that arises in the area of evolutionary biology. Recently Liu gave a complete invariant for (phylogenetic) trees. However, the polynomial invariants defined thus far for phylogenetic networks that are not trees require vertex labels and either contain a large number of variables, or they have exponentially many terms in the number of reticulations. This can make it difficult to compute these polynomials and to use them to analyse unlabelled networks. In this paper, we shall show how to circumvent some of these difficulties for rooted cactuses and cactuses. As well as being important in other areas such as operations research, rooted cactuses contain some common classes of phylogenetic networks such phylogenetic trees and level-1 networks. More specifically, we define a polynomial F that is a complete invariant for the class of rooted cactuses without vertices of indegree 1 and outdegree 1 that has 5 variables, and a polynomial Q that is a complete invariant for the class of rooted cactuses that has 6 variables whose degree can be bounded linearly in terms of the size of the rooted cactus. We also explain how to extend the Q polynomial to define a complete invariant for leaf-labelled rooted cactuses as well as (unrooted) cactuses.},

This problem has been attracted by much research recently due to its importance in machine learning and combinatorial optimization . However, because of high query and adaptive complexities, the existing algorithms might still not be efficient enough when working with large input data. This paper proposes a randomized and bicriteria approximation algorithm that has O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) adaptive complexity and O ( ( n + log ⁡ n log ⁡ B ) log ⁡ ( n B ) ) O((n+log⁡nlog⁡B)log⁡(nB)) query complexity. Our algorithm significantly reduces both adaptive and query complexities compared to some state-of-the-art algorithms by factors of Ω ( log ⁡ ( m ) log 2 ⁡ ( m n log ⁡ B ) ( 1 + log ⁡ ( log ⁡ B ) / log ⁡ ( n ) ) ) Ω(log⁡(m)log2⁡(mnlog⁡B)(1+log⁡(log⁡B)/log⁡(n))) , Ω ( min ⁡ { n / log ⁡ ( n ) , log ⁡ ( B ) } ) Ω(min⁡{n/log⁡(n),log⁡(B)}) respectively, where m = f ( B ⋅ 1 ) m=f(B⋅1) .},

All the robots start at the center of the circle and can move anywhere with maximum speed 1. During the search, robots may communicate wirelessly. All messages transmitted by all robots are tagged with the robots&#39; unique identifiers which cannot be corrupted. The search is considered complete when the exit is found by a non-faulty robot (which must visit its location) and the remaining non-faulty robots know the correct location of the exit. We study two models of faulty robots. First, crash-faulty robots may stop operating as instructed, and thereafter they remain nonfunctional. Second, Byzantine-faulty robots may transmit untrue messages at any time during the search so as to mislead the non-faulty robots, e.g., lie about the location of the exit. When there are only crash fault robots, we provide optimal algorithms for the ( n , f ) (n,f) -search problem, with optimal worst-case search completion time 1 + ( f + 1 ) 2 π n 1+(f+1)2πn . Our main technical contribution pertains to optimal algorithms for ( n , 1 ) (n,1) -search with a Byzantine-faulty robot, minimizing the worst-case search completion time, which equals 1 + 4 π n 1+4πn .

If the cow travels a total distance s to locate a hyperplane H whose distance from the origin was r ≥ 1 r≥1 , then the cow is said to achieve competitive ratio s / r s/r . It is a classic result that, in R 2 R2 , the optimal (deterministic) competitive ratio is 9. In R 3 R3 , the optimal competitive ratio is known to be at most ≈13.811. But in higher dimensions, the asymptotic relationship between d and the optimal competitive ratio remains an open question. The best upper and lower bounds, due to Antoniadis et al., are O ( d 3 / 2 ) O(d3/2) and Ω ( d ) Ω(d) , leaving a gap of roughly d d .

  abstract     = {The annihilation number a ( G ) a(G) of a graph G is an efficiently computable upper bound on the independence number α ( G ) α(G) of G . Recently, Hiller observed that a characterization of the graphs G with α ( G ) = a ( G ) α(G)=a(G) due to Larson and Pepper is false. Since the known efficient algorithm recognizing these graphs was based on this characterization, the complexity of recognizing graphs G with α ( G ) = a ( G ) α(G)=a(G) was once again open. We show that these graphs can indeed be recognized efficiently. More generally, we show that recognizing graphs G with α ( G ) ≥ a ( G ) − ℓ α(G)≥a(G)−ℓ is fixed parameter tractable using ℓ as a parameter.},

To date, the radio k -chromatic number of finite paths and square of finite paths is computed exactly when k is equal to the diameter of the graph. Moreover, the exact value of the radio k -chromatic number of an arbitrary power of a finite path is also computed when the diameter of the path is strictly smaller than k . Close lower and upper bounds for the radio k -chromatic number are given for the infinite path. Furthermore, lower and upper bounds have been found for an arbitrary power greater than or equal to two of infinite path. In this article, we improve the lower bound for r c k ( G ) rck(G) of any arbitrary power of the infinite path for any k .

  abstract     = {The network coloring game has been proposed in the literature of social sciences as a model for conflict-resolution circumstances. The players of the game are the vertices of a graph with n vertices and maximum degree Δ. The game is played over rounds, and in each round all players simultaneously choose a color from a set of available colors. Players have local information of the graph: they only observe the colors chosen by their neighbors and do not communicate or cooperate with one another. A player is happy when she has chosen a color that is different from the colors chosen by her neighbors, otherwise she is unhappy, and a configuration of colors for which all players are happy is a proper coloring of the graph. It has been shown in the literature that, when the players adopt a particular greedy randomized strategy, the game reaches a proper coloring of the graph within O ( log ⁡ ( n ) ) O(log⁡(n)) rounds, with high probability, provided the number of colors available to each player is at least Δ + 2 Δ+2 . In this note we show that a modification of the aforementioned greedy strategy yields likewise a proper coloring of the graph, provided the number of colors available to each player is at least Δ + 1 Δ+1 .},

It is a proper coloring with an additional restriction that every non-isolated vertex has some colors that appear an odd number of times in its neighborhood. In a graph G , we use χ o ( G ) χo(G) to represent the minimum number of colors that ensures an odd coloring. A graph G is odd k -colorable if χ o ( G ) ≤ k χo(G)≤k . The above definition about odd coloring was introduced very recently by Petruševski and Škrekovski, who also proved that if G is planar then χ o ( G ) ≤ 9 χo(G)≤9 . A toroidal graph is a graph that can be embedded on a torus. In this paper, we study the odd chromatic number of toroidal graphs and prove that every toroidal graph G has a property that χ o ( G ) ≤ 9 χo(G)≤9 . Since K 7 K7 is a toroidal graph, χ o ( G ) χo(G) is no less than 7.},

There are ℓ groups: P 1 , … , P ℓ ⊆ P P1,…,Pℓ⊆P . We are also given a set F of feasible centers in X X . The goal in the socially fair k -median problem is to find a set C ⊆ F C⊆F of k centers that minimizes the maximum average cost over all the groups. That is, find C that minimizes the objective function Φ ( C , P ) ≡ max j ⁡ { ∑ x ∈ P j d ( C , x ) / | P j | } Φ(C,P)≡maxj⁡{∑x∈Pjd(C,x)/|Pj|} , where d ( C , x ) d(C,x) is the distance of x to the closest center in C . The socially fair k -means problem is defined similarly by using squared distances, i.e., d 2 ( . , . ) d2(.,.) instead of d ( . , . ) d(.,.) . The current best approximation guarantee for both of the problems is O ( log ⁡ ℓ log ⁡ log ⁡ ℓ ) O(log⁡ℓlog⁡log⁡ℓ) due to Makarychev and Vakilian (COLT 2021). In this work, we study the fixed-parameter tractability of the problems with respect to parameter k . We design ( 3 + ε ) (3+ε) and ( 9 + ε ) (9+ε) approximation algorithms for the socially fair k -median and k -means problems, respectively, in FPT (fixed-parameter tractable) time f ( k , ε ) ⋅ n O ( 1 ) f(k,ε)⋅nO(1) , where f ( k , ε ) = ( k / ε ) O ( k ) f(k,ε)=(k/ε)O(k) and n = | P ∪ F | n=|P∪F| . The algorithms are randomized and succeed with a probability of at least ( 1 − 1 n ) (1−1n) . Furthermore, we show that if W [ 2 ] ≠ FPT W[2]≠FPT , then better approximation guarantees are not possible in FPT time.},

These two objectives, however, cannot always be achieved simultaneously. Existing PPS schemes prioritize control of the sample size, violating the PPS property if necessary. We provide a new PPS scheme, called EB-PPS, that allows a different trade-off: EB-PPS enforces the PPS property at all times while ensuring that the sample size never exceeds the target value n . The sample size is exactly equal to n if possible, and otherwise has maximal expected value and minimal variance. Thus we bound the sample size, thereby avoiding storage overflows and helping to control the time required for analytics over the sample, while allowing the user complete control over the sample contents. In the context of training classifiers at scale under imbalanced loss functions, we show that such control yields superior classifiers. The method is both simple to implement and efficient, being a one-pass streaming algorithm with an amortized processing time of O ( 1 ) O(1) per item, which makes it computationally preferable even in cases where both EB-PPS and prior algorithms can ensure the PPS property and a target sample size simultaneously.},

By ensuring that the kernel consists of a single instance our result yields a kernel of the same magnitude (up to additive terms) for the almost equivalent rotation distance problem on rooted, ordered binary trees. The earlier work of Lucas left the kernel as a disjoint set of instances, potentially allowing very minor differences in the definition of the size of instances to accumulate, causing a constant-factor distortion in the kernel size when switching between flip distance and rotation distance formulations. Our approach avoids this sensitivity. We have also undertaken experiments to understand how much reduction is achieved by our kernel in practice.},

  abstract     = {Kansal and Dutta recently proposed a multisignature scheme at AFRICACRYPT 2020. This is the first lattice-based multisignature scheme that generates a multisignature in only a single round of interaction and supports public key aggregation. In this letter, we provide a cryptanalysis of this multisignature scheme and demonstrate that the scheme does not satisfy unforgeability requirements. We present an attack strategy to demonstrate that if an adversary obtains a sufficient number of signatures from a signer, he/she can recover the private key of the signer in polynomial time . We also uncover the root cause of the attack and provide a possible solution for this attack to aid future designs of secure multisignature schemes.},

The domination number of G is the minimum cardinality of an DS of G and the Roman domination number of G is the minimum weight of an RDF f of G , where the weight of f is ∑ v ∈ V f ( v ) ∑v∈Vf(v) . The (Roman) domination problem is to compute the (Roman) domination number of a given graph. In this paper, we study the Roman domination problem. We show that the complexity of the problem differs from the complexity of the domination problem and the problem is NP-complete for circle graphs and undirected path graphs and is APX-complete for graphs of degree at most 4. We also propose an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation with polynomial number of constraints for the problem. Additionally, we use the ILP formulation to give an H ( Δ ( G ) + 1 ) H(Δ(G)+1) -approximation algorithm for solving the problem for any graph G , where Δ ( G ) Δ(G) is the maximum degree of G . Furthermore, we show that the optimization version of the problem on split and chordal graphs cannot be approximated in polynomial time within ( 1 / 2 − ε ) ln ⁡ | V | (1/2−ε)ln⁡|V| for any ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 , unless NP ⊆ DTIME ( | V | O ( log ⁡ log ⁡ | V | ) ) (|V|O(log⁡log⁡|V|)) .},

Given a graph G , terminal vertices s and t , and an integer k , the Tracking Paths problem asks whether there exists at most k vertices, which if marked as trackers, would ensure that the sequence of trackers encountered in each s - t path is unique. It is known that the problem is NP -hard and admits a kernel (reducible to an equivalent instance) with O ( k 6 ) O(k6) vertices and O ( k 7 ) O(k7) edges, when parameterized by the size of the output (tracking set) k [4] . In this paper we improve the size of the kernel substantially by providing a kernel with O ( k 2 ) O(k2) vertices and edges for general graphs and a kernel with O ( k ) O(k) vertices and edges for planar graphs . We do this via a new concept, namely a tree-sink structure .

  abstract     = {Cuckoo hashing is a common hashing technique, guaranteeing constant-time lookups in the worst case. Adding a stash was proposed by Kirsch, Mitzenmacher, and Wieder at SICOMP 2010, as a way to reduce the probability of failure (i.e., the probability that a valid Cuckoo assignment fails to exist). It has since become a standard technique in areas such as cryptography, where a negligible probability of failure is often required. We focus on an extension of Cuckoo hashing that allows multiple items per bucket, which improves the load factor. That extension was also analyzed by Kirsch et al. in the presence of a stash. In particular, letting d be the number of items per bucket, and s be the stash size, Kirsch et al. showed that, for constant d and s , the failure probability is O ( n ( s + 1 ) ( 1 − d ) ) O(n(s+1)(1−d)) . In this paper, we first report a bug in the analysis by Kirsch et al. by showing a counter-example leading to an asymptotically-larger probability of failure ( Ω ( n − d − s − 1 ) Ω(n−d−s−1) ). Then we provide a general analysis and upper bound of the failure probability for (almost) arbitrary d and s , instead of just constant, which is useful for applications in cryptography. We finally deduce from the general analysis a tight bound Θ ( n − d − s ) Θ(n−d−s) for the probability of failure, for constants d and s .},

Our algorithms and results are based on some simple observations about listing triangles under various settings and we show that we can list larger cliques using such facts. Specifically, we show that our techniques can be used to solve an open problem posed in the original paper: we show that detecting and listing cliques (of any size) can be done using O ( 1 ) O(1) -bandwidth after one round of communication under node insertions and node/edge deletions. We conclude with an extension of our techniques to obtain a small bandwidth 1-round algorithm for listing cliques when more than one node insertion/deletion and/or edge deletion update occurs at any time.},

First, we consider the case where an argumentation framework is naive-bijective: its naive sets and preferred extensions are equal. Recognizing naive-bijective argumentation frameworks is hard, but we show that it is tractable for frameworks with bounded in-degree. Next, we give a bijection between the preferred extensions of an argumentation framework being admissible-closed (the intersection of two admissible sets is admissible) and the naive sets of another framework on the same set of arguments. On the other hand, we prove that identifying admissible-closed argumentation frameworks is coNP -complete. At last, we introduce the notion of irreducible self-defending sets as those that are not the union of others. It turns out there exists a bijection between the preferred extensions of an argumentation framework and the naive sets of a framework on its irreducible self-defending sets. Consequently, the preferred extensions of argumentation frameworks with some lattice properties can be listed with polynomial delay and polynomial space .},

  abstract     = {Vectors are called short vectors when the Euclidean norm of vectors is relatively small. By now, some researches have been done to find sufficient short vectors in certain variants of NTRU lattice to analyze the security of NTRU systems. These variants are all taking advantage of the property of NTRU cryptosystem to modify the standard NTRU lattice. Related variants include zero-run lattices with dimension 2 N , zero-forced lattices with dimension 2 ( N − r ) 2(N−r) , r r&amp;lt;N , and IN-lattices with dimension N . Motivated by different constructions, we revisit related variants and develop some techniques to further reduce the dimension of IN-lattice, such that the expected breaking time can be decreased significantly. Firstly, by working with the cyclic matrix associated with the NTRU public key h , shifts of the private vector f can be accommodated. Hence, t randomly chosen coefficients in a shift of the private vector f can be forced to equal zero. This not only results in a new lattice with a lower dimension but also creates an environment to utilize parallel mechanisms to improve the probability of success. Finally, experiments have demonstrated that our approach outperforms the previous methods.},

  abstract     = {Consumption Markov decision processes (CMDPs) are a kind of resource-constrained probabilistic decision-making systems allowing the consumption and replenishment to capacity of resource. Making each decision in CMDPs consumes some amount of resource, which can be reloaded to the full capacity in a specified set of states. We consider here the quantitative reachability probability controller synthesis problems for CMDPs that extract a policy preventing resource exhaustion and achieve (repeated) reachability goals with the maximal probability , in contrast to the original work focusing on the qualitative controller synthesis for CMDPs, e.g., fulfilling the (repeated) reachability goals with positive probability or probability one . We first prove that the exact quantitative reachability probability problems are NP -hard by a reduction from the 0–1 Knapsack problem. We solve them by converting a given CMDP to a flattened Markov decision process (MDP) and then constructing an optimal policy for that MDP. Unfortunately, the naive flattened MDPs are prohibitively large and thus make the subsequent synthesis not scale well. To overcome this drawback, we propose a pruned construction and a quotient construction of the flattened MDP to reduce the sizes of MDPs. The empirical evaluation shows that our optimizations can significantly improve the scalability of the purely flattening-based synthesis method for CMDPs on benchmarks from real-world scenarios — autonomous electric vehicle routing and helicopter planning in Mars Perseverance Rover project.},

  abstract     = {Residual Random Greedy ( RRGreedy ) is a natural randomized version of the greedy algorithm for submodular maximization. It was introduced to address non-monotone submodular maximization [1] and plays an important role in the deterministic algorithm for monotone submodular maximization that beats the ( 1 / 2 ) -factor barrier [2] . In this work, we analyze RRGreedy for monotone submodular functions along two fronts: (1) For matroid constrained maximization of monotone submodular functions with bounded curvature α , we show that RRGreedy achieves a ( 1 / ( 1 + α ) ) -approximation in the worst-case (i.e., irrespective of the randomness in the algorithm). In particular, this implies that it achieves a ( 1 / 2 ) -approximation in the worst-case (not just in expectation). (2) We generalize RRGreedy to k matroid intersection constraints and show that the generalization achieves a ( 1 / ( k + 1 ) ) -approximation in expectation relative to the optimum value of the Lovász relaxation over the intersection of k matroid polytopes. Our results suggest that RRGreedy is at least as good as Greedy for matroid and matroid intersection constraints.},

In comparison, the previous best-known linear kernel is of size at most 28 k . To achieve this improvement we introduce cyclic generators, which can be viewed as cyclic analogues of the generators used in the phylogenetic networks literature. As a corollary to our main result we also give an improved weighted linear kernel for the minimum hybridization problem on two rooted binary phylogenetic trees.},

Once a ball arrives, it is stored in one of the unoccupied bins. If all the bins are occupied then the ball is thrown away. In each time step, we select a bin uniformly at random, clear it, and gain its content. Once the stream of balls ends, all the remaining balls in the buffer are cleared and added to our gain. We are interested in analyzing the expected gain of this randomized process with respect to that of an optimal gain-maximizing strategy, which gets the same online stream of balls, and clears a ball from a bin, if exists, at any step. We name this gain ratio the loss of serving in the dark. In this paper, we determine the exact loss of serving in the dark. We prove that the expected gain of the randomized process is worse by a factor of ρ + ϵ ρ+ϵ from that of the optimal gain-maximizing strategy where ϵ = O ( 1 B 1 / 3 ) ϵ=O(1B1/3) and ρ = max α &gt; 1 ⁡ α e α / ( ( α − 1 ) e α + e − 1 ) ≈ 1.69996 ρ=maxα&amp;gt;1⁡αeα/((α−1)eα+e−1)≈1.69996 .

  abstract     = {In real-world applications, adversaries can launch leakage attacks, such as side-channel attacks, to obtain some information of the secret states (e.g. secret key, random value, etc.) in cryptographic protocols , compromising their security. Moreover, adversaries can obtain more leakage information by performing leakage attacks continuously, and the leakage attacks can be performed at any time by the adversary. Therefore, when designing public-key encryption (PKE) schemes, one should consider the continuous leakage setting. And it is desirable that the designed schemes can resist the leakage attacks. In this paper, to achieve better continuous leakage resilience, a novel construction of continuous leakage-resilient PKE scheme is proposed. The chosen-ciphertext attacks security of our proposed scheme can be proved based on the hardness of the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. Our construction tolerates a large key leakage rate, which is one of the best among existing PKE schemes. Moreover, the level of leakage resilience can be adjusted based on the specific requirements in real-world applications. The analyses demonstrate that our proposal also enjoys low computational overheads, outperforming the existing leakage-resilient PKE schemes.},

  abstract     = {TrCBC is a variant of CBC-MAC which appeared in Zhang et al. (2012) [9] . The authors claimed TrCBC to be a secure message authentication code (MAC) with some interesting properties. If TrCBC TrCBC is instantiated with a block cipher with block length n , then it requires ⌈ λ / n ⌉ ⌈λ/n⌉ block cipher calls for authenticating a λ -bit message and requires a single key, which is the block cipher key. The authors state that TrCBC can have tag lengths of size less than n / 2 n/2 . We show that with high probability, an adversary can forge TrCBC with tag length n / 2 − 1 n/2−1 with just three queries. The attack that we show can be applied to forge a large class of messages. The authors proved TrCBC to be a pseudorandom function (PRF). A scrutiny of the claimed PRF bound shows that for some recommended values of tag lengths, the bound turns out to be quite large. Thus, the security theorem does not imply security of TrCBC for all recommended tag lengths.},

  abstract     = {The organization of temporal properties into a Temporal Hierarchy proposed by Manna and Pnueli is central in the study of the expressive power of fragments of Linear Temporal Logic with Past ( LTL + P LTL+P ). A crucial role is played by the Reactivity class, which itself forms a hierarchy consisting of the classes Reactivity(1), Reactivity(2), and so on, and it is proved to be expressively equivalent to LTL + P LTL+P . The logic of Generalized Reactivity(1) ( GR ( 1 ) GR(1) for short), introduced in the context of reactive synthesis, expands the Reactivity(1) class (abbreviated R ( 1 ) R(1) ) with safety formulas and multiple fairness conditions. In this paper, we prove that GR ( 1 ) GR(1) is expressively equivalent to R ( 1 ) R(1) . We first define a simple normal form for GR ( 1 ) GR(1) formulas, and then we prove the expressive equivalence between GR ( 1 ) GR(1) (in such a normal form) and R ( 1 ) R(1) . In addition, we show that all the involved translations require only a linear increase in size. Finally, we lift these results to the general case proving that GR ( N ) GR(N) is equivalent to R ( N ) R(N) , for all N ≥ 1 N≥1 .},

  abstract     = {Computing cohesive subgraphs is a central problem in graph theory. While many formulations of cohesive subgraphs lead to NP-hard problems, finding a densest subgraph can be done in polynomial-time. As such, the densest subgraph model has emerged as the most popular notion of cohesiveness. Recently, the data mining community has started looking into the problem of computing k densest subgraphs in a given graph, rather than one. In this paper we consider a natural variant of the k densest subgraphs problem, where overlap between solution subgraphs is allowed with no constraint. We show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to k , and admits a PTAS for constant k . Both these algorithms complement nicely the previously known O ( n k ) O(nk) algorithm for the problem.},

This problem admits a polynomial parameter transformation to Tracking Shortest Paths , and this implies a kernel with O ( k 4 ) O(k4) vertices and edges for Tracking Shortest Paths in general graphs and a kernel with O ( k 2 ) O(k2) vertices and edges in planar graphs .

  abstract     = {The parallel time of a population protocol is defined as the average number of required interactions in which an agent in the protocol participates, i.e., the quotient between the total number of interactions required by the protocol and the total number n of agents, or just roughly the number of required rounds, where a round stands for a sequence of n consecutive interactions. This naming triggers an intuition that at least the expected number of parallel steps sufficient to implement a round is O ( 1 ) O(1) . In a single parallel step only mutually independent interactions can be involved. We show that when the transition function of a population protocol is treated as a black box then the expected maximum number of parallel steps necessary to implement a round is Ω ( log ⁡ n log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) Ω(log⁡nlog⁡log⁡n) . We also provide a combinatorial argument for a matching upper bound on the expected number of parallel steps under additional assumptions. Further, we extend these bounds by showing that the situation changes dramatically for sequences of m = Ω ( n log ⁡ n ) m=Ω(nlog⁡n) interactions. Then, the expected number of parallel steps required to implement such sequences is Θ ( m n ) Θ(mn) under the aforementioned additional assumptions. Thus, it asymptotically coincides with the notion of parallel time, i.e., O ( m n ) O(mn) , for sequences of interactions produced by protocols solving any non-trivial problems requiring Ω ( n log ⁡ n ) Ω(nlog⁡n) interactions.},

  abstract     = {When building secure safety-critical software systems upon modern processors, a system designer may wish to thwart cache side-channel attacks while ensuring that no process misses its deadline. If the side-channel attacks are prevented in a uniprocessor environment by flushing the cache whenever context is switched from a process with a high security level to a process with a low security level then the problem of scheduling processes while meeting deadlines can be modeled as a single-machine job scheduling problem with release times, deadlines, preemption, and family setup times, which is known to be NP NP -hard. Since we expect the number of security levels and the worst-case cache flush time in practical applications to be “small”, the number of families, F , and the largest setup time, S , are natural parameters for the problem. We show that the problem, when parameterized by ( F , S ) (F,S) , is not fixed-parameter tractable by proving that the single-machine job scheduling problem with release times, deadlines, preemption, and two families with setup times picked from the set { 0 , 1 } {0,1} is NP NP -hard.

In this paper, a new approach to analyze the schedulability of fixed-priority scheduling using well-known mathematical tool called continued fractions is presented. With continued fractions, a new schedulability test for Rate Monotonic algorithm is derived.

  abstract     = {A well-known construction of a weighted automaton over the integers, assigning zero to precisely the nonempty words from the equality set of a given Post&#39;s correspondence problem instance, is extended to the case of weights taken from an arbitrary integral domain that is not locally finite. Undecidability of problems for rational series such as universality or rationality of support thus generalises to such domains as well. In spite of being fairly simple, these findings imply that the support rationality problem can be undecidable over rings of positive characteristic, answering an open question of D. Kirsten and K. Quaas. In addition, a more general undecidability result for rational series over other than locally finite integral domains is proved, which subsumes, e.g., the undecidability of support rationality or context-freeness.},

  abstract     = {In selfish routing, Braess&#39;s paradox demonstrates the counterintuitive fact that removing a part of a network may improve the players&#39; cost at equilibrium. In this work, we use the approximate version of Caratheodory&#39;s theorem (Barman, SICOMP 2018) and show how to efficiently approximate the best subnetwork on selfish routing instances with relatively short paths and Lipschitz continuous cost functions. Restriction to networks with short paths is necessary to escape the strong inapproximability result of (Roughgarden, JCSS 2006). We present the first polynomial-time algorithm that approximates (in a certain relaxed sense) the best subnetwork problem on such instances. Specifically, for any constant ε &gt; 0 , our algorithm computes an ε -Nash flow with maximum latency at most ( 1 + ε ) L ⁎ + ε , where L ⁎ is the equilibrium latency of the best subnetwork. Moreover, our algorithm runs in quasipolynomial time on networks with polylogarithmically long paths. As a corollary, we obtain the first polynomial-time approximation scheme for the best subnetwork in the class of random G n , p instances proven prone to Braess&#39;s paradox by (Roughgarden and Valiant, RSA 2010) and (Chung Graham et al., RSA 2012).},

In this paper, we present a simple proof of the weak NP -hardness of the problem for travel time functions defined on integers. This simplifies and reproduces an earlier result from Orda and Rom. Our proof generalizes to travel time functions defined on rational numbers and also implies that, in this case, the problem becomes harder, i.e. is strongly NP -hard. As arbitrary functions are impractical for applications, we also study a more realistic problem model where travel time functions are piecewise linear and represented by a sequence of breakpoints with integer coordinates. We show that this problem formulation is strongly NP -hard, too. As an intermediate step for this proof, we also show the strong NP -completeness of SubsetProduct on rational numbers.},

We give the following generalization: Given an arbitrary weight function w on the edges of K n , n Kn,n , consider its set of minimum weight perfect matchings. We give the real multilinear polynomial for the Boolean function which determines if a graph G ⊆ K n , n G⊆Kn,n contains one of these minimum weight perfect matchings.

Traffic stabilizes to a game-theoretic equilibrium in which all agents experience the same latency. A multi-commodity (that is, a graph with many source-target pairs) is vulnerable if there exists an assignment of latency functions to edges such that the resulting traffic network suffers from the counterintuitive phenomenon, called Braess paradox, for which a network increases its efficiency by removing edges. Building on an existing characterization of vulnerable multi-commodities and a polynomial algorithm to check vulnerability for single commodities, in this paper we present a polynomial-time algorithm that checks whether a directed multi-commodity is vulnerable or not. This definitely closes a question opened by Roughgarden about 20 years ago.},

It uses σ lg ⁡ ℓ max + o ( σ ) + O ( ℓ max 2 ) σlg⁡ℓmax+o(σ)+O(ℓmax2) bits of space, where σ and ℓ max ℓmax are the alphabet size and maximum codeword length, respectively.
