  abstract     = {This work proposes a holistic decision support tool to be used by diverse stakeholders and decision-makers, integrating experimental data . Considering the characteristics of each region, the tool aids in defining the most suitable testing strategies per country or region: number of tests, time, cost, type of pool strategy based on prevalence rate interval, and the use of centralization vs. decentralization of testing strategies. The tool contributes to the field of decision support systems theoretically by introducing a novel model for testing decisions in extreme situations within a specific region, and practically, by demonstrating how laboratory data can be applied to real-life decision-making in that same region. This tool has been validated with two real case studies (Portugal and France) and has applied, as input data , real experimental results. The results suggested tree- and matrix-based strategies for low and high prevalence rates. A decentralized testing strategy improves the financial and time gains introduced by pool testing; however, centralizing the decisions shows a more straightforward implementation and resource management of the pool testing system with a low-performance loss. Therefore, there might be a solution to consider overcoming operational restrictions.},

  abstract     = {Online consumer reviews play an important role in helping consumers judge the quality and authenticity of products on e-commerce platforms. However, the constant presence of fake reviews on these platforms has significantly impacted the operation and development of e-commerce platforms. In this study, we develop a novel supervised probabilistic method to detect fake reviews by utilizing the difference in the distribution of non-fraudulent reviews and that of fake reviews. Specifically, we first derive the univariate distributions of several unique features (linguistic, behavioral, and interrelationship features). We then integrate these distributions into two mixed distributions according to their labels to represent the overall difference between non-fraudulent reviews and fake reviews. Next, we randomly generate synthetic review data points with different labels from the above mixed distributions. Finally, we train a Multilayer Perceptron model by using these synthetic review data to obtain a classifier. We conducted several experiments to test the model using several original real-world review datasets. Numerical results indicated that the proposed supervised method outperformed some well-known sampling models and fake review detection methods, in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, we extend the proposed method to handle the scenarios with small samples of raw review data. This study contributes to the literature by exploiting the difference in the distribution of non-fraudulent reviews and that of fraudulent reviews, which can improve the accuracy of fake review detection for online platforms.},

This work practically implements and evaluates an alternative, cost-based approach for data quality analysis starting from a ‘fitness for use’-perspective. The practical impact of completeness and representational consistency of data stored in an integrated relational database is investigated in an experiment with 218 volunteers. Two alternative versions of this database are then prepared by manually improving their data quality. Participants are randomly assigned to one of three databases and are given a set of questions to resolve by means of SQL . As questions are resolved, we measure several cost-based indicators such as ability to solve, time to solve and number of attempts. Results indicate that the impact of data quality issues can differ significantly from what would be expected when using rule-based measurement. Effects range from almost no impact to a 65% reduction in time needed to solve tasks. Effect sizes up to 0.43 using one-way ANCOVA tests are observed.},

  abstract     = {Predictive process monitoring (PPM) allows companies to improve the efficiency of their business processes by predicting aspects such as the process outcome, the next event, or the time until the next event. So far, existing studies have mainly focused on developing novel predictive models while using features solely from event logs. In this study, we aim to go beyond log data and increase the focus of PPM research towards external context information. To this end, we consider digital documents as they are omnipresent in many business processes and their inclusion can often be justified by a business rationale. However, incorporating digital documents into PPM models poses considerable challenges as they present unstructured data that can contain visual and textual cues of future process behavior , while manual feature extraction is generally not feasible. Therefore, we propose an approach that processes digital documents based on automated visual and textual feature extraction methods. Furthermore, we design a tailored integration module which transforms the extracted features from multiple document pages into a fixed-size representation that subsequently serves as input for the predictive models. Our evaluation, based on a real-world dataset of insurance claims from a mid-sized German insurance company, featuring 5131 process instances with 32,058 events and 39,242 document pages, shows that incorporating digital documents improves the performance by significant margins in predicting the damage type, the next event, and the time until the next event. Finally, we analyze how digital documents contribute to the model’s predictions in terms of Shapley additive explanations .},

  abstract     = {E -commerce retailers (e-tailers) are increasingly competing in order fulfillment to win over customers. Delivery guarantee emerges as a key competitive factor. Prior studies have examined the relationship between delivery performance and consumer satisfaction, but little attention was paid to the practice of delivery guarantee itself. This study examines delivery guarantee as a decision support tool provided by e-tailers. Particularly, we draw on the signaling theory, expectation disconfirmation theory, and attribution theory to investigate whether it is worth to offer delivery guarantee, who (what kind of e-tailers) can benefit more from it, and how e-tailers should manage the order fulfillment process when they offer delivery guarantee. Through analyzing data from Alibaba using the Heckman Ordered Probit Model , we show that delivery guarantee can be a double-edged sword. That is, offering and meeting a delivery guarantee leads to higher consumer satisfaction towards order fulfillment than not offering one, but failing to meet the guarantee lowers consumer satisfaction more than not providing it. We further show that large e-tailers are more negatively affected by failed guarantees than small ones, and that the “middle mile” (delivery en route) of order fulfillment significantly reduces consumer satisfaction if failed. Taken together, this study generates implications for e-tailers that consider providing delivery guarantee. Large e-tailers should be especially cautious and assess their capability and commitment. The middle mile should receive enough managerial attention in addition to the widely concerned last mile.},

Although the idea crowdsourcing literature has grown significantly, it is relatively new and focused on idea crowdsourcing platforms for product improvement ideas where individuals submit ideas to fix software bugs or to request new features. By examining idea quality (measured by vote) and idea submission in idea crowdsourcing platforms for NPD, we aim to enrich our understanding of these contexts. Furthermore, we review the literature from two perspectives: individuals&#39; own experiences (past performance) and the experiences of others (interaction with peers&#39; ideas) and identify several key gaps in the literature. Using data from a pioneer innovation community for NPD, we find an inverted U-shape association between users&#39; past performance (in terms of average quality of past ideas) and idea quality and idea submission. Additionally, interaction with peers&#39; ideas (in terms of quantity and intensity) positively influences idea submission but does not impact idea quality. A complementary relationship between own experience and others&#39; experiences was also not found. The findings provide new insights into idea crowdsourcing platforms for NPD and the determinants of individuals&#39; idea submission behavior and idea quality on these platforms which have several implications for practice.},

To overcome these limitations, we ground this research on an exploratory study that captures eye-tracking data during a decision-making task of product selection. Grounded on the dynamic attention theory, we utilize different information types and formats present on a popular social commerce platform, to identify elements which are important when deciding about online product purchase decision. Specifically, we employ a series of prediction algorithms and use an ensemble learning setup to predict the aspects that contribute to product selection by consumers. Our analysis highlights the most important informational cues to accurately predict product selection among alternatives. In addition, the results showcase how such elements shift in importance during the temporal sequence of comparing different product alternatives. Our results provide insight into how we can understand the journey of decision-making for social commerce customers when navigating through information to select a product. In addition, it opens the discussion about the shifts that eye-tracking in combination with machine learning can create for researchers and marketers .},

However, a high-quality and well-structured dataset with question-paragraph-answer pairs is not usually found in the real world. Furthermore, updating or building an MRC dataset is a challenging and costly affair. To address these shortcomings, we propose a QA system that uses a large-scale English Community Question Answering (CQA) dataset (i.e., Stack Exchange) composed of 3,081,834 question-answer pairs. The QA system adopts a classifier-retriever-summarizer structure design. The question classifier and the answer retriever part are based on a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Natural Language Processing (NLP) model by Google, and the summarizer part introduces a deep learning-based Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model to summarize the long answers. We instantiated the proposed QA system with 140 topics from the CQA dataset (including topics such as biology, law, politics, etc.) and conducted human and automatic evaluations. Our system presented encouraging results, considering that it provides high-quality answers to the questions in the test set and satisfied the requirements to develop a QA system without MRC datasets. Our results show the potential of building automatic and high-performance QA systems without being limited by man-made datasets, a significant step forward in the research of open-domain or specific-domain QA systems.},

  abstract     = {Fraud detection is to identify, monitor, and prevent potentially fraudulent activities from complex data. The recent development and success in AI , especially machine learning , provides a new data-driven way to deal with fraud. From a methodological point of view, machine learning based fraud detection can be divided into two categories, i.e., conventional methods (decision tree, tree boosting methods, etc.) and deep learning , both of which have significant limitations in terms of the lack of representation learning ability for the former and interpretability for the latter. Furthermore, due to the rarity of detected fraud cases, the associated data is usually imbalanced, which seriously degrades the performance of classification algorithms . In this paper, we propose deep boosting decision trees (DBDT), a novel approach for fraud detection based on gradient boosting and neural networks . In order to combine the advantages of both conventional methods and deep learning , we first construct soft decision tree (SDT), a decision tree structured model with neural networks as its nodes, and then ensemble SDTs using the idea of gradient boosting. In this way we embed neural networks into gradient boosting to improve its representation learning capability and meanwhile maintain the interpretability. Furthermore, aiming at the rarity of detected fraud cases, in the model training phase we propose a compositional AUC maximization approach to deal with data imbalances at algorithm level. Extensive experiments on several real-life fraud detection datasets show that DBDT can significantly improve the performance and meanwhile maintain good interpretability.

Its unique on-demand features affect consumers&#39; shopping behaviors . This study uses a difference-in-difference approach with propensity score matching and machine learning approaches to examine the impact of a new giant online-to-offline entrant on consumers&#39; ordering and spending behavior. We find that overall, the new entrant has a negative impact on consumers&#39; ordering and spending from the perspective of existing providers. This negative impact is amplified if the consumers are highly engaged on the platform. However, the new entrant effect is reduced if the providers use in-house rather than outsourced deliverymen or consumers have a relatively long distance from the new entrant. Furthermore, the new entrant effect is altered if the platform implements technological innovation. On a provider level, the new entrant has a direct negative impact on consumers&#39; ordering and spending from homogenous providers; however, a positive spillover effect is observed in terms of increasing consumers&#39; spending on heterogeneous providers. The direct effect occurs immediately, while the spillover effect appears in a time-lagged pattern. On a product level, we find that the new entrant negatively affects consumers&#39; ordering and spending on substitute products also sold by the new entrant, but that their spending on non-substitute products is boosted. Our findings provide decision support for the new entrant and existing providers to expand the market to stimulate consumers&#39; purchase from both, to enhance their financial performance.},

  abstract     = {Online reviews affect consumer purchase decisions and become prevalent in different sectors. Platforms elicit useful reviews by allowing consumers to vote for helpfulness. The link between review features and review helpfulness hence has been a topic of broad interest in information systems (IS) and Internet commerce. Psychological science studies show that expressed emotions in information – valence and arousal significantly influence receivers&#39; engagement and valuation. Unlike valence (negative or positive) that is widely-analyzed, emotional arousal is a less-studied attribute of online reviews. This study presents a careful account of the nonlinear link between emotional arousal and review helpfulness. Following a rigorous procedure of theorizing and testing nonlinear relationships (Haans et al. 2016), we articulate latent mechanisms leading to an inverted U-shaped association and how valence would moderate the nonlinear effect of review arousal. We analyze reviews on experience goods from Yelp.com and find firm support for our hypotheses. The findings are triangulated using reviews on search goods from Amazon.com . While the nonlinear effect of review arousal and interactions with review valence are robust to both types of goods, an alternative moderation path of review valence on the inverted U-shaped relationship is observed. Our empirical study contributes to the literature by shedding lights on the dynamics among arousal, valence, review helpfulness, and product types, which illustrates a prototypical example to IS/e-commerce scholars on rigorously conceptualizing and estimating U-shaped links as well as their moderations.},

The platform decides the intensity of regulation measures to be implemented on its content, and the government decides to enforce either direct or indirect regulation on platform content. The main result is that the platform&#39;s regulation strategy depends on the relationship between the loss and fine caused by adverse social events and the cost to improve regulation intensity. We find that the optimal regulation strategy of the government depends largely on the potential probability occurrence of adverse social events and the efficiency of direct regulation. Competition prompts platforms to reduce regulation intensity, and counterintuitively, platform users can benefit from fierce competition. However, weak competition may result in lower consumer surplus in a duopoly market than in a monopoly market. In a duopoly market with greatly disparate intrinsic values of two platforms, the government can appropriately relax regulations.},

  abstract     = {In most practical prediction problems, such as regression and classification, the different types of prediction errors are not equally costly in the decision-making process. Although there exist numerous real-world cost-sensitive regression problems, ranging from loan charge-off forecasting to house price predictions, the literature on cost-sensitive learning mainly focuses on classification and only a few solutions are proposed for regression problems. These regressions are typically characterized by an asymmetric cost structure, where over- and underpredictions of a similar magnitude face vastly different costs. In this paper, we present a one-step boosting method (OSB) for cost-sensitive regression. The proposed methodology leverages a secondary learner to incorporate cost-sensitivity into an already trained cost-insensitive regression model. The secondary learner is defined as a linear function of certain variables deemed interesting for cost-sensitivity. These variables do not necessarily need to be the same as in the already trained model. An efficient optimization algorithm is achieved through iteratively reweighted least squares using the asymmetric cost function . The obtained results become interpretable through bootstrapping, enabling decision makers to distinguish important variables for cost-sensitivity as well as facilitating statistical inference . Applying different cost functions and various initial cost-insensitive learning methods on several public datasets consistently yields a significant reduction in the average misprediction cost, illustrating the excellent performance of our approach.},

In addition, we assert that the predictive model&#39;s effectiveness is different for consumers depending on their variety-seeking tendencies in music. We compared our predictive model to benchmark models and demonstrated that our proposed model is superior in predicting users&#39; download behavior. We also found that the overall predictive performance is higher for active variety seekers who consume diverse types of music via streaming. We provide some evidence that this may be due to differences in the degree to which the two groups are influenced by different types of media promotions. The results suggest that considering psychological characteristics such as variety-seeking tendencies provides more advantages in prediction and recommendation systems, which opens new avenues for improvement.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing digitalization of health data, patients need to make informed decisions about the online sharing of their protected health information . This necessitates a robust technical infrastructure that enables patients to self-manage consent and the trusted exchange of this information across sharing entities. Unfortunately, current health information exchange systems in the U.S. are limited in both these regards. While there is recent work on digital patient consent management, there is limited work that provides effective solutions for patient self-management of consent . Further, interoperability issues in the way health information exchanges are currently architected and differences in regulations across localities exacerbate the challenges of consent management. In this research, we survey potential patients&#39; willingness to self-manage healthcare-related consent. Having established the desire for consent self-management, we propose a solution that enables the seamless sharing of patient consent across different healthcare providers and health information exchanges. Specifically, we use a rigorous design science approach to create a blockchain-based, self-managed patient consent system and we evaluate the design through an instantiated prototype. The results of our study should be useful to researchers in healthcare information management as well as to practitioners designing consent management systems .

  abstract     = {Advances in and increased access to mobile technology have prompted businesses to embrace gamified applications, particularly to enhance customer engagement . Thus, it is important to highlight not only the antecedents and consequences of customer engagement but also the critical role of gamification . This study aims to examine the causal relationships among brand identification, self-expressiveness, brand love, gamification , customer engagement, brand experience, and repurchase intention in the context of Nike Run Club, a gamified running app available at the Apple and Google Play stores. It also explores the mediating effect of consumer engagement on the association that brand love and gamification have with brand experience and repurchase intention. Additionally, it analyzes the moderating effects of gamification on the relationship between brand love and customer engagement. The hypotheses are empirically tested by analyzing data collected from 526 respondents on a Nike Run Club app. Results confirm that both brand identification and self-expressiveness significantly and positively influence brand love, which in turn significantly and positively affects customer engagement and, subsequently, brand experience and repurchase intention. Further, this study demonstrates that customer engagement acts as a mediator to improve brand experience and to motivate the customer to repurchase the brand. In addition to showing the impact of gamification on brand love, brand experience, and repurchase intention, this study reveals the moderating effect of gamification on the relationship between brand love and customer engagement. These findings offer deeper insights into brand identification, self-expressiveness, and gamification as significant influencing factors, which can be helpful to brand managers in enhancing brand love and customer engagement. Additionally, this study demonstrates that gamification is the most effective approach to increasing brand love, strengthening customer engagement, and improving brand experiences and repurchase intention.},

Popular end-to-end approaches tend to capture spurious correlations in historical data , whereas two-stage approaches that decompose time series and make separate predictions often result in error accumulation. To address these issues, we propose PoissonGP, a novel Bayesian model that employs a non-homogeneous Poisson process with a Gaussian process prior for sales prediction. PoissonGP can capture complex patterns in data with multiple trends and manage distribution shifts caused by changes in long-run sales. Additionally, it incorporates forecast uncertainty and provides interpretability for building efficient and visual decision support systems . Experimental results on several synthetic and empirical datasets suggest that PoissonGP outperforms existing approaches, making it a promising tool for e-commerce platforms.},

We apply these measures to a unique dataset from a leading mobile product information app that includes &gt;13 million search sessions from 2.5 million consumers searching for 1.8 million different products. Our findings show that store distance and store density significantly influence consumers&#39; mobile search behavior: detailed searches for product-specific attributes (search depth) increase as store distance decreases and store density increases, while the number of jointly searched products within the same category (search breadth) increases as store distance and density increase. We also find that durable products weaken the main effects of store distance and density on search depth but strengthen it for search breadth. These results provide insights for offline retailers to better understand location-specific consumer demands and improve their mobile in-app targeting and product assortment decisions.},

However, existing research primarily examines the effects of a single social network relation or several social network relations separately, without applying a holistic approach to investigate the joint effect of multiple social network relations on ECT use. Drawing on a novel technique of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and social network analysis , this study explores how multiple social network relations (i.e., advice, friendship, and communication) collectively influence ECT use. Using multi-source data from 178 employees in the human resources department of a global technology company, we identify several configurations of multiple social network relations associated with high ECT use and low ECT use. Our findings indicate that a single social network relation is insufficient to explain ECT use and should be considered alongside other social network relations. Overall, this study provides an integrative framework to unpack the complex and contingent effects of multiple social network relations on ECT use.},

Thus, gig workers experience difficulty in addressing hardships related to gig work. To this end, we must determine how gig platforms build a governance environment that matches gig workers to help them craft gig work. However, extant studies have remained in the qualitative research surface, lacked a certain empirical insight, and have not clarified the direction to creating an effective platform governance model. Thus, based on such literature, we first conceptualize platform formalization governance. Drawing on person-environment fit theory, the PLS-SEM analysis of 290 data from gig workers finds that platform formalization governance directly promotes gig workers&#39; job crafting and indirectly propels it by improving performance appraisal systems&#39; transparency. However, platform work insecurity climate weakens such an direct/indirect positive relationship . These findings contribute to strategic values and effectiveness of the governance model of gig platform ecosystems, thus balancing interests between gig platforms, gig workers, and customers. Gig platforms should consider appropriately formalizing the current governance model and improving work insecurity climate, which helps gig workers more easily address hardships associated with platform work through job crafting.},

The present investigation proposes a new approach to identify a set of non-dominated neural network models for further selection by the decision-maker. A new co-evolution approach is proposed to simultaneously select the features and topology of neural networks (collectively referred to as neural architecture ), where the features are viewed from a topological perspective as input neurons. Further, the co-evolution is posed as a multi-criteria problem to evolve sparse and efficacious neural architectures. The well-known dominance and decomposition based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are augmented with a non-geometric crossover operator to diversify and balance the search for neural architectures across conflicting criteria. Moreover, the co-evolution is augmented to accommodate the data-based implications of distinct market behaviors prior to and during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A detailed comparative evaluation is carried out with the conventional sequential approach of feature selection followed by neural topology design, as well as a scalarized co-evolution approach. The results on three market indices (NASDAQ, NYSE, and S&amp;P500) in pre- and peri- COVID time windows convincingly demonstrate that the proposed co-evolution approach can evolve a set of non-dominated neural forecasting models with better generalization capabilities.},

Showrooming takes place when consumers visit the B&amp;M retailer to resolve product fit uncertainty first and then buy the best-fit products at the online retailer. In terms of mitigating the showrooming effect, we examine a promotion strategy with which the B&amp;M retailer acquires consumer information from data brokers and makes a promotional offering to a targeted segment of traceable consumers, and investigate how the B&amp;M retailer can benefit from this promotion strategy via a two-stage game-theoretical framework. We show that there is a threshold for the number of traceable consumers above which the promotion strategy begins to benefit the B&amp;M retailer. When in the B&amp;M retailer’s best interest, there exist two equilibria: one in which some traceable consumers showroom and the other in which no traceable consumers showroom. Less showrooming always takes place in the former equilibrium but more showrooming could occur in the latter equilibrium, as compared to the non-promotion strategy. Furthermore, a higher level of product fit uncertainty increases the B&amp;M retailer’s demand and profit while inducing more showrooming in the latter equilibrium. Thus, showrooming driven by product fit uncertainty could leave the B&amp;M retailer better off under the promotion strategy.},

  abstract     = {Livestream e-commerce has been developing at a tremendous pace in recent years. On livestream platforms, such as Douyin, a retailer attracts viewers into the live room through short video advertising, and then streamers promote and sell products in real time. In such a scenario, an accurate prediction of traffic and sales plays an essential role in operation management , including live content strategy and inventory control. However, complex behaviors (follow, share, comment, etc.) of users and long conversion paths (from seeing the advertisement to entering the live room, and to purchasing the goods) lead to poor performance of traditional prediction methods. Additionally, few studies focus on advertising information in evaluating live room performance. Therefore, we propose a two-stage learning model for traffic and sales prediction based on behavior mining, which combines marketing models and deep learning methods. In the first stage, we integrate user behaviors before getting into the live room with short video advertising data for traffic prediction . In the second stage, based on the traditional marketing model, AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action), we design a funnel convolutional neural network (FCNN) to learn sophisticated behaviors in the live room in both time and behavior orientations, and take the predicted traffic volume as the auxiliary information for sales prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from Douyin illustrate the efficacy of our proposed method, which shows the value of fusing marketing models with deep learning techniques. Furthermore, the in-depth analysis provides practical insights into user behaviors for livestream e-commerce.},

  abstract     = {With data being generated at an unprecedented rate, monetizing data has become a paramount issue in this era of the digital economy. Firms have traditionally leveraged consumer data to improve their product or service offerings and increase their sales revenue, which is indirect data monetization. The recent emergence of online data markets and the data brokerage industry have facilitated direct data monetization, enabling firms to obtain additional revenue by selling their anonymized data directly to data brokers. This study develops a game-theoretic model to investigate the impact of direct data monetization on competition between firms. Our results show that in equilibrium, high-value firms with competitive advantages in product or service value often sell less data than low-value firms, implying that high-value firms rely less on direct data monetization than low-value firms. Surprisingly, as direct data monetization prevails, high-value firms further dominate the market for selling products or services, especially when the data broker&#39;s analytics capability is high. This result reveals that data brokers with high analytics capabilities can hinder, rather than facilitate, market competition. Finally, direct data monetization may benefit both consumer surplus and social welfare because it facilitates data-sharing between firms, allowing firms to obtain additional insights to improve their product or service offerings. These findings are explored in-depth, along with different model extensions and their relevant managerial implications.},

  abstract     = {With the explosion in the number of mobile applications, it becomes difficult and time-consuming for users to find the most suitable and interesting application from the millions of applications that exist today. Therefore, mobile app recommendation becomes a top priority to help people solve this problem. In previous studies, there are two common methods to solve this problem, one is to apply matrix factorization to the rating data to predict the target user&#39;s ratings for other applications, and the other is to predict ratings based on the user&#39;s review text. In addition to combining the above two traditional methods, this study also combines deep learning methods to generate better models. For rating data, we use a deep matrix factorization method to obtain latent factor vectors of users and items from the rating matrix to improve the embedding of ratings. For review text, we improve the text representation by using a multi-embedding approach. Most importantly, our model also incorporates deep neural networks with nonlinear transformation capabilities to extract more representative abstract features. We conduct experiments on datasets collected from the real world. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method has better performance than other existing methods.},

This paper measures consumers&#39; valuation of two types of personal information—personally identifiable information (PII) and non-PII, with the willing-to-accept (WTA) payoffs using a multi-study mixed-methods approach. We conducted two realistic auction experiments with 150 and 415 participants, respectively, as well as one interview study with 31 participants and a meta-analysis study to explain international differences in WTA prices between China and other countries. We found that while consumers claimed that PII was more valuable than non-PII in the interview study, they did not demand a higher WTA price when monetizing PII in the two experimental studies. However, consumers became more cautious and provided fewer data items when dealing with PII, compared to non-PII. Consumers may ask for a higher price for non-PII than PII when they need to disclose more information. They also strategically select information being disclosed, if possible, to reduce privacy risk. Context only matters in WTA price for certain types of data, which is medical PII data in our case. Specifically, the WTA price for PII is higher in the medical information context than in the shopping information context. The meta-analysis shows that individualism and uncertainty avoidance are two key cultural dimensions explaining international differences in WTA prices.},

This research investigates how the reward–product congruity of nonmonetary rewards influences consumers&#39; recommendation intention in online RRPs. Specifically, drawing on the theories of congruity fit and schema congruity, we propose that nonmonetary rewards with moderate congruity trigger consumers&#39; recommendation intention in RRPs more than those with high and low congruity. Moreover, this inverted U-shaped relationship is moderated by factors that influence the individual cognitive state (i.e., need for cognition and utilitarian versus hedonic products). An experiment with a 3 (reward–product congruity: high/moderate/low) × 2 (product type: utilitarian app/hedonic app) mixed factorial design was conducted to test our hypotheses. The results largely support our propositions. First, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between reward–product congruity and recommendation intention and a mediated effect of reward attractiveness. Furthermore, need for cognition moderates the effects of reward–product congruity on recommendation intention, and there is a three-way interaction effect among product type, need for cognition, and reward–product congruity. We also discuss the important theoretical and practical implications of our findings.},

Trust antecedents have been extensively researched and categorized into argument quality and source credibility . However, there is still a need to investigate how their help for consumers differs across national cultures. Furthermore, while a profile photo has been found to enhance the helpfulness of a review by improving source credibility, little is known about how consumers perceive user appearance in a review picture and no research has compared these two types of visual information. To bridge these gaps, we examine how trust antecedents and visual information help consumers&#39; decision making differently across national cultures, using reviews collected from Amazon in the US and Germany, respectively. Our results show that information quality is more helpful for consumers in an individualistic and low uncertainty avoidance culture, whereas source credibility is more valued in the opposite culture. Interestingly, the effects of the two types of visual information, user appearance in a profile photo versus in a review picture, also differ across cultures. This research contributes to the online review literature by introducing visual information and national culture with new perspectives of trust. Our findings suggest that multinational e-commerce businesses adopt culture-specific strategies in review systems to better help consumers make informed purchase decisions.},

  abstract     = {Many social interactions rely on the premise of mutual trust, but deception violates trust and poses risk. Empirically examining trust and deception, particularly in high-stakes situations, is challenging but essential for improving the research realism and generalizability. To address this difficulty, we study trusting and deceptive behaviors in a high-stakes situation by using a novel dataset created from an American game show, Friend or Foe (FoF). In the show, a contestant&#39;s reward was determined through a trust game modified from the prisoner&#39;s dilemma. We explore how numerous human behaviors including facial expressions, gaze, head pose, body motion, language, and socio-demographic attributes, were related to a contestant&#39;s trusting or deceptive decision. Using a data-driven approach, we find that the deceivers&#39; (contestants who chose Foe ) behavior featured a neutralized face, negative facial emotions, enhanced upper body motion, and language with a lower sense of immediacy and agreeableness. The contestants who chose to trust (chose Friend ) exhibited opposite behavioral patterns. Socio-demographic factors such as age, height, and facial attractiveness were also associated with a contestant&#39;s choice. Combining multimodal information, machine learning classifiers could predict the contestant&#39;s choice with an accuracy about 25% greater than earlier reported human accuracy. We contribute to both trust and deception literature by examining the generalizability of trusting and deceptive behaviors to a new high-stakes scenario. We also add to the decision support literature by showing the superior predictive performances of combining behavioral and socio-demographic features. Furthermore, we contribute to the academic community by introducing the FoF dataset.},

  abstract     = {The number of reliable samples obtained in early decision-making activity is usually relatively small. Due to variable distribution and incomplete structure of tiny datasets, it is challenging to create reliable and robust predictive modeling using classic statistical and machine learning models in small sample settings. The virtual sample generation (VSG) technique improves model learning accuracies for minimal datasets across diverse applications. Virtual samples on independent variables were generated using established VSG methods predicated on the assumption of a probability distribution or a membership function to fill data gaps. However, in the actual world, non-linear function interactions between variables are common. To address this issue, this paper developed a novel VSG method called Dual-VSG, which generates non-linear interpolation virtual samples using a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework to improve learning performance on small datasets. We generated non-linear interpolation virtual samples without labels by estimating non-linear functions and transforming them into a high-dimensional space using the proposed dual-net model. The weights of the dual-net model are transferred to a downstream task to generate virtual sample labels. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested strategy, this research employed five datasets. On the Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN) predictive model , we compared the suggested method&#39;s prediction performance to two state-of-the-art VSG approaches. To assess prediction performance on a regression dataset, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are used. Furthermore, the classification accuracy (ACC) and the Fl measure are used to assess classification capability on classification datasets. In addition, the paired t -test was utilized to see if the suggested Dual-VSG approach differed significantly from the other VSG methods in terms of RMSE, MAPE, accuracy (ACC), or F1 score. For short datasets, the suggested Dual-VSG method outperforms those VSG methods, according to our experimental results.},

This research addresses the central challenge of setting strategic intervention plans for these families considering their multiple levels of vulnerability and the limited government resources available to address them. The paper builds on the framework for analytical CZRM to prototype and build a tool that analyzes data about income, nutrition, and housing for over 34,000 low-income families in Ceará, Brazil. Each family is assigned a vulnerability score, which is then used to filter public policy recommendations that address specific vulnerability profiles. The CZRM derives from over one year of interaction with government stakeholders who expressed their needs. Further software validation was completed with a series of test cases which ensured the tool was working and showing accurate results. The interactive mapping, ranking and filtering tool exemplifies an emerging decision support system to build a citizen portfolio and to set strategies to provide public services to different citizen groups.},

Previous studies on product returns have mainly focused on traditional e-commerce, with few studies considering signals in unstructured data formats . The main contribution of our research is the design of a multimodal analytics framework to predict product returns in live streaming e-commerce settings. Multimodal features (e.g., visual, textual, and acoustic) and their correlations extracted from different data sources (product descriptions and live streaming records) are considered in our prediction model. In addition, to better study the impact of anchor speech during live streaming, we propose an acoustic feature extraction model called “OpenTransformer,” which extracts acoustic features of anchor audio and outperforms baselines. We have conducted experiments based on a real-world dataset collected from Taobao live streaming. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using multimodal signals from products and anchors for product return prediction. The managerial implications of our research are that live streaming platforms and potential consumers can prejudge which sold products will have high return rates in a timely fashion , and based on these predictions, merchants and anchors can better design their product descriptions and speech behaviors. This study thus supports more effective development of live streaming e-commerce markets.},

To support decision-makers with timely information, we utilize data from online social networks to propose an adaptable information extraction solution to create indices helping to forecast COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalization rates. We show that combining heterogeneous data sources like Twitter and Reddit can leverage these sources&#39; inherent complementarity and yield better predictions than those using a single data source alone. We further show that the predictions run ahead of the official COVID-19 incidences by up to 14 days.

  abstract     = {The issue of harnessing machine learning (ML) algorithms for the prediction of adverse medical events is important considering the prevalence of vast repositories of patient-level medical data, and the quest to reduce healthcare costs while elevating the quality of care. Of particular interest is identifying a set of features that can better predict the risk of unplanned readmissions of chronically ill patients within 30 days post discharge, among them patients with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). While numerous studies have employed ML algorithms to identify sets of significant features, only a handful have compared features extracted by various methods, and even fewer have compared the predictive power of feature sets selected by human experts to those selected by ML. Hence, this research aimed to elicit a comprehensive feature set selected by four ML algorithms and compare its predictive performance to that of a feature set selected by experts. We then evaluated a merged list of the two feature sets, constructing a human-machine collaborative set to predict the likelihood of 30-day unplanned readmission of CHF patients using data on 10,763 CHF patients hospitalized during the years 2010–2017. Our models achieved Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) above 0.8 and an Accuracy of ∼0.89, comparable to the best models in the extant literature. Moreover, the Human-Machine Collaborative model significantly outperformed (best AUC 0.836) other human-only selected models as well as the machine-selected set.

  abstract     = {Websites that allow consumers to post online reviews often allow others to signal the value of the reviews by voting for them as being helpful (i.e., an upvote) or unhelpful (i.e., a downvote). Although a review&#39;s content should drive votes, herd behavior may also be operative if consumers discount their own judgments of the review based on signals others provide. Using a field study of online product reviews from Amazon, a longitudinal experiment, and two cross-sectional experiments, we find evidence for herd behavior: consumers&#39; voting decisions and intentions are influenced by others&#39; votes. However, this effect is complex with multiple moderating factors, including consumer involvement, review valence, and review diagnosticity. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for reducing the potential negative effects of herd behavior in the context of online reviews.},

  abstract     = {The introduction of consumer-initiated models with small group size has increased the popularity of group buying. With lower size requirements for forming buying groups, more impulsive buying is facilitated while more postpurchase regret is spawned. Consumer postpurchase regret not only poses challenges to the coordination of group buying but may also eventually lead to merchant losses. Therefore, understanding the factors that may affect consumer postpurchase regret in group-buying contexts is crucial. Drawing on observational learning theory and expectancy disconfirmation theory, the present study focuses on how the response speeds of group-buying campaign coparticipants intertwined with publicly available information of group-buying deals (i.e., the deal popularity and expected savings) to affect campaign initiators&#39; postpurchase regret. Through secondary data analysis and a laboratory experiment, we find that a lower coparticipant response speed is associated with a higher likelihood of the initiator experiencing postpurchase regret. In addition, when deals have a higher level of popularity, this effect is amplified. Our findings demonstrate the potential importance of considering the coparticipant effect to discourage negative consumer behavior in group-buying contexts.},

This ever-expanding visualization toolset has outrun the development of theories of data visualization usage for decision support. In the current research, we contribute to the development of visualization theories in two ways. First, we incorporate our understanding of evolutionary adaptations into the cognitive fit theory to explain why 3-D surface graphs often outperform traditional 2-D graphs in various sensemaking tasks. Drawing on geon theory to interpret the 3-D advantage, we develop the concept of geonic/non-geonic information representations and tasks. We tested and found support for our hypotheses that geonic representations have a speed advantage for the tasks we studied, derived from the human evolved capacity for geographic orienteering, but accuracy depends on the match of representation and task, as geonic or non-geonic. Our experiment compared the geonic representation (3-D surface graph) to non-geonic planar representations (cluster bar, heat map , and line) in geonic (integration, proportion) and non-geonic atomic (acquisition, comparison) tasks. For our second contribution, we build on this result to expand the cognitive fit model to incorporate classic human information processes and evolutionary adaptations. We suggest that the cognitive fit model can expand to include new advances in neuroscience . We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our experiment and our expanded model.},

  abstract     = {E-learning platforms have increasingly been adopted by corporate employees in the workplace. On these platforms, users typically follow a two-stage decision-making process: they first choose which content to learn and then decide how much to continue learning. The decisions of individual employee users are influenced by members of the same workplace organization (group influence) and general users on the platform from other organizations (mass influence). Extant research has not shown how different types of social influence impact different decisions. Using data from a corporate e-learning platform, this study examines how group influence and mass influence support employees&#39; learning decisions, from the perspective of the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). The results reveal that mass users&#39; past choices only influence low-elaborative choice decisions but not high-elaborative engagement decisions. In contrast, workgroup members&#39; past choices influence both the low-elaborative choice and high-elaborative engagement decisions. Furthermore, positive synergy exists between the two types of social influence for the choice decision, but the synergy dissipates for the engagement decision. These findings can help online content platforms design appropriate information-sharing systems to influence users&#39; choice and engagement decisions. The results can also help corporates take advantage of social influence to motivate employees to engage in work-related online learning.},

The result reveals the need to continuously identify tactics embedded in fraudulent email content to understand why users still fall prey to phishing attacks . Using the literature as a backdrop, we identify and conceptualize a thematic dimensional framework of fraudulent phishing attacks. This study uses benchmark datasets of fraudulent email to empirically validate the proposed dimensional framework. Specifically, a combination of machine learning-based content analysis and topic modeling found a majority of the discovered topics were labeled against the proposed dimensions. Statistical analysis was employed to provide empirical evidence of the thematic dimensions of fraudulent email attacks. This study thus, not only extends the cybersecurity literature by identifying and validating eight dimensions that enrich our understanding of phishing and attack identification but stimulates cumulative research endeavors to develop yet more comprehensive dimensional frameworks of phishing email attacks .},

Through two online experiments, we investigate the effects of providing a simple source-evaluation flag or a flag with more detailed supporting information explaining the evaluation. We found that negative flags from expert fact-checkers reduced users&#39; beliefs, and supporting information had no additional effect; in contrast, positive flags required information beyond the simple flag to have maximum effectiveness. Positive and negative crowd-sourced information had similar effects but was weaker than evaluations from experts.

A novel multi-criteria framework, including fuzzy Schweizer-Sklar norms based on the Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) to assess the metaverse integration alternatives, is developed. To rank the alternatives, non-linear processing of information based on the fuzzy Schweizer-Sklar weight assessment method (SWAS) is proposed. A case study is developed to provide a foundation for the experts&#39; evaluations using twelve criteria, which are organized into four aspects namely, economic, user, operational, and advancement.

  abstract     = {As globalization drives more firms toward cross-border e-commerce (CBEC), a well-designed decision support system becomes crucial to gain a competitive edge in the international market. Product images, a vital aspect of the system interface, play a significant role in shaping users&#39; first impressions, facilitating seller-buyer information interaction, and ultimately enhancing users&#39; decisions making in the system. Across a series of studies, this research investigates the effect of cultural differences (thinking style: holistic vs. analytic) on image background and reveals the underlying mechanism. Results show that online consumers from cultures characterized by holistic thinking style (Chinese sample) are more prone to purchase products presented with contextual backgrounds than those with white backgrounds, while this effect is absent for online consumers from cultures that tend to think in an analytic way (American sample). This effect is also observed when the thinking style is primed within the culture in separate samples from the United States and China. Study 3 employs eye-tracking technology and shows that holistic thinking, compared to analytic thinking, results in an asymmetry in cognitive effort to purchase the same products framed with contextual and white background images. Specifically, contextual (vs. white) background information greatly assists holistic thinking consumers in understanding the product, enabling them to spend less cognitive effort on product information processing . Instead, the cognitive effort that analytic thinking consumers spare in the product information is not affected by the background. Finally, we discuss theoretical contributions and practical insights for CBEC retailers and system designers that the findings indicate.},

  abstract     = {Internet users frequently encounter diverse data requests, and their privacy disclosure decisions have attracted massive practical and scholarly attention. Nevertheless, how the accumulation of users&#39; disclosure-related experiences influences their future privacy disclosure decisions is still under-explored. In this paper, we theoretically derive and examine the impacts of two types of disclosure-related experiences— privacy disclosure and privacy invasion experiences . These experiences respectively represent user experiences in the participation and feedback stages of privacy disclosure events. We draw on the systematic-heuristic model of information processing and the privacy calculus model to raise the core speculation that users&#39; disclosure-related experiences exert multiple forms of effects on their privacy disclosure decisions through multiple theoretical routes (i.e., polymorphic experience effects ). To test this speculation, we conducted two online survey studies ( N = 485, N = 324) and yielded three major findings: (1) users&#39; privacy disclosure experiences can promote their information disclosure intentions through direct and mediation routes (i.e., habituation effects ); (2) users&#39; privacy invasion experiences can deter their information disclosure intentions through mediation and moderation routes, yet the latter varied across the investigated contexts (i.e., vigilance effects ); (3) the moderating role of privacy disclosure experiences and the directly influencing role of privacy invasion experiences were largely insignificant. Our research reveals the polymorphic impacts of disclosure-related experiences on Internet users&#39; privacy disclosure decisions and lays the foundation for future theoretical and practical work.},

  abstract     = {Online dating has transformed the way people meet and start relationships. However, online dating platforms typically have many lurkers without active participation. Using a self-regulation framework, this paper aims to study users&#39; active participation in online dating through a mixed methods study. We first conducted qualitative and quantitative investigations with a machine learning method to explore user active participation and its antecedents. We then developed a theoretical model and conducted a statistical analysis of the model. The empirical findings showed that service quality and trust significantly affected individual active participation in a dating site through attachments to the daters and services. The findings of the study contribute to the extant literature by analyzing user participation in online dating from an attachment perspective.},

  abstract     = {Reliable hotel cancellation prediction can help establish appropriate operational strategies for hotel management. In this sector, personal name records (PNR) data may be the most representative information source for prediction tasks. Despite the popularity of PNR, its inherent lack of availability has been commonly disregarded in the literature. Existing studies have directly input PNR into high-dimensional machine learning (ML) models to achieve cancellation predictions. Another type of model generates cancellation prediction based on the probability modeling of samples. In this study, we propose an interpretable feature interaction method to enrich the existing PNR information. Thereafter, we empirically assess the prediction performance of the two model classes. This study specifically determines whether or not the two methods can cross-fertilize each other to improve cancellation prediction. To do so, we propose a model integrating Bayesian networks (BNs) and Lasso regression for this prediction task. This study utilizes BNs for the probability model consistent with our correlated variables and dichotomous prediction setting. Moreover, we use a linear ML model (i.e., Lasso regression), given its advantages in reducing ineffective predictors and transparency for ranking feature importance. Empirical results show that the proposed integration model has better prediction performance, and the obtained BN estimators and interactive features are the most important predictors. This study contributes to the booking cancellation literature by proposing an interpretable feature interaction and a prediction method integrating two types of effective models. The obtained accurate and interpretable cancellation prediction further contributes to offering practical implications to hoteliers in managerial decision-making.},

We further use a unique dataset collected from an online B2B E -commence platform to validate our findings. We discover that at a low CFPC level, increased SFPC leads to fewer seller-posted products on the platform and crowds out third-party sellers, making the platform a more concentrated market. When the CFPC level is high, third-party sellers&#39; responses to increased SFPC turn the opposite: they fight back by posting more products on the platform. Consequently, the market becomes less concentrated and more competitive. To our knowledge, this study is among the first to explore the strategic use of SFPC and its influence on market concentration at different CFPC levels in the context of B2B E -commerce platforms.},

These platforms are also dynamic, with shows or discussions changing quickly inside a room and users frequently switching between rooms. To improve user engagement and experience on such platforms, we design a new recommendation model named D ynamic R epresentations for L iv e Str e aming R ooms (DRIVER) to provide room recommendations. Guided by the Integrated Framework for Consumer Path Modeling and the social affordance theory, DRIVER infers dynamic representations of live streaming rooms by leveraging users’ behavior paths in entering, staying in, and leaving rooms. One contribution of our model is a new and efficient dynamic learning framework to model instantaneous and ever-changing inter-room relationships by considering individual users’ behavior paths after leaving a room. Also supported by social affordance theory, another methodological novelty of our model is to capture dynamic characteristics of a room by incorporating features of the current audience inside the room. Experiments on real-world datasets from two different types of live streaming platforms demonstrate that DRIVER outperforms state-of-the-art representation learning methods and sequential recommender systems. The proposed method also has implications for recommender system design in other contexts, in which items are characterized by users’ dynamic behavior paths and ongoing social interactions.},

To better analyze product relations and the underlying competitive aspects, we consider consumer limited attention when modeling consumers&#39; preferences and introduce a background aspect to filter out the trivial and maintain the valuable competition-related information in review texts. We validate this approach using a dataset of 785 products reviewed by 15,669 consumers in the auto industry . Based on the empirical experiments, we show that our model can accurately infer high-quality competitive segments and decipher competition-related aspects corresponding to these segments. To highlight differences, we conduct comparisons and find our approach outperforms the benchmark models meaningfully in the literature when predicting consumers&#39; online behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Predicting price trends of cryptocurrencies is a challenging task due to the highly speculative cryptocurrency market . Prior studies mainly investigate predictors such as historical trading data, macroeconomic development, and public interests in cryptocurrencies for price trend prediction while ignoring the predictive role of the relations between cryptocurrencies. In fact, the price movement of a cryptocurrency may be affected by those of other cryptocurrencies, thus, incorporating cryptocurrency interrelations can further improve the prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end model for price trend prediction using long short-term memory (LSTM) and relationwise graph attention network (ReGAT), in which both individual cryptocurrency features and cryptocurrency relations are considered. Specifically, a cryptocurrency network is built by using shared features between cryptocurrencies. Further, LSTM is used to profile sequential patterns of individual cryptocurrency features. To fully extract network features, ReGAT is designed to aggregate information conveyed by different types of relations while automatically differentiating their importance. Finally, the conventional and network features are concatenated to predict the price trend. The effectiveness of LSTM-ReGAT is validated using real-world cryptocurrency market data. The trading simulations for Bitcoin and portfolios reveal that our model obtains the highest profits. Our study provides insightful implications for investment decision support in cryptocurrency market.},

The analysis results of two comprehensive panel datasets from App Store and Google Play suggest that CBF recommendations favor niche items and effectively boost the long tail of the market. Moreover, consistent with signaling theory, relative quality signals provided by recommendation systems can impact consumer decision making process , leading to a spillover of demand.

We develop a novel role-wise attention mechanism to capture the conversational contingency among customers and service agents. Our results reveal that the role-wise attention mechanism is effective for measuring service interaction quality. When the mechanism is combined with a deep-learning model, it outperforms traditional self-attention mechanisms for predicting customer purchases. The area under the curve of the model is 0.85.

This study aims to provide a holistic understanding of gamification effects on mobile payment platform retention. Using a survey dataset from 447 Alipay users and an online scenario experiment of 1022 participants, we find that four gamified artifactual affordances (rewards, competition, feedback, and cooperation) positively affect user retention through the mediation effect of user engagement. Moreover, narrative affordance moderates the relationship between the four gamified artifactual affordances and user engagement.

  abstract     = {Based on the assumption that the success of an organization is largely determined by the knowledge and skills of its employees, human resource (HR) departments invest considerable resources in the employee recruitment process with the aim of selecting the best, most suitable employees. Due to the high cost of the recruitment process along with its high rate of uncertainty, HR recruiters utilize a variety of methods and instruments to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of this process. Thus far, however, neurological methods, in which neurobiological signals from an examined person are analyzed, have not been utilized for this purpose. This study is the first to propose a neuro-based decision support system to classify cognitive functions into levels, whose target is to enrich the information and indications regarding the candidate along the employee recruitment processes. We first measured relevant functional and cognitive abilities of 142 adult participants using traditional computer-based assessment, which included a battery of four tests regarding executive functions and intelligence score , consistent with actual recruitment processes. Second, using electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, which is one of the dominant measurement tools in NeuroIS research, we collected the participants&#39; brain signals by administering a resting state EEG (rsEEG) on each participant. Finally, using advanced machine and deep learning algorithms , we leveraged the collected rsEEG to classify participants&#39; levels of executive functions and intelligence score. Our empirical analyses show encouraging results of up to 72.6% accuracy for the executive functions and up to 71.2% accuracy for the intelligence score. Therefore, this study lays the groundwork for a novel, generic (non-stimuli based) system that supports the current employee recruitment processes, that is based on psychological theories of assessing executive functions. The proposed decision support system could contribute to the development of additional medium of assessing employees remotely which is especially relevant in the current Covid-19 pandemic. While our method aims at classification rather than at explanation, our intriguing findings have the potential to push forward NeuroIS research and practice.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in terms of the number of cases and deaths in men and women in the USA . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the CRC screening compliance rate remains low in the United States. It is even more concerning that the number of cases and deaths due to CRC is increasing in the younger population, for which there is no guideline to get colonoscopy screening. In this paper, we develop a novel network-based model to identify patients under 50 years of age having a high risk of CRC, particularly those who do not have a family history. Our model can help predict which patients are at risk of developing colorectal cancer to aid the practicing primary care physician and gastroenterologist to triage patients into meaningful risk groups to provide accelerated diagnostic steps and care to these patients. The model uses our proposed variables created through comorbidity network matrices obtained from CRC and non-CRC patients as inputs. We used the electronic medical records of thousands of CRC and non-CRC patients to develop and validate the models. Our model for younger patients correctly predicted 73.2% of the patients with future diagnoses with an area under the ROC curve of 0.81. At the 50% sensitivity, the false positive rate was 11.5%. The performance of our model is the highest in the current state-of-the-art. Our proposed variables quantifying the interactions between multiple diseases can also be adapted in future predictions of other diseases in a patient.},

  abstract     = {The cyber security industry is rapidly adopting threat hunting as a proactive tool for early and faster detection of suspected malicious actors . In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method, Unsupervised Hunting of Anomalous Commands (UHAC), to detect text-based anomalous commands in security information and event management (SIEM) logs that are good candidates for threat hunting. A unique feature of the proposed method is that it first creates a feature set based on the augmentation of document-term and document-character matrices. Then, an autoencoder-based detector is trained on this feature set using a custom loss function. UHAC consistently outperforms other feature sets and algorithms such as one-class support vector machine , density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, and word-embedding based models such as word2vec . The UHAC detector identifies 84–89% of anomalies in the top 10% of the data. Findings have implications for cybersecurity analysts who perform threat hunting in SIEM logs for process auditing on endpoint devices .},

Provisioning is important to meet customer needs, and in turn, for customer retention. The service provisioning problem , in addition to being NP-hard, is further compounded by the fact that the timeframe to make provisioning decisions is short, and more importantly, varies considerably across different platform domains. Digital-platform customers often request bundled services and are sensitive to when tasks get completed. We describe a behavioral-economic model of this problem and develop a domain-independent solution featuring a judicious combination of optimization-backed rule-based approach.

The nursing literature suggests that continuity of care helps reduce medical errors and readmissions and increases patient satisfaction. Balancing patient assignments to nursing staff is also critical to avoid overwork and burnout. This study investigates the relationship between continuity of care and workload balance in NPA decisions in hospital inpatient units. We develop an NPA heuristic to guide continuity-care assignment while addressing the trade-off with workload balance. The heuristic prioritizes higher-acuity patients to the objective of continuity of care, while assignment of lower acuity patients seeks to minimize workload imbalance. A discrete event simulation model of an inpatient hospital unit is used to evaluate how the heuristic addresses the tradeoff between the two objectives under distinct work design scenarios. The heuristic enables significant increases in continuity of care for specific patient segments while limiting the impact on workload balance. We discuss implications for theory and managerial practice.},

This difficulty is particularly pronounced for senior IS managers, such as CIOs and IT Vice Presidents, who tend to have scarce time and limited project-related knowledge but are ultimately held accountable for IS project performance. Focusing on this under-researched controller category, the study at hand contributes new insights into the enactment of controls by exploring how IS project uncertainty affects senior IS managers&#39; control-style choices, as well as how it moderates the impact of such choices on process and product performance. Based on a survey of 150 senior IS managers, we find that IS project uncertainty increases managers&#39; use of an authoritative control style but is unrelated to their use of an enabling control style. Further, in IS projects characterized by uncertainty, an authoritative control style is found to be effective for process performance, whereas an enabling style is found to be effective for product performance. Moreover, the results of a post-hoc analysis show that using the two control styles simultaneously under uncertainty delivers no discernible benefits, suggesting a decision-related control dilemma. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Unlike previous research that studied groups performing a single task, here we measure group performance using a test of collective intelligence (CI) that includes a combination of tasks specifically chosen to predict performance on a wide range of other tasks [72]. Our findings suggest that there is a curvilinear relationship between group size and performance and that the optimal group size in online groups is between 25 and 35.

  abstract     = {Financial statement fraud caused by listed companies directly jeopardizes the reliability the financial reporting process . Leveraging multimodal information for financial statement fraud detection (FSFD) has recently become of great interest to academic research and industrial applications. Unfortunately, the predictive ability of multimodal information in FSFD remains largely underexplored, particularly the fusion ambiguity embedded in and among multi-modalities. In this study, we propose a novel attention-based multimodal deep learning method, named RCMA , toward an accurate FSFD. RCMA synthesizes a fine-grained attention mechanism including three innovative attention modules, i.e., ratio-aware attention, chapter-aware attention, and modality-aware attention mechanism. The first two attention mechanisms help to liberate the extraordinary predictive power of the financial modality and the textual modality on FSFD, respectively. Moreover, the proposed modality-aware attention mechanism enables better coordination between the two modalities. Furthermore, to ensure effective learning on the attention-based multimodal embedding, we design a novel loss function named Focal and Consistency Loss, or FCL . It considers class-imbalance and modality-consistency simultaneously, to specialize the optimization of FSFD. The experimental results on the real-world dataset show that the proposed RCMA on FSFD task outperformed the state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, interpretation analysis visualizes the attention weights of different ratio groups, chapters, and modalities from RCMA, and illustrates how these interpretations influence stakeholders&#39; decision process for FSFD.},

Reflecting on this phenomenon, we propose a game-theoretic model to analyze strategic decisions made by a hacker and a defender in equilibrium. In our game model, the hacker launches stealthy cyberattacks for a long time and the defender decides when to disable a suspicious user based on noisy observations of the user’s activities. Damages caused by the hacker can be enormous if the defender does not immediately ban a suspicious user under certain circumstances, which can explain the emerging sophisticated cyberattacks with detrimental consequences. Our model also predicts that the hacker may opt to be behavioral to avoid worst cases. This is because behavioral cyberattacks are less threatening and the defender decides not to immediately block a suspicious user to reduce cost of false detection.},

Therefore, we propose a novel end-to-end framework to detect fake reviewers based on behavior and textual information. It has two key components: (1) a behavior-sensitive feature extractor that learns the underlying patterns of reviewing behavior; (2) a context-aware attention mechanism that extracts valuable features from online reviews. We rigorously evaluate each proposed module and the entire framework against state-of-the-art benchmarks on two real-world datasets from http://Yelp.com . Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on fake reviewer detection.

To preserve data privacy during multi-party collaborative model training, we use additively homomorphic encryption based on the second-order Taylor series expansion of the loss function and its gradient.

Existing triaging methods from primary care to secondary care are labor-intensive processes that involve manually reviewing referral data from multiple sources and can cause long referral to treatment time . There has been no research using machine learning methods that automatically analyzes heterogeneous data including referral letters to recognize regularities to support the primary to secondary care triage. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous data-driven hybrid machine learning model including Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve hospital triage efficiency at the point of triage. The proposed model achieved a precision of 0.83, recall of 0.82, F1-Score of 0.83, accuracy of 0.82, AUC of 0.90 in identifying patients with non-inflammatory conditions (NIC) and inflammatory arthritis (IA) at the point of triage with explainable risk stratifications . Our model is piloted in a real-world trial in a large secondary care hospital in the UK to compare referral accuracy and time saved between our model and clinicians, and evaluate its acceptability by users. Our model achieved precision and recall of 0.83 and 0.81, compared with the precision and recall of 0.80 and 0.78 by clinicians. The research also shows that our model enabled decision support can save clinicians 8 h per week in assessing the referral assessment.

Combining both approaches, it is found that 12 out of 25 topics are either unavailable or only partially available, indicating an information gap. Two topics which constitute the information gap are then utilised to conduct a full factorial experiment on 153 respondents using a Latin Square design. Experimental results demonstrate that adding relevant information improves the physician selection process. Our work contributes to the healthcare IS literature on online physician selection and the role of information availability. The results will help PRWs and hospitals decide how to restructure information on their websites and devise strategies to nudge patients to write reviews highlighting the desired information.},

  abstract     = {Social networks have become important platforms for the marketing and sale of illicit drugs . Hashtags make it easier for users to engage in drug trafficking , further increasing the risk of drug abuse. However, there are significant challenges in the detection and management of drug trafficking activities. In addition, the rapid legalization of some drugs has required a fine-grained classification of drugs to distinguish them from those that are illegal. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, our aim is to develop a methodology using the latest advances in AI technology to classify hashtags from posts advertising illicit drugs for sale on social networks. We present a semi-supervised deep learning approach to classify hashtags from posts advertising illicit drugs. An elegant combination of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) allows us to analyze the characteristics (e.g., shipping region and platform self-regulation) of illegal drug trafficking. Our BERT+GCN model achieved the best performance with more than 75% accuracy compared to the other three baseline models . Then, fine-grained hashtags identified are applied to explore the characteristics of drug trafficking. Finally, we report our results for further exploration of shipping regions and self-regulation of drug trafficking on the platform in two analysis scenarios. Our developed approach has shown its effectiveness in detecting hashtags for different types of drugs from illegal drug sellers. Based on hashtag classification, we also provide two case studies that indicate that (1) there are differences in self-regulation for different types of drugs on social media, (2) there are regional differences in the demand for different types of drugs.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of variable renewable energy increases the significance of reserve markets, which provide energy flexibility to compensate for supply–demand mismatches on short notice. Accordingly, market regulators in different locations have been continuously adopting different mechanisms to attract flexible sources, such as batteries to participate in reserve markets. While these mechanisms are different and sometimes contradictory, there is no consensus on their effectiveness. Therefore, there is a dire need to examine their effectiveness systematically. This paper proposes a model-driven decision support system , focusing on regulators’ perspectives, assisting them in evaluating the effectiveness of different market mechanisms for attracting batteries in reserve electricity markets. We formulate the problem as a stochastic Mixed-Integer-Linear-Program, incorporating practical restrictions and applicable to many electricity markets. As an example, we apply our model to the case of the German electricity market to evaluate some market mechanisms. We find that although some reserve markets do not allow separate bidding in charging and discharging directions (asymmetric bidding), this seems to be an effective mechanism to attract battery operators. When asymmetric bidding is allowed, battery operators often optimally choose to reserve their capacity only in the charging direction and use the discharging direction in energy markets, taking opposite seller/buyer roles in energy and reserve markets. Our results also advocate mechanisms such as remunerating the activated energy and shifting the gate closure closer to the time of operation. In contrast, some existing rewarding mechanisms designed for flexible resources do not seem to be very effective.},

  abstract     = {A key group decision making task is to aggregate individual preferences. Conventional group decision methods adopt pre-defined and fixed strategies to aggregate individuals&#39; preferences, which can be ineffective due to the varying importance and influence of individual group members. Recent studies have proposed to assign different weights to individual members automatically based on the level of consistency of their ratings with group assessment outcomes. However, they ignored the high-order influence relationship among individual group members on group decision making. In this study, from a group recommendation perspective, we propose a novel collaborative Group Embedding and Decision Aggregation (GEDA) approach by leveraging the graph neural network technique to address those limitations. Specifically, GEDA first deploys a graph convolution operation on user-item interaction and group-item interaction graphs to generate embedding representations of members, groups, and items. A novel multi-attention (MA) module then learns each member&#39;s decision weight by simultaneously considering the relationships among members for aggregating individual preferences into group preferences. The empirical evaluation using two real-world datasets demonstrates the advantage of the proposed GEDA model over the state-of-the-art group recommendation models.},

  abstract     = {The over-the-top (OTT) industry has witnessed remarkable growth in recent years with a sharp increase in the number of subscribers, leading to increased competition among OTT platforms to acquire movie rights. Consequently, the gap between the theatrical and OTT releases has been diminishing over the last few years. An early release of a movie on an OTT platform fetches a higher distribution fee for a movie distributor (MD), however, it reduces the MD’s revenue from the theatrical release. Therefore, it becomes critical for the MD to determine the optimal release time and distribution fee combination. In this paper, we analytically solve the MD’s decision problem and provide a detailed analysis of how the optimal release time varies with changes in platform characteristics such as the proportion of ad revenue and the platform’s risk profile, movie characteristics such as success factor and suitability for OTT, and market characteristics such as broadband penetration, piracy rate and customers’ preferences for viewing channels. We compare our results with the actual release times of 243 movies released during 2015–2022. We find that the optimal release time increases with ad revenue proportion, broadband penetration, and piracy rate, whereas the optimal fee reduces non-linearly with release time and depends on OTT’s risk profile. Our findings also indicate that the optimal release time reduces for movies that do not provide any additional utility for theater goers, and as customers’ preference towards OTT increases. Our work provides much-needed guidelines for professionals dealing with movie releases on OTTs.},

In this study, we aim to obtain a conservative estimate of profitability, while accounting for the combination of several important real-world aspects. Specifically, we consider the holistic research problem that combines model predictions based on the textual content of corporate disclosures and trading strategies while accounting for transaction costs, order clearance periods, post-publication returns, and liquidity filtering. Furthermore, we aim to understand how the resulting profits are influenced by different model and trading strategy parameters. Based on 354,992 form 8-K filings and 10,204 ad hoc announcements, we find that the proposed trading strategies yield up to 7.81 % and 9.34 % out-of-sample annualized return. In addition, our results suggest that machine learning models should be provided with additional features about prior disclosures, while being trained on the ternary prediction problem that allows for predictions of neutral market reactions. We complement our results with several sensitivity analyses that show how profitability is influenced by transaction costs, different ensemble sizes, return neutrality thresholds, and liquidity filtering. Ultimately, we provide useful insights for practitioners by describing how the machine learning models arrive at decisions in terms of Shapley Additive Explanations .},

In this study, we focus on order effects, i.e., when the input of information impacts human perception and the decisions resulting from this information. We propose the Order Effect Removal Method (OERM) for handling the order effect which leads to bias and for helping organizations remove these biases from their training datasets and, therefore, from automated decision-making systems. Using design science principles to theoretically create, test, and validate the method, we can eliminate the order bias even in basic classification systems. Furthermore, the method can be applied in a multidisciplinary context, where an AI-based algorithm substitutes for manual work.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rapid growth of social media and mobile devices, social apps have become deeply integrated into people&#39;s lives. Extensive adoption of social apps entails the collection of massive amounts of users&#39; private information , causing serious privacy issues. To protect their privacy, in practice, social app users are quite likely to disclose false information (i.e., to engage in misrepresentation behavior). Although misrepresentation behavior both influences the regular involvement of fellow users and reduces the efficiency of the marketing strategies designed by the social app operator, this phenomenon has received limited attention from academics. Accordingly, we use privacy calculus theory to investigate user misrepresentation behavior in the context of social apps. Our empirical analysis shows that both privacy concerns and social rewards motivate users to engage in misrepresentation behavior, while personalized benefits discourage users from doing so. We verify the interdependence of privacy concerns and perceived benefits by confirming that users with a high degree of privacy concerns tend to discount the perceived benefits of information disclosure . Moreover, we find that, as antecedents, perceived privacy control and app permission sensitivity influence privacy concerns significantly, while disposition to value privacy and perceived effectiveness of privacy policies have nonsignificant effects on privacy concerns. We also conduct various mediation analyses to extend our basic model. This study enriches the literature on privacy calculus theory and information disclosure behavior. Additionally, our findings shed light on the strategies that the social app operator can adopt to incentivize users to refrain from disclosing false information.},

The few computational BPI approaches hardly leverage the opportunities brought about by computational creativity, neglect process data, and rely on rather rigid improvement patterns. Given the increasing amount of process data in the form of event logs and the uptake of generative machine learning for automating creative tasks in various domains, there is huge potential for BPI. Hence, following the design science research paradigm, we specified, implemented, and evaluated ProcessGAN , a novel computational BPI approach based on generative adversarial networks that supports the creation of BPI ideas. Our evaluation shows that ProcessGAN improves the creativity of process designers, particularly the originality of BPI ideas, and shapes up useful in real-world settings.

These practices have facilitated the availability of new data sources, such as web behavioural variables providing scope for innovation in credit risk analysis and decision practices. This paper examines new web browsing variables and incorporates them into survival analysis as predictors of probability of default (PD). Using a large sample of purchase and repayment credit accounts from a major digital retailer and financial services provider, we show that these new variables enhance the predictive accuracy of probability of default (PD) models at account level. This also holds in the absence of credit bureau data, therefore, the new information can help people who may not have a credit history (thin file) who cannot be assessed using traditional variables. Moreover, we leverage on the dynamic nature of these new web variables and explore their predictive value in short and long- term horizons. By adding macroeconomic variables, the possibility for stress-testing is provided. Our empirical findings provide insights into web browsing behaviour, highlight how the inclusion of non-standard variables can improve credit risk scoring models and lending decisions and may provide a solution to the thin files problem. Our results also suggest a direct value added to the online retail credit industry as firms should leverage the increasing trend of consumers embracing the digital environment.},

How to improve the quality of the results and decrease the travel distance has been extensively studied in recent years. Existing studies often assume that moving speed is constant or real-time road network information is known. In this paper, the travel time is predicted based on historical data. A framework for time-prediction-based task assignment approach in spatial crowdsourcing (TP-TASC) is proposed. Firstly, a prediction model based on the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) is used to predict the travel time of workers with the consideration of the spatial features, the temporal features, and the climate features. Secondly, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to assign the spatial crowdsourcing tasks to appropriate workers. When a task is assigned to a worker, the payment of the worker is also determined automatically. Finally, the simulation experiments based on a real-world taxi-hailing dataset show that the proposed method can not only effectively minimize the task requesters’ waiting time, but also maximize the results’ quality.},

This paper is one of the first to empirically investigate the double-edged role of P4P schemes in HIT adoption. We leverage a natural experiment in the US healthcare system, which introduced P4P schemes in 2013. Our empirical analysis reveals an unintended side effect of P4P schemes that could potentially impede HIT adoption. We also find that P4P schemes have a negative spillover effect on nonparticipating hospitals in the same multihospital system (MHS) as participating hospitals, particularly for small nonparticipating hospitals.

By adopting the commitment-trust theory and the dynamic capability view, this study empirically examines the effects of relationship quality, c-commerce behavior, and dynamic capability on c-commerce performance. Survey data collected from 257 professionals in various manufacturing industries were analyzed using the partial least squares technique. The findings suggest that c-commerce behavior and dynamic capability are positively associated with c-commerce performance. However, negative calculative commitment does not positively affect c-commerce behavior. Moreover, institution-based trust does not negatively affect negative calculative commitment. This study is one of few studies investigating the relationships among the variables that contribute to c-commerce performance. The findings can serve as references for practitioners in supply chain practices.},

  abstract     = {Extracting useful knowledge from multimodal data is the core of many multimedia applications , such as recommendation systems, and cross-modal retrieval. In this paper, we propose a label-based multimodal topic (LB-MMT) model to jointly model text and image data tagged with multiple labels. Specifically, we use the labels as supervised information to generate the text and image data. In the LB-MMT model, we assume that the textual words and visual words related to each text and image are drawn from a mixture of latent topics, where each topic is represented as a group of textual words and visual words. Moreover, we introduce multiple topics for each label, to build the top-down relationship from label to text and image. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on a real-world multimodal dataset with labels. The results show the proposed approach obtains superior performances on topic coherence and label prediction compared with previous competitors. In addition, we show that our model yields interesting insights about multimodal topics. The proposed model provides important practical implications, e.g., designing more attractive multimodal contents for marketers .},

  abstract     = {We offer theory and evidence regarding the impact of content ideology (i.e., emotionally charged beliefs expressed in sentiments) on opinion polarization (i.e., conflicting attitudes about an event) on social media. Specifically, we consider the moderating role of functional affordances and symbolic expressions to draw inferences about opinion polarization. From a sentiment analysis of 3600 posts and a survey of 468 Weibo users, we find that content ideology is positively related to social media opinion polarization. The effect of content ideology is greater when users receive stronger symbolic expressions. Further, our results show an insignificant moderating relationship between functional affordances and this effect. The findings suggest that it is critical to consider content ideology and symbolic expressions when assessing the relationship between published content and polarized opinions on social media.},
